      <itunes:summary>Medium-term rentals are not new to real estate investing, but most investors have hardly heard of them. For years, corporate travelers would rent a room, apartment, or small property for a year or less. These travelers would pay a premium to avoid long-term leases and stay close to their work. But, with the rise of traveling nurses and digital nomads, the medium-term rental strategy is in a revival when investors need it most.

Joining us on today’s show are investors, coaches, and authors, Sarah Weaver and Zeona McIntyre. Their new book, 30-Day Stay, is a masterclass in the wonderful world of medium-term rentals, walking new investors through everything they need to double their cash flow almost overnight. This strategy sounds too good to be true, but even a short-term rental king like Tony Robinson says that he’s intrigued. So is there a catch to this no vacancy, high cash flow, and often headache-free type of housing?

In this episode, you’ll learn the pros (and very limited cons) of investing in medium-term rentals. You’ll also hear which markets this strategy works best in, what type of software you’ll need to run one, and how medium-term rentals are starting to rival vacation rentals! If you’re looking for an investment with a high ROI, that doesn't need to be minutes from a beach, this strategy is for you!

In This Episode We Cover

The medium-term rental strategy explained and why it’s become so popular in 2023

Short-term rental regulations and whether or not they affect medium-term rentals

How to analyze a medium-term rental and what to look for in an investing area

Tenant screening tips and building your lease agreements for medium-term tenants

Which real estate markets work best for medium-term rentals (and which to avoid)

Running your medium-term rental hands-free and the best software picks to choose

And So Much More!

      <title>Semi-Retired at 30 Thanks to One Year’s Worth of Real Estate Investing</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>If <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/money-314" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">early retirement</a> seems out of reach right now, try semi-retirement. Once you get there, you’ll only be halfway to early retirement, just like today’s guest, <strong>Jessie Dillion</strong>.<strong> At only thirty years old, she is semi-retired</strong> and has scaled her real estate portfolio to <strong>almost two million dollars in nine months, </strong>with five properties total!</p><p>When people think about high returns, they often think about a high unit count—but<strong> why have a lot when you can do the same with a few?</strong> Jessie is <strong>strategic about each property purchase</strong> she makes and has made a goal to make one smart investment each quarter. She currently has a <strong>single-family home and two duplexes.</strong> One of her duplexes is a house hack, and her portfolio sports a <strong>mix of long-term, short-term, and mid-term tenants</strong>.</p><p>Jessie’s success is due to how responsible she is with her finances. To finance her first property, she<strong> built up her savings</strong> to ensure she had enough to cover any surprises.

      <itunes:title>Semi-Retired at 30 Thanks to One Year’s Worth of Real Estate Investing</itunes:title>
      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>231</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>If early retirement seems out of reach right now, try semi-retirement. Once you get there, you’ll only be halfway to early retirement, just like today’s guest, Jessie Dillion. At only thirty years old, she is semi-retired and has scaled her real estate portfolio to almost two million dollars in nine months, with five properties total!

When people think about high returns, they often think about a high unit count—but why have a lot when you can do the same with a few? Jessie is strategic about each property purchase she makes and has made a goal to make one smart investment each quarter. She currently has a single-family home and two duplexes. One of her duplexes is a house hack, and her portfolio sports a mix of long-term, short-term, and mid-term tenants.

Jessie’s success is due to how responsible she is with her finances. To finance her first property, she built up her savings to ensure she had enough to cover any surprises. As Jessie continues to scale, she has gotten more creative with her financing. She has formed great relationships with her lenders because of her ability to ask questions and carefully choose where and how she gets her funding. Now she is semi-retired at thirty years old and pays a measly fifty dollars a month towards her mortgage!

In This Episode We Cover

The FIRE movement and how to start your early retirement journey today

How to use transferable skills from other jobs to make investing easier

Building trust with your spouse and getting them on board with your investing journey

Getting the funding for your first rental property and how to use creative financing for the rest

Brilliant savings tips and how to rapidly increase your savings

The loan process and how to build a strong relationship with lenders

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>Your network can be your most powerful tool inside and outside of real estate. Today’s guest, Ryan John, started his real estate investing journey after seeing his friends succeed in the investing space—including his childhood friend, Ashley Kehr. Ryan has been in the real estate game for a year and a half and has closed on two off-market deals—a house hack and a duplex. 

As all rookies know, trying to find and close on your first deal can be a mix of emotions. From excitement to fear to anxiousness and fulfillment, you go through various emotions when trying something you’ve never done before. While Ryan wanted to get started right away, he experienced a lot of nervousness regarding his first deal—waking up at three in the morning, scared he was missing something. But, unlike many other investors, he didn’t allow this to deter him from accomplishing his goals.

Ryan prefers off-market deals because he doesn’t have to go through a realtor. An off-market deal requires more legwork but often comes with significantly better numbers. Becoming an investor has also given Ryan the freedom to make big life changes. Ryan went to his first real estate investor meetup and met investors with a wide range of experience. After attending, an incident at work prompted him to quit. Since he lives below his means and has cash-flowing rentals, he has the time and ability to breathe and explore his options before deciding his next steps.

In This Episode We Cover

How to overcome analysis paralysis and the fear of your first deal

The pros and cons of off-market deals and how to find them in today’s market

How to buy a small multi-family property and why they’re worth investing in

House hacking 101 and how to make money using unused space on your property or in your home

Time value vs. opportunity cost and how to know when it’s time to outsource

The power of real estate meetups and being surrounded by motivated investors

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>Who says you can’t have it all? The career, the love, the wealth—it can all be yours if you want it and work for it. Today’s guest, Mackenzie Grate, works hard so she can have it all. Working full-time as an assistant middle school principal, Mackenzie spends her nights and weekends as a real estate investor and agent. She owns two single-family homes, a fourplex, a duplex, a short-term rental, and her primary residence. 

Mackenzie’s real estate investing journey started in 2017. While living in her apartment, she rented out her extra room and decided to buy a home once rent prices became a little too high to handle. From there, she started looking for her first deal by googling the three fastest-growing job markets in New York. She then chose the market she wanted to invest in, asked a friend to go upstate with her, and started driving for dollars. She put in an offer on the first house she saw and closed on the home. But was she doing it alone?

There is a common misconception that when you invest with a significant other, they have to be involved to be on board. Mackenzie’s relationship with her husband proves that involvement doesn’t equate to support. He supports what she’s doing, but he isn’t an active part of her investing journey, and for them, that works. He shows support by doing other everyday tasks at home, giving Mackenzie more time to work and pursue real estate. This freed-up time is essential for Mackenzie as she juggles all her endeavors and earns her nickname, the "Mack of All Trades."

In This Episode We Cover

The pros and cons of getting your real estate license and how to determine whether becoming an agent is for you

The benefits of owning a co-op and what it means to “own a share” of a building

How to find and capitalize on emerging markets that have strong rental demand

Investing with a spouse and how to find the right balance for your relationship

Property management vs. self-management and how to weigh the pros and cons for both

Managing a short-term rental and automating your processes to become the ultimate host

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>As a new investor, financing can come with a lot of questions. Financing your first property itself seems like a steep learning curve, but once you find a method that works for you, it makes investing a lot easier. Welcome back to this week’s Rookie Reply. But, instead of just answering one question, we’ll be going over multiple to get you on the fastest path to investing in real estate. Today, we’re touching on topics like how much money you'll need to invest in your first property, how to build a lease, recommendations for financing without a W2, and how rising interest rates affect investors.

Before you invest, understanding the market you want to invest in is essential. You also have to understand the expenses that come with your property. Once you know these two things, you’ll have a more accurate estimate of your costs. A perk that comes with investing is that the money doesn’t have to be yours. Whether you decide to take out a conventional mortgage loan or partner with another investor, you can creatively finance your deal to have less money come out of your pocket!

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

In This Episode We Cover

How to understand the market you’re investing in, the average cost of a property, and the range of expenses you can expect

Safety reserves and how much to have on hand before you buy a property

Creative financing methods that will lessen the amount of capital you’ll need to close

Financing without a traditional W2 and how small banks, mortgage brokers, and co-signers can be your best friends

Easily building your perfect lease using the BiggerPockets lease agreements!

And So Much More!

A perk that comes with investing is that the&nbsp;<strong>money doesn’t have to be yours.</strong>&nbsp;Whether you decide to take out a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/conventional-mortgage-loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conventional mortgage loan</a>&nbsp;or partner with another investor, you can&nbsp;<strong>creatively finance your deal&nbsp;</strong>to have<strong>&nbsp;less money come out of your pocket!</strong></p><p>If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/realestaterookie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group</a>!

      <title>It’s Not All About Cash Flow: 4 Ways Real Estate Makes You Rich</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Real estate investing </strong>is known for one thing: <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/cash-flow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>cash flow</strong></a>. No matter who you talk to, investors always seem to be <strong>hypnotized by this single metric</strong>. Rookie investors love to chase after cash flow and cash flow only—often completely disregarding the much more lucrative benefits of real estate investing for the shiny object of monthly profits getting deposited into your account.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>224</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>Real estate investing is known for one thing: cash flow. No matter who you talk to, investors always seem to be hypnotized by this single metric. Rookie investors love to chase after cash flow and cash flow only—often completely disregarding the much more lucrative benefits of real estate investing for the shiny object of monthly profits getting deposited into your account. But, if you’re buying, analyzing, and negotiating deals based on cash flow only, you could be making a huge mistake.

In the new book Real Estate by the Numbers, Dave Meyer and J Scott, both veteran investors in their own regards, give you the numbers behind the NOI and show how real estate will make you rich in much more ways than one. They give you the exact calculations, framework, and mindset to use when analyzing real estate deals, and will show you how you can build wealth faster, smarter, and with less effort than the cash-flow-crazed investor down the street.

On today’s show, Dave and J walk through the four ways that investors can build wealth through real estate, which questions real estate rookies should start asking, and debate whether or not the 2022 housing market is one worth buying in. Real estate rookie or not, this show will give you everything you need to start chasing better deals with hidden profits others are too blind to find.

In This Episode We Cover

Why real estate rookies should grab the new book, Real Estate by the Numbers

Recessions, interest rates, and whether or not 2022 is a good year to buy real estate

The four ways to generate wealth through real estate investing (it’s more than cash flow)

Questions real estate rookies should ask when analyzing their first real estate deals

Real estate tax deductions and how investors can pay almost no income tax 

How to “force” appreciation so you can increase equity faster and walk away with a big payday

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>If you pay attention, you’ll notice there is a game being played. The sooner you realize this, the sooner you can play to win. The game of life has various components, but the top one percent has mastered the game of money and finance. Once you start playing, your financial fear becomes irrelevant. After all, it is a game—and you’re supposed to have fun.

Today’s guest, Nick Troutman, started playing the game after his second child was born. His fatherly instinct kicked in, and he had a deep desire to provide. He started researching investing, money, and finance—his friend recommended BiggerPockets, and the rest was history. Now, Nick has four rental properties with seventeen units, including a nine-unit apartment.

As a professional athlete, Nick is on the road for six to ten months, which exposes him to various housing markets. This exposure helped him narrow down his scope of locations to invest in. Ultimately he decided to invest in Tennessee and Georgia. Nick’s open and optimistic approach to life has helped him create his dream life as a father, husband, professional athlete, and investor.

In This Episode We Cover

The “game” of money and finance and how to play to win

Overcoming provider syndrome and how to use it to your advantage

The BRRRR Method and why it’s one of the best ways to get into real estate

What to consider before investing in a new market and why you should invest in familiar markets

Price-to-rent ratio and making sure you’re charging the right amount for rent

Fear vs. danger analysis and how to use it to start eliminating fear in your life

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>If you’re hesitant to start your real estate investing journey, ask yourself this—where would you be now if you started ten years ago, and where could you be in ten years if you started today? As today’s guest, Brandon Rush, said, “everything you enjoy today, is the result of something you did five to ten years ago.” Brandon currently has three multi-family homes with a total of ten units. 

Brandon started his investing journey when he couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel with his W-2. He couldn’t imagine himself working a nine-to-five until sixty-five, so he decided to take his future into his own hands and started house hacking. After two years of hard work and planning, he was able to quit his W-2 a month ago to be a full-time real estate agent.

Brandon’s success is not without sacrifice. He moved out of his single-family home and moved an hour away from work for his first house hack. And, of course, after his first house hack, he moved to his second house hack! Moving required Brandon and his wife to get rid of most of their things and travel lightly. Although moving and getting rid of material things can be difficult, for Brandon, getting rid of clutter helped clear his mind and reinforced the idea that he was on the right path. Brandon is confident in his investing choices because he surrounds himself with like-minded people, has built an investor-friendly network, and knows that all his decisions now will benefit his future self.

In This Episode We Cover

House hacking 101—how to get started and why it’s a great way to start investing

How to build an investor-friendly network and the importance of surrounding yourself with like-minded people

Self-managing your tenants—how to set boundaries and expectations from the start

Creating your lease agreement and how to properly screen tenants

Why cash flow is the most overrated metric of success and how to accurately measure your property's performance

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Jerry through Ashley’s Instagram direct messages. Jerry is asking: I’ve finally made the plunge and bought three investment properties. After I rehab, rent, and refinance them, where can I get more money to invest? Is there a type of loan for investors or do I need to look into a hard money lender?

Rental property loans are aplenty if you’ve found the right deal. Most veteran investors already know that once you have a good deal, it isn’t hard to find the money to fund it. But, before you build your rental property portfolio, you’ll need to know which options are out there. Don’t worry, you won’t need to spend months or years saving up for another large down payment. There are quicker ways to build a cash-flowing portfolio.

Here are some suggestions:Go the commercial lending route and look into DSCR (debt service coverage ratio) loansPartner with another investor or a private money lender to finance your next down paymentCash-out refinance from your previous properties and recycle that money into your next dealOnce you have some investing experience, reach out to hard money lenders and ask for their terms and ratesAnd more in the episode…If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group!

      <itunes:summary>A successful investor finds their “why” where other people find excuses. Real estate investing isn’t without its challenges, but as you overcome more challenges, you become a better investor. Today’s guest’s strong “why” led him to real estate, and it’s what pushes him to break through barriers, overcome obstacles, and build the life he’s dreamed of.

Hunter Lewis’ "why" came two weeks before his senior year of college when he found out his girlfriend was pregnant. Knowing he was to become a father forced him to get serious about his future. He found a college mentor that was successful in the commercial real estate space and began working for his company. Hunter then saved up enough to buy his first property in July 2020. Since then, he’s closed on two other doors and is working on his fourth!

Hunter became a first-time landlord with his second property, and while it was a challenge initially, he learned more about property management and how to compromise. Becoming a father at a young age also taught him how to take advantage of opportunities and reframe obstacles. As a real estate investor, he’s learned how to structure partnerships with family and the benefits of patience. Hunter is now working towards his five-year goal—$10,000 of passive income per month.

For most real estate investors, it’s not the big steps that stop them from scaling. It’s the little ones. Finding deals means looking through the MLS, cold calling, driving for dollars, or door knocking almost daily.

Welcome back to this week’s Rookie Reply, where we’re joined by On The Market co-host, Henry Washington. In only a few short years, Henry has grown his portfolio to over seventy-five doors. With kids at home, a family to take care of, and businesses to manage, how did he scale so fast? He gives his secrets in this episode.

And as a bonus for our BPCon2022 attendees, we have some tips for you on how to make the most out of the upcoming convention!

      <itunes:summary>Successful real estate investors don't find success alone. Real estate is a relationship business, so eventually, you need someone— an agent, contractor, cleaning lady, or handyman. At times, your success depends on these people, so you need to build a relationship with them. Once you cultivate a relationship, maintenance becomes the next step, but how do you do that? How do you find the balance between too friendly and impersonal? How do you turn a transactional relationship into a transformational one?

Today’s guests, Evan and Katie Miller, have prioritized relationship building in their business and have seen tremendous success. The advantage of investing as a couple is they balance each other out. Evan enjoys numbers, while Katie enjoys working with people—creating the balance they need to be a well-oiled real estate machine. They have sixteen units amongst seven properties in Florida, Denver, and Nebraska. 

While growing their real estate business, they both work full-time jobs with a baby at home. Katie is the general manager at the BiggerPockets publishing division, which motivated her to invest because she sees the power of real estate every day. Since they still work full-time, they prioritize time management, relationship building, and organization. Evan and Katie hope to hit fifty properties in five years while keeping their full-time jobs.

In This Episode We Cover

Investing with a spouse or a significant other and how to find balance and set boundaries

Appraisal issues and finding creative solutions vs. knowing when it’s time to step away

Self-management vs. property management and whether outsourcing is worth it

Vetting and finding the right property manager in a new market

How to cultivate and maintain relationships both professionally and personally

Out-of-state investing, learning how to invest in new markets, and the criteria you should have

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>Real estate investors are a hard-working bunch. They put in long hours every day to create passive income and find financial freedom. Many investors resort to doing what they hate, day in and day out, simply to escape the clutches of a nine-to-five job. If you’re a rookie real estate investor, you’re probably the property manager, head of acquisitions, tenant contact, and accountant all rolled into one. But this “all or nothing” way of working could slow you down faster than you know.

If you want to take your wealth to the next level, try quitting—it’s what Pat Hiban and Tim Rhode have been doing for decades. As two successful real estate agents, they enjoyed the negotiation games that eventually led to large commission checks. But as the years went by, this non-stop grind took its toll—so much that they both gave up very profitable professions to do what they love. Surprisingly, the “do what you love” lifestyle made them even more money than before!

This is all well and good for a couple of veteran investors, but what about our real estate rookies? What about you, listening to this with one, two, or ten deals? How do you take a step back and become a quitter like Pat and Tim? Can you really make more money by doing less, and even if you could, how do you take the first step? In their new book, The Quitter’s Manifesto, Pat and Tim lay out the exact team and strategy you need to go from burnout to big checks with far less effort.

In This Episode We Cover

How two formal education failures became multimillionaires 

Going from 100% “obligation” work to 100% “interest” work by doing what you love

Finding the “quiet” that brings your best ideas to light 

Building your team of quitters who will hold you accountable to do less and make more

How to find a world-class real estate mentor who will speed up your growth substantially

The financial position you should be in before you contemplate quitting 

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Ricky through Ashley’s direct messages on Instagram. Ricky is asking: I’m about to start my investing journey with short-term rentals. How do I build a real estate team, and which positions should I look for first?

On your way to building a short-term rental empire, you’ll need to build out your real estate investment team. These are the people who will help you scale, manage your properties, and handle host headaches that come up, so you can focus on finding better vacation rental properties. If you want to scale like Tony, who’s already at sixteen short-term rental units, you’ll need to invest in the four “buckets." Doing this will free up time for you to run a better business and source bigger deals.

Here are some suggestions:

Start making checklists, notes, and training videos as soon as you buy your first property

Find the things you hate doing and offload them sooner, rather than later

Build out your short-term rental core four who can help manage the property while you source deals

Start small with a cleaner or maintenance worker and slowly hire out from there

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>The older you get, the more you realize how much life costs. As a kid, it's easy to take for granted the free rent and free meals, but what if you could get back to that? What if you could live mortgage or rent-free as an adult? What if you could have your meals paid for on someone else’s dime? In today’s episode, our guest, Nate Weintraub, shares how he lives for “free” with his three properties that total sixty-five units.

With a real estate investor as a father, Nate has always been around rental property investing. He never saw himself getting into real estate until he worked his first W-2. After seeing the realities of a nine-to-five, Nate decided to buy a property after college and pursue real estate. In March of 2020, he put a house under contract in Rochester, New York. Since then, he has purchased a sixty-three-unit storage facility in Alabama and is currently house hacking in Florida.

As Nate works toward financial freedom, he has made steps toward reducing his cost of living while still living a life he loves. In addition to being an investor, he does what he loves as a self-employed copywriter—BiggerPockets’ copywriter in fact. At only twenty-four, Nate lives rent-free in his house hack, his rental property covers most of his food, and his real estate investment trusts pay for his car.

 In This Episode We Cover

Analyzing and choosing an out-of-state market to invest in (w/o visiting them)

Self-managing and how to build a trusting relationship with your tenants 

House hacking and how to use it to live rent-free while building wealth

Self-storage investing and how to break into a newer, bigger asset class

Finding reliable and trustworthy partners and how to manage your partnerships

The importance of talking about your real estate aspirations and how to generate more business through conversation

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Carolyn through Ashley’s direct messages on Instagram. Carolyn is asking: I just bought my first investment property in cash. Am I still considered a first-time homebuyer? What happens if I take out a mortgage on that property?

First-time homebuyer loans tend to confuse many real estate rookies. When it comes to first-time homebuyer loans and programs, what options do you have? Some investors think that they can only use loans like the FHA loan for their first home, while others may be enticed by first-time homebuyer programs that boast a lot of benefits, but with a ton of red tape. Which loans work for which investors, and what happens when you want to refinance?

Here are some suggestions:

Remember that loans like the FHA loan are not reserved for first-time homebuyers

Special loan programs designed for first-time buyers could help you fund your down payment, but you’ll want to read the fine print

Look for state-specific grants when buying your first home (you could come across some free funds!)

If you are going to refinance after a cash purchase, be sure to double-check the “seasoning” period with your lender

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

How did all these successful investors get to where they wanted to be? And if they can do it, why can’t you? Today’s guests, Simon Murillo and Kristina Vaio adjusted their mindset from “why them?” to “why not us?,” which resulted in some serious short-term rental success. 

It took a while for Simon and Kristina to become cohesive in their real estate partnership. Simon has been interested in house hacking since 2018, but Kristina couldn’t envision sharing her home with strangers. For his first investment, Simon wanted to invest long-distance in his hometown, but Kristina had reservations about investing in a property she couldn’t physically manage. Despite their opposing views on what their first investment would look like, through a lot of communication, education, trust, and compromise, they found an investment they agreed on—their basement.

With the help of a rockstar real estate agent, they were able to close on a house in December of 2021. It took a few months of blood, sweat, and tears to set up their basement rental, but within just thirty minutes of posting their short-term rental listing, they got their first booking! Now, they’re averaging about $4,500 each month and are looking for their next home to house hack. They plan on doing this at least two or three times until they’re financially free in their forever home—and you can do it too!

In This Episode We Cover

Convincing a skeptical partner and how to find compromise through mutual goals

How to ease into investing through small steps and self-education

Building a team that can help you with your vision—from investor-friendly real estate agents to reliable contractors

The benefits of going to investor meetups and being surrounded by similar people with similar goals

Managing your short-term rental while balancing your full-time W-2

Increasing the value of your property through unique upgrades and renovations

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Aaron on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Aaron is asking: How do you set up your rental income for tax season? Do you just show your accountant, for example, a Stessa report? Do you give receipts to your tenant when they pay so you have one for tax season?

Navigating the world of real estate accounting can be tricky. Do you write everything down by hand or update your numbers in tax software? Ask two real estate experts like Ashley and Tony and you’ll see that there’s usually one clear way to gather up your rental income so your CPA doesn’t have a mountain of paperwork and an avalanche of questions to ask you.

Here are some suggestions:

Use software like Stessa or QuickBooks to easily track your income/expenses for tax time

Send tenants rent receipts (if they ask for them) using software like Apartments.com and RentRedi

Keep clear records of how much you received in rent, spent on maintenance, and any amount of vacancy

Get your bookkeeping in place from the first property onwards (your future self will thank you)

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

        <![CDATA[<p>This week’s question comes from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/realestaterookie/permalink/460002048380155/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Aaron</strong></a> on the <strong>Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group</strong>. Aaron is asking: <strong>How do you set up your rental income for tax season? </strong>Do you just show your accountant, for example, a <a href="https://www.stessa.com/?utm_campaign=BiggerPockets-Podcast&amp;utm_source=sponsorships&amp;utm_medium=podcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stessa</a> report?<strong> Do you give receipts to your tenant when they pay so you have one for tax season?</strong></p><p>Navigating<strong> the world of </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/organize-real-estate-bookkeeping" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>real estate accounting</strong></a> can be tricky. Do you write everything down by hand or update your numbers in tax software? Ask two real estate experts like Ashley and Tony and you’ll see that there’s usually<strong> one clear way to gather up your rental income</strong> so your CPA doesn’t have a mountain of paperwork and an avalanche of questions to ask you.</p><p>Here are some suggestions:</p><p>Use software like Stessa or QuickBooks to<strong> easily track your income/expenses</strong> for tax time</p><p><strong>Send tenants rent receipts</strong> (if they ask for them) using software like Apartments.com and <a href="https://rentredi.com/biggerpockets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RentRedi</a></p><p><strong>Keep clear records</strong> of how much you received in rent, spent on maintenance, and any amount of vacancy</p><p><strong>Get your bookkeeping in place from the first property onwards</strong> (your future self will thank you)</p><p><strong>And more in the episode…</strong></p><p>If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/realestaterookie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group</a>!

      <itunes:summary>As an entrepreneur trying to build wealth, how do you find work-life balance? How do you prioritize your family and life when you work long hours for a better future? Is the time freedom you’re ultimately working towards worth the time you have to give up presently? Amanda Salovitch, today’s guest, shares the balance she’s been able to maintain as a full-time working mom, building a short-term rental business while going from zero to six units in a year and a half. 

Amanda has been passionate about real estate for a while. She became a licensed real estate agent fresh out of college in 2008. Amanda worked at a brokerage with another recent high school graduate, and when she decided to pursue a career at the bank, she watched him grow his investment career. The bank required a very fast-paced lifestyle, and it wasn’t until the pandemic that she began to slow down and reassess certain aspects of her future. She started listening to the Real Estate Rookie podcast and became inspired.

She purchased three long-term rentals shortly after she began listening to the podcast. She then closed on a property with three short-term treehouse rentals with various income-generating activities. While living a hectic investor life, Amanda always includes her kids as much as possible. Her ultimate goal is to have the time and freedom to live the life of her choosing with her family, and with the path she’s on, she’ll be able to achieve it soon!

      <itunes:summary>Not knowing how to deal with a bad contractor can cost you thousands, if not tens of thousands, on a single deal. The wrong contractor can cause months more of holding time, thousands in materials wasted, and drain your energy when trying to get the project done. But, once you know the common contractor red flags, you’ll be able to spot which workers won’t work out in the future so you can hire the right ones faster.

Ashley and Tony both have horror stories when hiring general contractors. They have some crucial tips when hiring a contractor for your next home renovation. Their most important one? Hire slow and fire fast. The wrong crewmember could sabotage your entire real estate deal.

Here are some suggestions:

Don’t pay contractors per hour and stick to your contractor criteria

Stand your ground and don’t second guess yourself if you know how something should be done

Never hire the same contractor for another job until they’ve finished the first one

Set milestones and benchmarks for the contractor to hit so they stay on-schedule

Don’t hire the first contractors available for a job, take your time vetting the crew and general contractor

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>New short-term rental regulations are sprouting up around densely-populated states like California and New York. These regulations can stop new investors from setting up shop while making established hosts much wealthier. With stricter short-term rental laws, what should real estate investors do to hedge their risk against being stuck with a property that can’t be rented out?

Both Ashley and Tony own short-term rentals. Ashley’s is situated in a town with no regulations, while Tony has vacation rentals scattered across multiple markets, each with its own specific ordinances. Tony knows that even with these new laws, there are still steps you can take to ensure that your short-term rental investment isn’t ever at risk of being left empty.

Looking into short-term rental markets? Here are some suggestions:

Look for established, mature vacation rental markets when starting your search

Economic dependency on tourism will most likely make an area more open to short-term rentals

Always research the number of short-term rentals an owner can legally own in an area as well as how the permitting process works

Stay up-to-date on an area’s short-term rental laws as they are subject to change

And more in the episode…

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Brandon on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Brandon is asking: On a cash-out refinance, is this considered income? If so, will I have to report it on my taxes?

Real estate investing provides a lot of tax benefits, some that new investors or everyday homeowners simply don’t know about. One of the greatest tax benefits? No taxes on loans and liabilities! That means that the cash-out refinance can be done without paying any taxes on the cash given to you from the bank. But, there are a couple of ways that you could get snagged during tax season if you don’t follow the right steps.

Here are some suggestions:

Cash-out refinances are considered debt, not income, from a taxation point of view

If you are planning to have your business pay you back for acquisition/renovation costs, be sure you make a record of that so you don’t get taxed on your repayment

You may pay taxes on a cash-out refinance if you plan on taking profits from your business

As always, consult a tax professional if you have any specific tax questions

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>The beautiful thing about real estate is that there is endless room for growth. While some jobs have a capped amount of opportunity, real estate encourages constant advancement. Today’s guest, Gus Ofili, began his investing journey after the pandemic and now has nine properties with twenty-three units. 

Gus turned to real estate after deciding to leave his nine-to-five at a bank. He didn’t hate his job, in fact, he was doing very well, but there wasn't adequate room to grow. Gus started realizing he was getting passed up on opportunities by people who dedicated at least a decade of their life to the bank. He couldn't see himself taking ten years of his life for a career milestone—so he quit.

Initially, real estate intrigued Gus because of the thrill he got from negotiating. He started taking classes to become a realtor while working his nine-to-five. As an agent, he sold fifty homes in his first year, seventy-one in his second, and 108 in his third year. While he did exceptionally well as a realtor, he wanted a backup plan and knew investing would be a fundamental part of his real estate career. He had the opportunity to sell a five-unit house, but when the first appraisal fell through, he began to see potential in the home, decided to buy it, and as the saying goes—the rest is history.

 In This Episode We Cover

Quitting your nine-to-five and how to prepare to do so

How to use social media to gain free exposure and grow your brand  

Finding a profitable side hustle in real estate and the benefits of becoming a leasing agent

Clubhouse and how to use it to learn more, expand your network, and gain motivation

Overcoming the fear of buying your first investment property and how to make the transition as smooth as possible

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>You’re here to buy your first rental property. This is the Real Estate Rookie Podcast, and as a rookie, where should you start? Most new real estate investors think that the steps to buying a rental property are simple—find an agent, find a property, buy the property. And although that could buy you a rental property, the chances of you becoming successful are very low. Real estate investing requires much more than just purchasing a property if you’re trying to build generational wealth, financial freedom, and a life that operates on your schedule.

It shouldn’t be surprising that the CEO of a company like BiggerPockets is someone who took the slow, yet highly successful route. No raising money on his first deal, no buying multimillion-dollar apartment complexes, no giant yacht, and no private planes. Scott Trench is the epitome of the “grind until you shine” real estate investor. Starting with little-to-no savings, he was able to work his way up to his first rental, his second, and now his thirteenth.

To celebrate the release of the updated version of his wildly popular book, Set for Life, Scott has created a ten-step checklist that any new investor should use to get their first real estate investment. These steps were specifically designed for you to not just get one rental, but many more following your first purchase. These are the exact steps Scott took to reach financial freedom in under ten years, and if you follow them as well, you might be able to do it faster.

In This Episode We Cover

The ten steps to becoming a successful real estate investor (even if you have no experience)

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>You’re here to </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/rookie-podcast-136" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>buy your first rental property</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This is the <em>Real Estate Rookie Podcast,</em> and as a rookie, where should you start? Most new real estate investors think that the steps to buying a rental property are simple—find an agent, find a property, buy the property. And although that could buy you a rental property, the chances of you becoming successful are very low. <strong>Real estate investing requires much more than just purchasing a property</strong> if you’re trying to <strong>build generational wealth</strong>, <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/financial-freedom-guide-30-somethings" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>financial freedom</strong></a>, and a life that operates on your schedule.</p><p>It shouldn’t be surprising that the <strong>CEO </strong>of a company like <strong>BiggerPockets </strong>is someone who took the slow, yet highly successful route. No raising money on his first deal, no buying multimillion-dollar apartment complexes, no giant yacht, and no private planes. <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/scotttrench" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Scott Trench</strong></a> is the epitome of the “<strong>grind until you shine</strong>” real estate investor. <strong>Starting with little-to-no savings</strong>, he was able to work his way up to his first rental, his second, and now his thirteenth.</p><p>To celebrate the release of the updated version of his wildly popular book, <a href="https://store.biggerpockets.com/products/set-for-life-revised-edition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><em>Set for Life</em></strong></a>, Scott has created a <strong>ten-step checklist</strong> that any new investor should use to<strong> get their first real estate investment</strong>. These steps were specifically designed for you to not just get one rental, but many more following your first purchase. These are the exact steps Scott took to<strong> reach financial freedom in under ten years</strong>, and if you follow them as well, you might be able to do it faster.</p><p>In This Episode We Cover</p><p><strong>The ten steps to becoming a successful real estate investor</strong> (even if you have no experience)</p><p><strong>Frugality </strong>and its impact on how you invest and <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/factor-growing-wealth-guaranteed-real-estate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>grow your wealth</strong></a> over time</p><p>Calculating your dollar per hour cost and choosing whether or not to outsource work</p><p><strong>The four levers of wealth creation</strong> and how to pull them all for fast-paced wealth building</p><p>How Scott went from <strong>entry-level worker to CEO of BiggerPockets</strong> in under ten years</p><p><strong>Building your “investor ability”</strong> so you can make smarter decisions faster</p><p>And <strong>So </strong>Much More!</p><p>Links from the Show</p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcasts/real-estate-rookie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rookie Readiness Checklist</a></p><p><a href="http://instagram.com/wealthfromrentals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ashley's Instagram</a></p><p><a href="http://instagram.com/tonyjrobinson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tony's Instagram</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/real-estate-rookie-podcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Estate Rookie Podcast</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/realestaterookie/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Forums</a></p><p><a href="https://airtable.com/shrUj5YX0XwmJk1qb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Podcast Guest Onboarding Form</a></p><p><a href="https://store.biggerpockets.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Bookstore</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcasts/money" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The BiggerPockets Money Podcast</a></p><p><a href="http://www.dish.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dish Network</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcasts/real-estate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Real Estate Podcast</a></p><p><a href="https://www.joshuadorkin.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joshua Dorkin's Website</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/beardybrandon/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brandon Turner's Instagram</a></p><p><a href="https://www.podcastengineers.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dave Visaya's Podcast Editing Services</a></p><p><a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. Money Mustache</a></p><p><a href="http://www.airbnb.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Airbnb</a></p><p><a href="http://www.vrbo.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vrbo</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mindyatbp/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mindy Jensen's Instagram</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/money-315" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">From 400 Credit Score to Making $17,000/Month in Passive Income</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/real-estate-investing-bootcamps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Bootcamps</a></p><p><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FRED</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/investment-calculators" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Calculators</a></p><p><a href="http://www.buildium.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Buildium</a></p><p>Connect with Scott:</p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/scotttrench" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scott's BiggerPockets Profile</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcasts/real-estate-rookie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scott's Rookie Readiness Checklist</a></p><p><br></p><p>Check out the full show notes here: https://biggerpockets.com/blog/rookie-200</p><p><em>Interested in learning more about today's sponsors or becoming a BiggerPockets partner yourself?

What content should you create to target your desired audience? Today’s guest, Kerwin Donis, shares how he and his brothers have built the platforms that have helped them partner in over 600 units of apartment syndication deals.

Kerwin, the head of their social media, says their initial goal was to document their journey and build credibility as young investors. While that is still their goal, they have become more strategic about what they post and the audience they post for to grow their platform and their online community. 

So how do you begin? You begin now—stop waiting! Kerwin emphasizes that when you start, it won't be perfect, and that's okay. Create the content you’d want to consume, aim to entertain and educate, and the rest will come. The benefits of building your platform are endless because you never know who you’re reaching—whether that be a future mentor, partner, or client. There is no better time to start your social media journey and no better place to start than this episode! 

In This Episode We Cover

Building a platform with little knowledge (it’s not as hard as you think)

How to manage different social media platforms and decide which one should be your primary focus 

The various benefits of building a platform and how to get the most out of your platforms

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Mantas on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Mantas is asking: My buddy placed an offer substantially above asking price and the seller, before accepting the offer, asked my friend if he would pay the difference if the appraisal came in lower than the offer. Anyone encountered this situation and what would be the best response if any?

Ah, the classic appraisal gap/appraisal contingency. During hot housing markets (like we’ve been experiencing over the past two years), these types of offers have become more and more common. A seller wants to be sure that they can get the sales price they want and the buyer often has to pay the price to cover the appraisal difference. But what are some ways to get around this if your appraisal comes back low?

Here are some suggestions:

Do as much research beforehand so you know an appropriate appraisal value before the appraisal

Run comps using real estate data tools (like PropStream) or look up comparable home sales in your area using a listing service

Challenge the appraisal buy checking for discrepancies and running comps

Get a different appraisal ordered or switch to a more flexible lender if all else fails

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>If you’re unsure about real estate, run the numbers. It’s that simple. Once you run the numbers, you’ll have clarity on which decisions to make and tangible reassurance that you made the right ones. Today’s guest, actress Brec Bassinger, shares how focusing on the numbers has given her the confidence to become the successful investor she is today.

Brec’s name may sound familiar to some of you. She’s been the star of Bella and the Bulldogs and the new hit show, DC’s Stargirl. Brec’s interest in real estate began after a trip to Big Bear with her boyfriend when she realized the earning potential of short-term rentals. She decided to buy a condo and had her first short-term rental within six months. The speed at which she got her first deal may seem intimidating, but Brec’s confidence came from the numbers she calculated and the profits she knew she could make.

During her first season of Stargirl, Brec had to share a small apartment with her coworker because that’s all she could afford with her fluctuating income. Now she makes more money by living in an expensive high-rise apartment while renting out her old space. Real estate has allowed Brec to supplement her fluctuating income without a W-2 and the freedom to live the life she wants. And even though she plays a superhero, her story proves that you don’t have to be one to invest in real estate.

 In This Episode We Cover

How to confidently close on your first investment property and move past fear

Becoming more financially stable by supplementing your income with a passive income stream

The importance of running the numbers and how to use the simple rental calculations to make profitable decisions

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Tony’s Instagram direct messages! This rookie real estate investor is asking: I have a good chunk of equity in my home, should I pull out cash to purchase a rental property? If not, what should I do with the equity?

If you want to know how to use home equity to buy real estate, you need to know your options first. As many homeowners are sitting on massive equity gains, thanks to the past two years worth of price run-ups, they’re asking how they can use this equity to their advantage. For most investors, you’ll have two options in how you take this equity out of your home’s value. But, both of them need to be intelligently evaluated before you make a decision.

Here are some suggestions:

Look at your current mortgage rate and see if it’s higher or lower than today’s average interest rate to refinance 

Ask your lender about a HELOC (home equity line of credit) as well as the terms, interest rates, and duration offered

Interest rates are likely to rise, so locking down a great rate now may help you in the future

Know your exit strategy (flip vs. BRRRR vs. buy and hold) for each different kind of financing option

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <title>How a College Dropout Got a Seat at the Millionaire Investor Table</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Your <strong>connections and relationships are invaluable</strong> in real estate, so how do you get to know the right people? How do you<strong> build a lasting, </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2016-06-03-considering-partnerships-stop-and-read-this-first" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>mutually beneficial</strong></a><strong> relationship</strong>? The answer is simple—you <strong>show up, get your name and face out there, and listen</strong>. Building a network can seem intimidating, especially starting from scratch, but today’s guest, <strong>Jeffrey Donis</strong>, breaks it down step-by-step.</p><p>Jeffrey Donis of the Donis Brothers is <strong>in charge of nurturing investor relations</strong>, so networking is his bread and butter. At<strong> twenty-three</strong>, he has helped his brothers <strong>raise enough money to co-sponsor 600 units </strong>worth of deals<strong> in the last two years.</strong> This would have been nearly impossible to achieve in such a short time without the network they built and the relationships they nurtured. Their network didn’t come automatically, and similar to everyone else, they started from scratch and were able to find a way to get themselves out there.</p><p>The first step is to <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2013-11-15-how-to-build-credibility" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>build your credibility</strong></a>.

      <itunes:summary>Your connections and relationships are invaluable in real estate, so how do you get to know the right people? How do you build a lasting, mutually beneficial relationship? The answer is simple—you show up, get your name and face out there, and listen. Building a network can seem intimidating, especially starting from scratch, but today’s guest, Jeffrey Donis, breaks it down step-by-step.

Jeffrey Donis of the Donis Brothers is in charge of nurturing investor relations, so networking is his bread and butter. At twenty-three, he has helped his brothers raise enough money to co-sponsor 600 units worth of deals in the last two years. This would have been nearly impossible to achieve in such a short time without the network they built and the relationships they nurtured. Their network didn’t come automatically, and similar to everyone else, they started from scratch and were able to find a way to get themselves out there.

The first step is to build your credibility. While there are many ways to do so, Jeffrey explains how to use social media to document your journey and build trust. He also goes into how to navigate networking events and bring value no matter your experience level. The Donis Brothers have become widely successful in a record amount of time, and the way they built their network and brand is a large part of that.

In This Episode We Cover

Building credibility and how to use social media to do so

The 80/20 rule and why it’s an effective way to network and build relationships

How to bring value to others (without money!) and maintain a good reputation

Overcoming imposter syndrome and how to be more confident in your abilities

How to vet potential investors and red flags you should look out for

The importance of constant self-education through real estate courses and classes

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Natalie on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Natalie is asking: How did you narrow your focus to determine your strategy? And how do you get good at analyzing real estate deals? 

This is one of the most-asked questions we receive. When you’re starting as a rookie real estate investor, every strategy seems like a good one. You may hear a guest on the Real Estate Rookie show talk about wholesaling or flipping or short-term rentals. Before long, you’re already planning your next exciting purchase even if you had another one already in the works. This “shiny object syndrome” is common when getting started, and while it’s good to know about many different investing strategies, changing yours too often can lead you well off the path to financial freedom.

Here are some suggestions if you’re torn between strategies and need to up your analysis game:

Look at your resources and base your investing strategy upon what makes sense for you specifically

Pledge to become an expert in a certain strategy and don’t try building too many bridges

Set up a strong foundation in your current investing strategy, then you can pivot wherever you want

Practice your deal analysis daily and send your calculations to other investors as a pulse check

Get to know your investing area as much as you can (even if you’re remote investing!)

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>What differentiates a top producer from everyone else? The most common answer is hard work, ambition, and charisma, but what does that even mean? Hard work, while a universal concept, changes depending on the context, so what does hard work entail in real estate? Today’s familiar guest, David Greene, answers all these questions and more in today’s episode and his new book, SKILL.

SKILL is only part two in his three-part book series where David teaches you how to excel as an agent or investor. It follows SOLD, which is all about gaining confidence by learning and understanding the fundamentals of real estate. SKILL then teaches you how to become a top producer and make more money through intelligent negotiation, building trust with clients, and becoming an expert in your field. Ideally, this book is for those with a little experience who want to take their career to the next level.

In today’s episode, David shares some of the characteristics of a top producer. He goes over the importance of generating leads and how to do so, building your marketing funnel, and the metrics you should be tracking to find and convert more leads. Instead of telling you how to get better through abstract concepts, David provides concrete step-by-step examples on how to differentiate yourself, so you can beat out the other agents in your area.

In This Episode We Cover

How to decide if getting your real estate license would be beneficial for you (it’s not the answer you think)

Lead generation and how to get your name known 

How to improve investor and agent communications and find deals that align with your criteria

The most important metrics to track if you want to scale your business

Lead vs. lag measures and why tracking lead measures get you results sooner

Listing presentations, how to hold one, and why they make you stand out as an agent

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>What is due diligence in real estate? If you ask most new investors, they’ll have some sense of what due diligence is, but may be confused about what it really means. Is due diligence when you analyze your deal? Who should you be in contact with during due diligence? How long does a due diligence period usually last? And what happens if your deal turns out to be a dud in due diligence?

In reality, due diligence isn’t all that confusing. It’s simply the time that you, and your partners (if you have them), spend inspecting, double-checking, and re-analyzing the deal. The due diligence period is there for the protection of the investor, so you can use everything in your power to confirm that you truly are getting a great deal. But, before you start calling inspectors, make sure you follow some of these more granular steps that could save you a fortune in the future.

Never done due diligence before? Here are some suggestions:

Work with a seasoned real estate broker, agent, or attorney who can catch things you won't

Double-check that your financing options still stand if you find anything wrong with the property

Talk to the local city government or code enforcer to ensure prior work on the property was done correctly

Calculate out what the cost of repairs will be for the property once you’ve gotten an inspection

Don’t fall in love with a deal and be prepared to walk away if you find something that’ll kill your exit strategies

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>House hacking is one of the easiest ways to get into real estate investing. Thanks to its flexible financing options, low down payment loans, and ability to cut your rent in half (or eliminate it), house hacking is truly a phenomenal investing strategy. In short, house hacking is when a homeowner or investor buys a house or multifamily and rents out the other rooms or units while they live in one of them.

The house hacking strategy can be mixed and matched in any way you like. Want to live with a bunch of friends? Buy a three or four-bedroom house and rent out the rooms. Want to have a private space for you and your family? Buy a small multifamily and rent out the other units. No matter what you choose to do, house hacking can help speed up your journey to financial freedom. This is done by reducing the amount of money you spend on rent/a mortgage while also giving you serious tax benefits, instant cash flow, and appreciation so you can build wealth in the background.

In this how-to episode, Ashley and Tony give you everything you need to find, analyze, finance, and buy a house hack. They go over in-depth real estate analysis so you can confidently bring a deal to your lender, partner, or just have peace of mind that you’re making a smart investment. This single home purchase could change your financial future forever, so what are you waiting for?

In This Episode We Cover

What is house hacking and the major benefits of hacking your house

The four ways to build wealth in real estate and three common rookie mistakes

The best ways to fund your real estate deals or house hack property

How to analyze your next property using the BiggerPockets real estate calculators

Property management 101 and how to manage a rental property

How to get your first real estate deal faster with BiggerPockets tools and expert guidance

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>Networking tips only matter as long as they work. Everyone knows the classic ones—bring a business card, wear a nametag, and look people in the eye. But, when you’re meeting with investors who have big portfolios, it can be easy to get flustered all of a sudden. Maybe you run into your dream mentor at your next real estate meetup—what do you do?

Both Ashley and Tony were able to buy their first rentals and grow their portfolios thanks to networking. At first, they didn’t know what to do or say, and didn’t have many deals to speak of. But, over time, their net worth grew with their networking skills, allowing them to connect with more investors, find more deals, and build lifelong friendships. They’re testaments that even if you don’t have any deals yet, networking could be what brings you your first!

Not used to networking? Here are some suggestions for your next meetup:

Sign up for a BiggerPockets meetup in your city and get your tickets to BPCon2022!

Don’t stick with your clique, remember that networking is there for you to meet new people

Rehearse the question you want to ask if a mentor, speaker, or inspiring investor is at the event

Take a break from networking to write down names, lessons learned, and takeaways from conversations

Don’t know anyone at the meetup? Join a group (they’ll almost always welcome you openly)

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>Cash flow and revenue should always be your main focus, but that’s not always the case. Often, the focus tends to be on the number of doors, with many investors not realizing you can make more with less. Today’s guest, Welby Accely, has mastered the art of maximizing revenue per unit and automating his flips. Despite his primary focus being quality over quantity, Welby has done over 100 flips in just four years!

Welby’s success didn’t come overnight, in fact, most of it has come from trial and error. Welby started investing in 2004 without knowing anything about ROI or cash flow, but that didn’t stop him. Unfortunately, this lack of knowledge cost him a fortune in time and money. Fast forward thirteen years, Welby has realized all the detrimental mistakes he was making. The price of his lessons may have been high, but now he knows people with twice as many doors as him that don’t make half as much net income.

As Welby says, everything is about the numbers. When you realize this, it’s easier to focus on the properties that generate income and ditch the properties that don’t. Before you focus on the numbers, you need to understand cash flow and depreciation while also figuring out your financial goals and what aligns with them. These two metrics are Welby’s bread and butter. After he understood them, he created a simple formula for his flips and automated everything in his business, allowing him to make more while doing much less.

In This Episode We Cover

Generating capital through your flips and how to invest that capital to make even more

Understanding capital, ROI, and depreciation and the importance of setting your financial goals first 

How to maximize revenue per unit and focus on the numbers to reach your financial goals

How to simplify your scope of work, control your capital, and make your money work for you 

Building a business model that focuses on maximizing your revenue and simplifying your flips

Welby’s flip formula and how to automate your flipping process to get the most out of it

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Aaron on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Aaron is asking: What paperwork do I need to close an off-market deal? If presenting a cash offer, can it all be done between me and the seller? Do you typically ask for an inspection period?

Off-market real estate deals can seem tricky when you’ve never done one before. For the most part, investors only deal with on-market deals where their real estate agent walks them through the closing process. When you’re pursuing off-market deals, you’re on your own (for the most part), but that doesn’t mean that closing on a new deal has to be complicated.

Here are some suggestions:

Contact local real estate attorneys and escrow offices before closing on a property

Remember to include purchase contingencies (like inspections) so you’re not stuck with a bad deal

Send in a letter of intent to the seller before presenting a formal offer to see where they stand

Consult a real estate attorney to draft up a legal, enforceable purchase and sale agreement

When in doubt, lean on your escrow, title company, or attorney for the next steps

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Andrew on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Andrew is asking: How would you handle a prospective tenant that has a bankruptcy on their record? 

Tenant screening is almost as important as rental property screening. A bad tenant can not only cost you potential rent but cause thousands or tens of thousands in damages if not handled correctly. This is why landlords are so strict when evaluating tenants, as a good tenant can mean next-to-nothing maintenance and a bad tenant can mean habitual headaches. It’s up to you whether or not a potential tenant meets your criteria. When evaluating, remember to stay within your legal limits!

Got a tenant with some questionable financial history? Here’s how to proceed:

Speak with the applicant and get their side of the story while trusting your gut

Verify the applicant is truthful by running a credit check and background check

Use a property management software that allows you to report a tenant’s monthly payments to credit bureaus

Look at the applicant’s job history, debt-to-income ratio, and if they have any repossessions

Know that people who have filed bankruptcy may only have the option to rent (for a while)

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

He discovered real estate after being unfulfilled by the typical “American Dream'' job. His parents encouraged him to pursue the tried and true traditional path that leads to retirement at sixty-five, but after sixteen years at a corporate job, he needed something to change. Omid was looking for something new when he stumbled upon BiggerPockets and discovered the power of real estate investing.

Omid and Tony work well together because they complement each other’s skillsets. Where Tony is idealistic, Omid is realistic and together they reach each goal they set.

Omid serves as proof that we all need to stop classifying wealth as just financial and realize true wealth is about finding your freedom.

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Brandi through Ashley’s Instagram direct messages. Brandi is asking: Our current home could give us about $260,000 in net proceeds if sold. We plan to purchase rentals with those proceeds. But, our home is in a good location with good appreciation. Should we sell our primary to buy properties or refi and make it a rental?

The sell vs. refi argument is back once again! In this hot housing market, it’s no surprise that homeowners want to take advantage of their growing equity by selling their properties. But, doing so could cause you to lose one property only to have to go out and find another. Although the sell vs. refi answer is specific to each investors’ situation, there are a few quick ways you can establish which is a good move for you.

Here are some suggestions:

Ask “what’s going to give me a higher ROI?” and look at metrics like cash-on-cash return and return on equity (ROE)

Take out a home equity line of credit (HELOC) instead of refinancing and BRRRR your next rental to pay back the loan

Don’t forget to factor in future appreciation that you could miss out on by selling

Double-check your interest rate on your primary residence (it may be too good to give up!)

And more in the episode…

        <![CDATA[<p>This week’s question comes from <strong>Brandi </strong>through <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wealthfromrentals/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ashley’s Instagram</a> direct messages. Brandi is asking: <strong>Our current home could give us about $260,000 in net proceeds if sold</strong>. We plan to purchase rentals with those proceeds. But, our home is in a good location with good appreciation. <strong>Should we sell our primary to buy properties or refi and make it a rental?</strong></p><p>The <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/refinance-or-sell-investment-property" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>sell vs. refi</strong></a> argument is back once again! In this hot housing market, it’s no surprise that homeowners want to <strong>take advantage of their growing equity</strong> by selling their properties. But, doing so could cause you to lose one property only to have to go out and find another. Although the sell vs. refi answer is specific to each investors’ situation, there are a few <strong>quick ways you can establish which is a good move for you</strong>.</p><p>Here are some suggestions:</p><p>Ask “<strong>what’s going to give me a higher ROI?</strong>” and look at metrics like <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/cash-on-cash-return" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cash-on-cash return</a> and return on equity (ROE)</p><p><strong>Take out a </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/glossary/heloc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>home equity line of credit (HELOC)</strong></a> instead of refinancing and BRRRR your next rental to pay back the loan</p><p>Don’t forget to <strong>factor in future appreciation</strong> that you could miss out on by selling</p><p><strong>Double-check your interest rate</strong> on your primary residence (it may be too good to give up!)</p><p><strong>And more in the episode…</strong></p><p>If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/realestaterookie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group</a>!

      <itunes:summary>When you think about long-distance investing, what comes to mind? People usually have reservations about investing out-of-state, but today’s guests took it a step further and invested from halfway across the world. Today’s guest, Caleb Drake, has closed on nine doors with one flip underway.

Caleb was active duty military for fourteen years, and once he joined special ops he was deployed for six months at a time. During those six months, his house would sit, unused, and that’s when he saw an opportunity. Caleb decided to rent out his house through Airbnb. As a new landlord and Airbnb host, Caleb had to learn by doing, a task that was increasingly more difficult since he was self-managing from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Africa. Caleb was able to combat this challenge by building a team that could handle what he couldn’t.

After a few years of investing solo, Caleb joined a partnership to expand his portfolio and increase his profit. His partner was also out of the country, so they switched off who was “on-call” and figured out how to automate their check-in and check-out processes. As the business grew, the partnership adjusted to ensure its longevity. Caleb now hopes to continue to scale his business, add to his personal portfolio, and build wealth in the background.

In This Episode We Cover

The importance of building a self-sufficient team and how to do so

Vetting your guests/tenants and how to target your ideal tenants 

How to invest out-of-state or overseas and automating your check-in processes

Residential loans vs. commercial loans and how to figure out which one to use

How to balance and adjust your partnership(s) as your business grows

The importance of having a real estate agent with an investor mindset, plus how to find one

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Rodney through Tony’s Instagram direct messages. Rodney, like many investors, has been told that you need twenty percent down to buy a rental property. Rodney wants to know the best way to fund a property without breaking the bank. He's asking: Should I save for a down payment or is there a way to get a rental without the twenty percent down?

It’s not uncommon for real estate investors to get into deals with far less than 20% down. But, for a beginner, this type of task can seem a bit intimidating, especially if you’re looking at your first investment property. Thankfully, the world of real estate presents investors like us with many ways to creatively fund deals!

Here are some suggestions:

Purchase a vacation rental using a second home loan that only requires ten percent down

Pitch seller financing to the seller and walk them through the tax benefits of financing the property to you

Partner up with an investor who can provide the down payment on the deal

Sign a joint venture agreement with another investor who can split the down payment with you

Remember: if you find a deal you can (probably) find the money for it!

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Jessica through Tony’s Instagram direct messages. Jessica has seen what Tony and his wife Sara have been doing while building their short-term rental empire. But, Jessica is having some doubts. She’s asking: How do you invest in real estate when the idea of debt scares you? 

Many new investors have this fear. If you’re buying your first property, the thought of five or six-figure debt may seem like a massive weight on your shoulders. After all, isn’t the goal to be debt-free? Fortunately for real estate investors, the answer is no. Using leverage to buy properties makes your investing far more profitable and can help you get comfortable when taking on good debt.

Here are some suggestions:

Scared of debt? Pay off your personal debt before you invest in rental properties 

Think of debt as a tool that can help you build wealth with real estate 

Know the difference between good debt and bad debt and how to use both

Define your “worst-case scenario” if you’re unable to pay your rental mortgage 

Use the BiggerPockets Calculators to calculate your rental property profits (especially when taking on debt!) 

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>Every week, Ashley and Tony reply to a frequently asked question from the BiggerPockets community. But, this week, they’ve decided to finally answer the most asked question yet: what happened with Tony’s Shreveport deal? If you’re an avid Rookie Reply listener, you’ve probably heard Tony talk about one property that he has been trying to sell for over a year. Well, it’s finally sold, and Tony’s here to share all the details, mistakes, and numbers so you can do better on your next deal.

While this wasn’t Tony’s first deal, it did provide him with a strong foundation of knowledge to pursue bigger and better real estate investments. So, if you find yourself looking for deals, or stuck with a bad deal, take some of Tony’s suggestions to heart:

Avoid buying properties in flood zones unless you’ve fully calculated the cost of flood insurance 

Be highly selective of your property’s location and get to know the neighborhood you’re buying in

Have multiple exit strategies for every property (rental, flip, BRRRR, etc.)

See money spent on a deal as “real estate education” that will make you richer!

Know that as an investor, you’re not going to get everything right all the time

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>There are those who accept their circumstances and then there are those like today’s guests —the Donis Brothers (Jeffrey, Kenneth, and Kerwin). These three brothers have created immense success for themselves at only twenty &amp;amp; twenty-three years old through self-education, network building, and hard work. They’ve done seventeen wholesale deals and co-sponsored three multifamily syndications with a total of 636 units between them in a mere two years.

They got their start in college when the oldest brother, Kenneth, heard about wholesaling while watching The Breakfast Club. After taking a humbling trip to Guatemala and realizing how many opportunities they had access to, they knew they had to pursue real estate. Once they decided to pursue real estate, each brother separately came to the same conclusion—college wasn’t for them. They collectively decided to focus on building their business so they could reach their ultimate goal of financial freedom and retiring their mom. 

They started their real estate journey with single-family homes but quickly realized multifamily properties aligned more with their goals. During their transition, it took six months of straight cold calling before they got their first deal. While working to get their first deal they also joined a mastermind and spent time expanding their network. They actively sought out people in spaces they were trying to penetrate which led them to their current mentorship program. Their ability to scale their business and network simply proves they are a force to be reckoned with. Make sure to listen closely because the Donis Brothers could be the next big thing.

In This Episode We Cover

How to invest at a young age and turn being young into an advantage 

Networking events and how to extract true value from each one you attend

Cold calling, its importance, and how to effectively nurture leads

How to make the transition from single-family to multifamily properties

Building a powerful real estate network of mentors, investors, deal finders, and friends

Syndications and how to use them to broaden your investing opportunities

Building a social media platform to expand your network and reach

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Kurt through Ashley’s Instagram direct messages. Kurt is asking: We’d like to buy a vacation property with my brother and sister-in-law. My wife and I would handle the management while my brother would bring the down payment to the table. How do we quantify each party’s contribution when dividing profit and equity in the property? 

Real estate partnerships can be a huge help to rookie investors, especially for those who have the experience but lack the cash to invest by themselves. It’s important to note that real estate partnerships can be set up in any way you prefer⁠—as long as both parties agree that the split is fair⁠—you have full reign of your partnership structure.

Ready to partner up on a deal? Here are some suggestions:

Clearly define responsibilities so that both parties are happy with the agreement

Have a predetermined exit strategy for the partnership and property

Provide interest to whoever is putting down the money and pay fees to whoever manages the property

Set limits to when partners can use the property for their personal use (if it’s a short-term rental)

And more in the episode…

      <itunes:summary>Investing in rental properties can be challenging at first, which is why so many investors tend to take it slow. Tyler Madden had the luxury of NOT being able to do this, and it’s worked out well in his favor. Just over a year ago, we interviewed Tyler on episode fifty-five of the Real Estate Rookie Podcast. At the time, Tyler was an “accidental landlord”, but a lot has changed since then.

Tyler found himself in the position to purchase seven units, a mere $1,000,000 or so in real estate, right as his wife was due to deliver their first-born child. While he didn’t necessarily want to handle a full rehab of so many units, he took a “why not?” approach and found a way to make both properties work. Through a lot of sweat equity, Tyler was able to rehab, rent, and refinance these units and come out with a crazy amount of monthly cash flow!

If you want to expand your real estate portfolio as Tyler did, listen to this episode intently. Tyler dives deep into the numbers, work, and lessons he learned along the way as he turned seven underperforming rental units into a portfolio any investor would dream of!

In This Episode We Cover

Relying on data vs. emotions when buying your first rental property

Whether or not now is the right time to buy real estate 

What’s impacting today’s housing market and using uncertainty to your advantage

The best investing moves to make if a recession (or crash) is on the horizon

What rookies should look for in a real estate investing market 

Buying real estate with a long-term outlook (so you can handle the dips!)

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>Today’s episode is all about understanding yourself. Nick Baumgart, an Enneagram expert, explains how to use the information from the Enneagram in your everyday life. The Enneagram test is used as a way to understand your emotional habits. Unlike other popular personality tests, the Enneagram focuses less on what you do and more on who you are.

The test breaks down your motivations into three parts: fear, body, and mind. When you truly understand what motivates you, you're able to see why you act the way you do and can start taking steps to fix any destructive behaviors. This knowledge also goes a long way when interacting with other people. This test is ideal for teams because instead of putting yourself in their shoes and still looking at problems from your perspective you can “understand them in their shoes." Nick talks about how powerful of a tool this test is and how it could have changed his life if he had found it earlier, so do yourself a favor and let this test change your life today!

      <itunes:episode>171</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>The 2022 housing market is off to a wild start. We’ve seen home inventory at decade lows, interest rates have finally started to rise, and more homebuyers are looking at fewer houses. As a real estate investor, it can be tough to navigate a market like this, especially when you’ve never bought a rental property before. What you need is data behind the decision making, and today, we’ve got just that!

Joining us today is Dave Meyer (@thedatadeli), VP of Data and Analytics at BiggerPockets, and host of the brand new podcast, On The Market. Dave has spent the last decade analyzing real estate data so he and the BiggerPockets community as a whole can invest smarter. Today, Dave dives deep into the most pressing matters of the real estate market, ranging from topics like interest rates, to housing crash indicators, determining the best rental market, and more.

If you want to hear a high-level update on everything happening within the world of real estate investing, plus some predictions for this year’s housing market, stick around! Dave will give you all the analytics-based insight you need!

In This Episode We Cover

Relying on data vs. emotions when buying your first rental property

Whether or not now is the right time to buy real estate 

What’s impacting today’s housing market and using uncertainty to your advantage

The best investing moves to make if a recession (or crash) is on the horizon

What rookies should look for in a real estate investing market 

Buying real estate with a long-term outlook (so you can handle the dips!)

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Channa through Ashley’s Instagram direct messages. Channa is asking: I have three rental properties and am looking to refinance them all. Should I do an adjustable-rate portfolio loan on all three or do separate fixed-rate loans on each property? 

As real estate investors, we tend to have many different options when financing rental properties. Some, like adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), may come with lower closing costs and slightly lower interest rates, while fixed-rate mortgages have slightly higher interest rates but boast the added security of long-term financing for a property or properties. While both have definitive pros and cons, the implications of both types of loans must be understood before you reach the closing table.

Here are some suggestions when making the choice:

Understand your long-term strategy for the property and which loan works for which exit strategy

Run an amortization schedule on both loans to see the difference in your monthly payment

If you decide to go with an ARM, make sure you know what you’ll do once your low-interest rate ends

Calculate total closing costs to see if you have the reserves ready to go through with each loan

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

While both have definitive pros and cons, the implications of both types of loans must be understood before you reach the closing table.</p><p>Here are some suggestions when making the choice:</p><p>Understand your<strong> long-term strategy for the property </strong>and which loan works for which exit strategy</p><p><strong>Run an </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2013-03-20-amortization-schedule-how-to" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>amortization schedule</strong></a> on both loans to see the difference in your monthly payment</p><p>If you decide to go with an ARM, make sure you know <strong>what you’ll do once your low-interest rate ends</strong></p><p><strong>Calculate total </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/glossary/closing-costs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>closing costs</strong></a> to see if you have the reserves ready to go through with each loan</p><p><strong>And more in the episode…</strong></p><p>If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/realestaterookie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group</a>!

She shares the exact steps she took to build her portfolio as fast as she did, so you can do the same!

 In This Episode We Cover

Fixing your personal finances before trying to invest in real estate 

Building a “financial runway” that allows you to buy properties, stress-free 

In-state investing vs. out-of-state investing and the best choice for those in pricey markets

Using mid-term rentals as a way to keep rent stability while boosting your profit 

The risk vs. reward of buying properties sight unseen when investing out of state

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>How much cash flow do you need to quit your day job and go full-time into real estate investing? You may have a big number in your head when we ask that. Maybe you’re thinking of replacing a six-figure salary with six-figure cash flow, but that's probably far from what you truly need to quit. In fact, you can quit with a lot less cash flow than what you’re being paid today!

Joining us again is Daryl Clinch, who recently went full-time into real estate investing with his mentor and partner, Ashley Kehr. Daryl transitioned from seasonal employment to full-time investor after working at his job for sixteen years and deciding he needed a change. In today’s show, Daryl breaks down exactly how he prepared to quit, the cash savings he had, and the surprising amount of cash flow that allowed him to achieve occupation-independence!

Looking to do the same as Daryl? Here are some suggestions:

Find a mentor who can fast-track your knowledge and learn from them

Partner up on deals with other investors and provide value whenever possible

Calculate your true cost of living to find your minimum cash flow to quit 

Keep a strong safety reserve so you can focus on getting deals (not paying bills!)

And more in the episode…

      <itunes:summary>Welcome to part two of a rehab estimation masterclass with real estate mogul James Dainard! As mentioned in part one, James has created a multi-level brokerage where he has been involved in 3,000 transactions. His excess experience has allowed him to create an almost scientific process for his flips. In today’s podcast, James builds off part one and gives you a step-by-step guide on how to emulate the process that has given him his success.

James goes over what and who to bring when visiting a property, closing on a property, writing a contractor contract, and finalizing a project to perfection. Each process includes tedious details that may seem daunting at first, but as the saying goes, the devil is in the details. While the initial steps may seem meticulous, once you begin making the process repeatable and do it continuously, it's second nature. James perfected his flipping and renovation processes through trial and error, and if you listen closely you can avoid commonly made mistakes and have an advantage over most new investors. To be the best you have to learn from the best—so listen closely!

      <itunes:summary>Despite what most people would like to think, success has no timeline. There will be some "perfect" opportunities that don’t work out, which is why you must persist. You can either become stuck in one failure or use that failure to propel you forward. Our guest, Andrew Bresee, has learned to use missed opportunities to propel him forward.

Andrew was infected with the “real estate bug” in his teenage years after reading Rich Dad Poor Dad. While he didn't start his real estate journey that young, he began developing the skills that have made him a successful entrepreneur early on. Being persistent has helped Andrew in more ways than one. In school, he had the opportunity to study abroad in Italy and like many others, he loved it so much he didn’t want to leave. For weeks he continued to ask to stay and for weeks he continued to get rejected, but he refused to take no for an answer. After a while, the administration finally relented and let him stay as long as he agreed to work as a handyman. Had he accepted his fate, Andrew would have missed out on another year in a beautiful country with the love of his life who is now his wife.

When he came back, he lived with his parents, and instead of rushing to get to the next chapter of his life, he took a step back and found an opportunity right where he was. He decided to convert his parent's basement into an apartment that they could eventually rent out. While it took six years to complete, it currently cash flows and gave him experience with the rehab process. After that, he found the fourplex that he lives in now which cash flows about $1,200 a month! He found his current fourplex after he didn't qualify for a fourplex he thought was "perfect". Opportunities can be found in any failure or redirection—you just need to look hard enough.

In This Episode We Cover

The power of persistence and how to make life work for you

Understanding a seller and how catering to their needs can ultimately benefit you

Optimizing your Airbnb descriptions to attract your ideal tenant

Establishing your short-term rental vs your long-term rental and why it’s important to approach them differently

The importance of finding the right real estate agent who understands your goals and intentions

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Carlos, who directly messaged Ashley on the BiggerPockets Real Estate Rookie Bootcamp! Carlos is asking: Do you recommend, or is it even possible, to use a hard money lender from a different state?

Hard money lenders and hard money loans are a crucial part of real estate investing for many real estate investors. If you’re a rehabber, flipper, or BRRRR-er, there’s most likely a chance you’ll need hard money in the future. But how do you find a hard money lender without past experience with one?

Here are some suggestions:

Use investor referrals and sites like BiggerPockets to find hard money lenders

Be specific when you ask a hard money lender questions to make sure they can lend in your area

Inquire about the criteria that your hard money lender looks at when lending

Relay your strategy to your hard money lender, to ensure they can lend on the property type you’re looking at

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>Real estate favors those who value risk. An investor’s willingness to take a calculated risk separates the good from the great. And today’s guest, Grace Gudenkauf, is definitely on her way to greatness. This ambitious 24-year-old has managed to get seventeen doors between eight properties under her belt in less than a year, and she shows no signs of slowing down.

She was first introduced to real estate when her boyfriend decided to flip a house. It didn’t pique her interest until she reviewed the numbers and saw the potential. Since then, hard work and calculated risk have allowed her to have the accelerated success any new investor dreams of. A substantial amount of this success is due to her and her boyfriend making it a point to “never let the money stop them”, they “get the deal first and then find the money.” Most would be reluctant to take this approach, but it has worked phenomenally for Grace.

From talking directly to a VP at a local bank to deciding to leave her W-2, Grace keeps taking risks in the name of real estate, and it keeps paying off. When it came to deciding if she would leave her W-2 or not, Grace looked at the worst-case scenario to weigh her options. After it was all laid out—her worst-case financially, emotionally, and socially—she decided the risk was well worth it. This is an episode you don’t want to miss.

Taking on big rehabs as a rookie and how to DIY to save money

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from AJ through Ashley’s Instagram direct messages. AJ is asking a question many new investors have: If I borrow down payment money from friends or family, what’s the best way to pay back the down payment while cash flowing on the property?

For many rookie investors who don’t have large cash sums sitting around, much of their initial investment has to be done through borrowed money. This means not only getting a conventional loan from a bank but privately financing their down payment as well. But, before you start asking your grandma for some “seed funds”, make sure that your bank will allow you to borrow down payment money.

Here are some suggestions:

Double-check that your bank allows borrowed down payments, if not, try and receive a “gift” from a family member 

Work out a payment plan with your private lender before closing on the deal

Pay back the down payment personally and count it as an initial investment in your CoC calculations

Offer equity or a delayed payout as a way for you to maximize cash flow in the deal

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <title>Building an Out-of-State Empire by Using the Right Type of Real Estate Agent w/ Sarah Weaver</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Knowing<strong> how to find a real estate agent </strong>is one thing. Knowing how to find a truly <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2013-10-28-find-investor-friendly-realtor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>investor-friendly agent</strong></a><strong> i</strong>s another. While most real estate agents and realtors can show you homes on the market, send you MLS listings, and do the needed paperwork, investor-friendly agents do much, much more. These types of agents are so <strong>important to a real estate investor</strong>, that they can be thought of as a more permanent part of your team. They’ll find deals, leads, help you run numbers, and give you what you need to <strong>grow your real estate portfolio.</strong> But how do you find them?</p><p>This was a question that real estate investor, agent, and coach, <strong>Sarah Weaver </strong>asked when first getting into <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/out-of-state-real-estate-investing-pros-cons" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>out-of-state investing</strong></a>. In fact, Sarah was doing more out-of-country investing than most other investors.

      <itunes:summary>Knowing how to find a real estate agent is one thing. Knowing how to find a truly investor-friendly agent is another. While most real estate agents and realtors can show you homes on the market, send you MLS listings, and do the needed paperwork, investor-friendly agents do much, much more. These types of agents are so important to a real estate investor, that they can be thought of as a more permanent part of your team. They’ll find deals, leads, help you run numbers, and give you what you need to grow your real estate portfolio. But how do you find them?

This was a question that real estate investor, agent, and coach, Sarah Weaver asked when first getting into out-of-state investing. In fact, Sarah was doing more out-of-country investing than most other investors. As a digital nomad, Sarah was traveling throughout the US, Canada, and New Zealand buying rental properties without ever laying an eye on them. She was able to do this thanks to her rockstar real estate agents.

Now, after almost perfecting the long-distance real estate investing strategy, Sarah is back to share with rookie investors how they too can find an investor-friendly agent to help them scale. If you haven’t already, check out the BiggerPockets Real Estate Agent Finder Tool, you’ll instantly have access to dozens of investor-friendly agents in your area that can help you close on your next deal!

In This Episode We Cover

Investing in real estate while out of state, out of the country, and far from home

The best questions to ask a real estate agent to see whether or not they’re truly “investor-friendly”

Defining your crystal clear criteria so top agents take you more seriously

What a great agent should (and should not) know about an investing area

Building the investor-agent relationship so you both benefit for years to come

Qualifications an investor must meet before reaching out to real estate agents

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Ryan through Ashley’s Instagram direct messages. Ryan is asking: What job would be best for real estate investors? I’m currently doing maintenance for a contractor, but am having minimal takeaway. What’s the best move for financial freedom?

Real estate side hustles and full-time jobs come in all different shapes and sizes. What one job path may lack in salary, it may make up for in experience and connections. What’s more important than immediately jumping ship at your current job is to see what you can do within your role to grow your skillset. So how do you get paid, gain experience, and buy more rental properties?

Here are some suggestions:

Look for opportunity within your current role and ask to take on more of what interests you

Ask an investor if you can work with them directly, you’ll learn a ton!

If you’re having trouble getting deals, look for a partner to invest with

Fully understand your expectations within your current and future roles

And more in the episode…

Adam got his start after college while stationed in Kansas. A fellow ROTC member advised him to start investing, and following his advice, Adam tried to find a property near Kansas State. Unfortunately, he couldn’t find anything that cash flowed, so he did a live in flip instead. He made a solid profit from his first flip and continued to do live in flips with two other properties.  

Before he got into real estate investing, Adam was a commercial property manager, which gave him the experience he needed to handle any property management issues in his own buildings. Based on his experience, Adam has generated four keys vital to your property management success. These four keys can simplify a considerably complicated part of your real estate journey and give you a definite advantage over your competition. 

In This Episode We Cover

Live in flips and why they’re a great option for new investors

Conventional real estate loans vs FHA Loans and why conventional loans can sometimes be the better option

Self-management vs property management and how to figure out which one is better for you

How to find the right property manager (&amp;amp; red flags you should look out for)

The 4 crucial keys to headache-free property management

How to set up the right working relationship with your property manager 

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Xavier through Ashley’s Instagram direct messages. Xavier is asking: Can I use an FHA loan for a vacation rental? What’s the best way to scale without paying high down payments?

Xavier brings up a great question that many rookies have been asking. We all know we can get a conventional loan with very low down payment requirements for an owner-occupied investment like a house hack, but what about a vacation rental? Before you bombard your mortgage lender with questions, listen to what Tony (short-term rental expert) has been using for his vacation rental financing.

Here are some suggestions:

Look into vacation home loans, you can secure a property with only ten percent down 

Find a lender who’s familiar with funding vacation rentals, this will save you a lot of time

Understand the geographical limitations that come with vacation home loans

Make sure you’re able to use your vacation rental property for personal use at some point in the year

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>Every investor wants all their properties to be loaded with high cash flow, but that’s usually not the case. Realistic expectations are essential to the longevity of your career and the maximization of your investments. Progress over perfection should always be the goal. As today’s guest, Ali Garced, stated, “progress is progress, and it will eventually add up”.

Given that her dad is an investor, Ali has always been exposed to real estate, but it wasn’t until she was in the military that she decided to pursue it for herself. Once she realized how great of a resource VA loans are, Ali was determined to buy a house for herself. She purchased a house through the MLS but had to deploy before moving in, so that gave her another opportunity—renting it out. While it had seemed like a great idea, Ali later learned about the 1% rule and realized she was merely evening out after expenses and had no cash flow. This left her questioning if real estate was for her until she checked the appreciation of the house last year. From 2016 to 2021, Ali was shocked to find that the house appreciated double the price.

Her unintentional buy and hold profited more than what she wanted to get from renting—a very pleasant surprise. Since then, Ali has invested in four other properties, including an out-of-state turnkey and a duplex. While none of these properties have been a “home run”, Ali is more than thankful for her “base hits” because they helped her build wealth faster than she imagined. Turns out that it’s hard to not make money when buying the right real estate!

In This Episode We Cover

The VA loan and how it’s an incredible resource for military families 

The 1% rule and why it’s an important calculation to make when deciding on future or current investments

Property management vs self-management and how to decide between the two

The importance of having the right permits and how to check them

The classic buy and hold method and how to make a profit with minimal work

And So Much More!

While none of these properties have been a “home run”, Ali is more than thankful for her “base hits” because they helped her <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/4-reasons-to-invest-in-real-estate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">build wealth</a> faster than she imagined.

      <itunes:summary>We’re continuing the Rookie Reply Direct Message trend! This week’s question comes from Minnie through Tony’s Instagram DMs. Minnie is asking: Should you partner with family members when investing in real estate? 

While this may not be the most fun question that Tony has received in his DMs, it’s a very necessary one to answer, as many real estate investors start their journey partnering with family. While at times it can be stressful, working with family can also be rewarding in more ways than just financial. But, if you want to work with someone close to you, be prepared to treat your investment like a business.

Here are some suggestions:

Treat it like a partnership by signing an operating agreement or joint venture agreement 

Make sure your family member knows the risk of investing 

Don’t do anyone favors, present great investing opportunities instead of asking for money

If you feel like you need to update your partnership agreement, do so quickly and with the consent of your partners

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>Real estate requires a lot of self-motivation and discipline to succeed. Successful investors know that nothing happens overnight and nothing comes to you easily. Today’s guest, Terry Harris, had the perfect amount of drive and persistence when he began his real estate journey. He now owns five properties and has closed twenty wholesale deals.  

Terry started getting into real estate when he came to terms with his G League contract only lasting about six months. He wasn’t sure what to do with his free time until he picked up The Book on Rental Property Investing and started listening to BiggerPockets. He started bringing books with him on the road and while his teammates teased him for always having his nose in a book, it was during those rides that he decided he was going to buy a house. He bought his first house and while it didn’t go as planned at all, the house appraised for double the price and he was beyond proud of himself for seeing it through. One of the hardest things for him during his first deal was the lack of community he felt, but he filled that gap by relying on the BiggerPockets community.

Unfortunately, COVID quickly put a pause on him investing in any other properties, but Terry didn’t let that stop him. He moved to LA for basketball and began looking into another aspect of investing—wholesaling. After practice, he began dedicating an hour to driving around looking for vacant properties and listening to podcasts. He started cold calling and while he missed out on a big potential first deal, he did twenty successful deals after that. While he has found success in wholesaling and enjoyed it, he wants to now transition into investing in more properties himself and gain a more passive income.

 In This Episode We Cover

How to use FHA loans and seller credits to help you purchase properties

Succeeding in real estate without a strong support system and building your investor community

The importance of cold calling and how to add it into your busy schedule

Saving vs splurging and how to encourage yourself to funnel more money into investments

Wholesaling land and the three indicators of a successful land deal

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>Ashley and Tony’s DMs are open for real estate Q&amp;amp;A business! Just like last week, this week’s question comes from Tony’s Instagram DMs. The question? How are you scaling your real estate portfolio so quickly? How do you finance your deals?

For most rookie investors, real estate financing seems like a big hurdle to get over. With deals flying off the MLS so quickly nowadays, having your funding locked and loaded is as important as ever. Thankfully, even if you don’t qualify for bank financing (or you’ve maxed out your personal loan limit), you can still find some phenomenal financing options.

Here are some suggestions:

You don’t need the money, use a partner as a source of funding

Using a cash-out refinance or HELOC from a current property to fund your deals

Walk into your bank and ask what they can do for you (you may be surprised by your options)

Ask the seller about owner financing to close on deals without the hassle of a bank

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>Most people assume they’ll achieve financial freedom after they make their dream salary, but what they don’t realize is you can’t out-earn your toxic money habits. Today’s guest, Daniel Shin, learned this quickly when he started making his full-time surgeon salary.

As a child, Daniel was fortunate enough to live the ideal suburban lifestyle, but when his dad got laid off during a recession, things quickly changed for the worse. After seeing his parents struggle to put food on the table, young Daniel decided he would do everything he could to prevent himself from being in a similar situation financially. Once Daniel started making his surgeon salary he assumed he’d be financially stable, but he began to expand his lifestyle to his salary and started drowning financially. It was at this point he decided to turn to real estate investing.

He started by listening to BiggerPockets and decided investing was for him once he realized he could reach financial freedom faster through real estate. The first couple properties he invested in were turnkey properties. With less risk, Daniel felt it was a comfortable start to his investing journey, but after a while he wanted more of the action. Over the last three years, he has acquired about twenty-eight units including four duplexes and two small apartment buildings. Daniel is now focused on building his “real estate empire” while becoming financially free.

In This Episode We Cover

How to balance your salary and spending habits (and live below your means)

The benefits of investing in turnkey properties and how to find a turnkey operator 

How to deal with a “bad” property and how to prevent investing in any more future headache rentals

How to show possible investors, mentors, or partners that you’re committed

The importance of getting thorough inspections and the consequences of skipping them

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>Ashley and Tony’s Instagram DMs have been blowing up! This week’s question comes from Collette through Tony’s Instagram direct messages. Collette is asking: Do you make offers based on pro forma or actual rent numbers?

If you’re a real estate rookie or a residential-only investor, this may be the first time you’ve heard the term “pro forma” before. A real estate pro forma is simply a spreadsheet or document that projects the estimated financials on a property once capital expenditures, rent increases, or other improvements have been put in. So, should you trust those numbers?

Here are some suggestions:

Remember to “trust, but verify” and always run your own numbers on projected income

Use multiple different investor scenarios: pro forma, current numbers, worst case, etc.

Take into account the holding cost of performing a large rehab on a commercial property

Calculate your working capital and CapEx budget needed to acquire the property successfully

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

The importance of follow up and how much of a difference it can make in your business

How to finance your flips, rental properties, and mobile home parks

Structuring family partnerships and the benefits of working with those you trust

How to pitch investors on a potential deal so they feel confident in your value

        <![CDATA[<p>While leaving your W-2 to pursue real estate can be intimidating at first, it’s important to realize the <strong>skills you learned at your W-2 don’t all go to waste</strong>. Most of what you learned is transferable when it comes to the wonderful world of<a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/guides/ultimate-real-estate-investing-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> real estate investing</a>. Instead of looking at your W-2 as a means to an end, think of it as an experience-based asset. This is exactly what today’s guest, <strong>Emily Fackler</strong>, did.</p><p>As a<strong> former salesperson</strong>, Emily was no stranger to the word “no”. In fact, she had heard it so many times she has created <strong>a thorough follow-up system</strong> to combat it. This follow-up system led her to her <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/fund-your-first-flip" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first flip</a>, purchasing a home that multiple people told her “was already sold”. Her first flip took her 17 months and while she did two other flips besides that, she soon <strong>realized flipping wasn’t for her</strong>. This took her to her<strong> next real estate venture: </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/ideal-mobile-home-investment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>mobile home investing</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Emily partnered with her best friend and<strong> bought a 39 lot mobile home park for a mere $139,000</strong>. Compared to flipping homes, Emily loves it! Investing in mobile homes makes&nbsp;<strong>more sense for her financially and allows her to have a sense of relationship with all her tenants</strong>. She has been able to <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/hire-property-manager" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hire a property manager </a>to handle all the logistics and hopes to bring more homes into the park. After finding her niche with mobile homes, Emily is ready to hit the ground running and eventually be known as the <strong>“Mobile Home Park Queen”</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;In This Episode We Cover</p><p>The<strong> importance of </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/real-estate-leads-follow-up" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>follow up</strong></a> and how much of a difference it can make in your business</p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/finance-your-fix-and-flip" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to finance your flips</a>, rental properties, and mobile home parks</p><p><strong>Structuring family partnerships</strong> and the benefits of working with those you trust</p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2013-08-12-how-to-pitch-to-investors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to pitch</a> investors on a potential deal so they feel confident in your value</p><p>The “stair-stepping method” and how to increase rent in a gradual, less intrusive way</p><p>And <strong>So</strong> Much More!</p><p>Links from the Show</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCA5VL6_GTfTY9I-V7QUcJw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Estate Rookie Youtube Channel</a></p><p><a href="http://instagram.com/wealthfromrentals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ashley's Instagram</a></p><p><a href="http://instagram.com/tonyjrobinson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tony's Instagram</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/realestaterookie/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Podcast</a></p><p><a href="https://www.edmylett.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ed Mylett's Website</a></p><p><a href="https://andyfrisella.com/blogs/mfceo-project-podcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The MFCEO Project Podcast</a></p><p><a href="https://www.bpcon2021.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Conference</a></p><p><a href="http://biggerpockets.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets</a></p><p><a href="https://www.claytonhomes.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clayton Homes</a></p><p><a href="https://odcfund.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open Door Capital</a></p><p><a href="https://instagram.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p><p><a href="https://facebook.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/rookie-podcast-91-lili-thompson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rookie Podcast 91: 8 Units, 10 Wholesale Deals, and $0 Spent on Marketing w/ @Liliinvests</a></p><p><a href="https://www.propstream.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Propstream</a></p><p><a href="https://yourfirstrealestateinvestment.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tony Robinson’s Podcast</a></p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Netflix</a></p><p><a href="https://www.hulu.com/welcome" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hulu</a></p><p><a href="https://www.realtor.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Realtor</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zillow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zillow</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Forums</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/bootcamp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Bootcamp</a></p><p><a href="https://dividendrealestate.com/7incomestreams/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The 7 Income Streams of Millionaires</a></p><p>Check the full show notes here: https://www.biggerpockets.com/rookie149</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Brandon through Ashley’s Instagram direct messages (follow her @wealthfromrentals). Brandon is asking: I live in a great neighborhood where my rent is less than a potential mortgage. I’m looking to invest in a different town experiencing great growth, but I would live there myself. Is it a bad idea to purchase a rental property before purchasing my primary residence? 

Both Ashley and Tony had to ask themselves this same question as they started their real estate investing careers. While they took different approaches, in the end, they both agree that this decision is far more subjective than many people think, and it will entirely depend on your family plans, cash flow, and net worth calculations.

Here are some suggestions:

Ask “will this home purchase contribute faster to my cash flow or net worth goals?”

Decide on the importance of having a “home base” in your name

Understand how your financing options may change after buying the property

Calculate how long it will take you to invest/buy your primary after your purchase

Make the decision through a five-year lens

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>To be a successful entrepreneur and investor, you need to learn how to turn a no into a yes. Today’s guest, Anthony Michael, has earned his title as a successful entrepreneur from doing just that. Through determination, calculated risk, and finding ways to create value, Anthony has done thirteen flips while also becoming a trusted lender.  

Anthony’s real estate investing journey started when he realized he needed to gain control of his money. After his first flip, a live in flip on the house he and his wife had just bought, he knew flipping was something he could do for profit. From there he found his first partner, one of his co-workers, and began to flip even more houses. The second partner he found rejected him at first, even though his online profile (with no profile picture) was pretty much anonymous. Despite this, Anthony was drawn to this mystery partner and his alleged “400 flips” so he flew out to meet this so-called legend and was pleasantly surprised when he was exactly who he said he was.

Anthony could have stopped there but he decided to tap into a new source of income; lending. It started with him asking his neighbor what he did for a living and now he’s the top-rated lender on BiggerPockets. The ability to create value and persist has allowed Anthony to become not only a great real estate investor but an amazing entrepreneur.

      <itunes:summary>Getting fired usually isn’t a good thing. But in retrospect, it was arguably one of the best things to ever happen to Tony Robinson. Before being the internet’s poster boy for short-term rental investing, Tony Robinson spent his days working for someone else while climbing up the corporate ladder. When he unexpectedly got fired (2 days before Christmas), he had to reimagine what his life would and could look like.

Tony took a chance on himself and his real estate business, a chance that has paid off massive dividends to this day. He now lives life on the schedule he wants, spending time with his wife and son, without having to worry about a boss one day letting him go.

Maybe getting fired (while owning real estate) isn’t such a bad thing!

Thinking of leaving your job? If so, prepare like Tony did:

Have a healthy safety reserve before you decide to leave

Understand the job market for your specific position and whether or not you could be rehired

Use your W2 income to invest in cash-flowing assets like real estate

Understand the difference between “job security” and “wealth building security”

And more in the episode…

It usually includes a tedious plan with an incredible amount of time spent gaining background knowledge—but that’s not always the case. Today’s guest, Jan Trisler, stumbled into real estate investing by accident but hasn’t been able to look back after having four successful flips, while currently working on her fifth. Now, she has hopes of getting into rental properties in the upcoming year.

Jan was already in a transition period in her life as she was moving from Nebraska to Arizona as a divorcee but she decided to take it one step further and trade her 9-5 for real estate. It started with purchasing her primary residence from an auction, then later rehabbing it to realize she could do this for a profit. From there, she made the transition from rehabbing to flipping and bought two more properties from an auction.

Once Jan realized that flipping was not only a sustainable source of income but something she genuinely enjoyed, she formed an LLC with her daughter and made things official. While some are hesitant to work with family, Jan and her daughter have created a great system where work is allocated fairly, their wages are paid hourly and the financial investment works perfectly for them. By taking the investing “plunge”, Jan has been able to live and finance her ideal life while doing it with the people she cares about most.

In This Episode We Cover

House hacking and how to get your start in real estate investing

Wholesaling and whole-tailing and what that means

How to make sure the job you work at matches your ideal life

How to set long-term and short-term goals and how to approach them

Building processes and incorporating systems that help your business prosper

Outsourcing and how to train employees (even if you’ve never been a boss)

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>From time to time, Ashley and Tony both have questions they need answering. And thankfully, they both host a show with a real estate investor in complementary niches. This week, Ashley is prepping to scale her short-term rental empire, so she wants to know from Tony what his six top tips for vacation rentals would be.

Although Tony has only been hosting for a few years now, he has a sizable portfolio that was built fast and efficiently. He’s able to charge top dollar on his vacation rentals due to his management, rehabs, and pricing strategies. If you want to max out your vacation rental income, Tony is the guy to listen to!

Here are some suggestions for Ashley:

Utilize comparable data to match region-standard checkout policies, nightly pricing, and minimum stays on bookings

Find the niche that you can fill and will allow your rental to stand out

Do whatever you can to ensure the guest leaves a positive review on your property

Communicate with guests in a systematized, timely manner

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Mack through Ashley's Slack channel in the Real Estate Rookie Bootcamp. Mack is asking: How can I buy an investment property without putting 20% down?

Mack has the question that many real estate investors do: how to buy with low or no money down? Thankfully, the world of real estate has a plethora of financing options from low down payment conventional and FHA loans to zero percent down loans from certain providers. Granted, you do need to check a few boxes before you can get these.

Here are some suggestions:

Understand the main differences between FHA loans and conventional loans

Use house hacking as a way to qualify for owner-occupied financing

Calculate out your PMI beforehand so you know the true cost of a sub-20% percent down loan

Use a HELOC on your current properties as the down payment for new ones

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>We usually get to hear from our amazing guest speakers, but as the year comes to an end, it’s time to hear directly from our dynamic show hosts. Besides hosting rookie podcasts, Tony and Ashley are living proof of how lucrative real estate can be when done right. In this end of the year special we explore Tony and Ashley’s business goals, challenges, and motivations.

While it might be hard to imagine, Tony and Ashley started exactly where everyone else did, at the beginning. Before they each had their own successful businesses, they had to develop a plan, make connections, build a strong reputation, and find the confidence and motivation to keep going even through failure. In fact, despite their current success they still have to do all these things and more. Real estate investing isn’t stagnant and in order to get to or stay on top you have to be willing to evolve, change and take risks.

Tony and Ashley break today’s episode into three categories: business development, partnerships and motivation/inspiration. In each category they talk about their current and past business ventures and their big takeaways. We usually get to hear small snippets about what they’re doing and how they’re doing it, but today it’s just them and it’s something you don’t want to miss!

In This Episode We Cover

The BRRRR strategy and how lucrative it can be for investors

The importance of constantly challenging yourself and finding something you’re passionate about 

The benefits of finding your niche market and becoming “known” for something

Why goal setting and vision planning is essential (even if you don’t know your end goal)

Building your internal team and the difference between your internal and external partners

The different types of partnerships and finding the right partnership structure for you

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>Once again, Ashley’s DMs are open for questions! This week, Brendan direct messaged Ashley asking: I’m looking at a 10-unit property at $1.9M. The current owner only has 4/10 units rented, but banks require 75% occupancy to finance. The seller would be interested in owner financing. Where do I start?

It’s good to note that no two seller financing deals are the same. Different sellers want different things out of a sale and it’s up to you, as the buyer, to find the things they really need to get the deal done. If you’re able to do that, you could get a great property under contract with little-to-no money down!

Here are some suggestions for owner financing:

Use PropStream or county records to see whether or not the seller has a mortgage/lien on the property

Calculate how much you’d be comfortable putting down and relay that in your offer

Run the numbers with current/Pro forma occupancy to see what the property could cash flow

Know that (almost) everything is negotiable, don’t be scared to ask for flexible options

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>What 2022 real estate tax strategies do you have prepared? Or maybe the better question is: have you even started to plan for taxes in 2022? If you’re a real estate rookie, you probably are just dipping your toe into the wonderful world of real estate tax deductions. But, without a good bookkeeper, accountant or CPA, you could be missing thousands (if not more) in tax savings.

Joining us today for our end of year tax roundup is investor, lender, and CPA Ana Klein. Ana started her real estate journey working as a public accountant, then a private accountant, and finally starting her own business.

Now, Ana has a growing portfolio, complete with cash flow and depreciation to offset her income. Ana spends some time today walking through how you, a rookie or experienced investor, can benefit when investing in real estate. She also lays out the ways you can set yourself up for success with a CPA and maximize your deductible income.

In This Episode We Cover

How to shift from a nine-to-five mindset to an entrepreneurial spirit

Converting a duplex into a triplex for only a thousand bucks

What should rookies do right now to take advantage of real estate tax benefits

Is it ever tax-advantaged to buy a rental property that is losing money?

      <itunes:episode>138</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Daniel, who reached out directly to Ashley through her Instagram (@wealthfromrentals). Aside from giving Ashley some more movie quotes to use, Daniel is also asking: How do I gather local rent numbers for my rental property? 

Landlords can struggle when trying to price a rental appropriately, that’s why rental comparable (comps) research can be so important when looking into a new area or when shopping for properties. Both Ashley and Tony use rental comps daily, so they can calculate the right rent price in their sleep!

Here are some suggestions:

Look at comparable homes in your area and see what they’re renting for on top rental sites

Focus on a zip code and property type, as these will be two important factors when comparing rents

Use the BiggerPockets Rent Estimator to automatically find a comparable rent price

Call a local property manager and ask them what your property would rent for

Start an excel spreadsheet where you can easily track days-on-market and price for rentals

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>Do you ever feel out of place as an employee? The W2 route isn’t for everyone and maybe you’ve started to feel the entrepreneurial itch. So what steps do you take when it’s time to transition into working for yourself all while building wealth through real estate?

After years of being in and out of the prison system, Sterling Shrout needed a change. His whole life he considered himself a “bad employee” until he finally realized he wasn’t meant to be an employee, so he turned to real estate.

He began by listening to The BiggerPockets Podcast and any other educational material he could find. From there, he became hooked on the idea of creating opportunity and building capital through self-employment. Besides owning his own home, something he never thought he would do, Sterling has now closed on ten doors in less than two years!  

We touch on topics like overcoming self-doubt, finding a business partner, going from an employee to an entrepreneur, triple net leases, and operating agreements. If you want to begin the journey to self-employment regardless of your past, this episode is perfect for you!

In This Episode We Cover

Overcoming self-doubt and not letting it keep you from pursuing your dreams

The importance of having the right business partner (and how to find one)

Transitioning from being an employee to an entrepreneur and why you should take the leap

Triple net leases and the massive advantages that come with it as a landlord

How to set up an operating agreement and why they’re essential for partnerships

How to build, find and maintain business relationships (even if you don’t have any yet)

And So Much More!

      <title>The 6-Step Process for Buying Your First Rental Property</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>If you’re wondering <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/How-to-Buy-FirstNext-Rental-in-Next-90-Days.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>how to buy your first rental property</strong></a>, there is arguably no better place on the internet to learn than BiggerPockets. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wealthfromrentals/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Ashley Kehr</strong></a> should know, she <strong>tripled her portfolio after she found the </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>BiggerPockets forums</strong></a>. But, in order for Ashley to triple her portfolio, she had to make the leap and buy her first deal. Today, she’ll teach you how to do the same, so you can reach financial freedom.</p><p>Ashley wasn’t born into a real estate family. She worked a <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2015-10-02-simple-secret-financial-freedom" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>nine-to-five job</strong></a><strong> as an accountant</strong>, only to realize she hated it and later quit.

      <itunes:summary>If you’re wondering how to buy your first rental property, there is arguably no better place on the internet to learn than BiggerPockets. Ashley Kehr should know, she tripled her portfolio after she found the BiggerPockets forums. But, in order for Ashley to triple her portfolio, she had to make the leap and buy her first deal. Today, she’ll teach you how to do the same, so you can reach financial freedom.

Ashley wasn’t born into a real estate family. She worked a nine-to-five job as an accountant, only to realize she hated it and later quit. She began working for a local investor and started learning the real estate management game. Ashley then partnered with the son of her boss, who provided her the capital to begin investing.

In less than a decade, Ashley was able to reach financial freedom, retire from any possibility of a regular workweek, and spend more time with her children. Now, it’s time for you to do the same!

 In This Episode We Cover

The six-step process to go from real estate onlooker to real estate investor 

How real estate can help you build long-lasting, generational wealth

Why doesn’t everyone invest in real estate if it’s so great?

      <itunes:summary>Real estate is a relationship-based business. As you establish more relationships within the industry, your job continues to get easier and today’s guest, Jay Simpson, is a prime example of that. With the help of his mentor, he has successfully flipped two houses and already turned one into a rental property.

The primary reason he got into real estate was because he wanted the time to be actively part of his daughter’s life — a freedom his W-2 didn’t allow. His ability to cultivate meaningful relationships is the reason he has been able to find so much success as a real estate agent and investor. Jay heavily emphasizes the role his mentor plays in his real estate career, especially given that when he was new to the industry, he needed someone to show him what the classroom couldn’t. His genuine nature got him his first sale, his first flip, and a continued relationship with his lenders.

Real estate has allowed him to not only free up his time but enjoy the time he has freed up, which to a family man like himself, is the dream. Investing is about more than building wealth, it’s about learning the value of time, especially because you can never get it back.

In This Episode We Cover

Getting your real estate license and how it can be the first step to investing

Working for a broker and what that means for your career as an agent

House flipping and the signs that indicate a great potential flip

How to estimate rehab costs as a first timer 

The importance of a detailed scope of work and its benefits

The importance of being genuine and authentic with everyone you encounter

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Neil on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Neil is asking: I’m reading a book on financing strategies — if a loan is amortized over thirty years, how is there a balloon payment at fifteen years? What’s the difference between the two?

Most real estate investors don’t run into things like balloon payments until they’ve started taking loans from private lenders or use seller financing. Balloon payments allow investors the chance to refinance earlier or pay off a loan in its entirety while also giving a seller or lender the cash they want.

Considering a balloon loan? Here’s what to know:

A loan is amortized over a set amount of years and interest is usually paid before principal

Balloon payments force the lendee/investor to pay back the unpaid loan amount at a certain year mark

Refinancing, paying off a property, or selling a property are ways to fund a balloon payment

Balloon payments force investors to think further in the future for better exit strategies 

And more in the episode…

      <itunes:summary>What if you knew you could be fresh out of college and already owning property? Why wait for a “stable career” to start building wealth when you can dive into real estate investing, whether that be in or out-of-state? Would you start looking into investing earlier if you knew it was without age limitation?

Today’s guest Karina Mejia, a 24-year-old investor, goes over her house hacking journey that helped her go from a server to a landlord. From managing tenants to investing in out-of-state properties, Karina walks through the mindset of investing from a very early age, without the emotional support of those around her.

In This Episode We Cover

What to do with an unruly tenant while house hacking 

How to invest with a romantic partner to ensure asset protection for the both of you

Investing fresh out of college even if you have no experience in real estate

      <itunes:summary>We often hear entrepreneurs talk about how they want to “be the best” in their field. It’s the same with many real estate investors. They want to be the best wholesaler, flipper, short-term rental host, or landlord. But, does “being the best” really matter much to your customer if they can’t tell the difference between you and your competition? Probably not.

Mike Michalowicz, author of Profit First, is on the show today to discuss his new book, Get Different, and why so many entrepreneurs and real estate investors have marketing all wrong. If you’ve ever tried direct mail, cold calling, or door knocking, you know the sting of quick rejection from a potential seller. Why do they reject so quickly? Because you sound just like every other real estate marketer trying to get to them.

If you’re looking to entice new partners, private lenders, tenants, employees, or sellers, you need to start marketing differently. This is possible through Mike’s “D.A.D Framework” that highlights the three most important factors of marketing successfully to a prospect.

In This Episode We Cover

Why real estate investors need marketing more than they think

Finding your competitive advantage and using it to outsmart other investors

Why having a high-referral rate doesn’t mean you're succeeding at marketing

Who, what, and ‘win’ to target and market to partners, private lenders, and sellers

The “D.A.D Framework” and how you can capitalize on it to score leads

Asking customers “what am I doing right” and making it a crucial part of your brand

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>The more “traditional path” encourages a lot of waiting: waiting to get into the right school, waiting to get the right degree, the right internship, and the right job, but what about the right now? As every current and aspiring entrepreneur knows, time is money so capitalizing on the right now is essential. How do you do that? Real estate investing!

Today’s guest, Rachel Morrow, knew the importance of capitalizing on the right now. At merely 20 years old she was on her way to med school when she realized she wanted to start building wealth. During her warehouse shifts, she began listening to real estate podcasts and recognized real estate was not only something she wanted to do but something she could do. This led to a big transition period in her life from the path she had always known to the path less traveled, but once she made that mindset shift, that was it.

The change didn’t happen instantaneously. She had to completely start anew and work towards her goals which at one point meant working 60 hours a week for a year to get pre-approved for a loan. Her drive and persistence allowed her to close on 4 units with hopes of closing on more single-family homes in the future. We touch on topics like creating value, breaking from the “traditional” path, self-managing a house hack, finding a mentor, and being a young investor.

In This Episode We Cover

Breaking from the “traditional” path and finding what best suits you

Building wealth without prior experience in real estate

How to successfully self-manage a house hack 

Using your youth as an advantage when investing in real estate

Getting pre-approved for a loan without high income or long work experience

How to find the right mentor (especially as a newbie)

And So Much More!

        <![CDATA[<p>The more <strong>“traditional path”</strong> encourages<strong> a lot of waiting</strong>: waiting to get into the right school, waiting to get the right degree, the right internship, and the right job, but what about <strong>the right now</strong>?

At merely <strong>20 years old</strong> she was on her way to <strong>med school </strong>when she realized she wanted to start <strong>building wealth.</strong> During her warehouse shifts, she began<strong> listening to real estate podcasts </strong>and recognized real estate was not only something she wanted to do but something she could do.

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Rob on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Rob is asking: How do I make sure a wholesaler that is sending me deals is not a scam?

With wholesaling, as with any other sector of real estate, you’re always going to have your good and bad actors. Many wholesalers are running professional businesses, but some are simply inexperienced, while others have malicious intent.

Here are some suggestions on weeding out wholesalers:

Have your attorney look over the assignment contract to ensure it’s legal

If a wholesaler ever asks you to send funds directly to them, they’re probably not legit

Know your numbers, so any suspiciously good (or bad) deals can be written off

Contact wholesalers on your own so you can do due diligence upfront 

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>Ashley and Tony have been on a tear this year, buying up more homes than ever before. They’ve also been branching out into bigger commercial deals, like RV parks, campgrounds, hotels, motels, and more. While every real estate rookie knows the thrill of finding a new deal, many don’t understand the struggles that go with it.

Today, Ashley and Tony walk through the biggest hurdles they’ve been facing when trying to chase bigger, better deals. One of the biggest struggles when getting into a larger real estate class is financing. You’ll hear how the hosts individually dealt with difficult financing challenges, from subject to financing to raising money and syndicating.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>127</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>Military members in the real estate community love to preach about how great the VA loans are for financing primary residences. They also love the fact that these primary residences can be turned into rentals, quite easily, when the military decides to station you elsewhere. This is exactly how Angel Garcia got his start; accidentally investing in real estate, all while stationed overseas.

Angel bought his first house as a way to ensure financial security for his wife and daughter, but when he was re-stationed, he decided to give landlording a go. He bought another primary residence, but once again, was forced to move, leaving him with two rental properties. He started to notice the cash flow coming in, and with some help from David Green’s Book Long-Distance Real Estate Investing, he made the jump to invest out-of-state.

He made an offer on the perfect property, a $55,000 duplex, but when his inspector wouldn’t even enter the house, he knew he may have made a mistake. This home had $40,000 in foundation damage that needed to be repaired, turning his small investment into a cash-heavy burden. Through perseverance and the ability to learn from past mistakes, Angel was able to make this rental cash flow a respectable amount and it allowed him to get even further along the path to financial freedom.

In This Episode We Cover

Opening yourself up to investing, even if you were raised without an investor’s mentality

Using rental property investing as a way to secure generational wealth for your family

Utilizing VA loans to get 0% down financing on your primary residence

Why you need to be careful you don’t talk yourself out of a deal

Why you should always “do something” even if you can’t buy a property yet

Recovering from a $40,000 surprise when rehabbing a property 

How to help those around you even if they don’t seem interested in learning

And So Much More!

      <title>Rookie Reply: Want to Be a Full-Time Investor? Learn These Skills! </title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This week is less of a <strong>Rookie Reply</strong>, and more of a “Rookie Ramble” as Ashley likes to call it, as <strong>Tony and Ashley </strong>ask each other questions about their <strong>road to </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2015-10-02-ready-become-full-time-investor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>full-time investor</strong></a> status.

      <itunes:episode>126</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>This week is less of a Rookie Reply, and more of a “Rookie Ramble” as Ashley likes to call it, as Tony and Ashley ask each other questions about their road to full-time investor status. They talk about first jobs, best degrees for real estate investing, the industries they chose to go into after college, and the skills they wish they had learned earlier.

Both Tony and Ashley didn’t have the end goal of investing in real estate upon graduation, but they made smart choices in their W2 careers that allowed them to go full-time when the opportunity presented itself. If you’re young or even just starting out on this real estate journey, ask yourself, “what skills do I need to develop to succeed at this?”

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:episode>125</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>You could say that Brin Amberlee isn’t a traditional real estate investor. She doesn’t have tons of experience with property management, construction, or investing, but she does have the will to succeed. After buying her primary residence in Las Vegas, Brin was prompted by friends to start listening to The BiggerPockets Podcast, where she learned about the mind-blowing BRRRR strategy. Brin's funding source for the deal? Her OnlyFans business!

Hailing from Columbus, Ohio, she knew that investing in her hometown would be a perfect place to practice her first BRRRR, turning an old house into an instagramable short-term rental. With help from her father, she is personally taking the time to demo, rehab, and design this property, top to bottom.

Brin touches on everything from finding an investor-friendly agent, to viewing properties, analyzing deals, getting financing, growing your personal brand, and more. She has some big plans to buy even more short-term rentals after this first BRRRR, and we doubt we won’t see her back on The Real Estate Rookie podcast very soon, with a lot more units to her name!

 In This Episode We Cover

Resisting lifestyle creep so you can use extra money to invest

Why your first BRRRR doesn’t need to be perfect

Surrounding yourself with those who achieve greatness and distancing from those who don’t

Vacation home mortgages vs. conventional mortgages on short-term rentals

Building your brand on social media and beyond

The importance of keeping healthy reserves in case a rehab goes over budget

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>New construction is an enigma to many real estate investors, and especially to rookies. When building a new house, you need to understand engineering, permitting, construction, and a more complicated funding structure. This didn’t stop Donovan Adesoro, house hacker turned home builder from keeping the investment train going.

Although Donovan had a background in engineering, he didn’t have much experience with building homes. He started off buying a duplex property to house hack, which turned out so well that he wanted to buy another. The problem? Not enough cash to make the down payment. So he wondered, “what would it cost if I built one of these?” Donovan discovered that he was able to use raw land as a down payment for a new construction loan. So if he had enough to buy the land, he had enough to build the whole house!

Now, at only twenty-four years old, Donovan has twelve lots either ready for a new build, partially through construction, or about to be sold. He’s taken advantage of the huge appreciation we’ve seen in the past two years and makes it clear that even if you don’t have money, you don’t have to give up on a deal.

In This Episode We Cover

The many costs that go into developing a new construction home

Engineering, permitting, contracting, and other key parts of home building 

Using partners to cover costs when you aren’t able to come up with enough cash

House hacking as a way to get your start in real estate investing 

Always having multiple different exit strategies so you come out profitable

Renting your car for extra cash and passive income

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>Five short years ago, Avery Carl didn’t own ninety-six rental units. She didn’t have her real estate license, she hadn’t founded The Short Term Shop or The Mortgage Shop, and she did not have a book written on short-term rental investing. But now, Avery has all those things, and she did all of them in only half a decade.

Avery’s first venture into real estate started by her saving up every penny she could to buy a property in Nashville. After some success, she asked, “what’s the most bang for my buck in real estate?” The answer: short-term rentals. Seven of her units alone brought in over six figures in just July, proving her point that vacation rentals are a necessary part of any investor's asset collection.

Now, she manages her own short-term rentals and long-term rentals, she also helps teach others how they too can start investing in short-term rentals and even goes as far as to help them to get financing. All of this was done in a very short time period, and all of it proves that hard work can fuel financial freedom through real estate investing.

She didn’t have her real estate license, she hadn’t founded <a href="https://theshorttermshop.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>The Short Term Shop</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href="https://mortgageshop.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>The Mortgage Shop</strong></a>, and she did not have a <a href="https://store.biggerpockets.com/products/short-term-rental-long-term-wealth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">book written on<strong> short-term rental investing</strong></a>. But now, Avery has all those things, and she did all of them in only half a decade.</p><p>Avery’s first venture into real estate started by her saving up every penny she could to buy a property in Nashville. After some success, she asked, <strong>“what’s the most bang for my buck in real estate?” The answer: </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/analyze-short-term-rental" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>short-term rentals</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Seven of her units alone brought in over<strong> six figures in just July</strong>, proving her point that <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/vacation-rentals-high-profit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vacation rentals</a> are a necessary part of any investor's asset collection.</p><p>Now, she manages her own short-term rentals and long-term rentals, she also helps teach others how they too can <strong>start investing in short-term rentals </strong>and even goes as far as to help them to get financing. All of this was done in a very short time period, and all of it proves that hard work can fuel <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/financial-freedom-guide-30-somethings" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>financial freedom</strong></a><strong> through real estate investing</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/real-estate-rookie/id1499646507" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Click here to listen on Apple Podcasts.</a></p><p>In This Episode We Cover</p><p>What to look for in a <strong>short-term rental or vacation rental market&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Why short-term rentals are far more <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/biggerpockets-podcast-458-tamar-hermes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>active investing</strong></a> than long-term rentals</p><p>Staying up to date on your city’s <strong>short-term rental laws and regulations</strong></p><p>The <strong>software and systems Avery uses</strong> to analyze a deal</p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/1031-exchange" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>1031 exchanges</strong></a> and using them to massively grow your portfolio (tax-free!)</p><p>Getting out of the fear of overpaying for a property through detailed analysis</p><p>And <strong>So </strong>Much More!</p><p>Links from the Show</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCA5VL6_GTfTY9I-V7QUcJw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Estate Rookie Youtube Channel</a></p><p><a href="http://instagram.com/wealthfromrentals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ashley's Instagram</a></p><p><a href="http://instagram.com/tonyjrobinson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tony's Instagram</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/realestaterookie/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Estate Rookie FaceBook Group</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Podcast</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Forums</a></p><p><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/biggerpockets-podcast-364-avery-carl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Podcast 364: Snowballing 6-Figure Short-Term Rental Profits Into Passive Investments with Avery Carl</a></p><p><a href="https://theshorttermshop.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Short Term Shop</a></p><p><a href="https://mortgageshop.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Mortgage Shop</a></p><p><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Airbnb</a></p><p><a href="https://www.vrbo.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">VRBO</a></p><p><a href="http://alphageekcapital.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alpha Geek Capital</a></p><p><a href="https://alphageekcapital.com/Calculator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alpha Geek Capital Calculator</a></p><p><a href="https://yourporter.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Your Porter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.igms.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iGMS</a></p><p><a href="https://hospitable.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Smartbnb</a></p><p><a href="https://www.airdna.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Airdna</a></p><p><a href="https://hello.pricelabs.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PriceLabs</a></p><p><a href="https://store.biggerpockets.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Publishing</a></p><p>Check the full show notes here: https://www.biggerpockets.com/rookie122</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>Tony Robinson has some great ideas, like creating a short-term rental empire in both Joshua Tree, California, and the Smoky Mountains over in Tennessee. Tony talked so highly of the latter investing region, that today’s guest, Cale Delaney decided to pack his whole family into the minivan and make the 10+ hour drive to check out the area. Shortly after, Cale was under contract for not one, not two, but three cabins!

This wasn't Cale’s first experience with real estate investing. Back at the beginning of 2020, Cale had a mental shift where he realized that real estate could be the key to setting him financially free. He scoured homes all over his area of Florida until he came across a fourplex which rejected one offer from him but later accepted another. He made three of these units long-term rentals, and the other one a short-term rental.

Cale went from zero to ten units in only a year and a half or so, without a ton of management experience of extravagant funding. If he can do it, you can too!

In This Episode We Cover

How to get your first property under contract, even if you keep getting rejected

Managing locally before stepping into long-distance investing

How a quick closing can lead to more deals in your pipeline

Getting off-market properties under contract even in a competitive area

Financing real estate investments using conventional loans, HELOCs, and more

Scheduling time now to plan for freedom tomorrow

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Vince on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Vince is asking: After a 1031 exchange, can I refi/cash-out most of the funds and use it to purchase other property? Will I still be liable for taxes?

While neither Tony or Ashley are tax specialists, they have had some experience in the past with 1031 exchanges. Firstly, make sure you understand the rules of a 1031 exchange and use an intermediary to perform one, after that you may be in the clear to refinance!

Here are some suggestions:

Use the entirety of your 1031 profits to purchase (or subsidize) a new property to limit taxes

Harness the power of appreciation to “swap til you drop”

Use the same entity to 1031 exchange your property and hold it for at least two years

Use a trusted intermediary to complete the exchange

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <title>A Single-Mom’s Second Chance at Success with Real Estate Investing </title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/susanr0120/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Susan Reehill</strong></a> has defied the odds time and time again. She was a <strong>teenage mother</strong>, having her first son at the young age of sixteen. For most young and <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/nakeishas-story-single-mom" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">single mothers</a>, the <strong>chance of becoming a homeowner, let alone an investor is slim</strong>, to say the least. At forty-two years old, Susan decided to make two big jumps in her life and career: graduate from college and buy her first home. She succeeded at accomplishing both.</p><p>As the years passed by, Susan wanted to be a closer distance to her local downtown area. So, she decided to look at <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/home-buying-mistakes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">buying a new home</a>. When <strong>her old home was having a hard time selling, she decided to try and rent it out</strong>, which she did with very little <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/property-management-vs-self-management" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">property management</a> knowledge or <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/6-things-youll-need-when-getting-into-diy-landlording" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">landlording skills</a>. Her <strong>tenant brought in ten different individuals</strong> to live with her, <strong>half of which weren’t authorized on the lease</strong>.

      <itunes:summary>Susan Reehill has defied the odds time and time again. She was a teenage mother, having her first son at the young age of sixteen. For most young and single mothers, the chance of becoming a homeowner, let alone an investor is slim, to say the least. At forty-two years old, Susan decided to make two big jumps in her life and career: graduate from college and buy her first home. She succeeded at accomplishing both.

As the years passed by, Susan wanted to be a closer distance to her local downtown area. So, she decided to look at buying a new home. When her old home was having a hard time selling, she decided to try and rent it out, which she did with very little property management knowledge or landlording skills. Her tenant brought in ten different individuals to live with her, half of which weren’t authorized on the lease. In only six months, her tenant did more damage to her house than Susan had done in the several years she lived there.

But, this didn’t stop Susan’s will to create long-lasting wealth. She began listening to more real estate podcasts, one of which was the Real Estate Rookie podcast. She ended up joining Ashley’s first round of the Real Estate Rookie Bootcamp, where after 90 days Susan was able to score a phenomenal deal, over $100k+ under the asking price!

In This Episode We Cover

Breaking through the societal norms of who you’re supposed to be at a certain age

Becoming an “accidental landlord” and what everyone should know before they rent their home

Making it known that you’re an investor who is actively looking for good deals

Why a deal is still a deal even if you have to pay PMI (private mortgage insurance) 

Finding contractors through meetups, fellow investors, and Facebook groups

Why you don’t need to be rich to start investing in real estate

And So Much More!

        <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/multifamilyamanda/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Amanda Bolan</strong></a>, like many of us, had a “pressure cooker” moment where she realized that <strong>becoming a real estate tycoon</strong> was part of her future. At the time, she was working in the oil and gas industry without real estate investing experience. She took a leap of faith and decided to <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2013-01-16-how-to-lose-money-flip" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>flip her first house</strong></a> in 2018, then flip another in 2019, then <strong>buy a 12-unit apartment</strong> in 2020, and another in 2021. Did we mention she was buying a <strong>61-acre </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/choosing-land-development" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>land development</strong></a><strong> deal </strong>in between these time periods?</p><p>While Amanda was searching for rentals she saw more and more expensive multifamily deals come up.

      <itunes:title>From 0 to 12 Units Overnight and House Hacking a...Farm?</itunes:title>
      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>117</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>Amanda Bolan, like many of us, had a “pressure cooker” moment where she realized that becoming a real estate tycoon was part of her future. At the time, she was working in the oil and gas industry without real estate investing experience. She took a leap of faith and decided to flip her first house in 2018, then flip another in 2019, then buy a 12-unit apartment in 2020, and another in 2021. Did we mention she was buying a 61-acre land development deal in between these time periods?

While Amanda was searching for rentals she saw more and more expensive multifamily deals come up. At first, she had “sticker shock”, but ran the numbers and realized that a good deal in real estate is a good deal for her, no matter the price. She got to work underwriting, financing, and partnering to close on this seven-figure property. Even with some hiccups along the way (financing falling through, environmental flags going off), she was able to close on the deal and became a commercial real estate owner.

Part of her fearlessness in taking on these big, and often unconventional deals is looking at what could go right, not just what could go wrong. Instead of being stuck in analysis paralysis, Amanda made moves to secure properties that would scare rookie investors and made them her own.

In This Episode We Cover

Buying a large multifamily property as your first rental

What to do when financing falls through at the last moment

Running the numbers before you run away from a potential deal

Learning to self-manage at scale without any experience

Buying farmland and holding land for future development

Pushing past fear and making large deals work in your favor

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Mel on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Mel is asking: When working with agents, do your agents help in finding off-market deals, or do you mainly look for those as they send you on-market deals?

While it isn’t uncommon for agents to have “pocket listings” (pre-market listings), most agents deal solely with on-market deals, working with buyers and sellers based on MLS listings. If you’re looking to find more off-market deals, you may have to incorporate some deal hunting strategies like driving for dollars, sending out direct mail, cold-calling, and door-knocking.

Here are some suggestions:

Look for investor-friendly agents who can bring “pocket listings” to you

Even if you find your own deals, agents can help draft up purchasing documents 

Find agents who may have new construction contacts that can bring you pre-market offerings

Ask buyers to split commission payments or offer to pay in full to sweeten the deal

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>What if you could own rental properties without the responsibility of landlording? Not only that, what if you were paid a hefty, non-refundable deposit for your home, minimizing your risk? Would you start investing under these circumstances?

If you like the sound of that, you’ll love the rent-to-own strategy, or as Today’s guest Jessica likes to call her framework, the BRRTOR (Buy, Rehab, Rent-to-Own, Repeat). Most landlords won’t offer rent-to-own to their tenants, not because they don’t want to, but because they don’t know it’s a possibility. This type of seller financing is what Jessica’s entire portfolio is built off of, and it has some major benefits for not only the landlord but the tenant.

Jessica also gives some great advice in our mindset segment, specifically relaying that a big part of real estate is making mistakes. Jessica has had some great deals in her real estate investing career, but not every one of them has turned out to be a superstar. The big takeaway for investors should be to start, make mistakes, learn from them, and do better!

In This Episode We Cover

Combining the BRRRR strategy and the rent-to-own strategy

How to vet tenants to find the best candidates for seller financing

The importance of putting ownership in the hands of a tenant

Finding homes that will profit in this highly competitive market

What to look out for when interviewing hard money lenders

Understanding that the first deal probably won’t be a home run

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Roosevelt on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Roosevelt is asking: I’m currently preapproved with one lender but another lender has a loan option my current one isn't offering. Can you be preapproved with multiple lenders at once? And are there any issues I could run into with this?

It’s commonplace in the real estate investing world to be preapproved by multiple lenders, that way, you’re never stuck without an option to finance a deal. Many investors also opt to use a mortgage broker that can help shop for loans on your behalf. If you’re worried about your credit score dropping because of preapprovals, try to apply for your loan applications within thirty days so credit bureaus count the multiple hard credit pulls as a singular instance.

Here are some suggestions:

Get preapproval from multiple banks (small, local, national, etc.)

Apply within the same thirty day period to minimize effects on your credit

Use a mortgage broker to save time when applying for loans

Ask what the lender has to offer, they may have custom loans for investors

And more in the episode…

      <itunes:summary>When you get started in real estate investing, you often don’t know what you’re doing. Is this deal going to work out? Am I choosing the right materials for my flip or BRRRR? Will this appraise at what I need it to? All these types of questions can flow through a rookie investor’s mind in the first months or even years of investing. But, if you’re making the right progress and doing what needs to be done, you’re probably miles ahead of the competition.

Today we talk to Brian Davila, a real estate investor and coach who helps his students answer the same questions like the ones above. Brian has identified the six key traits of a successful real estate investor. You may have been born with some of these, but almost every real estate investor needs to make a conscious effort to become a master of all six.

If you’re able to capitalize on the advice from Brian, you’ll score more deals, connect with more investors, raise more money, and maybe make an extra few hundred thousand dollars a year!

In This Episode We Cover

Why every investor needs to take calculated risks frequently

Becoming a problem solver so you can get deals others will pass up

Using resources like BiggerPockets and Facebook Groups to find deals

Choosing the activities that will set you closer to your goal 

Having faith even when you’re low on energy (or money)

Building relationships and developing basic sales skills 

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Scott (@hotdads1) through Tony’s direct messages on Instagram! Scott is asking: How are expensive properties profitable? Is it a mindset shift to buy expensive properties, or should I look in cheaper areas? Should I purchase in a quickly appreciating market? 

This is a very 2021-type question. We’ve seen numerous markets around the United States (and the world) see massive appreciation over the past year and a half. Now, real estate investors wonder if it’s even worth pursuing deals on the market. Although prices may be higher than they were before, you still have numerous options when trying to purchase a profitable rental property.

Here are some suggestions:

Price becomes irrelevant when looking at cash on cash return and true cash flow

Look at creative financing solutions (like FHA loans) to close on a home with low money down

Calculate your numbers for the long term to get rid of any short-term price dropping fears

Stop looking at past prices and ask: “Is it a good deal today?”

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Rhett on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Rhett is asking: How do you inform an inherited tenant of changes in ownership after you close on a property?

When you inherit a tenant, you often inherit a lease as well, so it’s important to know exactly what the tenant is paying for rent, their security deposit, and their lease terms during your due diligence period. If you want to notify your new tenants of an ownership change, make sure you do so professionally, so they reach out to you on your business phone, during the hours you’ve set availability at.

Here are some suggestions from Ashley:

Send an estoppel agreement to the tenants so you can verify the lease

Give your new tenants a welcome package with all the needed information

Check your local laws about rent increase timelines 

Prepare for the potential of vacancy in case a tenant disagrees with the rent change/ownership change

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

This was a position Nick never wanted to be in again. He knew what it was like to be broke and borderline starving due to financial scarcity. Nick then decided it was time to jump into real estate investing and make a change for the better.

As Nick made more money, he saved up everything he could to start buying primary residences, only to rent them out a year later using his coined “nomad strategy”. He’s done this multiple times and has been lucky to buy all of them in the growing Denver market. That being said, this wasn’t a completely smooth transition. Nick had a property that put a $50,000 hole in his pocket right after closing. If you stick around for his story, you too will be able to avoid this type of mistake in the future!

In This Episode We Cover

Developing your “why” behind investing in real estate

The “Nomad” strategy for buying a new primary residence every year

Wholesaling a $2M, 8-unit property as his first wholesale deal 

How to get your partner on the real estate investing train

Finding deals in expensive, competitive markets like Denver, Colorado

Whether or not investors should become real estate agents

Losing $50k on a bad deal, but creatively making a profit from it

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Steven on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Steven is asking: I’m about to try to make an offer on a house but the property is on market, so I’m talking with the agent. When I make the offer, is there any official document I need to submit, or do I just give them the price I want to offer?

Many rookies have this question, especially when trying to purchase their first rental property. You have a few options when trying to make an offer, and they will differ based on whether the property is on market, off-market, commercial, or residential.

Here are some suggestions:

Call the listing agent and ask if they will represent you (this is called a dual agent)

If a listing agent can’t represent you, ask if anyone on their team can

You don’t need to submit any documents, just tell your agent your offer and they’ll take it from there

If you’re working on an off-market deal, you may be able to negotiate directly with the seller and sign a purchase agreement

For bigger properties and commercial properties, you can submit an LOI (letter of intent)

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>We have lots of fun phrases in the real estate community, phrases like house hacking, live in flipping, and BRRRRing. Now, we may have one new phrase to add...land hacking. Kai Andrew describes land hacking as extracting as many income streams as possible from one piece of property. That means having the main house for long-term rentals, a small ADU for short-term rentals, a glamping tent in the back, and potentially some farmland being rented out as well.

Only someone as creative as Kai could come up with this sort of strategy. In fact, Kai started out house hacking for his first real estate investment at the age of 21. He rented out to family members and friends before he saved up enough cash to start buying short-term rental properties around his local area of Portland, Oregon.

As his short-term rental portfolio began to grow, Kai started investing in more “unique” opportunities, like shipping container homes, glamping, or A-frame builds. He also set up criteria that he terms “the golden triangle” for all his unique experiences. These unique homes have helped him grow his portfolio, his profits, and take home a sizable amount of equity between his 12 doors.

In This Episode We Cover

Why house hacking is still a relevant strategy in today’s market

How to convince your partner/parents/friends to invest with an investor presentation

Airbnb arbitrage (rental arbitrage) and building your business with no home purchase necessary

Land hacking and using a single property for many income streams

Creating a “golden triangle” for your unique short-term rentals

Setting up safety nets so you never have to realize your “worst-case scenario”

And So Much More!

      <title>Rookie Reply: Do I Need a Lawyer to Evict Tenants? </title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This week’s question comes from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/realestaterookie/posts/461517474895279" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Dan</strong></a> on the <strong>Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group</strong>.

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Dan on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Dan is asking: For those of you that have gone through the eviction process, did you go it alone in small claims court or did you hire a lawyer? 

While Tony (thankfully) doesn’t have experience evicting any tenants, Ashley has had to evict multiple out of her personal investment properties as well as from properties she managed when she was a full-time property manager. She describes the multiple ways you can evict a tenant, all of which will rely on the situation the tenant presents you with.

Here are some suggestions:

Hire an attorney if you are inexperienced with tenant evictions

Use small claims court to get back rent or payment for damages

Offer cash for keys if you are unable to legally evict at this time

Understand that many tenants will pay or leave once they receive an eviction notice

And Much More!

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

Choosing to forego college when it may not be a good option for you

Staying motivated even when deals become hard to close

Treating sellers with honesty, integrity, and sticking to your word

Finding the “traction” your business needs to grow and succeed

Building rapport with a seller and letting them talk 90% of the time

And So Much More!

We talk about the many different streams of income that a campground or RV park owner can cash in on, how to score financing when buying commercial properties, what to look for in your due diligence phase, and how to underwrite these massive deals. For beginner investors, this can seem like a huge task, but Heather proves that even with no experience, you can put in the work to make massive financial leaps like she did.

 In This Episode We Cover

The benefits of owning a campground or RV park

How commercial real estate differs from residential real estate

Financing big deals through bank loans and seller financing 

Looking for commercial BRRRRs and value-add opportunities

Long-term parks vs. short-term parks and the benefits of both

Developing systems that leave you less reliant on third-party businesses

And So Much More!

        <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.heatherblankenship.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Heather Blankenship</strong></a> was on a road trip from Florida to California, stopping at RV parks and campsites in between driving. She saw how busy these parks were and thought it would be interesting to own one. On her way back to the east coast, <strong>she ended up buying a campground in Tennessee for over three million dollars</strong>. She had <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/best-way-get-started-real-estate-investing-no-money-experience-network" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no experience, no team, and no money</a>. Now, that campground is<strong> worth over thirteen million dollars</strong>!</p><p>Although Heather was just 26 at the time, she was able to<strong> quickly adapt to the learning curve that the campground presented her</strong>. She grew her knowledge and skill set and now oversees around <strong>thirty million dollars in RV parks and campgrounds</strong>.</p><p>We talk about the many <strong>different streams of income</strong> that a campground or RV park owner can cash in on, how to score<strong> financing when buying </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/overlooked-commercial-investments-real-estate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>commercial properties</strong></a>, what to look for in your <strong>due diligence phase</strong>, and how to <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/glossary/underwriter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>underwrite</strong></a><strong> these massive deals</strong>.

      <itunes:summary>As a successful real estate investor, you may be looking for bigger and better deals to take on, but sometimes those deals may come in a different shape and size. Kier Vogt had mastered buy-and-hold rentals, house hacking, and flipping. She wanted to take on a bigger challenge, something that would give her more responsibility with even more upside. After taking a cross-country drive, she found the asset class she was looking for: RV parks and campgrounds.

If you’re a rookie investor, you may have never thought about investing in an RV park or campground, but there are some serious benefits to them. Since these are commercial properties, your ability to obtain seller financing is far more likely and you can build out multiple streams of income from one property, as opposed to solely collecting rent.

Now, Kier is in the stage of analysis. She already has a private-money lender, but has to find a deal that fits her purchasing power and her criteria. Kier shares the mindset behind going into this completely new asset class, and how you have to push through fear to cold call owners, send in offers, and finally get an RV park or campground under contract.

In This Episode We Cover

The difference between RV parks, campgrounds, and mobile home parks

Analyzing larger commercial deals and performing due diligence

The benefits of seller financing compared to bank financing

Submitting a letter of intent (even if you’re scared to do so)

Self-managing a property to learn about the business

The many different revenue streams an RV park or campground can offer

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>It takes most real estate investors a while before they make the jump from single-family homes to commercial properties or large multifamily properties like mobile home parks. Edwin Byler isn't like most real estate investors.

After successfully flipping his first home, he decided to throw the profits into a rental property. For the first month, everything was going well, then the tenant stopped paying. After 6 months of no rent payments, Ed had to make the tough decision to evict the tenant.

Now with some experience under his belt, Ed was ready to take on bigger deals. Thankfully he was friends with an older gentleman who was looking to offload a 6-unit mobile home park, and Ed turned out to be the perfect buyer. He acquired the park with 20% down over a 15-year amortization schedule and ended up DOUBLING the park's revenue with some simple value-add.

Now, he’s taking on a 51-unit mobile park with his brother as a partner. Did we mention he’s acquiring this property with no money down and paying 0% interest? If you’re wondering how he did it, take a listen to Ed’s story!

In This Episode We Cover

Partnering on your first deal to mitigate risks and learn more about real estate

Getting tenants to move out (without having to formally evict them)

Purchasing mobile home parks without prior experience

Looking for “value-add opportunities” when viewing potential investments

Using owner financing to purchase investments like mobile home parks

How to find out the “why” behind a seller’s listing

And So Much More!

      <title>19 Units in 1 Year and Starting a “Luxury House Hack” </title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Greg Schwartz</strong> didn’t plan on getting into real estate, he was keen on becoming a private pilot. He figured he’d make $200k-$300k per year and that would be <strong>enough money to help him retire</strong>. That was until he talked to a real estate investor who<strong> told him about the potential to </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/biggerpockets-podcast-390-leka-devatha" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>make 7-figures in a month</strong></a>.

      <itunes:summary>Greg Schwartz didn’t plan on getting into real estate, he was keen on becoming a private pilot. He figured he’d make $200k-$300k per year and that would be enough money to help him retire. That was until he talked to a real estate investor who told him about the potential to make 7-figures in a month. Greg knew that the investor was on to something and he took some time convincing his wife, Rachel, to start investing in real estate.

They both went in on a rental property in Alabama, but after some initial stumbles with long-distance investing, they switched their strategy to house hacking in College Station, Texas. Now, only a year into their investing journey, they have 19-units under their name, one of which is a “luxury house hack”.

Greg and Rachel have had to be diligent while building and systematizing their real estate. Rachel has already become an expert property manager and has learned through her job how to prioritize, systematize, and organize their business to the best of their abilities. This is a great interview with two rookies who chose to pivot and keep building better with every new property they got under contract.

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Lisa on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Lisa is asking all about property management this week: I’ve never had a property manager, what are the responsibilities of one? I was recommended a manager and was told he charges 10%. What is the average pay for a manager? What questions should I ask when I speak with him? 

While there is no standard on fees or responsibilities across all property managers, they tend to follow certain averages. Both Tony and Ashley have hired property managers as well as self-managed, here’s what they’ve found through their experiences:

Use your property managers as a means to find out more about a market

Property managers not only are in contact with your tenants, but they’ll also issue repairs and contractor bids when needed 

If you’re new to real estate, it’s useful to have a property manager who can help educate you

Property management fees are around 10% (of rent) a month, but can be as low as 5%

Property managers will also charge fees for filling vacant units or performing maintenance

Ask about fees, thresholds for maintenance, and their experience with local investors

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <title>Buying Your Next Home with This Often Overlooked 0% Down Loan</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>When most people think of <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/usda-rural-development-loan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>USDA loans</strong></a>, they tend to think of farmland or some very, very rural house in the middle of nowhere. While this can be the case for many USDA loans, it isn’t the standard for all of them. As today’s guest <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hollynbarrett/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Holly Barrett</strong></a> describes, <strong>USDA-applicable properties can be outside city centers and just a bit rural</strong>.</p><p>Not only that, these loans provide homeowners with the chance to<strong> get a </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/real-estate-investing-no-down-payment-loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>0% down loan</strong></a>!

      <itunes:title>Buying Your Next Home with This Often Overlooked 0% Down Loan</itunes:title>
      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>95</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>When most people think of USDA loans, they tend to think of farmland or some very, very rural house in the middle of nowhere. While this can be the case for many USDA loans, it isn’t the standard for all of them. As today’s guest Holly Barrett describes, USDA-applicable properties can be outside city centers and just a bit rural.

Not only that, these loans provide homeowners with the chance to get a 0% down loan! This is exactly what Holly did with her first home, later turning it into a rental and finally selling it to make room for some higher cash-flowing properties. She’s also used SBA loans to purchase a commercial property, which has helped her lower the upfront costs needed for acquisition.

Now, Holly has properties close to Chattanooga, centered around a “cool area” as she likes to call it. She’s making her transition from long-term rentals to short-term rentals and is excited to see what her new profit margins are like once her properties go live on Airbnb. 

In This Episode We Cover

Using USDA maps to see whether or not a potential home is eligible for a 0% down loan

Live in flips and using them to get tax-free flipping gains

When you should use a 1031 exchange intermediary 

Switching from long-term rentals to short-term rentals 

Funding a commercial property acquisition with SBA loans

What investors should look for in an agent and the top questions to ask

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Ben, who actually direct messaged Ashley and asked her a pretty personal question. Ben is asking: As someone with student debt, should I start investing in rentals or wait until I’ve paid off my student loans?

It goes without saying that this is a very personal question, especially since it has to do with personal (not business related) debt. Everyone is different in their willingness to take on debt. While some people don’t mind having lots of low interest debt, others want to get rid of it as fast as possible. Both Tony and Ashley have had student loans while building a rental portfolio, so they’ve had to ask themselves this question as well.

Here are some suggestions:

Make sure you pay off all high-interest debt first before you start investing

Use methods like partnerships, BRRRR investing, and other low/no money down options

Ask yourself whether or not the future cash flow can help you pay off your debts

Never put yourself in a position where you’ll feel anxious while investing

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <title>Stop Making Offers! Here’s What to Do Instead with Erik Wright</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In this hot housing market, it seems like<strong> almost everyone is telling you to make offers</strong> on anything that could be a potential deal. But <strong>Erik Wright</strong>, founder of <a href="https://www.newhorizonhomebuyers.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New Horizon Home Buyers</a>, poses a different strategy. Erik has been <strong>getting more and more off market deals</strong> in Chattanooga, Tennessee <strong>without offering a single dollar to potential sellers</strong>. He has a specific way of negotiating that allows him to <strong>get tens of thousands of dollars off of properties</strong>, making the deals even sweeter for him.</p><p>Erik didn’t always have the gift of negotiation.

      <itunes:title>Stop Making Offers! Here’s What to Do Instead with Erik Wright</itunes:title>
      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>93</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>In this hot housing market, it seems like almost everyone is telling you to make offers on anything that could be a potential deal. But Erik Wright, founder of New Horizon Home Buyers, poses a different strategy. Erik has been getting more and more off market deals in Chattanooga, Tennessee without offering a single dollar to potential sellers. He has a specific way of negotiating that allows him to get tens of thousands of dollars off of properties, making the deals even sweeter for him.

Erik didn’t always have the gift of negotiation. He started his real estate journey at 23 years old, buying an accidental house hack property, then buying a HUD foreclosure, a couple of duplexes, and some more single-family homes. Over the past decade, he has amassed a 7 unit portfolio and is currently transitioning into having New Horizon Home Buyers become his full-time job.

Through the use of search engine optimization (SEO), Erik’s company has become the top-ranking result when searchers type in “Chattanooga cash home buyer”. This proves that even in a business like flipping, BRRRR-ing, or wholesaling, you can still find new ways to optimize and upgrade your lead generation efforts, even if you have ZERO experience in something like SEO!

In This Episode We Cover

Why house hacking is a rookie investor’s best friend

Buying a HUD foreclosure and how it differs from regular home sales

Financing a growing real estate portfolio without a W2

Using referrals of other investors to find the best contractors around

How to rank #1 on google so you can get more off market deals

Getting below-market prices without ever making an offer on a house

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Shantay on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Shantay is asking: We are about to close on a duplex. It is going to need a $6k-$10k upgrade. What are some options for funding the rehab cost?

Different investors have different preferred methods of funding rehabs of this size/price point. Both Ashley and Tony have renovated numerous properties and used the below methods to raise the funds they needed without dipping into their own pockets!

Here are some suggestions:

Find a 0% interest credit card so you can buy material for the rehab

Partner up for equity with another investor so you can split the costs

Raise private capital from family and friends by delivering a solid investment presentation

Take out loans against your stock portfolio, 401(k), or other assets

And more in the episode...

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Joey on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Joey is asking: Was driving in a new part of town and came across a house that had a yard that hasn’t been maintained in months and the house looks unkept.  Any suggestions on how I should go about finding the owner and asking if they would be interested in selling? 

We had a ton of great responses in the Facebook group, but Ashley and Tony will do their best to answer based on their own experience and their preferred style of skip tracing. You can do this both for free or for a fee, it all depends on which information you need!

Here are some suggestions:

Look up your city’s GIS mapping website and find the owners on the title 

You can also use Propstream to skip trace the owners for a small fee

Reach out to neighbors and ask them if they know anything about the owner

If the owner is an LLC, go to your Secretary of State’s website to look up the LLC owner 

And more in the episode…

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>Sometimes, new real estate investors tend to forget about the other types of real estate investing outside of single-family and multifamily homes. What about self-storage, or commercial, or in Matt Racker’s case, warehouses? All these options can make you passive income, sometimes with far less hassle than managing residential properties.

Matt caught the real estate bug doing his first live in flip. He saw a house being remodeled, took a look inside, and decided he could finish the job. Just like that, he called the contractors, found the flippers, and offered to take it off their hands. With some sweat equity, Matt was able to completely renovate his primary residence off of a construction loan, while leaving $0 in the property. I think it’s safe to say we’d all like a new house for free! Then, Matt started thinking about what else he could invest in.

Since he runs his own office furniture and cubicle system business and had a pretty good handle on warehouse leases, he decided to use his expertise to start buying commercial warehouses as rental properties. Matt walks through exactly what you need to analyze a warehouse, which metrics matter most, and how to structure your leases (triple net, single net, etc.).

In This Episode We Cover

Putting in sweat equity so you can 100% finance your home

How to analyze commercial warehouses depending on their square footage

Partnering with family and how to create an org chart

Bidding on duplexes at a virtual auction

Triple net leases and why they’re common in commercial real estate

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>Today, we have a question from Ashley to Tony, on a subject he has a lot of experience in. Ashley wants to know: How do you analyze a market for short-term rentals? Which factors come into play and how can you stay away from the markets that won’t work for short-term rentals?

This is a perfect time to ask Tony, especially since he’s looking to find a third market to invest in (outside of Joshua Tree and the Smoky Mountains).

Here are some suggestions from Tony:

Make sure you aren’t buying in an area that heavily relies on seasonality

Focus on mature vacation rental markets that have the infrastructure for short-term rentals 

Double check regulations and zoning laws so you know you’re allowed to host a short-term rental 

Look at the availability in the current market (are there any houses to buy?)

And more in the episode...

If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>Young love is beautiful, but what’s even more beautiful is young love that produces residual income together! That’s exactly what Sam and Nick of Eagle Hill Homes have done. Even though they have been together since their teenage years, Sam still had to be nudged by Nick to get into real estate investing. Once Sam started designing, planning, and executing on rehabs, she knew that this was the life for them.

Now, Sam is a certified general contractor and Nick is a loan officer. But these weren’t the couple’s original jobs, far from it actually. Nick was in corporate insurance sales while Sam was in marketing. Once they had 6 units under their name and they were making enough money to pay for their lifestyle, they quit their W2s and jumped into the real estate industry!

Now they’re rehabbing, renting out, and house hacking anything that has “value add” potential for them. They’ve taken very smart steps to renovate houses for far higher cash flow and ARV, gotten mortgages with 90%+ financing, and used their own specific skills to grow a flourishing rental portfolio!

In This Episode We Cover

Leaving a W2 job to pursue a career in real estate

Finding “value add” potential in deals

Finding off-market properties and negotiating with sellers

Understand the “why” behind a seller’s reason to offload their property

House hacking tips and how to keep your sanity when living close to tenants

And So Much More!

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Adri on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Adri is asking: I came across a seller financed mobile home park, this would be my first out of state investment. What should I be looking out for on MHP (mobile home parks) and is this a huge jump to make while still being a rookie?

While we can’t answer how ready Adri is for investing in a mobile home park (we believe in you), we can answer questions about what to look for when evaluating a MHP deal. Before you consider investing, you’ll need to look at some mobile-home-park-specific factors.

Here are some suggestions:Make sure you get accurate financials, especially a T12 rent roll Look at the utilities and see whether they’re public or private (wells and septics)Look at the capital expenditures (capex) of the entire parkFind out who owns the trailers/mobile homes and evaluate whether the current ownership is advantageous to youIf you’re still nervous, partner up with someone more experienced!And more in the episode…If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group!

      <itunes:summary>Coming up with capital isn’t easy when you’re just starting out. How are you supposed to get 20% down for one property, let alone multiple when trying to grow your portfolio. This was the predicament Justin Munk was in until he found out about the BRRRR strategy. When implementing the BRRRR strategy, Justin was able to use a fraction of the money he would need as a down payment to get a renovated, highly desirable rental property. 

Justin invests over 1,000 miles away in Ohio and manages all his rehabs remotely. Most investors would stray away from remote rehabs, but Justin has so many “checks and balances” set up that he feels confident to do them. His rehabs have to go through an inspector, a contractor, and a leasing manager before they’re put on the market. This allows Justin to have extreme confidence that he’s rehabbing a property to get the highest rent, with the lowest headache to management. 

Justin gives some valuable advice to new investors that are struggling with analysis paralysis: don’t sabotage your own deals by finding problems in every property!

      <title>College Coach with 10 "Doors" Renting By the Room to Students</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Many landlords decide to switch from renting by the unit to <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/rent-by-the-room-faqs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>renting by the room</strong></a> in order to <strong>maximize cash flow per unit</strong>. Renting by the room is usually best situated for students and for properties nearby sizable universities. This type of strategy is exactly what Hastings College track and field coach, <strong>Ryan Mahoney</strong>, has done with his 2 units that have a combined <strong>10 rooms being rented out</strong>.</p><p>After a bit of <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2014-01-04-leveraging-really-risky" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over-leveraging</a> in the early 2000s, <strong>Ryan found BiggerPockets </strong>and knew landlording was something that could help him <strong>reach financial freedom</strong>.

      <itunes:episode>83</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>Many landlords decide to switch from renting by the unit to renting by the room in order to maximize cash flow per unit. Renting by the room is usually best situated for students and for properties nearby sizable universities. This type of strategy is exactly what Hastings College track and field coach, Ryan Mahoney, has done with his 2 units that have a combined 10 rooms being rented out.

After a bit of over-leveraging in the early 2000s, Ryan found BiggerPockets and knew landlording was something that could help him reach financial freedom. When some of his athletes started complaining to him about the sub-par conditions they were living in, Ryan decided to start competing with the local student rentals, providing better living conditions at a more manageable price.

Now, Ryan is exclusively renting out his properties to students on 9 to 10-month leases. He’s had to pivot a bit since COVID-19 shutdowns took students off-campus, but has a solid amount of reserves and enough flexibility with students that he doesn’t have to worry. Ryan talks about how he found great contractors, used the BiggerPockets investment calculators to secure financing, and what you should (and shouldn’t) do when renting out to students.

      <title>David Greene on Where Rookies Go Wrong When Looking for an Agent</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>A familiar voice pops in for this episode of the Rookie Podcast, it’s <a href="https://www.davidgreene24.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>David Greene</strong></a>! The<strong> real estate agent, investor, entrepreneur, and co-host of the </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/category/biggerpockets-podcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>BiggerPockets Real Estate podcast</strong></a> joins us to talk about making the transition to top real estate agent and what new investors can do to <strong>find better deals and a great agent</strong>.</p><p>Most newbie investors want to be hand-held, which makes sense when you’re just starting out. That being said, that may not be <strong>the best way to </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/real-estate-companies/find-real-estate-agent-directory" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>find a great agent</strong></a> who can help you find a profitable deal. David talks through <strong>why so many new investors never end up buying</strong>, why you aren’t “hiring” an agent, and <strong>how to work together to achieve a </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2015-09-07-win-win-partnership-grow-business" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>win-win scenario</strong></a>. As he puts it, you’re in a partnership together, meaning it’s a win-win or a lose-lose.</p><p>If you’re trying to <strong>become a great agent</strong>, make sure you jot down some notes on David’s “<strong>medicine and delivery system</strong>” analogy where he talks about how he had to change his perceptions to succeed as a real estate agent. Many new agents (and investors) want to wait until they get their first sale/deal to become confident, but <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2014-09-02-dominate-talking-motivated-sellers-real-estate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">you’ll<strong> need confidence</strong></a> before you can get the first one!</p><p>In This Episode We Cover</p><ul><li>What exactly an <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/real-estate-investor-friendly-agent" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>“investor-friendly” agent</strong></a> is</li><li>How David Greene built one of the<strong> top real estate teams in America&nbsp;</strong></li><li>How new investors should look at their<strong> investor/agent relationships&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Making sure you<strong> manage client expectations </strong>as an agent especially when working with investors</li><li>Who should (and shouldn’t) <strong>become a real estate agent&nbsp;</strong></li><li><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/real-estate-social-media-harness-good" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Using <strong>social media to boost your credibility</strong></a> and industry presence</li><li>And <strong>So </strong>Much More!</li></ul><p>Links from the Show</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/realestaterookie/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group</a></li><li><a href="http://instagram.com/wealthfromrentals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ashley's Instagram</a></li><li><a href="http://instagram.com/tonyjrobinson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tony's Instagram</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCA5VL6_GTfTY9I-V7QUcJw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rookie Youtube Channel</a></li><li><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Podcast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.kw.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KellerWilliams</a></li><li><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/biggerpockets-podcast-353-tim-rhode" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Podcast 353: Turning $5K Into $5K/Month and Retiring at 40 with Tim Rhode</a></li><li><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/biggerpockets-podcast-226-from-d-student-400000-annual-cash-flow-david-osborn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Podcast 226: From “D-Student” to $400,000 in Annual Rental Property Cash Flow with David Osborn</a></li><li><a href="https://hibandigital.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Real Estate Rockstars Podcast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/bp-podcast-190building-multiple-passive-streams-income-pat-hiban" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Podcast 190: Building 61 Different Passive Streams of Income with Pat Hiban</a></li><li><a href="https://mapscoaching.com/welcome-to-bold-pivot/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keller Wiliams Bold</a></li><li><a href="https://kwcapitalproperties.com/ignite/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keller Williams Ignite</a></li><li><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/biggerpockets-podcast-406-shelby-osborne" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Podcast 406: 51 Units and $900/Month in Pure Cashflow on a “BRRRRnB” with Shelby OsborneShelby Osborne</a></li><li><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Building-a-Deal-Pipeline.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LAPS System</a></li><li><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/moneyshow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Money Podcast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/biggerpockets-business-podcast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Business Podcast</a></li><li><a href="https://store.biggerpockets.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiggerPockets Store</a></li></ul><p>Check the full show notes here: http://biggerpockets.com/rookie81</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>A familiar voice pops in for this episode of the Rookie Podcast, it’s David Greene! The real estate agent, investor, entrepreneur, and co-host of the BiggerPockets Real Estate podcast joins us to talk about making the transition to top real estate agent and what new investors can do to find better deals and a great agent.

Most newbie investors want to be hand-held, which makes sense when you’re just starting out. That being said, that may not be the best way to find a great agent who can help you find a profitable deal. David talks through why so many new investors never end up buying, why you aren’t “hiring” an agent, and how to work together to achieve a win-win scenario. As he puts it, you’re in a partnership together, meaning it’s a win-win or a lose-lose.

If you’re trying to become a great agent, make sure you jot down some notes on David’s “medicine and delivery system” analogy where he talks about how he had to change his perceptions to succeed as a real estate agent. Many new agents (and investors) want to wait until they get their first sale/deal to become confident, but you’ll need confidence before you can get the first one!

In This Episode We CoverWhat exactly an “investor-friendly” agent isHow David Greene built one of the top real estate teams in America How new investors should look at their investor/agent relationships Making sure you manage client expectations as an agent especially when working with investorsWho should (and shouldn’t) become a real estate agent Using social media to boost your credibility and industry presenceAnd So Much More!Links from the ShowReal Estate Rookie Facebook GroupAshley's InstagramTony's InstagramRookie Youtube ChannelBiggerPockets PodcastKellerWilliamsBiggerPockets Podcast 353: Turning $5K Into $5K/Month and Retiring at 40 with Tim RhodeBiggerPockets Podcast 226: From “D-Student” to $400,000 in Annual Rental Property Cash Flow with David OsbornReal Estate Rockstars PodcastBiggerPockets Podcast 190: Building 61 Different Passive Streams of Income with Pat HibanKeller Wiliams BoldKeller Williams IgniteBiggerPockets Podcast 406: 51 Units and $900/Month in Pure Cashflow on a “BRRRRnB” with Shelby OsborneShelby OsborneLAPS SystemBiggerPockets Money PodcastBiggerPockets Business PodcastBiggerPockets StoreCheck the full show notes here: http://biggerpockets.com/rookie81

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Bryan on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Bryan is asking:  How do PM (property management) companies handle maintenance? Do they fix the issue and submit invoices to the owner or withhold the amount from monthly payments to the owner?  

This is a great question for those who want to transition from self-management to hiring property managers. Both Ashley and Tony have the same type of payment setup with their property managers, but it can vary company to company.

Here are some answers/suggestions:Both Ashley and Tony have a maintenance threshold for small repairsAnything over the threshold needs to be approvedOne the job is done, the cost is deducted from the rent You can always go with a PM’s repair/remodel bid, but it may save you money to hire an outside contractor you know and trustTry and get PM companies with software, so you can see the exact invoice onlineAnd more in the episode…If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>Before cooking at Michelin star restaurants, Ellen Bennett worked as a lottery announcer, an English tutor, and a “booth babe”. All of these jobs taught her to be comfortable in uncomfortable positions. When her head chef told her that he needed new aprons for all the cooks, Ellen took to the challenge, with no business plan, no connections, and no experience designing aprons. The deadline, uncomfortability, and challenge pushed her to deliver the aprons on time, and start Hedley &amp;amp; Bennett.

Now, Ellen runs this multi-million dollar business that delivers to Michelin star restaurants and at-home cooks alike. Ellen talks about the necessity of committing to something scary, even when you don’t know how to handle it. She used the same approach when buying 3 rental properties nearby her home in Los Angeles, all of which have appreciated dramatically.

The mantra used in creating a successful business, investment, or anything else is Dream First, Details Later, which also happens to be the name of Ellen's new book! An entrepreneur can get bogged down so easily with the details of any venture, so much sometimes that it could push them away from accomplishing something great.

In 2009, as the market was hitting unprecedented lows, he decided to start investing in real estate. He purchased a single family home to start, then started house hacking, moved on to some fix and flips, bought some vacation rentals, and before he knew it, he was a very active real estate investor.

There was one problem though. Travis was working 90+ hour weeks in the oil industry, often working overseas for long periods of time. Travis was trying to run his active investing with his hectic schedule, but often found it hard to put a high level of effort into his rentals when so much of his energy was being exerted from his job. In 2015, Travis made the decision to become a passive investor.

Passive investing isn’t for everyone, especially for those who want to be making the big decisions. Luckily, Travis didn’t mind having general partners make decisions for the syndications he invested in, if anything, he preferred it. Travis walks through what you need to look at before putting money into a syndication, including the general partners, the market, and the deal. He also talks through how to identify whether or not a syndication is being run well, and other passive investing strategies like investing in REITs.

Many real estate investors will find themselves with lots of projects, lots of experience, lots of money, but little to no time. If you feel like this, it may be a good idea to start balancing some of your active investing with more passive cash flow opportunities!

They’re recording from the BiggerPockets headquarters in Denver, and they brought their partners! Tony’s wife Sarah and Ashley’s business partner Joe are here to answer the most common questions about partnerships and investing with someone else.

What makes a great partner? Tony, Sarah, Ashley, and Joe all agree that a good partner has to have complementary strengths to you. Do you know how to do financing but are terrible at design? You should find a partner who loves design but doesn’t want to touch financing. Although it may not be the easiest task, one of the best ways to find a partner is to look at your weaknesses, your strengths, and look within your circle to find someone who could be the yin to your yang.

Ashley also talks about the “partner presentation”. You may have heard this term before on the show. A partner presentation is essentially a binder including a bank statement, credit report, personal finance statement, and past deal history. This helps you show a potential partner that you’re coming from a position of strength and that you possess the competence to tag team a deal.

Ashley, Tony and their partners also go over things like goal setting, partnership structures, LLCs, life insurance policies, and more. While many rookies feel they don’t have the experience to bring to a partnership, it’s important to know that you running the numbers, listening to the podcast, and having interest in real estate already puts your skillset above many others!

      <title>Auctions, Section 8 Tenants, and 16 Doors in South Chicago with Martin Neal</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Martin Neal</strong> started his career as a <strong>police officer</strong> during the great recession. His family convinced him to<strong> buy a condo since prices were near rock bottom</strong>, this is when Martin was bit by the real estate bug. When he was transferred to another police station, thus doubling his salary, he knew it was time to do something with the condo. He <strong>paid off the loan and set up a </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/rei/glossary/heloc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>HELOC (home equity line of credit)</strong></a> so he could <strong>purchase cash flowing rentals</strong>!</p><p>Now Martin uses the <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/guides/brrrr-method" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>BRRRR strategy</strong></a> to buy homes that need rehabbing, rehab them, rent them out, and get them into conventional loans. As of now he has<strong> 11 properties with 16 doors</strong>, most of which was picked up just in the last 3 years.</p><p>Martin has done what many investors advise against,<strong> worked with his family</strong>. He has his dad running management on some of his properties and helps when rehabbing them as well. How did Martin <strong>work with his dad without jeopardizing their relationship</strong>?

      <itunes:title>Auctions, Section 8 Tenants, and 16 Doors in South Chicago with Martin Neal</itunes:title>
      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>71</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>Martin Neal started his career as a police officer during the great recession. His family convinced him to buy a condo since prices were near rock bottom, this is when Martin was bit by the real estate bug. When he was transferred to another police station, thus doubling his salary, he knew it was time to do something with the condo. He paid off the loan and set up a HELOC (home equity line of credit) so he could purchase cash flowing rentals!

Now Martin uses the BRRRR strategy to buy homes that need rehabbing, rehab them, rent them out, and get them into conventional loans. As of now he has 11 properties with 16 doors, most of which was picked up just in the last 3 years.

Martin has done what many investors advise against, worked with his family. He has his dad running management on some of his properties and helps when rehabbing them as well. How did Martin work with his dad without jeopardizing their relationship? He sat down with his father, laid out the roles and responsibilities of the project, and paid him for his time. It’s tough finding trustworthy workers and partners in real estate, so don’t disregard family just because they’re family!

Martin also gives some great advice on finding high-quality section 8 tenants, many of which helped his real estate portfolio through the COVID-19 shutdowns due to their government subsidized rent. He also talks about buying homes off of auction sites, but making sure you’re able to do your due diligence before putting in an offer.

In This Episode We CoverUsing HELOCs to fund your future BRRRRsHaving a defined plan so you can scale faster and with less headache Having the bravery to buy more units, even when it pushes you into new territoryWhy townhouses may be an attractive asset in specific parts of townWorking with family (without destroying your relationships)Buying homes at auctions And So Much More!Links from the ShowRookie Podcast 55: Combining House Hacking and Live in Flips with Tyler MaddenBiggerPockets FormsBiggerPockets File PlaceGoogle SpreadsheetsAuction.comCozy.coTrestaBiggerPockets PodcastBiggerPockets Podcast 248: From Shop Teacher to Multifamily Syndicator with Todd DexheimerBiggerPockets Podcast 075: Mobile Home Investing and Getting Started With John FedroBrandon Turner's InstagramBiggerPockets Money Facebook GroupReal Estate Rookie Facebook GroupBiggerPockets Facebook GroupBiggerPockets ForumsRookie Rockstar Facebook PostCheck the full show notes here: http://biggerpockets.com/rookie71

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Becky Nova</strong> didn’t have a linear path to real estate like many others. She’s had times in her life when she was poor and times in her life when she was rich. Becky knew that she didn’t want to go back to those poorer times in her life, so when she was about to marry her husband, she was <strong>pushed to get herself out of debt</strong> and into a much more stable position. She worked a consulting gig, got herself <strong>debt-free,</strong> and decided she wanted to start <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/house-hackingcase-study" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>house hacking</strong></a>!</p><p>Now, Becky is off in the Dominican Republic, <strong>running her entire portfolio of 10 houses </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/remote-real-estate-investing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>completely remote</strong></a>. Even more impressive, Becky used traditional financing for those rental properties! So how does she<strong> manage properties all the way in upstate New York</strong> while she’s <strong>thousands of miles away</strong> on the beach?</p><p><strong>Well-tailored systems and procedures</strong> is what Becky relies on. She refers to her phone as one of the best tools for real estate, since she can call her agent, her tenant, or her contractor whenever she needs something. Becky proves that you can<strong> run a rental portfolio long distance</strong>, and do it successfully to boot!</p><p>This did take Becky some time, though.

Today we talk to Julia Galef, author of The Scout Mindset and host of the “Rationally Speaking” podcast.

Sometimes we have a scout mindset, which allows us to be more exploratory and see what really is going on. Then we also have a soldier mindset, which is when we’re seeing only our pre-existing beliefs. How do you know if you’re using your scout or soldier mindset? Ask yourself if you’re rationalizing your situation or just making excuses.

This can be hard as business owners and investors because we often are the first to blame someone else for our problems. We even downplay our shortcomings, like when a novice flipper thinks he or she can do the electrical, plumbing, foundation, and flooring work without any prior experience. It’s important for us as people and investors to get honest feedback not only from our clients, tenants, contractors, and partners, but also from ourselves.

He had bought himself a primary residence and cosigned with his mother on her home, but knew he wanted to accrue units that could be cash flowing.

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Mitch on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Mitch is asking two questions: How do you close on a property sight unseen and how do you finance off-market deals?

Our two lovely hosts have expertise in both of these areas. Tony has bought a fair amount of property sight unseen and Ashley has used some very creative strategies for financing off-market deals.

Here are some suggestions for both of Mitch’s questions:Get your agent, inspector, and general contractor to inspect a prospective sight unseen propertyDon’t waive the inspection clause, especially if you’ve never been in the propertyLook for lenders that aren’t traditional banks, especially those that work with investorsAsk local banks if they offer any products that could help with your fundingUse a line of credit or borrow against your stocks/other assetsAsk for seller financing whenever possibleAnd More!If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group!

      <itunes:summary>Real estate investing works differently for different people. Some people like to gradually buy small properties, then start looking for larger deals, and then go into commercial financing for big deals. Tommy Polise always knew he wanted to buy real estate and had spent five years analyzing markets and educating himself, but never bought any properties. In 2019, that changed.

Tommy had been looking into single family homes but found that he’d only be walking away with a small amount of pure cash flow each month. While he now feels that single family homes are a great investment, at the time, he didn’t think the cash flow was worth the effort. So he and a partner went in on a multifamily deal together. It worked out well and he gained some experience and connections, so he decided to go bigger and better.

Now, two years later, Tommy and his partners are sitting on 30 units. This includes single family homes, multifamily properties, and a land deal that includes 10 mobile home lots, 8 storage units, 3 single family homes, and a 5 unit apartment complex. He even has a laundromat with a residential property attached to it as well!

So how does a real estate rookie like Tommy go from 0 units to 30 units in the span of 2 years? Tommy says you need to develop good relationships, get great partners, understand your financing, and continuously take risks!

In This Episode We CoverHow to get commercial financing if you’re just starting out in real estateFinding a great partner that will work with you, even when you make mistakesWhy single family homes may work for some investors more than othersThe appeal of doing large commercially financed deals How to do a thorough inspection when you’re closing on a large propertyCalculating your “worst case scenario” and knowing your risksDeveloping the confidence to pursue bigger and more complicated dealsAnd So Much More!Links from the ShowBiggerPockets ForumsBiggerPockets Real Estate PodcastBrandon TurnerClubhouseZillowBuildiumBiggerPockets Podcast 348: Full-Time Job, Full-Time Mom, and Full-Time Wealth From Rentals with Ashley KehrBiggerPockets Podcast 423: Who Not How: Stop Doing the Things You Hate, Free Up Time, Be Happier and Richer with Dan SullivanBiggerPockets Business PodcastReal Estate Rookie Facebook GroupCheck the full show notes here: http://biggerpockets.com/rookie65

      <title>Rookie Reply: How Do I Place Properties Under a Newly Acquired LLC?</title>
      <description>

      <itunes:summary>This week’s question comes from Mantas on the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group. Mantas is asking: How do I place properties under a newly acquired LLC?

Before you place your properties in an LLC, you’ll need to ask yourself if you need an LLC in the first place. This really depends on your goals as an investor and whether you have a partner or not. Many investors skip the LLC route and put a rental property solely in their name, while other investors that work with partners choose to either start a new LLC or put the new investment property in their current LLC.

Here are some suggestions:Make sure you know the financing options for LLCs vs. buying in your own nameGet an umbrella policy if you don’t have an LLCSpeak to a trusted attorney or submit LLC paperwork yourself (if not too burdensome)Get commercial financing for your LLC and purchase the house in its nameAnd Much More!If you want Ashley and Tony to answer a real estate question, you can post in the Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group! Or, call us at the Rookie Request Line (1-888-5-ROOKIE).

      <itunes:summary>It’s hard to leave a comfortable job, especially when you’re working with family. What happens if you can’t make your entrepreneurial dreams work, what if you need health insurance, what about your bills? This is the predicament that Sean and Ann Wayne were in, only a couple short years ago. Thankfully, they made the jump, and now they’re flipping more than ever!

Sean and Ann left college with around $93,000 in debt, but were able to pay it off quickly due to their thrifty lifestyle and saver skills. After they had paid off their debt, they wondered where they could put their leftover money into. Sean stumbled upon BiggerPockets and knew that something within the realm of real estate was the best option.

Luck would have it that Sean and Ann’s landlord at the time was a flipper and a real estate agent. After some discussions, their landlord decided to mentor them through their first flip. If you’ve listened to this podcast long enough, you know what’s coming next. They were hooked! Sean knew he had to leave his corporate job to pursue flipping, even if it meant less stability.

Now this dynamic flipping duo has done 12 deals. Sean focuses on the rehab and Ann focuses on design. If you’ve wondered about what the best ways to paint and design your flip are, Ann drops some knowledge on what is worth risking, and what isn’t. Together, they’re an unstoppable team, and will definitely be on the Real Estate Podcast soon enough!

Cory is asking: Owner financing would buy me some time to get the property rented and cash flowing as well as build some equity before taking it to my bank for conventional financing. Any tips, suggestions, stories on doing this? 




Many real estate professionals have an opinion on owner financing (also called seller financing). Some love it, some hate it, and some just haven’t had any experience with it. Ashley has had some great experience not only owner financing a package of properties for sale, but also being the owner who has financed her property when selling it. 




Here are some of Ashley’s suggestions:Show the seller that you’re financially stable with some key documents Work with the seller to find terms, interest rates, and payment options that work for you bothAsk the seller what they need to make this deal work for themDraw up a letter of intent and attach an amortization schedule Get it structured and drawn up legally with your lawyer

Tyler went to school to be a doctor, but after leaving school he found himself in the restaurant industry.

He got so good at fixing up his own house, other people started asking him to take care of projects on their houses. Tyler loved fixing up houses, and decided to get his general contractor license and start up his own business. 

Tyler was even inadvertently house hacking and doing a live in flip/rehab on his first primary home without even realizing it. He rented out a room in his house while he was fixing up the property, which helped him cover a lot of costs. When Tyler and his wife decided to move into another house, they kept it as a rental property, and held on to a LOT of equity that he is now using to pursue future deals.

      <itunes:summary>Real estate investors are very busy people, and often, rookie investors become busier than ever as they’re learning the tricks of the trade. Kevin Christensen is no different, he works a full-time job, runs a retail store with 5 locations, and self-manages his long and short-term properties, all while doing some handyman work himself!

As a United States Marine, Kevin was used to the “improvise, adapt, and overcome” mentality, which has served him well in his investing career. Kevin only started actively investing in real estate around 2 years ago, but has so far done 18 deals, won a lawsuit, and hired two full-time contractors for his properties. He runs a very tight ship, and doesn’t let much slip through the cracks.

Kevin’s secret to success is centered around just being himself: work hard, be kind to others, and focus on customer service. As you’ll hear in the episode, Kevin was able to get a $350,000 house reduced to $190,000 simply by listening to the seller’s needs and being courteous throughout the transaction, something that the other wholesalers in his area failed to do.

If you’re interested in subject-to properties, it will serve well to heed Kevin’s advice. He was sued in the middle of a subject-to deal while renting out a house as a short-term rental. Kevin walks through exactly why the sellers were suing, how he protected himself, and how he pulled in $14,000 of revenue in only around 2 months!

You’ll probably hear Kevin on the BiggerPockets Real Estate podcast soon, because even though he’s a rookie in years, he’s a pro in experience!

In This Episode We Cover:How to be a better wholesaler and listen to what sellers needGetting your spouse on board for real estate investingWhat a subject-to property is and how to facilitate a subject-to transactionThe best property management software (that’s also free!)The importance of having a W2 income if you’re going to BRRRR, flip, or buy long-term rentalsWhy short-term rentals can be serious cash-flowing investmentsWhen to BRRRR and when to flip (depending on your goals and finances)And SO much more!Links from the ShowReal Estate Rookie Facebook GroupBiggerPockets PodcastAshley's InstagramTony's InstagramRookie Podcast 32: Debt Free with 2 Rentals and Counting with 24-Year-Old ICU Nurse Prescott WilliamsCozySmartbnbPriceLabsCheck the full show notes here: https://www.biggerpockets.com/rookie51

      <title>Targeting New Builds to Get Around the W-2 Requirements for House Hacking with Andres Bustamante</title>

      <itunes:summary>Not many college students get their real estate license while in college, let alone during freshman year. Andres Bustamante did just that, becoming a leasing agent so he could cover his housing and tuition costs. Andre didn’t know if he would go into real estate full-time after college, but when he found the BiggerPockets Podcast in the Summer of 2019, he decided to make the jump.

Andres reached out to a guest on the show, who later became his mentor and asked Andres to join his team! In his first year of full-time real estate Andres managed to sell 15 houses, with 15 more under contract as we speak. He lives in a house hack, has another house hack under contract, and bought an AirBnB as a short-term rental.

Since Andres had 1099 income he wasn’t able to take the traditional route to house hacking that W2 employees have available to them. Instead, Andres found new construction projects going up, put down earnest money for them, and locked in the deal. As Andres describes, he was able to get into these projects at “stage 1”, so as the builders were building, Andres was guaranteed a price for a house that was appreciating everyday in his growing market.

As Andres has been house hacking he's come up with some great ways to verify that tenants will work for you and for your profit margins. He talks about what he provides, what he puts in his leases, how he decides on tenants, and more helpful tips for any aspiring house-hacker!

In This Episode We Cover:How to get a property for house hacking when you don’t have a W2What you’ll need to get a new build under contractHow earnest money differs from a down paymentThe criteria you should have in place for househack tenantsHow to split utilities among tenants when house hackingHow to make equity profit from new buildsAnd SO much more!Links from the ShowReal Estate Rookie Facebook GroupBiggerPockets PodcastBiggerPockets Podcast 352: No Driver’s License, No Money, No Excuses: How Diego Corzo Blazed a Trail to 18 DoorsBiggerPockets Podcast 329: Financial Freedom Before 30 Through Just 10 Deals With Felipe MejiaDiego Corzo’s InstagramStessaAshley's InstagramTony's InstagramCheck the full show notes here: https://www.biggerpockets.com/rookie49

      <title>4 Ways Newbies Can Finance Deals with Richard Kelly</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>After <strong>Richard Kelly</strong> shadowed a veterinarian for the day, he realized that his passion wasn’t performing surgery on animals, it was actually money. This led him to become a <strong>banker </strong>and after he was given the book <strong><em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em></strong><em>, </em>his interest in <strong>real estate investing was</strong> sparked.</p><p>After deciding he wanted to become a landlord, Richard found <strong>BiggerPockets </strong>and started listening to every episode of the podcast he could. After feeling confident enough in the real estate investing education space, he made his first jump into <strong>flipping</strong>, buying a <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/rei/glossary/short-sale" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>short-sale</strong></a><strong> home</strong> with some <strong>creative financing via </strong><a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/hard-money-loan-ultimate-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>hard money loans</strong></a>.</p><p>After some very heavy<strong> hard money fees</strong> paired with long nights working to get his flip finished, he walked away with a solid profit, and knew that he wanted to park it in <strong>buy-and-hold investing</strong>. Currently, Richard has completed 2 flips and owns 2 rentals (a single family and a duplex), and knows exactly what (and what not) to look for when using hard money and <strong>creative financing</strong>.

      <itunes:episode>48</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>After Richard Kelly shadowed a veterinarian for the day, he realized that his passion wasn’t performing surgery on animals, it was actually money. This led him to become a banker and after he was given the book Rich Dad Poor Dad, his interest in real estate investing was sparked.

After deciding he wanted to become a landlord, Richard found BiggerPockets and started listening to every episode of the podcast he could. After feeling confident enough in the real estate investing education space, he made his first jump into flipping, buying a short-sale home with some creative financing via hard money loans.

After some very heavy hard money fees paired with long nights working to get his flip finished, he walked away with a solid profit, and knew that he wanted to park it in buy-and-hold investing. Currently, Richard has completed 2 flips and owns 2 rentals (a single family and a duplex), and knows exactly what (and what not) to look for when using hard money and creative financing. Now, he’s here to share the knowledge with all of us.

Richard has done 4 deals, with 4 completely different ways of financing. From private money, to 401(k) loans, and using a fan favorite, the 203(k) construction loan. He also talks through how to find deals, who to partner up with, and why you need a great real estate agent especially when you’re just starting out.

      <itunes:summary>Most rookie real estate investors want to hit a home run on their first deal, Annie and Trey Johnson did it completely on accident. Neither of them were interested in being landlords or real estate investors, but after they made six figures profits on their first home, they realized there was real money in the real estate game.

Annie and Trey were looking for a home to raise their family in. They found the perfect plot of land which had a new manufactured home and a scenic view. After living in the home for a few years they decided to move elsewhere to be closer to family, and instead of selling it, they decided to rent it out for a year.

Now they were landlords by accident, and as the money started to flow in every month they questioned “is this something people are normally doing to make money?”. Fast forward a year, they subdivided the land, sold the home, and walked away with profits exceeding $200,000. Not bad for a couple of rookies!

Annie and Trey now invest out of state, building up their real estate portfolio by rehabbing inexpensive homes. They’re so into real estate, that Annie even hosted her own socially-distant meetup during 2020!

This investor couple walks through their keys to success, the players on their team that make the biggest difference, and how they went from just homeowners to real estate investors!

      <title>Bed and Breakfast House Hacking with Lauren Keen Aumond </title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Lauren Keen Aumond</strong> was only 22 years old when she got her <strong>primary residence</strong> under contract, and 23 when she purchased it. She realized that the rents in her area were higher than the <strong>mortgage payment of buying a house</strong>, so she bought a home, leased out a room, and incidentally discovered <a href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2013-11-02-hack-housing-get-paid-live-free" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>house hacking</strong></a>.

This home was situated on a decent sized lot, with a primary home, 2 cottages, and a mobile home! As a resourceful investor, Lauren decided the best way to make this a cash flowing property was to turn the two cottages into short-term rentals and buy a camper as a 4th unit on the property.

      <itunes:summary>Investor couple Anam and Aamir have been hard at work during COVID, locking down deals and BRRRR-ing more and more houses. Through years of system-building and deal mistakes/lessons, they were able to create a system that allows them to save time searching for deals and know immediately whether a property is worth the investment or not.

After pinpointing exactly what they wanted in a deal, Anam and Aamir took the time to develop systems and processes that would help them get properties rehabbed and rented faster.

So how did they finance these deals? HELOCs, credit cards, cash, hard money, and other creative financing. 

This is what allowed them to build a portfolio of 21 units within a few years, all while working full time jobs that take up much of their waking hours.

With their deal criteria system (A.R.E.A), they’ve been able to turn their dreams into reality. Now at only 28 and 30, Anam and Aamir are on track to close more and more deals, securing their financial independence all while building appreciating wealth.

In This Episode We Cover:How you can grow your rental portfolio, even during a pandemicHow to get your processes and systems down so they work for you Using your partner’s strengths/weaknesses to inspire growth How to use different creative financing strategies to get deals fasterHow to find a hard money lender that works with your time-frame and ARVWhat the A.R.E.A system is, and how it can help you find high-quality dealsThe importance of running accurate comps in a desired areaUsing your mistakes to make yourself into an educated investorAnd SO much more!Links from the ShowReal Estate Rookie Facebook GroupAshley's InstagramTony's InstagramBuildiumBiggerPockets ForumsBiggerPocketsCheck the full show notes here: http://biggerpockets.com/rookie40

      <title>$500 Per Door on Multifamily Properties (During COVID!) with Thomas Tsitouridis</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Thomas Tsitouridis </strong>is truly a jack of all trades. As a kid, he was used to helping on the project-management side of his parent’s <strong>64-unit apartment building</strong> (taking out the trash, helping with tenants, and so on).

      <itunes:summary>Thomas Tsitouridis is truly a jack of all trades. As a kid, he was used to helping on the project-management side of his parent’s 64-unit apartment building (taking out the trash, helping with tenants, and so on). He later realized that real estate investing would hold a special place in his future.

Thomas later worked for a construction manager, then chose to start his own construction business, property management business, and long term buy-and-hold business. 

Using the experience and cash flow from his construction business, Thomas found that he could amplify his money by buying deals and using his own team to do the construction and rehab.

Now Thomas (and his partner) are buying multifamily deals, fixing them up, and getting sustainable cash flow, so they can retire early. Within his first year as a real estate investor, he has already learnt a lot. Thomas shares some great tips on tenant management, system automations, construction, and even financing so you can get better ROI earlier on!

With so much going on at once, Adam makes it look easy, juggling his hectic military life while accomplishing his long term goals.

Adam started learning about real estate over a decade ago, but didn’t dive in until 2017. Thanks to his “ruthless work ethic”, he’s been able to stack up his rental portfolio, make meaningful mentor connections, and join masterminds in only a few years!

Adam talks about getting 0% down loans, locking down long-distance real estate deals, doing thorough inspections when buying sight-unseen, and how to start relationships with mentors and real estate professionals you look up to.

With a healthy portfolio of rental properties spanning across the country, Adam is the perfect example of someone who found the time to accomplish his (and his family’s) dreams of financial independence!

      <itunes:summary>Big news: previous guest Tony J Robinson is back... he's now your new co-host alongside Ashley.

Today, you'll get reacquainted with Tony and learn how he rapidly expanded his portfolio this year. In fact, he went from owner of 2 houses when he appeared on the show in March... to closing on his 7th property (!) next month.

...How tho? Tony spells it out today: from finding new financing options in Louisiana (he lives in Southern California), to breaking into the short-term rental game in the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and Joshua Tree, CA.

Plus: a next-level tip we haven't heard before: using a line of credit against your stock portfolio (rather than a property) to free up short-term cash.

      <itunes:episode>35</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>From $25,000 purchase prices last week to $300,000+ group houses this week!

We head to the Bay Area today to meet pharmacist Ryan Chaw, who ventured about an hour away from his hometown and began buying 1 house per year and renting them by the room to college students.

Ryan collects nearly $11,000/month from 18 tenants, and is creating the kind of generational wealth his grandfather used to put both him and a sibling through college.

Does renting to college kids sound like a disaster waiting to happen? Well... Ryan has found several ways around this, and in this episode he outlines the checklists, systems, and "personal touches" he uses to self-manage without the headaches.

Ryan opens up about an early failure, too. He wasn't getting all his rooms filled, and he realized he wasn't doing a good enough job advertising. So he developed step-by-step, "P.R.I.M.E." marketing method to attract a steady stream of qualified applicants... and you'll learn each step today.

If you're struggling how to figure out just how to create cashflow in a spendy market, follow Ryan's lead! Get creative, consider rent-by-the-room and other outside-the-box strategies, and reap the rewards of greater appreciation and stability that come with high-priced areas.

In This Episode We Cover:How Ryan is succeeding in one of the most expensive markets in the country, the Bay AreaUsing his job as a pharmacist to get conventional financingCreating generational wealth through real estateHow he saved up to buy 1 property per year, 4 years in a rowWhy he rents his houses to college studentsThe systems he uses to manage 18 tenants and avoiding roommate dramaUnlocking hidden value and boosting rental income by adding bedroomsLessons learned from a difficult tenant who smoked weed and played loud musicWhy "buy then wait" beats "wait then buy"And SO much more!Links from the ShowReal Estate Rookie Facebook GroupFelipe's InstagramAshley's InstagramBiggerPockets ForumsBiggerPockets PodcastRentometerYelpZillowCheck the full show notes here: https://www.biggerpockets.com/rookie35

      <itunes:summary>Frontline healthcare worker... Air Force Reservist... real estate investor!

24-year-old Prescott Williams is a renaissance man committed to building real wealth through real estate while serving his community and his country. Today he walks us through his first 2 deals, and the 3 deals he's currently working on in the Hattiesburg, Mississippi area.

Prescott shares some great shortcuts for investors who work full-time – from creating a "rental requirement list" with your personalized criteria to publicly posting your real estate goals (you never know who will send you a lead!).

A lot of our guests choose their real estate agent as their MVP, but for Prescott it's his mortgage lender. You'll learn how he finances his rehabs and new construction deals by partnering with a small local bank – a strategy you can model (if you're willing to put in a little legwork!)

Give Prescott a follow on Instagram @prescott_williams -- and follow us by joining our Real Estate Rookie Facebook Group: just search "Real Estate Rookie" and answer the screening questions to join 15,000 other like-minded investors.

In This Episode We Cover:Prescott's strategy for graduating college debt-freeFinding a flexible local "portfolio" lenderPersuading his parents to take out a HELOC to help him get started in real estate investingSleeping on an air mattress while renovating a houseHis "rental requirement list" criteriaHow he uses the "1% rule" (rent = 1% of purchase price) to guide his purchasing decisionsThe stress-free way to handle maintenance callsHow he's gotten deals just be posting his goals on social mediaAnd SO much more!Links from the ShowReal Estate Rookie Facebook GroupFelipe's InstagramAshley's InstagramBiggerPockets ForumsBiggerPockets PodcastBiggerPockets Podcast 348: Full-Time Job, Full-Time Mom, and Full-Time Wealth From Rentals with Ashley KehrBiggerPockets Podcast 329: Financial Freedom Before 30 Through Just 10 Deals With Felipe MejiaBiggerPockets Podcast 012 : Wholesaling and Marketing with Sharon VornholtZillow Check the full show notes here: http://biggerpockets.com/rookie32

      <itunes:summary>So... how do partnerships work in real life? Today, you'll learn how – from two new(ish) real estate investors: Amy Swayze and Chris Lawrence.

Amy breaks down her partnership with her adult son, who used his retirement fund to jumpstart their investing career earlier this year (right before COVID hit!). Here's the arrangement: Amy's son brings the money and crunches the numbers; she manages rehabs and gets tenants in their BRRRR rental properties.

Chris is a more experienced investor, having left his sales job to start investing full-time in the Rochester, NY area. Still – when he first jumped into real estate investing, he realized he was missing a few pieces of the puzzle (including liquid $$$).

So what did he do? He found a partner!

Like Amy, Chris and his partner split everything 50/50. They use a HELOC to borrow money at a low interest rate... so they can make cash offers when they're looking for flips and wholesale deals.

This is a real-life look behind the curtain to see how two rookie investors are running their business, and using partnerships to supercharge their wealth-building. Don't miss it... and if you enjoy it, share it with a friend or family member. Who knows, he or she might want to partner up with you someday!

In This Episode We Cover:How Amy partnered 50/50 with her son, an electric line worker who likes the tax advantages of real estateHow she and her son divide dutiesUsing hard money to fund their BRRRR dealsStarting out in real estate investing right before COVID-19 hitHow Chris' partner complements his skill setHow he evaluates various exit strategiesA deep dive into one of Chris and his partner's recent fix-and-flipsAnd SO much more!Check the full show notes here: https://www.biggerpockets.com/rookie31

      <itunes:summary>Expensive market? Busy with a career and other priorities? There are a lot of compelling reasons to consider turnkey investing in a more affordable area – where a local "operator" sells you a tenanted property designed to pump out cashflow from day one.

All you have to do is "turn the key," hand things off to a property manager and... voilà! You're rich. You can now kick back and sip margaritas on the beach. Right?

Well, it's a little more complicated... as you'll learn today from seasoned turnkey investors Whitney Hutten and Lance Robinson. Both have bought rental properties from turnkey operators in several different markets, and they tell us all about the highs and lows, reveal what they wish they would have known, and offer candid advice for anyone considering this niche.

When you're done with this show, you'll know the exact questions savvy investors ask prospective turnkey providers about neighborhoods, construction warranties, property management contracts, and how operators handle evictions and major repairs. You'll also know how to handle a home inspection to ensure you know exactly what you're getting into!

Look – there are a lot of turnkey operators active on the BiggerPockets forums. A lot of them are great teachers, too. But this episode is told from the investor/customer's perspective... and it's well worth a listen – or two!

In This Episode We Cover:What turnkey investing isDoing due diligence to find a trusted turnkey operator Why it's always worth flying out to walk the property before purchasingHiring your own home inspector!Whitney and Lance's turnkey winners and losersManaging your property managerHandling an evictionThe role of cash reserves when buying turnkey propertiesThe "BRRRR-key" business modelAnd SO much more!Links from the ShowReal Estate Rookie Facebook GroupFelipe's InstagramAshley's InstagramBiggerPockets PodcastQuickbooksBiggerPockets CalculatorsDavid GreeneTurnkey ReviewsBiggerPocketsBiggerPockets ForumsAppfolioBuildiumZillowApartments.comFEMADeal Check StessaQuickbooksCheck the full show notes here: http://biggerpockets.com/rookie29

      <itunes:summary>Derek Tellier didn’t start investing in real estate until he was over 40. Unhappy with what was going on in his life, a friend plugged him into healthy eating, exercising, and long-distance running. Once his health was back on track, he realized he didn’t like the trajectory his life was on, and made major changes.

That same running friend introduced him to real estate investing. Derek got licensed, joined his friend’s real estate team, and bought his first real estate deal - a cabin that he rents out short-term in the Smoky Mountains.

Derek has parlayed that into a career, helping people invest in short term rentals in the Smoky Mountains

Derek’s Rookie Deal is a BRRRR property that needed a LOT of work. He financed it using private money and after his rehab he was able to pull out ALL of the money he had into the deal. It even cashflows $350 per month!

Derek has had some growing pains along the way, like a true real estate investor. He shares tips for finding contractors, finding lenders, and finding deals in this episode, along with discussing numbers and the importance of having reserves.

If you think you waited too late to start investing in real estate, this episode can help change your mindset and show you that it’s never too late to get started.

In This Episode We Cover:How a midlife crisis made him start investing in his 40sBuying short-term rentals during COVIDHow he funds deals using private moneyHis BRRRR strategyHow his mentor helped him get 7 deals in 6 monthsHow he got the word out there by starting his own meetupAnd SO much more!Links from the ShowReal Estate Rookie Facebook GroupFelipe's InstagramAshley's InstagramBiggerPockets PodcastRookie Podcast 23: From Dave Ramsey Disciple to No-Money-Down Real Estate Investor with Sarah BrandenbergerRookie Podcast 19: Going Full-Time as a Rookie Right Out of College With Arvi Carkanji and Dave ArlaudRookie Podcast 09: Finding Off-Market Deals, Step by Step with Ryan Dossey (Mentor) and Drew Wiard (Mentee)—Part 1Rookie Podcast 13: How Drew Pulled 6 Deals From His First Direct Mail Campaign With Ryan Dossey (Mentor) and Drew Wiard (Mentee)—Part 2BiggerPockets Podcast 364: Snowballing 6-Figure Short-Term Rental Profits Into Passive Investments with Avery CarlThe Short Term ShopAirbnbUberVrboBiggerPockets Podcast 352: No Driver’s License, No Money, No Excuses: How Diego Corzo Blazed a Trail to 18 DoorsThe Daily Stoic PodcastRyan HolidayCheck the full show notes here: http://biggerpockets.com/rookie26

      <itunes:summary>Curious how to manage a rental portfolio in your limited free time?

Learn from today's guest Ruben Galindo, who had his hands full managing hundreds of law enforcement officers in Texas... but didn't let that stop him.

Ruben is 48 years old, and in the past five years, he's acquired five rental properties that require about an hour of his time each week. In this episode, he'll teach you how he uses Cozy and Docusign to do everything virtually, how door knocking led to one of his best deals, and how he leverages his 401(k) in his real estate business.

Ruben didn't jump in until his 40s, but he already has experience with buying a foreclosure, helping a seller avoid foreclosure, a short sale, and a straightforward live-in flip (where he currently lives). Not bad for a relative rookie!

If you pick up any tips from Ruben or have questions for him, leave a comment in the show notes at biggerpockets.com/rookie22. And if you're feeling extra generous, leave us a rating and review in Apple Podcasts.

      <itunes:summary>In today's episode, you'll meet a power couple who both immigrated to the U.S. seven years ago and soon decided real estate would be their path to financial freedom.

Arvi Carkanji and Dave Arlaud are Nashville-based flipper-investors, who are dividing and conquering to run a successful business while building a stable of rental properties. Arvi handles acquisitions (listen for the Rookie Request Line about direct mail), while Dave is a licensed contractor who takes charge of construction.

Together they walk us through their approach to renovating houses and working with subcontractors and dive into the deal that motivated Arvi to quit her first (and quite possibly last) "real job."

If you're thinking about taking on "value-add" projects—and you probably should be—listen close to hear these two rookies walk us through their process!

In This Episode We Cover:How Arvi and Dave wound up as real estate investors just a year out of collegeHow they work with contractors, step by stepDave's "25-25-50" payment plan for contractorsThe different stages involved in renovating a houseRed flags to look for when inspecting workDue diligence and permitsTransforming a single-family home into a duplexRaising private money as a newbieRenting staging furniture from companies like Rent-A-CenterAnd SO much more!Links from the ShowReal Estate Rookie Facebook GroupFelipe's InstagramAshley's InstagramBiggerPockets PodcastRookie Podcast 09: Finding Off-Market Deals, Step by Step with Ryan Dossey (Mentor) and Drew Wiard (Mentee)—Part 1Rookie Podcast 13: How Drew Pulled 6 Deals From His First Direct Mail Campaign With Ryan Dossey (Mentor) and Drew Wiard (Mentee)—Part 2BiggerPockets ForumsRent-A-CenterRookie Podcast 15: 5 Steps to Reach Financial Freedom in 15 Years Through Long-Distance Investing With Elyse RasmussenRookie Podcast 17: 3 Rentals in His First Year &amp;amp; the Power of a Real-Life 'Rich Dad' Mentor with Derrick Ziglar Jr.Check the full show notes here: https://www.biggerpockets.com/rookie19

      <itunes:summary>Between his career and a podcasting side hustle, Robert Leonard's a busy guy. So how does he—and how can you—build a small but mighty rental portfolio in your spare time?

For Robert, it comes down to 4 major elements:

1. Use a series of house hacks to lower expenses and build equity.

2. Find an MVP real estate agent.

3. Align with a partner.

4. Invest out-of-state.

In this episode, Robert goes into detail on each of the above and explains how they helped him break through "analysis paralysis" in his early 20s. If you pick just one of these strategies and do it well, you'll be way ahead of the game. When you combine several, you're on your way to financial freedom.

Be sure to check out Robert's two podcasts, Millennial Investing and Real Estate Investing over on The Investor's Podcast Network, and subscribe to Real Estate Rookie so you won't miss our next show.

      <itunes:summary>OK, you've got a property under contract. Now the real work begins!

In today's episode, you'll learn all about about a crucial step in the home-buying process: home inspections.

Find out how they work, how much they cost, and how they could wind up saving you a boatload of cash—or help you negotiate a sweet deal!

Rose Buckley is a certified home inspector who has walked 1,000-plus homes. And with her background in teaching and translating, she enjoys breaking down this part of the business for up-and-coming investors.

Rose shares her tips for finding a great local inspector and reveals which defects are no biggie, which are challenging, and which ones can be "deal killers."

And yes. We, too, noticed Rose is a female in a male-dominated profession. That led to a great discussion about how she approaches that challenge, how sometimes it's actually an opportunity, and why training as a home inspector—regardless of your gender—may get you closer to your investing goals.

      <itunes:summary>Tony Robinson had every excuse NOT to invest.

Expensive local market? Demanding full-time job? Family responsibilities?

Check, check, and check.

So, how did he pull off his first two deals in a cash flow-friendly market 1,500 miles away?

Today, Tony spills the beans: how he got a bank to loan him 100% of purchase AND rehab cost, how he managed contractors from afar, two crucial lessons he learned on his first deal, and much more.

Tony shares tip after tip for investors like you—especially if you live in a pricey area (he lives in Southern California and invests in Shreveport, Louisiana).

Plus, he dives into the mindset shifts that helped him break through—and how becoming a father at a young age led to a goal of achieving financial independence.

      <itunes:summary>Can't find deals on the MLS? Dreaming about off-market deals, but not sure how to go after them?

Today's show lays out a step-by-step, repeatable strategy for those of you who have what it takes to approach homeowners directly. It's not easy. It takes patience. And It costs money (or time). But for those precise reasons, it's where the real money is.

Today we bring in Drew Wiard, a Fort Wayne, IN investor with a family and a full-time job. He's joined by his mentor, Ryan Dossey, a former BiggerPockets Podcast guest who built his 100+ unit portfolio by creating a pipeline of off-market deals.

The guys walk us through how to build a brand that stands out from the competition, how to establish authority online, and how to pull lists full of juicy leads. This is not vague advice... they reveal the exact systems and resources they're using to find and contact sellers (not all of whom fit the "desperate/distressed" stereotype, by the way)!

Plus, we have a great conversation about mentoring in general – how to find and vet teachers, how to deliver value, and how to hold one another accountable along the way.

This is actually Part 1 in a series; we're going to invite Drew and Ryan back next month to tackle the second piece of this puzzle: handling leads, negotiating with sellers, and crafting your exit strategy.

If you think you have what it takes to find off-market deals, this episode is a perfect starting point. Be sure to subscribe to the show in your favorite app, and we'll see you next Wednesday!

      <itunes:summary>Banks tend to love a certain type of borrower... and Mallori and Lucas don't quite fit the mold.

They're not 9-to-5ers. They rely on tips and seasonal work. And they live modestly but aren't swimming in cash. So, when they took the plunge into real estate investing—in pricey Tacoma, Washington—they had some work to do to become "bankable."

Today you'll learn how despite a few roadblocks, they dumped their rent payment and pulled off their first-ever home purchase: a house hack in an up-and-coming area. From shopping around between banks, to securing a "rehire" letter to verify employment, to negotiating "early access" to the property and doing some repairs before closing, this episode is full of great tips for those just starting out.

        <![CDATA[<p>Banks tend to love a certain type of borrower... and <strong>Mallori</strong> and <strong>Lucas</strong> don't quite fit the mold.</p><p>They're not 9-to-5ers. They rely on tips and seasonal work. And they live modestly but aren't swimming in cash. So, when they took the plunge into real estate investing—in pricey Tacoma, Washington—they had some work to do to become "bankable."</p><p>Today you'll learn how despite a few roadblocks, they dumped their rent payment and pulled off their first-ever home purchase: a house hack in an up-and-coming area. From shopping around between banks, to securing a "rehire" letter to verify employment, to negotiating "early access" to the property and doing some repairs <em>before</em> closing, this episode is full of great tips for those just starting out.</p><p>Also—it's a reminder that "sweat equity" doesn't always mean physical labor.

      <itunes:summary>Today we tackle the often-overlooked -- but perhaps most important -- element of real estate investing: actually placing a (great!) resident in your property.

Our guest Lucas Hall built website Landlordology.com (which he later sold to Cozy, where he now works) and is an expert on best practices for landlords self-managing small portfolios (that's you!).

Lucas walks us through his exact process from the moment he lists a property for rent, to the moment he signs a lease -- AND explains what's changed (and what hasn't) since the COVID-19 outbreak began.

Want to avoid evictions and vacancy? Listen up...⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Lucas has been a landlord for 10+ years, owns 4 properties across 3 states. Yet he still hasn't had to evict anybody. That's not an accident; it's the result of a firm but fair process he follows every time there's a vacancy.

Plus, we add a fun twist toward the end of the episode when a rookie investor -- Andrés Bustamante -- jumps on the call to ask some GREAT questions about his own current search for a tenant.

This is a timeless episode that will be just as relevant years in the future. Check it out now, and subscribe to Real Estate Rookie so you won't miss the next one.

See you next Wednesday!

In This Episode We Cover: 

- The importance of "pre-screening" over the phone

- Online tools to run background and credit checks

- Why you should always check an applicant's social media profiles

- The income-to-rent ratio Lucas uses to qualify tenants 

- Why gathering social security numbers is overrated

- Photo ID checks

- Where to find classes on how to be a fair, ethical landlord

- How to follow fair housing laws

- What Lucas thinks of "cash for keys"

- Whether to accept pre-payment of rent

- Co-signing/guarantor arrangements when a tenant has no income

- How to show properties during the COVID-19 quarantine

- Handling late and non-payment of rent

And much more!

      <itunes:summary>Yes, newbies ARE still closing deals out there.

This week, we talk to three up-and-coming investors who either recently closed or are currently under contract on investment properties. 

Despite entire parts of the economy being shut down, real estate continues to be classified as "essential" -- and Jeremy Goldizen (Avon, OH), Kristen Johnson (Columbia, SC), and Rafael Estrada (Denver, CO) are all taking advantage. 

This episode was streamed as a Facebook live, so our audience pitches in and puts some timely questions to our guests and hosts. 

How did Jeremy score a 55% discount on a house he plans to BRRRR?

How did Kristen find the wholesaler who brought her the perfect rental property?

And how did Rafael shift his strategy when coronavirus hit and flipping no longer looked like such a great idea?

Hit play, and get answers to all those questions and more.

Next week, we'll be talking about how to screen and work with tenants in the current environment. 

You won't want to miss that one... so subscribe to Real Estate Rookie in your favorite podcast app, and we'll see you next Wednesday!

      <itunes:summary>It's a new week... and, seemingly, a new world.

So -- we've got a new (and very fresh) episode for you... with a twist on our usual format.

On Tuesday, March 17, Ashley and Felipe sat down with Joe Asamoah and Steve Rozenberg to discuss the topic on everyone's mind: the COVID-19 outbreak and its inevitable impact on real estate investors.

Think of it as a virtual coaching session with two seasoned, successful investors who have withstood several downturns and lived to tell about it.

Joe and Steve have a combined 50 years of experience under their belts, so they offer a valuable perspective to younger or less experienced investors -- our fearless co-hosts included -- who haven't yet seen a full real estate cycle.

This episode covers it all -- from the mindset successful investors use to accelerate wealth-building through downswings, to the shifting competition you're likely to face, to how to whip your finances into shape and secure lines of credit BEFORE you need them.

Plus -- Joe breaks down how renting to Section 8 voucher holders can be a lifeline during a recession (assuming you do a few things exactly right), and Steve shares his tips for designing systems and checklists (he's a pilot after all!) so you can think clearly... even when you're steering into economic headwinds.

This episode is GOLD for investors on the hunt for their first, second, or third deal in 2020... Stay safe, everyone -- and we'll see you next Wednesday.




In This Episode We Cover:Why the first thing we should all do is "take a breath"The importance of a well-thought-out business planLearning from local investors who thrived during past crashesWhy you're likely to see more flippers leasing out housesWhy taking out a HELOC may make sense right nowTreating tenants like customers to reduce turnoverWhy Joe believes "your tenant is the true asset"What Steve learned from 9/11 and Hurricane HarveyLearning from your own (and others') failuresAnd SO much more!

      <itunes:summary>Ever felt like you're close to breaking into real estate investing, but not quite getting anywhere?




Today's guest, Tim Goutos, was right there with you. But after taking a trip abroad to clear his head, Tim narrowed his focus and went ALL-OUT in pursuit of his first deal.




He talked to everybody about his goal. He went driving for dollars in his hometown of Lake George, NY. Then, after seeing a For Sale By Owner (FSBO) sign, he called the owner on the spot.




What happened next? You'll hear the story in today's episode of the Real Estate Rookie Podcast.




We'll cover how to manage fear when making a cold call, how to crunch the numbers using government tax records, and how to protect yourself against the worst-case scenario.




Plus -- if you know anyone who got burned in 2007-08.. or worry you'll meet the same fate... you'll connect with Tim's story. He had a close relative who lost out in the last downturn, so he had every reason to stay far away. Instead, Tim learned all he could and put together a more conservative game plan.




"Captain Tim" is a relatable, down-to-earth guy... and you can learn a lot from his approach of looking to "get on base" rather than hit a home run right away.

      <itunes:summary>How will YOU transition from the "getting educated" phase to taking direct action toward your real estate goals?

Start by taking cues from Lauren and Kyle!

In this premiere episode, they share how they powered through their initial hesitation to build a "small but mighty" rental portfolio in less than 3 years' time... a portfolio that has them well on their way to a life of financial freedom (and maybe even a "boat house!").

You'll love their tips for identifying the right market for you, minimizing risk by house hacking, and leveraging your local meetup group to get the scoop on real estate trends in your area.

Plus, they guide us through their first "true" BRRRR deal—sharing lessons from their experience negotiating directly with a seller, firing a contractor, and finding time to DIY a lot of the renovation, all while juggling two full-time careers.

Lauren and Kyle may seem like sophisticated investors now. But in 2017, they were right where a lot of you are today. By following their roadmap and adjusting it to your market, you too can build a mini-empire that funds the life you dream about.
