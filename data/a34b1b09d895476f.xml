  <description><![CDATA[<div>The COVID-19 pandemic, Russian invasion of Ukraine, energy crisis and the resulting high inflation have created new worries about inequality on both sides of the atlantic. Labour markets and occupations have gone through profound changes as a result of technological progress, globalisation and changes to labour market institutions, among many other factors. In this episode of the Sound of Economics, Giuseppe Porcaro hosts Indivar Dutta-Gupta, President &amp; Executive Director, CLASP Center for Law and Social Policy, and István György Tóth, Director of Tarki Social Research Institute, for a conversation about the evolving nature of inequality on both sides of the Atlantic, what are the drivers of this wedge and what policy tools are needed to address it.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In July 2022, by the time the European Central Bank (ECB) lifted its deposit rate from negative to zero, headline inflation in the euro area had reached 8.9%. Irrespective of the drivers of inflation – a temporary supply shock or lasting demand shock – it is shocking that a central bank with a price stability mandate keeps its main interest rate negative while inflation accelerates that much.</div>
<br>
<div>Something clearly went wrong. With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to say that the ECB made mistakes. But should the ECB have acted differently, given the information available at the time of its monetary policy meetings? </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div> China’s GDP growth plummeted to only 0.4% YoY in Q2 2022, the worse performance after Q1 2020 when the first wave of COVID-19 hit Wuhan. Apart from the economic turbulence, a major political event to look out for is the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, to be held on 16 October 2022. What should we expect from this gathering and what economic impact will it have? <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/people/giuseppe-porcaro">Giuseppe Porcaro</a> discusses with <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/people/alicia-garcia-herrero">Alicia García-Herrero</a> and <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/people/sitao-xu">XU Sitao</a>. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Independent work, self-employment and the gig economy have been evolving in the past decade, changing our understanding of traditional employment.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Drawing lessons from the ongoing shortages in chip supply, the United States, China and the European Union are adopting industrial policies to secure semiconductor supply chains as well as economic and technological competitiveness.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>2022 marks the 50th anniversary of the normalisation of diplomatic relations between Japan and China. As the world’s third largest economy, Japan cannot neglect the importance of economic and trade relations with China, despite tensions between two countries. How does Japan manage its economic proximity with China under the circumstances? Can Europe learn from Japan when it comes to juggling close economic relations with China when relations are bad?<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/giuseppe-porcaro/">Giuseppe Porcaro</a> and <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/alicia-garcia-herrero/">Alicia García-Herrero</a> are joined by <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/yoshikazu-kato/">Yoshikazu Kato</a>, Director of Trans-Pacific Group Institute and Research Fellow at Rakuten Securities Economic Research Institute, to talk about how Europe is seen by Japan and China, what Europe can learn from Japan’s economic relations with China and to explore the possibility of a common approach to China. <br>

<a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/guntram-b-wolff/">Guntram Wolff</a> is joined by <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/mark-leonard/">Mark Leonard</a>, director of the European Council of Foreign Relations, to discuss his new book: The Age of Unpeace: how connectivity causes conflict. In his new book, Leonard argues a rather new and unique point: living in a globalised world creates new vulnerabilities due to this interconnection, and thus gives rise to unpeace. Guntram and Leonard explore how connectivity has caused fragmentation, the concept of unpeace, how we've gotten here, and what the EU should do moving forward.</div>

 A wave of government regulations is being imposed on China’s digital sector, from gaming platforms to GDPR-like privacy regulations, to a draft regulation cracking down on recommendation algorithms.

The concept of “common prosperity” has deep roots in the Chinese Communist Party. It was already used in the 1950s and the late 1970s under different leaderships. On August 17 2021, President Xi Jinping highlighted this concept again, calling for China to achieve "common prosperity", seeking to narrow a yawning wealth gap that threatens the country's economic ascent and the legitimacy of Communist Party rule. Since then, there have been simultaneous crackdowns on business sectors and individuals, many of which fall under the umbrella of ‘common prosperity’.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Sustainable investing is gaining in popularity as socially conscious clients consider environmental, societal and governance (ESG) criteria when deciding on potential investment. As a result, the financial world is offering more ESG compatible products on the market.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>While well intentioned, the ability and capacity of ESG criteria in corporate disclosure to achieve climate and social goals is questionable.

<br>

</div>
<div>Today on The Sound of Economics, we're asking the big questions. In order to find answers, our own <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/giuseppe-porcaro/">Giuseppe Porcaro</a> hosts <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/aaron-benanav/">Aaron Benanav</a>, recent author of Automation and the Future of Work. Benanav argues that the "rise of the robots" may not really explain future employment crises, or our failure to move into a post-scarcity era.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Meanwhile, Bruegel Research Fellow <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/laura-nurski/">Laura Nurski</a> adds insight from her own research at Bruegel's <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/the-future-of-work-and-inclusive-growth-project/">Future of work and inclusive growth</a> project, and <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/alexis-moraitis/">Alexis Moraitis</a> at Lancaster University considers how advances in technology could impact the international political economy.<br>

<br>

</div>
<div>In this episode of The Sound of Economics, Bruegel’s Director Guntram Wolff and Bruegel Senior fellow Andre Sapir and Simone Tagliapietra walk you through the 13 proposals and hundreds of pages designed to ensure the continent meets the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 55 percent in 2030 and net zero by 2050, compared with 1990 levels. How ambitious are the goals? How should they be distributed among the citizens, businesses and countries of the EU? How stringent should a new carbon border adjustment be?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>‘Technological change is revolutionising the workplace’, ‘the future is automated’ and ‘a robot will be doing my work before long’ are phrases we hear a lot when it comes to discussing the impact of technological advancement on the labour market and skills.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>As the only global international organisation dealing with the rules of trade between nations, the World Trade Organisation should be the place where governments sort out the trade problems they face with each other. However, in recent years, WTO members have not managed to conclude new agreements to liberalise trade in goods and services. The organisation has not played a significant role in defusing and addressing the trade conflict between the US and China. It was also largely ‘missing in action’ during the first stages of the global COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>All these lead to the conclusion that reform is necessary – whether the political will exists to re engage multilaterally and pursue it is another question.

Since 2010, the landscape of China’s largest companies has shifted away from the dominance of state-owned enterprises towards a more diverse and complex landscape with an increasing number of mixed-ownership enterprises and non-public enterprises.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>This evolution, however, has been far from linear with Chinese private companies facing several challenges. In this episode, <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/weijian-shan/">SHAN Weijian</a>, Chairman and CEO of PAG, joins <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/giuseppe-porcaro/">Giuseppe Porcaro</a> and <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/alicia-garcia-herrero/">Alicia García-Herrero</a> from Hong Kong, to share his insights on how the private sector has progressed and the road ahead.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>European strategic autonomy is probably the single most used watchword in European circles, if only because of lack of consensus about what it entails. US bashing for some, a more confident and independent EU for others, the concept has well and truly moved out of the security and defence area into every area of EU policy. This is most apparent in the debate around the international role of the euro, where institutional thinking has shifted fast in the past couple of years. Is it inevitable?<br>

China’s growing economic power is causing great anxiety in the West: European regulators are tightening the rules on takeovers by Chinese state-owned giants, while the United States is imposing aggressive sanctions on leading Chinese technology firms such as Huawei, ByteDance (TikTok) and Tencent (WeChat).<br>

They were able to discuss the uneven recovery from the pandemic. In the latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF warns that even though the global economy is on firmer ground, recoveries are diverging dangerously across and within countries, as economies with slower vaccine rollout, more limited policy support, and more reliance on tourism do less well.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Global prospects remain highly uncertain one year into the pandemic. The outlook depends not just on the outcome of the battle between the virus and vaccines—it also hinges on how effectively economic policies deployed under high uncertainty can limit lasting damage from this unprecedented crisis.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Before the pandemic, Africa was experiencing unprecedented economic growth and poverty reduction.

<br>

</div>
<div>In both Europe and the United States, interest rates have been declining for more than fifteen years. For much of this period, real interest rates have been negative and they are expected to remain negative for at least another decade. The literature associates this decline in interest rates with a similarly protracted decline in productivity. But the decline in productivity appears paradoxical given major technological advances.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>The structural factors behind the downward pressure on interest rates imply that macroeconomic policy will have a reduced role in managing aggregate demand. Monetary policy in the euro area will be more about preventing financial fragmentation and less about stimulating demand. Equally, fiscal policy will have more of a supporting rather than stimulating role.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Tackling the structural decline in market dynamism and therefore in real rates will require structural policies to reduce market power globally and ensure the creation of capital markets in the EU.</div>

<div>The middle-income trap describes a situation in which a country, having attained a certain income level, gets stuck there (due to given advantages). The high-income trap is of a similar nature, because although the positioning of these economies might be more advantageous to begin with, they find it difficult to promote innovation in manufacturing or upgrade to higher value-added services to remain competitive and provide benefits to a wider spectrum of society.<br>
<br>

<div>In this episode of The Sound of Economics, <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/giuseppe-porcaro/">Giuseppe Porcaro</a> and <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/alicia-garcia-herrero/">Alicia García-Herrero</a> are joined by <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/syaru-shirley-lin/">Syaru Shirley Lin</a>, Compton Visiting Professor in World Politics at the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia. They discuss the middle/high-income trap in East Asia, and especially in China. Is the high-income trap different between East Asia and Western Europe, especially in terms of their economic relationship with China? How has COVID-19 changed the economic landscape?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Central bankers now seem keen to take on responsibility for policy objectives they have previously shied away from – in particular, tackling climate change. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde acknowledged in January that central bankers will have to look beyond their traditional duties to address the challenge. ECB Executive Board Member Isabel Schnabel said in September 2020 that central banks should be an active part of the collective effort to reduce carbon emissions. Executive Board Member Fabio Panetta said ECB analysis can help make climate-risk valuations more accurate.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Should central banks continue accommodating corporate bonds and bank loans of high carbon companies as collateral, or should they reduce them?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Across the Atlantic, EU member states have been discussing a recovery plan since last spring, striking an agreement over the summer to create a €750 billion pandemic recovery fund. Hard-pressed EU capitals must now submit detailed plans to Brussels to unlock their share of the cash and begin rebooting their economies. One such country is Italy, where an ambitious once in a generation plan is being drawn up to spend €200 billion to relaunch an anemic economy. The hope is that by pushing through unpalatable reforms together with funds underwritten by 27 member states, that an economy that has not grown in real terms for over two decades can be jump started. Bruegel has been tracking the national recovery plans that states have been submitting to Brussels to unlock funds, and plans to release an overview soon. <br>

<a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/giuseppe-porcaro/">Giuseppe Porcaro</a> is joined by Bruegel scholars <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/carlo-altomonte/">Carlo Altomonte</a>, <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/maria-demertzis/">Maria Demertzis</a> and <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/zsolt-darvas/">Zsolt Darvas</a> to discuss economic stimulus and its implications. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The European Green Deal is a plan to decarbonise the EU economy by 2050, revolutionise the EU’s energy system, profoundly transform the economy and inspire efforts to combat climate change. But the plan will also have profound geopolitical repercussions and is likely to impact partner countries adversely. In the latest <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/2021/02/the-geopolitics-of-the-european-green-deal/">paper</a> co-written by Bruegel and the European Council on Foreign Relations, the authors map out the geopolitical implications and lay out a foreign policy agenda to manage the geopolitical aspects of the European Green Deal and lead climate change efforts globally. In this episode of The Sound of Economics, co-authors Jeremy Shapiro of the European Council on Foreign Relations, as well as Jean Pisani Ferry, Simone Tagliapietra and Guntram Wolff of Bruegel introduce their paper and give their insight on this issue.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On 30 November 2020 after over 7 years of talks, the European Union and China concluded negotiations for a Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI for short).<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>The agreement is intended to increase investment between the EU and China by establishing a legal framework and common rules on issues ranging from state-owned enterprises to subsidy transparency and rules against the forced transfer of technologies. The deal replaces more than two dozen bilateral investment treaties between the EU’s 27 member states and China, improving market access for European companies operating — or intending to operate — in China and ensuring a level playing field and reciprocity when they do.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Does the agreement actually live up to the above claims and seven years of expectation? To help us find out, in this episode of the Sound of Economics <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/giuseppe-porcaro/">Giuseppe Porcaro</a> is joined by <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/?author_name=bert-hofman">Bert Hofman</a>, the director of the East Asian Institute at National University of Singapore and Bruegel’s China expert <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/author/alicia-garcia-herrero/">Alicia García-Herrero</a>, for a in depth commentary and glance at what the detail of the deal means for Europe.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Poland is sometimes characterised as the black sheep of EU climate policy: in 2019, more than 70 percent of the country’s electricity was generated by coal. In the meantime, it is closing down coal mines and discussing building a nuclear power plant in order to diversify its energy supplies. What is Poland’s climate policy and how is it evolving? Is the idea of Poland’s characterisation as a scapegoat of the failure of international climate ambitions misleading?<br>

</div>
<div>They try to understand the geopolitical role of money, in other words, currencies and capital flows. While unconstrained capital flows cause afflictions of the global economy, the current debate on currencies is in fact driven by politics rather than economics, as Alicia argued in an opinion piece recently: <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/2020/10/politics-not-economics-demands-a-strengthened-international-role-for-the-euro/">Politics, not economics, demands a strengthened international role for the euro</a>.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Climate transition is hotly debated in EU circles as it impacts all areas of policy: from the ambitious climate targets set by the President of the European Commission with the European Green Deal, to the discussions of the next budget of the Union and the recovery plan from the current pandemic.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>The topic is especially important for 2021 with a new US administration more likely to engage on climate change, a commitment for carbon neutrality in 40 years by China and the delayed COP26 under the leadership (or not) of the United Kingdom. Any European debate is certain to have an important impact on a regional and national level, but will also influence the global trajectory of climate policy.<br>
<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The economy of the euro area is forecast to contract by 8.7% in 2020 but grow by 6.1% in 2021. The drop in GDP in 2009, the worst year of the financial crisis, was just over 5%. There is no doubt that the drop we face today is much more significant, although it is expected to be short-lived with a sharp bounce back. However, all EU countries are currently going through a second COVID-19 wave exponentially worse than the first in terms of number of infections, albeit with fewer deaths (so far). Who knows what the real hit to the economy will be, and indeed how long it will be before we can resume normality?<br>
<br>
In this episode of the Sound of Economics, Giuseppe Porcaro is joined by Bruegel deputy director Maria Demertzis, and Nicola Viegi, Professor of Monetary Economics at the University of Pretoria, who is based in South Africa. They will explore the theme of uncertainty, highlighted by the pandemic, and how to plan policy interventions, especially monetary policy, in this climate of uncertainty.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Maria Demertzis and Marta Domínguez-Jiménez, Bruegel research analyst have recently published a paper for the European Parliament on the topic, looking at the challenges faced by the European Central Bank: ‘Monetary policy in the time of COVID-19, or how uncertainty is here to stay’: <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/2020/11/monetary-policy-in-the-time-of-covid-19-or-how-uncertainty-is-here-to-stay/">https://www.bruegel.org/2020/11/monetary-policy-in-the-time-of-covid-19-or-how-uncertainty-is-here-to-stay/</a>

</div>
<div>Bruegel fellows from around the world - Uri Dadush, based in Washington DC; Alicia Garcia-Herrero based in Hong Kong and Suman Bery based in India, bring their knowledge and geopolitical expertise to a heated discussion on this deal, hosted by director Guntram Wolff.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Following Biden's victory in the US presidential election, what will the transatlantic relationship look like? Would it be a big relief, or nothing much will change? And will we see a shift from ‘America first’ to ‘buy American’? <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>This week Bruegel director Guntram Wolff is joined by Esther de Lange MEP, Vice Chair of the European People's Party Group, to talk us through what this all means for Europe, and more importantly for its place in the world. What next for European strategic autonomy? How will this affect climate policies? How can EU level the playing field while not getting squeezed by the US and China?<br>
<br>
With Mrs de Lange’s experience within the Delegation for relations with the People's Republic of China, we also discuss that, as the US is trying to decouple economically with China, what would be the right strategy for Europe?</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Taxation is one of the few areas of financial policy which the general public has great interest in, as it affects their everyday life directly. But when we talk about it on a European level, it has much to do with tax distortion and competition in the single market.<br>
<br>
In this episode of The Sound of Economics, Bruegel director Guntram Wolff is joined by Sven Giegold MEP from the European Green Party. Giegold envisions a European common tax space, where minimum tax rates will be applied on a European level. They also discuss tax reporting regulations for large corporations, VAT reform, and how the Commission, European Financial Intelligence Unit and potentially a European financial police force can target money laundering and financial crime.</div>

<div>Rebecca and Scott will walk us through the most crucial domestic topics, from voter suppression to shrinking republican demographic, from the covid-19 pandemic to US healthcare system. On international issues, they look at the approaches the two administrations will likely take on climate, trade, data privacy, as well as financial regulations. While a Biden presidency might be the hope to reinitiate sensible discussions and restore alliance and partnerships, a Trump administration will very much likely continue its path on isolationism.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this episode of The Sound of Economics, we invite Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan to talk about their most recent book: 'The Great Demographic Reversal’. They argue that trends in demography and globalisation, especially the stunning rise of China combining both, have greatly weakened labour bargaining power and led to subsequent disinflation, inequality and falling interest rates. But just as these demographic and globalisation trends are now reversing, labour bargaining power will rise again, bringing with it more inflation, less inequality and rising interest rates. The coronavirus pandemic will only accelerate this reversal.<br>
Bruegel scholars Maria Demertzis and Guntram Wolff join the authors for a conversation on ageing societies, waning inequality, as well as an inflation revival.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On 15-16 October the European Council will take stock of the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and review the state of the negotiations on the future EU-UK partnership. Leaders will discuss preparatory work for all scenarios after 1 January 2021. The timetable is very tight, with October seen as the last deadline for reaching an agreement that could then be ratified in time for entry into force by the end of the current transition period.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In this live recording session of The Sound of Economics, Bruegel’s scholars took a step back and provided the background, as well as outline the key issues at stake necessary to follow the discussions at the Council and understand the ongoing negotiations. We also engaged in an informed debate with the audience on the post-Brexit scenarios.<br>
<br>
 The podcast host, Giuseppe Porcaro, was joined by Maria Demertzis, André Sapir, and Guntram Wolff.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The European Union recovery fund could greatly increase the stability of the bloc and its monetary union. But the fund needs clearer objectives, sustainable growth criteria and close monitoring so that spending achieves its goals and is free of corruption. In finalising the fund, the EU should take the time to design a strong governance mechanism.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In this episode, Guntram Wolff, director of Bruegel, is joined by MEP Luis Garicano, vice president of Renew Europe, who is also an economist and was heavily involved in the discussion on Next Generation EU, the new recovery instrument that the EU proposed for the Recovery and Resilience Facility. On this topic, they discuss the key concerns on how to ensure EU-borrowed money will be well-spent by the member states. MEP Garicano shares his insights from the Parliament of where this debate currently stands.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this episode, we propose a full lecture about the future of globalisation by Dani Rodrik, Professor of International Political Economy, at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, of Harvard University.  </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Rodrik argues that the model of hyper globalization we have been pursuing is unsustainable and that we have an opportunity to embark on a sounder, healthier globalisation. And he outlines his views on what such a globalisation might look like.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The Lecture took place during the Bruegel Annual Meetings and it was followed by a lively discussion between Dani Rodrik and André Sapir, who is a Senior Fellow at Bruegel, which we have recorded and included in this podcast. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This is the last episode of the summer feature of the Sound of Economics recorded as part of the Reopening Europe project.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Between the 12th and the 27th of June, we traveled over 2700 kilometres through the Netherlands, Germany, France, Austria, Slovenia and Italy to collect voices from the ground during the weeks when the borders were reopening after the COVID-19 spring lockdown.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since the start of summer, the pandemic has continued to ravage the globe, and in Europe we are currently seeing a resurgence of infections. The next few months continue to be uncertain in terms of medical and economic consequences. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Given this context, the Reopening Europe project assumes additional layers: documenting the seemingly ephemeral moment of the summer reopenings, and reflecting about the hopes and wishes of Europeans at a unique moment. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>That is why, in this concluding episode of this feature, we reflect about the future. Not as an escapist wishful thinking, but as an attempt to start re-imagining a society, an economy and politics cohabiting with the virus and eventually overcoming it.   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>For this reflection Giuseppe Porcaro is joined by Bruegel’s senior scholar Alicia Garcia Herrero and Rutger Sjögrim, the architect that built the space ship featured in the movie Aniara (2018), and member of the Secretary studio in Stockholm. </div>

<br>
In this latest installment of our summer series on Reopening Europe's trip across Europe at a unique moment, Giuseppe is in conversation with Ivo Tarantino, Head of Public Affairs &amp; Media Relations at Altroconsumo, the largest independent and non-party political consumers’ organisation in Italy.<br>

How much each country has gained from belonging to the EU’s single market? How much would it have missed out on if it didn’t belong to the single market?<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In this week’s episode, we will look at the economic impact of the EU's last enlargement and ask who benefited the most: the old 15 or the new 13 members?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this episode we discuss financial fragility in European households in the time of COVID-19. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Before the pandemic hit, a substantial share of households reported that they would be unable to handle a financial emergency. In some EU countries, many had savings equivalent to just a few weeks of basic consumption.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Giuseppe is joined by Maria Demertzis, deputy director at Bruegel, and Anna Maria Lusardi, Academic Director of the George Washington University Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center who have authored a <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/2020/07/the-financial-fragility-of-european-households-in-the-time-of-covid-19/">paper published by Bruegel</a> on the topic</div>
<div>

What did they find out, about how households finances have been impacted by the pandemic so far? <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Since the end of May and throughout the month of June, many European Countries have lifted or loosened the lockdown measures set in place to fight the spread of the virus. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>One of the last measures still in place is the closure of international borders, which to some extent brought back to the memory a closed Europe, and border checkpoints, which many of our listeners that born after 1989 probably bene experienced, at least on the scale we have had. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>As this is somewhat an atypical and historical moment, we are going to embark in a peculiar journey, starting on Friday 12 June. Bruegel is supporting a project driving across 7 Countries and more that 2.500 kilometres to collect facts about how the border closure affected the economy and society, take a “temperature reading” of the perceptions of people, and make an analysis out of it. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>It is an exciting endeavour that sees Bruegel on the road, after these months of lockdown and countless zoom livestreams. It will provide a snapshot of the impact on the ground also of the European policies which we are more of a commonplace in our studies and in this podcast. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>You will be able to follow us on the road on the Bruegel channels, as well as the project website <a href="http://www.reopeningeurope.com/">www.reopeningeurope.com</a> </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This episode provides a background overview of the impact of the reopening on European value chains, future of work, and innovation. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The euro is, by definition an international currency. However, since being established in the late 90s the single currency has always been somewhat less than the sum of it's parts and has yet to challenge the US dollar for global dominance. Its international status declined with the euro crisis of 2008. <br>
<br>
Could the reform of the institutional setup of the monetary union that many are arguing for in the wake of the covid-19 crisis boost the euro's status as a global currency?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The pandemic is hurting emerging economies in at least three ways: by locking down their populations, damaging their export earnings and deterring foreign capital. Even if the pandemic will fade in the second half of the year, gdp in developing countries, measured at purchasing-power parity, will be 6.6% smaller in 2020 than the IMF had forecast in October.<br>
<br>
In this episode we dig into the topic and sketch the possible tools that emerging economies can use to face the liquidity crisis.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>China’s financial sector has grown massively in size and has become systemically important. In addition, it has also become much more complex with increasing systemic risk.

 The cyclical -beyond the structural – deceleration that the Chinese economy is undergoing is one of the key risks that the Chinese financial system is facing. At the same time, China has decided to open up its financial sector to foreign competition. What can foreign banks expect to find? Should they grab this opportunity? Giuseppe Pocarro is joined by independent economist Gary Liu and Bruegel Senior Fellow, Alicia García-Herrero.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>COVID-19 has triggered a severe recession and policymakers in European Union countries are providing generous, largely indiscriminate, support to companies. As the recession gets deeper, a more comprehensive strategy is needed. This should be based on four principles: viability of supported entities, fairness, achieving societal goals, and giving society a share in future profits. The effort should be structured around equity and recovery funds with borrowing at EU level.<br>
<em><br>
In this episode we discuss the proposal for a recovery plan outlined in a recent paper by Julia Anderson, Simone Tagliapietra and Guntram Wolff which can be read here <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/2020/05/rebooting-europe-a-framework-for-a-post-covid-19-economic-recovery/">https://www.bruegel.org/2020/05/rebooting-europe-a-framework-for-a-post-covid-19-economic-recovery/</a> <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>After its longest meeting ever, the Eurogroup reached an agreement yesterday evening. What does the agreement say? What does it mean in terms of the emergency reaction to the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic? What does it mean, more broadly, for the future of Europe? This week, Giuseppe Porcaro is joined by Maria Demertzis, André Sapir and Guntram Wolff to discuss whether the Eurogroup can save the day.<br>
<br>
<em>This podcast is a member of the </em><a href="https://www.bullemedia.eu/europod"><em>Europod network</em></a><em>. <br>
<br>
</em>The podcast started by the participants giving their view on the deal that was closed last night by the Eurogroup. Guntram Wolff noted that is was good to have a deal, even if it is small in his view. André Sapir also expressed reserved satisfaction for the deal. He was however not surprised, as more could only come from the heads of state and that it is part of the Eurogroup’s habits to increase firepower over time. Maria Demertzis found it is surprising that the longest ever Eurogroup meeting led to such a small result and though this was a bad signal. She did agree with her co-panellists that some agreement was better than no agreement in this case.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Jumping into the debate, the panellists were asked to reflect on what the measures meant in more detail. André Sapir started by mentioning that of the €540 billion announced, about half (€240 billion) would be provided by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), each Member State would have access to a credit line equivalent to 2% of their GDP. He added that it was clear however that not all Member States would use the ESM credit line making the €240 billion a maximum rather than the actual amount deployed. Guntram Wolff agreed with this and noted that the ESM was after all a stopgap in case borrowing from the markets became less accessible for a certain country. He added that the ESM package also reflected a movement towards a larger role for fiscal policy in the Euro Zone which was positive. In addition, he noted that it was still the ECB, which through its interventions, is keeping the yields of countries like Italy down and allows them to implement ambitious economic support packages. On the same line, Maria Demertzis agreed and stated that while countries like the Netherlands and Germany do not need ESM credit lines, even countries such as Italy or Span might not use them, as they do not which to be subjected to the conditionality that is attached to it. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Afterwards, the panel went on to discuss the other measures that were part of the package agreed upon by the Eurogroup. Maria Demertzis expressed her satisfaction about the common unemployment insurance, temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE), which putting aside its relatively small size, is a step in the right direction. Indeed, it provides an automatic stabilizer and could set a good precedent. André Sapir expressed more reservation about whether SURE would one day become a permanent tool, given that its temporary nature is clear in the text. Guntram Wolff agreed that SURE was a good tool as it operates through credit guarantees and through the Commission’s budget. This means that money could be better directed at countries that need it the most. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The panellists followingly discussed issues related to the Italian economy and whether this would lead to debt sustainability issues. Guntram Wolff mentioned that the economic downturn in Italy is likely to be huge, not so much because it was badly affected by the pandemic, but because tourism represents a large share of its economy. He did not think, however, that Italian debt would become unsustainable, at least not as long as yields remained low thanks to the ECB. He therefore argued that Italy should have a large economic support programme. Maria Demertzis was less convinced that Italy did not run any debt sustainability risks due to the current crisis. She noted that while yields mattered, the stock of debt and economic growth were also key determinants of debt sustainability. While the ECB would have to roll over Italian debt indefinitely and probably further expand its Italian debt holdings, low growth could still lead to a bad equilibrium. She called for a deeper reflection into options to monetize debt in order to keep it sustainable. Guntram Wolff agreed and added that the real limits were political and legal in this discussion. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The panellists were asked to conclude with some final thoughts. André Sapir noted that it was important to keep in mind the needs of non-Euro Zone EU Member States, even if they appeared less affect by the pandemic for the moment. Maria focused on a quote from the final text of the agreement that she was positive about: “a response commensurate with the size of crisis”.  She explained that it was reflective of the new awareness of the Eurogroup about the urgency of the situation. Guntram Wolff concluded with two final remarks. First, that one should not only look at the size of the Eurogroup’s package but rather at the size of fiscal support at a national level. Second, although the idea of a federal Europe seems desirable it remains distant, but it is in the interest of all Eurozone countries to help struggling neighbours and this should be reflected by the politics as well. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>When it comes to global carbon emission is a tax the best form of defence? To make the European Green Deal work, the EU is considering a levy on carbon-intensive goods manufactured beyond its borders. But will a carbon border tax spawn a massive bureaucracy and lead to accusations of protectionism? To find out, Nicholas Barrett talked to Georg Zachmann and Ben McWilliams from Bruegel and Gabriel Felbermayr, President of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>As China and the US battle for global supremacy, the EU seems to remain in the shadows. But what if the EU had been shaping the world economy all along without anybody noticing? Could its soft power be strong enough to shape regulations all over the world? What impact does such influence have over its own economy? This week, Giuseppe Porcaro and Guntram Wolff are joined live by Ashoka Mody, Professor in International Economic Policy at the Princeton University, and Anu Bradford, author of the book "The Brussels Effect: How the European Union rules the world".</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>As the Coronavirus continues to spread, schools have closed, flights have been canceled and entire towns have been quarantined. Most of those who contract the virus will undoubtedly survive, but can the same be said for globalisation? Is it time for economists to question the virtue of international supply chains? Should policymakers in the west be thinking twice about our material dependency on Chinese manufacturing? And is an economic contagion as dangerous as its medical equivalent? To discuss this, Nicholas Barrett is joined by Nicolas Veron and Niclas Poitiers, and down the line from Spain, by Alicia Garcia Herrero.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Last Friday, Qassem Soleimani, head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ QUDS force, was killed by an American airstrike outside Baghdad airport. Tehran has promised to retaliate. At the time of recording, the world is still waiting to see how Iran will respond. Some have speculated that they could disrupt the world’s oil markets by closing the Strait of Hormuz, which acts as a vital artery for around a third of the world’s liquefied natural gas and almost a quarter of the world’s oil. Today, oil prices surpassed $70 a barrel and if tensions continue to escalate the price is bound to grow. How dependent is the global economy on affordable Middle Eastern fossil fuel? This week, Nicholas Barrett is joined by Maria Demertzis and Niclas Poitiers to discuss how the US-Iran hostilities are affecting the global economy.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The British government has reached a deal with the EU27.  The agreement is still subject to approval by the British and European parliaments, as well as the European Council. But is it good news for Brussels? How will Britain strike favourable trade deals when all this is over? And, with a new relationship between Brussels, London and the world yet be realised, is this the beginning of the end or just the end of the beginning? </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The European Union and Mercosur – a customs union covering Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay  – have spent two decades negotiating a trade agreement. The gains are modest the ratification process will be anything but easy. Nevertheless, the deal is worth fighting for according to Uri Dadush. This week he joins Nicholas Barrett on our Deep Focus podcast to discuss the perils and process of an agreement that could be as significant to the globe's climate as it is for the global economy. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Increasing cyber and hybrid risks will test the European Union’s system of fragmentation on issues of security but centralisation on financial and other economic issues. This asymmetry was not an obstacle in a world in which security threats were more contained or of a different nature. But the world is changing.  But what is a hybrid attack and whose responsibility is it to deal with? Last week Bruegel's Director, Guntram Wolff and our Deputy Director Maria Demertzis presented a paper on the subject to ECOFIN, an informal meeting of European finance ministers in Helsinki. In this episode of Bruegel's "Sound of Economics" podcast, Nicholas Barrett sits down with Guntram Wolff to find out.  </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The layout of the commission has largely changed this year. A key part being that there are now three executive Vice Presidents, driving three main economic issues. Frans Timmermans, responsible for the implementation of the Green Deal; Margrethe Vestager, responsible for the digital age and competition policy and Valdis Dombrovskis, responsible for economy and financial services. The major change being that, in this commission, the Vice Presidents also have their own portfolio and Directorate-Generals to oversee, suggesting these three will be instrumental in driving the political priorities of commission.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In this episode of 'The Sound of Economics' Bruegel director Guntram Wolff discusses with Simone Tagliapietra the new commission setup and Ursula von der Leyen's European Green Deal.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In his <a href="https://bruegel.org/2019/07/von-der-leyens-green-deal-isnt-just-a-plan-for-the-environment/">previous blog post on the Green Deal</a>, Simone argues not only does it aim to reduce the continent's emissions, but it also has the potential to grow the EU's economy and transform the bloc's politics. He also states the green deal has the motivation to achieve very high climate targets in quicker time than foreseen.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>For further reading on this topic, we recommend another recent blog post by Simone Tagliapietra on <a href="https://bruegel.org/2019/08/the-democrats-need-to-have-a-climate-only-tv-debate-for-americans-and-for-the-rest-of-us/">the global summits between now and November 2020 that are crucial to the future of climate change.</a>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>When the dust settles after the recent European elections, and as the new Commission takes office, the problem of climate change - and its accompanying policy challenges - will remain one of the EU's chief agenda items.<br>
<br>
One significant facet is the transition of Europe's energy generation to more renewable sources. The EU has to find a way to decarbonise particular sectors much more quickly than has been managed so far, while allowing for and managing the distributional consequences of such policies for the continent's population.<br>
<br>
Simone Tagliapietra has co-written a research paper on energy transition with his Bruegel colleague Georg Zachmann, as well as Jean-Michel Glachant, director of the Florence School of Regulation; Pedro Linares, professor at Universidad Pontificia Comillas; Andreas Loeschel, professor at the University of Muenster; and Ottmar Edenhofer, director and chief economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.<br>
<br>
If you would like to read more on this topic, we suggest Simone Tagliapietra's article the geopolitical implications of the global energy transition. Equally, we recommend an episode of our Backstage podcast series, where the same scholar hosts a discussion on the next decade of energy transition in Europe with Sir Philip Lowe, former director general at the European Commission, DG ENER, and Alberto Pototschnig, director at the European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>A difficult proposition faces the new ECB president – monetary union remains incomplete, the bank lacks room to manoeuvre in applying new tools, and it is not yet clear what constitutes the new economic ‘normal’.<br>
<br>
In this episode of 'The Sound of Economics' Bruegel director Guntram Wolff addresses deputy director Maria Demertzis and research fellow Grégory Claeys, who together with senior fellow Francesco Papadia have written <a href="http://bruegel.org/2019/07/preparing-for-uncertainty/">a memo to the incoming ECB president.<br>
</a><br>
In their note, the authors state that the ECB needs to begin this eight-year term by reviewing monetary policy framework to account for the increasingly uncertain environment in which it will have to operate. In that vein, the incoming president will have to be prepared to emulate previous actions, providing certainty when it cannot be found elsewhere.<br>
<br>
In addition, the authors propose methods by which the ECB can bolster the euro-area architecture while continuing to fulfil its role in promoting financial stability.<br>
<br>
For further reading on this topic, we recommend a recent blog post by Grégory Claeys and Tanja Linta on <a href="http://bruegel.org/2019/06/the-evolution-of-the-ecb-governing-councils-decision-making/">the evolution of the ECB governing council's monetary-policy decision-making process.</a>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The next president of the ECB, much like his predecessors, will have the difficult task of dealing with the balance between speaking with one voice and making timely, optimal decisions for the euro area as a whole. <br>
<br>
In this episode of ‘The Sound of Economics’, Bruegel deputy director Maria Demertzis speaks with Bruegel research fellow Grégory Claeys about the evolution of decision-making of the previous three governors and the differences in the effects of interest rates. <br>
<br>
Grégory Claeys and Tanja Linta have<a href="http://bruegel.org/2019/06/the-evolution-of-the-ecb-governing-councils-decision-making/"> published a blog post</a> creating a database to look back and examine precisely how decisions have been taken since the ECB was created. </div>

  <itunes:summary>In this Director’s Cut, Bruegel’s Grégory Claeys and Maria Demertzis take a deeper look at whether the monetary policy decisions made by the ECB over the past three presidential eras arrived by consensus, by unanimity or by majority votes of the governing council. </itunes:summary>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Cohesion policy remains a contentious topic in the EU, central as it is to the matter of convergence between regions. The need to share economic growth throughout the bloc is particularly acute in the wake of notable electoral advances from several more populist political parties in Europe in recent years.<br>
<br>
Bruegel senior fellow Zsolt Darvas explains how his recent study, co-written with Jan Mazza and Catarina Midões, adopts a new methodology with the aim of avoiding the complicating factors that have underpinned the greatly varied results of many previous assessments of cohesion-policy effectiveness. He explains further how the EU might refine its implementation of cohesion policy, and looks ahead to what might be the biggest obstacles to improvement.<br>
<br>
For further reading, we recommend the Bruegel Policy Contribution at the centre of this Deep Focus episode, ‘<a href="http://bruegel.org/2019/05/how-to-improve-european-union-cohesion-policy-for-the-next-decade/">How to improve European Union cohesion policy for the next decade</a>’.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this episode of 'The Sound of Economics', Bruegel senior fellow Georg Zachmann continues the Backstage series with an interview with Massimo Tavoni, professor at the Politecnico di Milano and director of EIEE.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The discussion point is climate modelling - specifically its use and the necessity of complexity in some of its formulations.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Some climate models are very straightforward, and this allows for the building of a solid base. But interaction between complex systems requires consideration of a multitude of factors, not all of which are easily measurable.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Modelling can be productive as a means of plotting a route to a policy goal such as the Paris Agreement. And the outcomes are best viewed as producing only one of many possible routes that could be taken.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>These models are increasingly relevant for numerous sectors, all beginning to factor in not only climate change but climate-change policy.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>If you are interested in more on this topic, we recommend the Bruegel Blueprint co-written by Georg Zachmann with Grégory Caleys and Gustav Fredriksson on <a href="http://bruegel.org/2018/11/distributional-effects-of-climate-policies/">the distributional effects of climate policies</a>.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>An analysis of the results of the most recent European elections reveals what Bruegel director Guntram Wolff classifies as a generally positive trend in electoral participation across the EU, with an overall increase of 7% in voter turnout since the last elections in 2014. Additionally, populist parties in the European Parliament seem to have been prevented from gaining ground.<br>
<br>
However, election results in some EU member states were not as pro-EU at the national level. In this podcast, Guntram Wolff welcomes Ferdinando Giugliano from Bloomberg and Krzysztof Blusz from WiseEuropa to discuss the results in each guest's home countries - Italy and Poland, respectively - and how the nationalist trends in each state might play a role in politics in the new European Parliament and European Commission.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in Bruegel's work concerning the European elections, we recommend our blog post: ‘<a href="http://bruegel.org/2019/05/spitzenkandidaten-visions-for-the-future-of-europes-economy/">Spitzenkandidaten visions for the future of Europe’s economy</a>’, which features the candidates for the next president of the European Commission.

  <description>**Giuseppe Porcaro hosts Bruegel director Guntram Wolff and visiting fellow Rebecca Christie to reflect on the key policy positions taken by the candidates for the European Commission presidency, ahead of May's elections.**

European elections are fast approaching. With them comes not just a visit to the polls, but the beginning of a sequence involving the European Parliament and the Council that will eventually decide who becomes the next president of the Commission. The Spitzenkandidaten process sees each of the parties put forward their nominated candidate - or candidates - one of whom should eventually assume the presidency, if the various criteria can be met.

Looking back upon Bruegel's recent six-part series of events, held in partnership with the Financial Times, the discussants assess the candidates' views on Europe's future industrial policy path, the EU's stance on the growing trade dispute between the US and China, as well as the most vital and realistic euro-area reforms for the next five years. The debate also considers how each of the candidates might be positioning themselves and their parties in the complex process of selecting a new president.

Giuseppe Porcaro leads the review with Bruegel visiting fellow Rebecca Christie and director Guntram Wolff, in this special edition of the Backstage series.

If you would like to review the series in more depth, we recommend our blog post: ‘Spitzenkandidaten visions for the future of Europe’s economy’, which contains extracts and video clips from the events.

With President Trump increasing tariffs on the US' imports from China and China retaliating in kind, the trade dispute between the two countries is escalating quickly.

Here the discussants elaborate on the disruption caused by trade tariffs, the likelihood of China acquiescing to US demands with regard to economic reform, and where the EU might figure in the stand-off.

  <description>'The Sound of Economics' podcast continues with an instalment of the Deep Focus series, with Bruegel fellow Marek Dabrowski talking to Sean Gibson about the findings of his research paper on Russia's growth problems (co-written with Antoine Mathieu Collin).

The Russian economy has weathered several crises in recent decades, most recently between 2014-16\. Though this latest dip was relatively not so deep, growth has returned much more slowly this time around than in previous years.

Some problems are age-old, while others are a product of recent political movements and developments. In this episode the conversation specifies some of Russia's institutional shortcomings and structural economic weaknesses, accounting for the country's efforts at macroeconomic management and the evolving demographic difficulties particularly concerning Russia's working-age population. 

The discussion also reflects on the particular economic impacts of Russia's involvement in Ukraine, and looks ahead to the most vital and realistic possible remedial measures that could yet be taken.

If you are interested in more of Bruegel's work on this topic, we recommend Marek Dabrowski's blog post on how Russia's foreign policy obstructs its attempts at economic modernisation. Also consider the same author's recent publication, 'Can emerging markets be a source of global troubles again?'</description>

  <description>**Bruegel fellows Rebecca Christie and Nicolas Véron discuss how the map of the EU's financial services industry has begun to change, and how it might eventually settle.**

The Brexit process has begun to unravel the supremacy of London as the financial centre of Europe, yet it remains unclear how the map of the EU's financial system will eventually be refigured.

Several cities have emerged to compete not only for the business that is leaving the UK's capital but for new investment as well. This raises broader questions about whether it is more beneficial to have a single hub or to spread financial services across numerous locations. It also poses difficulties for firms that relocate, some of whose general staff may prefer a different destination to that desired by the lawyers and compliance officers.

Brexit has set in motion events that will not be undone even if the UK were to throw the process in full reverse, and remain in the EU, and the idea has been mooted that Brexit merely accelerated a desertion of London that may have happened in any case. Still, the future landscape of the EU's financial services industry will still largely depend on the final shape of the UK's future relationship with the EU. Broadly, observers would expect a harder Brexit to yield a swifter and more seismic movement away from London.

In this episode of the Bruegel Backstage podcast series, Bruegel visiting fellow Rebecca Christie and senior fellow Nicolas Véron discuss the early developments in this direction, and the likeliest areas of future progression.

Each of the discussants made presentations at the Bruegel event 'The emerging new geography of financial centers in Europe', which was conducted under the Chatham House rule.

For further reading, we recommend this article written by Nicolas Véron about [the relocation of banking business from London](http://bruegel.org/2017/12/brexit-when-the-banks-leave/) to elsewhere in Europe in the wake of the Brexit referendum vote.</description>

  <description>**Maria Demertzis sits down with Bruegel senior fellow André Sapir to break down the news, discussing the events leading up to the renewed EU-US trade talks, and the likely future course.**

On 15 April 2019, the European Council approved mandates for the Commission to resume trade negotiations with the United States, which are to be centered around eliminating industrial tariffs. Although already a breakthrough, the talks are set to encounter many difficulties given their highly political nature.

Bruegel's deputy director Maria Demertzis sits down with senior fellow André Sapir to assess the news, discussing the events leading up to the renewed talks and the likely future outcomes.

A consistent theme in the making of any EU trade deal is the repeated declaration that it would only engage with countries that are signatories to the Paris Agreement. In 2017, the Trump administration announced the US' intention to withdraw from that agreement, which should in theory exclude the possibility of a trade deal. Maria and Andre discuss just how likely it is for the deal to come to fruition against this backdrop.

Lastly, the discussants touch upon how the fractured EU-US trade relationship affects the multilateral trading system and, by extension, global economic growth.

For further reading, we recommend the Policy Contribution of Uri Dadush and Guntram Wolff, which analyses [how Europe can act in the interest both of itself and the multilateral system](http://bruegel.org/2019/03/the-european-unions-response-to-the-trade-crisis/) amid the ongoing global trade crisis. Similarly, consider Alicia García-Herrero's recent Working Paper on the [the options available to the EU](http://bruegel.org/2019/04/europe-in-the-midst-of-china-us-strategic-competition-what-are-the-european-unions-options/) in the face of the US-China trade stand-off.</description>

On 15 April 2019, the European Council approved mandates for the Commission to resume trade negotiations with the United States, which are to be centered around eliminating industrial tariffs. Although already a breakthrough, the talks are set to encounter many difficulties given their highly political nature.

Bruegel's deputy director Maria Demertzis sits down with senior fellow André Sapir to assess the news, discussing the events leading up to the renewed talks and the likely future outcomes.

A consistent theme in the making of any EU trade deal is the repeated declaration that it would only engage with countries that are signatories to the Paris Agreement. In 2017, the Trump administration announced the US' intention to withdraw from that agreement, which should in theory exclude the possibility of a trade deal. Maria and Andre discuss just how likely it is for the deal to come to fruition against this backdrop.

Lastly, the discussants touch upon how the fractured EU-US trade relationship affects the multilateral trading system and, by extension, global economic growth.

For further reading, we recommend the Policy Contribution of Uri Dadush and Guntram Wolff, which analyses [how Europe can act in the interest both of itself and the multilateral system](http://bruegel.org/2019/03/the-european-unions-response-to-the-trade-crisis/) amid the ongoing global trade crisis. Similarly, consider Alicia García-Herrero's recent Working Paper on the [the options available to the EU](http://bruegel.org/2019/04/europe-in-the-midst-of-china-us-strategic-competition-what-are-the-european-unions-options/) in the face of the US-China trade stand-off.</itunes:summary>

  <description>**Bruegel director Guntram Wolff talks to Padmashree Gehl Sampath, a Berkman Klein fellow at Harvard University, on the consequences of ‘new manufacturing’ for European industrial policymaking.**

In this Director’s Cut of ‘The Sound of Economics’, Bruegel’s Guntram Wolff discusses Industry 4.0 with Harvard University Berkman Klein fellow Padmashree Gehl Sampath.

Europe is yet to truly explore what interventions can and should be made with regard to the digitisation of industrial policy. But the ongoing development of technologies obliges the EU to examine how best to create a level playing-field for companies, and how to ensure that newly compiled sets of data can contribute positively to the welfare of its citizens.

The deployment of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation brought into focus the potential negative consequences of people’s data being amassed. Yet, as the discussants consider here, there are many potential works to which these data can be put that would serve a greater public good. But this will only follow once policymakers formulate fresh approaches tailored to the challenge, and propose how they will follow through on their aforementioned obligations.

  <description>**Bruegel director Guntram Wolff and senior fellow André Sapir discuss how potential WTO reform might position the organisation differently towards China.**

In this Director's Cut of 'The Sound of Economics', Guntram Wolff talks to Bruegel senior fellow André Sapir about his upcoming paper on the WTO reform, specifically what is necessary in order for the Chinese economic system to be compatible with the global multilateral trading system.

China has recently been atop the European policy agenda, especially with President Xi's recent visits to Rome and Paris ahead of the EU-China Summit in April. The discussants here walk us through the main challenges in the EU's quest to position itself vis-à-vis China, including the issues of forced technology transfers and the behaviour of Chinese state-owned enterprises.

  <description>**This episode of 'The Sound of Economics' features Bruegel senior fellow J. Scott Marcus in conversation with Lise Fuhr, director general, European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association (ETNO).**&#13;
&#13;
The next wave of mobile network innovation is provoking great excitement in the industry. And indeed, there is substantial potential for improvement. However, the exact form of the technology and the appropriate policy support are still far from clear. &#13;
&#13;
The next generation of mobile technology, 5G, is being developed along markedly different lines from previous generations. In the past, mobile generations were generally characterised by a core technology (or sometimes by two or more core technologies), and were designed to fulfil the requirements of a fairly small number of mobile voice and data applications. By contrast, 5G is being developed to fulfil the needs of multiple use cases.&#13;
&#13;
In this episode Scott Marcus and Lise Fuhr outline the challenges of 5G deployment in Europe, their policy implications, and the impact for the citizens. &#13;
&#13;

  <description>**Bruegel's Maria Demertzis welcomes Yale Law School professor Yair Listokin to this Director's Cut of 'The Sound of Economics', to discuss how law might be deployed as a macroeconomic tool to counter financial crisis.**

In this episode of Director's Cut, Bruegel's deputy director Maria Demertzis talks to Yair Listokin, a professor at Yale Law School, about the effect law could have on achieving macroeconomic objectives.

In his new book titled 'Law and Macroeconomics', Yair Listokin puts forward the idea that law has the ability to function as an instrument of macroeconomic policy. He argues that the time it took for private spending to recover after the 2008 financial crisis could have been cut, had legislation played a more vital role in the process.

Here the two elaborate on these ideas, focusing particularly on the perceived trade-off between law's role in maintaining stability, and its potential to be used as a real-time response to economic shocks. They also discuss the applicability of this policy approach in the European reality of multiple legal frameworks and central banks struggling to stimulate aggregate demand at the zero lower interest rate bound.

You can find more on macroeconomic policy in previous editions of the Director's Cut. First, we recommend Bruegel director Guntram Wolff's conversation about [the growth and stability challenges facing the global financial system,](http://bruegel.org/2018/10/directors-cut-how-to-reform-and-fortify-the-global-financial-system/) with Tharman Shanmugaratnam, deputy prime minister of Singapore and chair of the G20 Eminent Persons Group, and Jean Pisani-Ferry, mercator senior fellow at Bruegel. Second, consider Maria Demertzis' discussion with Martin Sandbu of the Financial Times, on the topic of [what the field of economics has learned in the decade since the financial crisis](http://bruegel.org/2018/10/directors-cut-is-economics-asking-the-right-questions/).</description>

  <itunes:summary>**Bruegel's Maria Demertzis welcomes Yale Law School professor Yair Listokin to this Director's Cut of 'The Sound of Economics', to discuss how law might be deployed as a macroeconomic tool to counter financial crisis.**

In this episode of Director's Cut, Bruegel's deputy director Maria Demertzis talks to Yair Listokin, a professor at Yale Law School, about the effect law could have on achieving macroeconomic objectives.

In his new book titled 'Law and Macroeconomics', Yair Listokin puts forward the idea that law has the ability to function as an instrument of macroeconomic policy. He argues that the time it took for private spending to recover after the 2008 financial crisis could have been cut, had legislation played a more vital role in the process.

Here the two elaborate on these ideas, focusing particularly on the perceived trade-off between law's role in maintaining stability, and its potential to be used as a real-time response to economic shocks. They also discuss the applicability of this policy approach in the European reality of multiple legal frameworks and central banks struggling to stimulate aggregate demand at the zero lower interest rate bound.

You can find more on macroeconomic policy in previous editions of the Director's Cut. First, we recommend Bruegel director Guntram Wolff's conversation about [the growth and stability challenges facing the global financial system,](http://bruegel.org/2018/10/directors-cut-how-to-reform-and-fortify-the-global-financial-system/) with Tharman Shanmugaratnam, deputy prime minister of Singapore and chair of the G20 Eminent Persons Group, and Jean Pisani-Ferry, mercator senior fellow at Bruegel. Second, consider Maria Demertzis' discussion with Martin Sandbu of the Financial Times, on the topic of [what the field of economics has learned in the decade since the financial crisis](http://bruegel.org/2018/10/directors-cut-is-economics-asking-the-right-questions/).</itunes:summary>

  <description>**This episode of 'The Sound of Economics' features Bruegel visiting fellow Elina Ribakova in conversation with Marc-Olivier Padis and Jean-Paul Tran Thiet about the reform of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS).**&#13;
&#13;
Asylum is a fundamental human right and an international obligation, first recognised in the 1951 Geneva Convention on the protection of refugees. Between 2013 and 2017, 4 million asylum applications were filed in the EU. This high number resulted in growing tensions between Member States, with some of them displaying non-cooperative behaviour.&#13;
&#13;
The migration crisis of 2015 revealed the inadequacies of European legal tools and, by extension, management of migration flows. In this context, Institut Montaigne jointly with Terra Nova have written a [report](https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/publications/saving-right-asylum) which calls for a reform of the European asylum policy and for a rapid, unified response to the humanitarian emergency in the Mediterranean.&#13;
&#13;
In the context of recent rise of populism and nationalist tendencies in Europe, creating a binding mechanism for solidarity is a daunting task. Currently, the EU is in the process of reshaping the Common European Asylum System, but the negotiations have shown close to no progress.&#13;
&#13;
In this episode of Backstage, Elina Ribakova, a visiting fellow at Bruegel welcomes Marc-Olivier Padis, head of studies department at Terra Nova, and Jean-Paul Tran Thiet, senior fellow at Institut Montaigne, to make a case for this reform. Together, they discuss the key elements of the revised system, which include improved monitoring of the asylum process, as well as efforts for equitable burden sharing.&#13;
&#13;
For further reading, we recommend our blueprint “[People on the move: migration and mobility in the European Union](http://bruegel.org/2018/01/people-on-the-move-migration-and-mobility-in-the-european-union/?utm_content=bufferf0023&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer+(bruegel))“, written by Uuriintuya Batsaikhan, Zsolt Darvas and Inês Gonçalves Raposo.&#13;
&#13;
Zolt Darvas also contributed to the debate on migration and refugees in Europe with two blogs on similar topics: “[Beyond border control, migrant integration policies must be revived](http://bruegel.org/2018/02/beyond-border-control-migrant-integration-policies-must-be-revived/)“ and “[The challenge of fostering financial inclusion of refugees](http://bruegel.org/2017/12/the-challenge-of-fostering-financial-inclusion-of-refugees/)“.&#13;

  <description>**This episode of 'The Sound of Economics' features Bruegel research fellow Simone Tagliapietra in conversation with Sir Philip Lowe and Alberto Pototschnig about the progress of the European energy transition as we prepare to enter the third decade of the 21st century. **&#13;
&#13;
In this episode of Backstage, Bruegel's Simone Tagliapietra welcomes Sir Philip Lowe, former director general at the European Commission, DG ENER, and Alberto Pototschnig, director at the European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).&#13;
&#13;
Together, they elaborate on the main trends driving the European energy transition towards greater sustainability, energy security and economic competitiveness. They also assess whether the EU has the necessary institutions to ensure a smooth process for a rapidly growing and more integrated energy market. Among the key challenges is the effective management of an increasingly democratised energy sector, which requires – among many things – innovative solutions in energy storage and use of renewables.&#13;
&#13;
The discussants also touch upon the subject of distributional effect of climate policies, as the recent unrest in France shows that this issue will sit high on the agenda as new strategies are implemented over the coming years.&#13;
&#13;
For further reading, we recommend a [Policy Contribution](http://bruegel.org/2018/12/is-the-european-automotive-industry-ready-for-the-global-electric-vehicle-revolution/) co-authored by Simone Tagliapietra on European automotive industry's place in the global electric vehicle revolution, as well as a [Blueprint](http://bruegel.org/2018/11/distributional-effects-of-climate-policies/) by Grégory Claeys, Gustav Fredriksson and Georg Zachmann on distributional effects of climate policies.&#13;

  <description>**In this episode of Director's Cut, Stephanie Segal of CSIS joins Bruegel's Guntram Wolff and Maria Demertzis for a conversation about the tension between free trade and national security issues, and the emerging threats to multilateralism.**

In a changing geopolitical order, with China on the rise, the linkage of economic and national security is more evident than ever. The boom of disruptive new technologies is accompanied by increasingly country-centric political tendencies, and the more and more antagonistic stance of the US towards the EU and China. Taken together, a unique setting emerges for dealing with pressing issues in economic security.

Stephanie Segal, deputy director and senior fellow of the CSIS Simon Chair in Political Economy, joins Bruegel director Guntram Wolff and deputy director Maria Demertzis to discuss the looming challenges.

They sketch out the approach taken by key global players to balance the continuous benefits of free trade against the need to safeguard national security interests.

  <itunes:summary>**In this episode of Director's Cut, Stephanie Segal of CSIS joins Bruegel's Guntram Wolff and Maria Demertzis for a conversation about the tension between free trade and national security issues, and the emerging threats to multilateralism.**

In a changing geopolitical order, with China on the rise, the linkage of economic and national security is more evident than ever. The boom of disruptive new technologies is accompanied by increasingly country-centric political tendencies, and the more and more antagonistic stance of the US towards the EU and China. Taken together, a unique setting emerges for dealing with pressing issues in economic security.

Stephanie Segal, deputy director and senior fellow of the CSIS Simon Chair in Political Economy, joins Bruegel director Guntram Wolff and deputy director Maria Demertzis to discuss the looming challenges.

They sketch out the approach taken by key global players to balance the continuous benefits of free trade against the need to safeguard national security interests. The new trade-restrictive measures – such as increased scrutiny over foreign direct investment – have obvious consequences for global economic growth and the rules-based multilateral trading system. The discussants elaborate on the importance of preserving multilateralism, and the role of international organisations in the process.

  <description>Bruegel senior fellow J. Scott Marcus joins Sean Gibson for this episode of Deep Focus on the 'The Sound of Economics', elaborating on a Bruegel study for the European Parliament into the progress made with the Commission's Digital Single Market Strategy since 2015.

In a study for the European Parliament, Bruegel senior fellow J. Scott Marcus (together with co-authors Georgios Petropoulos and Timothy Yeung) has reviewed the gains delivered so far by these new measures, insofar as they can yet be determined. The authors also look at what the next legislative term might deliver, what realistic progress can be expected and what business remains unfinished regarding measures implemented by the current Commission.  


Speaking to Bruegel press officer Sean Gibson in this episode of the Deep Focus podcast series, Scott Marcus specifies some of the real achievements that the DSM can - and, indeed, has begun to - deliver for both consumers and producers. More broadly, the DSM is put in the context of efforts to digitise European society, specifically how well policies towards the former are keeping pace with the latter.   

We invite you to review [the research paper in question](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2019/631044/IPOL_STU(2019)631044_EN.pdf) in this episode, but also recommend consulting [Scott Marcus' testimony before the European Parliament Committee](http://bruegel.org/2018/07/economic-benefits-of-the-digital-single-market/) on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO).</description>

  <description>**Bruegel fellows Alicia García-Herrero and Uri Dadush join Guntram Wolff for this Director's Cut of 'The Sound of Economics', focusing on the progress made by China's Belt and Road Initiative, how it will continue to develop, and the reactions it has stirred across the world.**

China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a trade and development strategy proposed by Xi Jinping in 2013\. It aims to enhance development prospects via infrastructure, trade, and investment on a trans-continental scale, and is hence often referred to as 'the 21st century's Silk Road'.

Five years after its launch, how well has the BRI been received and how much potential does it still hold? Two Bruegel scholars, Alicia García-Herrero and Uri Dadush sit down with Bruegel's director Guntram Wolff to discuss their analyses of the initiative.

In a recent [Policy Contribution](http://bruegel.org/2019/01/the-belt-and-road-turns-five/), Uri Dadush and Michael Baltensperger reflect on the background and context of the BRI, and critically assess the project's potential for future performance. In this podcast episode, Uri points to the worrisome aspects of the initiative, particularly the lack of transparency and due diligence concerning the issue of debt trap, as well as China's poor regard for the possible environmental impact.

In a newly released [Working Paper](http://bruegel.org/2019/02/countries-perceptions-of-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-a-big-data-analysis/), Alicia García-Herrero and Jianwei Xu analyse large amounts of data to identify the trends in the global perception of the BRI. In this episode Alicia lets us in on their findings. For example, she explains why – despite the generally positive image of the initiative – it is the Central European countries, which benefited from substantial assistance from China, that have a relatively negative perception of the initiative.

  <description>**This episode of The Sound of Economics features Bruegel senior fellow Zsolt Darvas in conversation with Maurizio Bussolo and Bernadette Ségol about income inequality in Europe and Central Asia, and the policy principles underpinning a possible new social contract. **&#13;
&#13;
Although income distribution in Europe and Central Asia reaches a fairly egalitarian standard relative to the rest of the world, the current levels of inequality among individuals and households are a major cause of dissatisfaction. In the time of globalisation and rapid technological change, when income inequalities heavily affect people's security and well-being, the demand for a new social contract (and hence welfare state) is apparent. But what would a renewed social contract look like?&#13;
&#13;
In this episode of Bruegel Backstage, senior fellow Zsolt Darvas talks to Maurizio Bussolo, the lead economist for Europe and Central Asia at the World Bank, and Bernadette Ségol, the former secretary general of the European Trade Union Confederation.&#13;
&#13;
The document that brings them together is the recently published World Bank report, [“Towards a New Social Contract: Taking on Distributional Tensions in Europe and Central Asia”](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/569321538150509492/pdf/130299-Toward-a-New-Social-Contract-PUBLIC.pdf), co-written by Maurizio Bussolo. It highlights the shortcomings of the current systems both for taxes and transfers and for labour-market regulation. The report sketches out the policy principles to guide a potential new social contract, principles that assume universal social assistance and insurance, labour protection, and more progressive taxation. If implemented, the report suggests, these measures would improve mobility and flexibility, helping to overcome the inequality traps and provide a broader, more just access to opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
For further reading, you may consider Zsolt Darvas' blog post on [the EU income inequality decline](http://bruegel.org/2018/07/eu-income-inequality-decline-views-from-an-income-shares-perspective/), as well as a publication on [the hardships of achieving the EU's poverty target](http://bruegel.org/2018/03/why-is-it-so-hard-to-reach-the-eus-poverty-target-2/) by the same author.&#13;

  <description>**Bruegel director Guntram Wolff is joined by senior fellow Zsolt Darvas to rake through the possibilities and probabilities inherent in a no-deal Brexit scenario, covering trade, the Irish border, citizens' rights and the EU budget.**&#13;
&#13;
Bruegel senior fellow Zsolt Darvas joins Guntram Wolff for this Director's Cut, to discuss the economic fall-out of a no-deal Brexit.&#13;
&#13;
While the UK remains without an agreement on the nature of its relationship with the EU beyond March 29th 2019, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit - and its bundle of complex permutations for each sector - is still on the table.&#13;
&#13;
What would a WTO-based trade relationship between the EU and the UK look like in reality? Beneath surface-level tariffs, the value chains that would be broken by a hard border in the English Channel could have far-reaching consequences. And in Ireland, the more innovative border solutions remain mostly unsubstantiated, and at the very least would require a long implementation period - the time for which has long since passed.&#13;
&#13;
A no-deal Brexit also has implications for the EU budget. Our calculations specify the gap to be filled if the UK were to stop contributing immediately, as well as the spread of the additional burden across the EU's member countries.&#13;
&#13;

  <description>**Bruegel fellows Reinhilde Veugelers and Simone Tagliapietra elaborate on the recent Policy Contribution they co-authored on the European automotive industry in the light of the global electric vehicle revolution.**&#13;
&#13;
Electrification is a key trend transforming the global automotive industry, especially in the light of increased decarbonisation efforts. The speed at which the technology is being developed and the decreasing production costs make for a rather optimistic prognosis for future global deployment of electric vehicles (EVs). The automotive sector is undoubtedly an important one for the EU economy, yet it has lagged behind in terms of both EV manufacturing and deployment.&#13;
&#13;
In this episode of Deep Focus, Sean Gibson interviews Reinhilde Veugelers and Simone Tagliapietra, the co-authors of a recently published [Policy Contribution on the EU automotive industry and the global EV revolution](http://bruegel.org/2018/12/is-the-european-automotive-industry-ready-for-the-global-electric-vehicle-revolution/). European manufacturers have extensive experience, robust R&amp;D projects and a large internal market, but can they make the switch to EVs sufficiently fast to remain competitive? To answer that question, Reinhilde and Simone outline the current picture of China's industry and point to the lessons that can be learnt from their electrification success story. While Europe cannot and should not adopt the centrally planned policy measures, a more comprehensive policy framework combining both demand- and supply-side instruments is necessary to bring the industry back up to speed.&#13;
&#13;

  <description>**With 2018 drawing to a close, and the dawn of 2019 imminent, Bruegel's scholars reflect on the economic policy developments we can expect in the new year – one that brings with it the additional uncertainty of European elections.**

These elections will be a bellwether for the continent-wide rise of populist politics that has been a defining characteristic of the year past. The results will certainly have profound consequences for all policy debates within the EU, but also for the bloc's relationship with external partners. The shifts in the geopolitical landscape have borne a trade war, prompting renewed talk of closer ties between China and the EU, the potential internationalisation of the euro, and how the multilateral trading system might be saved, reformed, or left behind.

Meanwhile, 2019 promises fierce debate of the next EU budget for 2020-2027, not entirely separate from the mooted euro-area budget and the ongoing efforts at euro-area reform and expansion. The upcoming elections will be pivotal in determining the complexion of these discussions as the year progresses.

  <description>**Bruegel senior scholar Zsolt Darvas speaks about his review of systematic errors in ECB forecasting, in another instalment of the Deep Focus podcast on 'The Sound of Economics' channel**

In this episode of the Deep Focus, Sean Gibson speaks with Bruegel senior scholar Zsolt Darvas about his research on European Central Bank forecasting.

Zsolt has analysed that, over the past five years, ECB forecasts have proven to be systematically incorrect: core inflation remained broadly stable at 1% despite the stubbornly predicted increase, while the unemployment rate fell faster than predicted.

Such forecast errors, which are also inconsistent with each other, raise serious doubts about the reliability of the ECB’s current forecast of accelerating core inflation, and necessitates a reflection on the inflation aim of the ECB.

  <description>**Bruegel fellow Georg Zachmann talks through a Bruegel Blueprint he has co-authored, looking into the potential distributional effects of climate policies, in another episode of the Deep Focus series.**&#13;
&#13;
Climate change is one of the big questions of this century, and mitigating its effects remains an enormous challenge. Decarbonisation will require a massive shift in our economies. Heating, transport, electricity and industry will have to transition to a world without fossil fuels. Agriculture and industry will have to find new ways to reduce emissions. This aim – as ambitious as it is essential – necessitates intrusive climate policies.&#13;
&#13;
In this episode of Deep Focus, Sean Gibson interviews Georg Zachmann, a co-author of a recently published [Blueprint on distributional effects of climate policies](http://bruegel.org/2018/11/distributional-effects-of-climate-policies/). They untangle the complicated picture of said effects, which may vary depending on the policy tool and its design, the sector addressed and the initial socio-economic conditions in the country. Some policy tools such as carbon taxes may leave low-income households worse off, while policies such as taxes on aviation may leave them better off relative to high-income households. Others, like public investment and agriculture policies, still have unclear effects.&#13;
&#13;
One thing is for certain: whatever distributional effects climate policies may have, they constitute no argument against their implementation. Climate change would leave everyone worse off and disproportionately hit the poorest part of the population. It is therefore essential to design policies in a way that minimises the adverse effects on those most vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
For further reading, you might consider an [opinion piece](http://bruegel.org/2018/11/what-the-gilets-jaunes-movement-tells-us-about-environment-and-climate-policies/) by Simone Tagliapietra and Georg Zachmann on what the “gilets jaunes” movement tells us about environment and climate policies, as well as their [blog post on the EU energy industry transformation](http://bruegel.org/2017/09/reinforcing-the-eu-energy-industry-transformation-stronger-policies-needed/).</description>

Heating, transport, electricity and industry will have to transition to a world without fossil fuels. Agriculture and industry will have to find new ways to reduce emissions. This aim – as ambitious as it is essential – necessitates intrusive climate policies.&#13;
&#13;
In this episode of Deep Focus, Sean Gibson interviews Georg Zachmann, a co-author of a recently published [Blueprint on distributional effects of climate policies](http://bruegel.org/2018/11/distributional-effects-of-climate-policies/). They untangle the complicated picture of said effects, which may vary depending on the policy tool and its design, the sector addressed and the initial socio-economic conditions in the country. Some policy tools such as carbon taxes may leave low-income households worse off, while policies such as taxes on aviation may leave them better off relative to high-income households. Others, like public investment and agriculture policies, still have unclear effects.&#13;
&#13;
One thing is for certain: whatever distributional effects climate policies may have, they constitute no argument against their implementation. Climate change would leave everyone worse off and disproportionately hit the poorest part of the population. It is therefore essential to design policies in a way that minimises the adverse effects on those most vulnerable.&#13;

  <description>In this episode of the Backstage series, Bruegel's Non-Resident Fellow Dirk Schoenmaker welcomes Molly Scott Cato, a Green party MEP for South West England, for a conversation on the EU's plan to transition towards sustainable finance.

To achieve the EU's 2030 targets agreed in Paris, such as a 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions, in May 2018, the Commission announced its action plan on sustainable finance. Its aims are, among others, to facilitate sustainable investment and improve the availability of information on investments carbon footprint.    

Molly Scott-Cato in conversation with Dirk Schoenmaker outlines the details of the plan and elaborates on the steps necessary for the transition from brown to green finance, from vast investments into public infrastructure to the introduction of carbon tax on aviation.

 While it is important to introduce dynamism to the discussion, we have to keep in mind to balance the sense of desperate urgency to avoid a systemic crisis.

  <description>**Bruegel's director Guntram Wolff looks at north Africa's economic growth in the light of the region's trade agreements with the EU, welcoming Karim El Aynaoui and Uri Dadush to the Backstage series on 'The Sound of Economics'.**&#13;
&#13;
In this episode of Backstage, Bruegel's director Guntram Wolff welcomes Uri Dadush, a non-resident scholar at Bruegel and a Senior Fellow at the OCP Policy Center, as well as Karim El Aynaoui, managing director at the OCP Policy Center. Together, they look at north Africa's economic growth in the light of the region's trade agreements with the EU.&#13;
&#13;
This podcast episode touches upon a [Policy Contribution](http://bruegel.org/2018/11/assessing-the-european-unions-north-africa-trade-agreements/) co-authored by Uri Dadush, which provides an economic assessment of the EU-north Africa trade agreements. While their performance is not spectacular, the agreements' common view often appears too harsh, especially bearing in mind the unfavourable domestic and international environment in which they came into force.&#13;
&#13;
Despite the visible misallocation of capital and insufficient job creation, some sectors in the region – such as the automotive, pharmaceutical and aeronautical industries in Morocco – are doing exceptionally well, both in terms of performance and integration. The question remains about the potential direction the region may wish to take when moving forward with its growth plan. To ensure strengthened EU-north Africa value chains, we have to move beyond the blanket-approach and instead reward the best performance.&#13;
&#13;
For further reading, you might consider an [opinion piece on the China-Africa economic relationship](http://bruegel.org/2018/09/china-made-two-promises-in-africa-can-it-keep-them/) written by Alicia García-Herrero, as well as a [blog post](http://bruegel.org/2018/04/free-trade-in-africa-an-important-goal-but-not-easy-to-achieve/) by Marek Dabrowski and Yana Myachenkova on the difficult task of achieving free trade in Africa.&#13;

  <description>In November 2008, the first G20 summit at the leaders' level took place amid the global financial crisis. The admittedly ambitious undertaking has since played its role in stabilising the global economy throughout the aftershocks of the crash. Today, the global order looks much different to the one in which the G20 found itself 10 years ago. How has the institution evolved and is it still equipped to create a supportive political environment for strong national and global actions?

In this episode of Bruegel's Deep Focus series on 'The Sound of Economics', Suman Bery reviews the G20's performance over the past decade to identify the challenges for the future. After the initial success, he identifies a sense of complacency that has seemingly crept into the global forum. Moreover, the emerging and developing economy members have remained observably passive, which may reflect their discomfort at their perceived systemic importance despite lower levels of income.

A further challenge for the G20 arises from Donald Trump assuming the US presidency in 2016, and the following tendency to drift away from multilateralism in favour of bilateral trade. The upcoming summit in Buenos Aires may be revealing in terms of just how much the G20 depends on American leadership. Another question remains about what potential the EU has as a future leader within the institution. One thing is certain: to champion a comprehensive approach, the G20 must conceive a set of rules that closer reflects the changing world.

For further reading we suggest not only the Policy Contribution written by Suman Bery – '[The G20 turns ten: what’s past is prologue](http://bruegel.org/2018/11/the-g20-turns-ten-whats-past-is-prologue/)' – but also the blog post of Jim O'Neill and Alessio Terzi, outlining [a proposal for a reformation of the G7](http://bruegel.org/2018/06/the-g7-is-dead-long-live-the-g7/).</description>

  <description>This episode of the Director’s Cut features a conversation between Bruegel’s director, Guntram Wolff and Maha Yahya, the director of the Carnegie Middle East Center, where her research focuses on citizenship, pluralism, and social justice in the aftermath of the Arab uprisings.&#13;
&#13;
Yahya is the author of numerous publications, including most recently “Unheard Voices: What Syrian Refugees Need to Return Home” (April 2018); “The Summer of Our Discontent: Sects and Citizens in Lebanon and Iraq” (June 2017); and “Refugees and the Making of an Arab Regional Disorder” (November 2015). &#13;

  <description>Think-tanks play a critical role in developing and promoting policy solutions, particularly in times of extreme disruption and change.

However, these organisations now operate in information-rich societies where facts, evidence and credible research are often ignored – and where disinformation can gain a footing.

In this edition of the Bruegel Backstage podcast series on ‘The Sound of Economics’, Bruegel secretary general Matt Dann welcomes senior thought leaders from research centres around the world, to discuss a range of strategies and best practices for transforming public policy and institutions in an era of digital and political disruptions as well as increased social and economic turbulence.

Speakers

**Matt Dann**, secretary general at Bruegel

**James McGann**, director of the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program at the Lauder Institute, University of Pennsylvania

**Milena Lazarević**, programme director and co-founder of the European Policy Centre in Belgrade, Serbia

**Edward Kofi Anan Brown**, senior director for research and policy engagements at the African Center for Economic Transformation in Ghana

  <description>The final act of the Brexit negotiations is upon us, with many questions still seemingly unresolved and the future relationship between the EU and the UK yet uncertain.&#13;
&#13;
The EU remains unyielding on compromising the integrity of the single market, with the UK struggling to propose an agreement suitable both for the EU as well as its own nuanced internal political situation.&#13;
&#13;
With the numbers delicately balanced in the UK’s House of Commons, whose MPs have to ratify the final deal, the subtlest shifts in positions and proposals have the potential to constitute serious stumbling blocks on the road to an agreement.&#13;
&#13;
Joining Bruegel’s Maria Demertzis for this Director’s Cut of ‘The Sound of Economics’ is Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham House institute in London. Together they run through what has already been agreed, what sticking points remain to be got past, and how the two sides might yet reach a deal that suits them both.&#13;
&#13;
For further reading, we recommend our blog post, written by Maria Demertzis and André Sapir, outlining the basic options for [the future relationship of the EU and the UK](http://bruegel.org/2017/12/brexit-phase-two-and-beyond-the-future-of-the-eu-uk-relationship/), how they might be negotiated upon, and which would suit each side the best.</description>

  <description>**Bruegel senior fellow Nicolas Véron joins Sean Gibson to delve into the recent Policy Contribution on how to better the European Union anti-money laundering (AML) regime, a paper he has co-written with Joshua Kirschenbaum.**

The study offers a response to the evident flaws of the present system, exemplified by a series of banking scandals in multiple European Union countries, and amplified by changing geopolitics.

The shortcomings of the current legal framework are identified by the authors as systemic in nature – the combination of an enforceable single market and national supervision of banks fails to meet the AML objectives.

In their analysis, the authors propose a new European AML authority that would work on the basis of deep relationships with national authorities such as financial intelligence units and law enforcement agencies.

  <description>**Bruegel senior fellow Zsolt Darvas welcomes Sayuri Shirai, professor at Keio University, visiting scholar at the Asian Development Bank Institute and former Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), for a discussion of the Japanese monetary policy outlook.**&#13;
&#13;
Japan is often portrayed in the economic circles as a country facing decades of loss, as it has long been experiencing slow economic growth and sluggish underlying inflation, despite numerous attempts at boosting it.&#13;
&#13;
The ambitious plan designed to do just that is known as ‘Abenomics’, a macroeconomic package advocated by Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, based upon the ‘three arrows’ of monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms.&#13;
&#13;
To evaluate the outcomes of the Abe’s policies and explore the challenges facing Japanese economy, Bruegel senior fellow Zsolt Darvas welcomes Sayuri Shirai, professor at Keio University, visiting scholar at the Asian Development bank institute and former Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan.&#13;
&#13;
The discussion touches upon the reasons why target inflation is so hard to achieve, including the issue of stagnant wages and low labour productivity, especially in the context of Japan’s aging society. It also reflects on the Bank of Japan’s monetary easing normalisation, and whether it is feasible for it to tamper its massive government bond purchases.&#13;
&#13;
For further reading, you might consider a [blog post](http://bruegel.org/2014/08/the-third-arrow-of-abenomics-what-economic-picture-will-it-draw-in-the-middle-term/) by Akio Egawa on the third arrow of Abenomics – a growth strategy.

  <description>**Bruegel director Guntram Wolff is joined by Tharman Shanmugaratnam, deputy prime minister of Singapore and chair of the G20 Eminent Persons Group, and Jean Pisani-Ferry, mercator senior fellow at Bruegel, for a conversation about the growth and stability challenges facing the global financial system, and how the system can be better equipped to deal with the significant and novel problems of the future.**&#13;
&#13;
In this Director’s Cut of ‘The Sound of Economics’ Guntram Wolff is joined by Bruegel’s mercator senior fellow Jean Pisani-Ferry, and by Tharman Shanmugaratnam, deputy prime minister of Singapore and chair of the G20 Eminent Persons Group.&#13;
&#13;
[A report from the Eminent Persons Group](https://www.globalfinancialgovernance.org/) looks into how the global financial system can adapt to meet the sizeable challenges the future will pose, with particular reference to growth and financial stability.&#13;
&#13;
Small episodes of growth scarcity accumulate to make for a significant reduction worldwide, and the current model is not going to achieve the necessary uptick in growth in the next decade. Meanwhile, financial stability remains elusive, despite the positive changes made – particularly in the banking sector – since the most recent crisis.&#13;
&#13;
But the report from the G20 Eminent Persons Group is not without hope, and in fact sees a practical way forward by which the gaps in the current system can be plugged before new foundations are laid for the future.&#13;
&#13;
For further reading, we recommend Jean Pisani-Ferry’s Bruegel Policy Contribution on the question of [whether we should give up on global governance](http://bruegel.org/2018/10/should-we-give-up-on-global-governance/) in such turbulent times.</description>

  <description>**Amid the Asia-Europe Economic Forum on the fringes of the 12th ASEM Summit, Bruegel senior fellow hosts a conversation on developing global trade relations, with guests Moonsung Kang, professor as Korea University, and Michael G. Plummer, director at SAIS Europe – Johns Hopkins University, for an episode of the Bruegel Backstage series on ‘The Sound of Economics’.**

With Bruegel hosting the two-day Asia-Europe Economic Forum in the same week as the Asia-Europe Meeting takes place in Brussels, André Sapir takes the opportunity to talk about the quickening changes to the global trade landscape in conversation with Moonsung Kang, professor as Korea University, and Michael G. Plummer, director at SAIS Europe – Johns Hopkins University. 

Led by President Donald Trump, the US has begun to challenge the multilateral trade system. Meanwhile, Europe has been busy securing free trade agreements – most recently with Japan, previously with Canada and others.

With the US appearing to withdraw, and abdicate its leading role in the global trading system, Asia’s moves to improve relations with Europe make sense; the EU seems to have better appreciated the shift of the gravitational centre of world trade towards Asia.

The question remains how closely Asia and the EU will agree to cooperate in the years to come, and whether the US political narrative will develop in a way that leads them back towards free trade, or even further down the road of bilateral agreements. 

If you are interested in reading more on this topic, we can recommend the research paper on the [EU-Japan agreement](http://bruegel.org/2018/10/the-eu-japan-economic-partnership-agreement/) that Bruegel has submitted to the European Parliament, by André Sapir, Sonali Chowdhry and Alessio Terzi.

  <description>**In this episode of Deep Focus, Bruegel research fellow Simone Tagliapeitra explains how the nature of cross-Mediterranean energy relations needs to change, not only in line with new climate-change targets but also to meet the burgeoning energy demand outside Europe.**&#13;
&#13;
Oil and gas dominated Euro-Mediterranean energy relations in the 20th century, but with the turn of the 21st century came a new focus on renewable sources. The new ventures were less successful than those of old, and both institutional and commercial plans failed to achieve the same level of fruitful cooperation.&#13;
&#13;
With electricity demand sky-rocketing in the Middle East, future efforts must differ from those of the past in providing much more supply for the countries outside Europe. The EU can play a key role in ensuring that both they and the countries on the southern side of the Mediterranean Sea benefit from such a spike in energy demand, with a strategy in-keeping with agreements already reached on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  &#13;
In this episode of Bruegel’s Deep Focus series, Simone Tagliapietra explains how the regulatory and financial constraints on renewable energy projects can be overcome. European institutions have the capability to back the sizeable upfront investment in renewables that will propel such projects towards their long-term pay-offs. But funding must be conditional on reform that promotes private investment and removes archaic bias towards fossil fuels.  &#13;
The research discussed in this episode is available in full in the Bruegel Policy Brief, ‘[The Euro-Mediterranean energy relationship: a fresh perspective’](http://bruegel.org/2018/10/the-euro-mediterranean-energy-relationship-a-fresh-perspective/), by Simone Tagliapietra. This scholar has also collaborated with Bruegel senior fellow Georg Zachmann on [a study of Europe’s failure to clean up its transport sector](http://bruegel.org/2018/04/addressing-europes-failure-to-clean-up-the-transport-sector/), which we recommend as further reading.</description>

  <description>**In this Director’s Cut of ‘The Sound of Economics’, Guntram Wolff welcomes Bruegel research fellow Grégory Claeys to assess how the new Italian budget proposals measure up against the existing EU fiscal rules.**

Italy’s new budget proposals, together with projected deficit levels for the coming years, have put the EU as well as bond-market investors on alert.

In the context of Italy’s already-high ratio of public debt to GDP, the coalition government’s plan to increase the budget deficit has prompted concerns that the country risks running afoul of the EU’s fiscal framework. 

What are the means by which the EU can monitor and, if need be, administer sanctions on Italy, in the event of any contravention of its fiscal rules? Bruegel director Guntram Wolff takes this opportunity to discuss all the options facing the European Commission and Council, as well as the specific details of the Italian case and the forecasts underpinning the budget’s figures, with Bruegel research fellow Grégory Claeys. 

For further reading, we recommend our full break-down of the [EU’s options for response to Italy’s fiscal plans,](http://bruegel.org/2018/10/italys-new-fiscal-plans-the-options-of-the-european-commission/) written by Grégory Claeys and Antoine Mathieu Collin.

  <description>**Bruegel senior fellow André Sapir welcomes Tamotsu Nakamura, dean of Kobe University’s Graduate School of Economics, and Maria Åsenius, head of cabinet to European trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström, for a discussion of the EU-Japan economic partnership in the context of heightening global trade tensions.**

The EU and Japan have signed a landmark trade deal this summer that will create the world’s largest open economic area.

 The economic partnership agreement will be the biggest bilateral trade agreement the EU has ever signed, permitting not only the dropping of tariffs but also regulatory cooperation, as well as a special focus to promote the interests of SMEs.    

The trade-positive nature of this agreement goes against the grain of the numerous challenges made to the global multilateral system in recent times, best represented by the tariffs and counter-tariffs imposed by the US and China upon one another.

To explore how this accord suits the EU and Japan, in terms of both the domestic and international interests of each side, Bruegel senior fellow André Sapir welcomes two guests for this edition of the Bruegel Backstage series – Tamotsu Nakamura, dean of Kobe University’s Graduate School of Economics, and Maria Åsenius, head of cabinet to European trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström.    

If you are interested in reading more on this topic, we can recommend the research paper on the EU-Japan agreement that Bruegel has submitted to the European Parliament, by André Sapir, Sonali Chowdhry and Alessio Terzi.

 

You might also consider our previous podcast on EU’s options in the event of global trade war, featuring Bruegel director Guntram Wolff with Bernd Lange, member of the European Parliament and chair of the Committee on International Trade.

  <description>**Bruegel deputy director Maria Demertzis welcomes Financial Times commentator Martin Sandbu to explore the journey taken by the field of economics since the financial crisis struck 10 years ago, and discusses what new tools economics has now that it didn’t have then.**&#13;
&#13;
In this Director’s Cut of ‘The Sound of Economics’, we trace the journey upon which the field of economics has embarked since the financial crisis, what lessons it has learnt and what it can do differently now with the benefit of hindsight.&#13;
&#13;
Economists and financial specialists failed to identify the burgeoning threat of financial imbalances, excessive risk-taking and housing bubbles that led to the crisis that first broke a decade ago. Can economics provide answers to the right questions – and in good time?&#13;
&#13;
Bruegel deputy director Maria Demertzis is joined by Martin Sandbu of the Financial Times to look at what new tools and approaches can help economists make a difference in the event that any similar such crisis strikes again.&#13;
&#13;
For further consideration we recommend [another edition of the Director’s Cut podcast series](https://audioboom.com/posts/6856399-director-s-cut-post-crisis-prognosis-for-macroeconomics), featuring a discussion between Maria Demertzis, Nicola Viegi – South African Reserve Bank professor of monetary economics at the University of Pretoria – and Frank Smets – director general of economics at the European Central Bank – on the topic of macroeconomics’ post-crisis reinvention and the flourishing of new models.&#13;

  <description>Guntram Wolff welcomes Bruegel affiliate fellow Silvia Merler to evaluate the Italian government’s planned budget for 2019, in this Director’s Cut of ‘The Sound of Economics’&#13;
&#13;
Six months after its election, Italy’s coalition government reached an agreement on public spending.&#13;
&#13;
The key tenets of its first budget include a spending increase that will drive the budget deficit to 2.4% of GDP, tax cuts, a proposal for a minimal income for the unemployed, as well as cancellation of the plans to increase retirement ages.&#13;
&#13;
Though the new deficit budget fits into the EU’s limit of 3%, Italy’s debt of €2.3 trillion makes for a difficult case to increase spending. The news comes as a blow for the finance minister Giovanni Tria, who pushed for a more fiscally responsible budget, trying to limit budget deficit to 1.6% of GDP. The decision also received disapproval from Brussels, with EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici criticising Italy for “flouting the rules” and disregarding its large debt.   &#13;
&#13;
To discuss the potential consequences, Guntram Wolff welcomes Bruegel affiliate fellow Silvia Merler to this Director’s Cut of ‘The Sound of Economics’.&#13;
&#13;
For further reading, we recommend Guntram Wolff’s opinion piece on how to overcome the hurdles obstructing Italian growth, as well as Silvia Merler’s note comparing the capital flight from Italy in 2018 with similar such scenarios witnessed in 2011 and 2016.</description>

  <description>Bruegel senior fellow Scott Marcus welcomes former European Regulators Group chairman Kip Meek to explore the consequences of Brexit for ICT policy-making in Europe.

The divorce of the UK from the European Union will have far-reaching consequences for all sectors, but what will be the balance of continuity and disruption in the sphere of ICT regulation?

With the terms of separation and the nature of the UK’s future relationship with the EU yet to be finalised, there are still many variables that could affect the final outlook. Nevertheless, we can explore the industry’s broader regulatory inclinations, as well as the areas that are most vulnerable to any serious disruption.   

Reflecting on the most essential problems that Brexit will pose to the ICT industry, Bruegel senior fellow J. Scott Marcus is joined in conversation by Kip Meek, former chairman of the European Regulators Group. 

For further reading, we recommend a blog post written by Scott Marcus on the question of whether mobile roaming arrangements can be maintained between the UK and EU post-Brexit. 

Kip Meek appeared as a panellist at an International telecommunications Society conference in Trento, Italy in August 2018, in a session moderated by Scott Marcus.</description>

  <description>Following a conference at Bruegel, at a critical moment for the global economic system, Bruegel director Guntram Wolff is joined by Zhang Weiwei, director at The China Institute of Fudan University, together with Bruegel senior fellow Alicia García-Herrero, for a discussion of EU-China trade relations.

With the United States pursuing a policy of imposing trade tariffs on its international partners, the geopolitical landscape is poised for change. What room is there, then, for closer economic ties between China and Europe in a world where a multilateral trading system cannot be taken for granted?

There are many points, political and economic, on which European and Chinese approaches diverge; nevertheless, there remains the opportunity to focus on common ground, establish a more mutually beneficial relationship, while also standing up for the multilateral system.

How prepared China and Europe actually are for building closer ties remains an essential debate. This conversation assesses what problems still prevent a smoother integration of interests in both the Chinese and the European spheres.

  <itunes:summary>Following a conference at Bruegel, at a critical moment for the global economic system, Bruegel director Guntram Wolff is joined by Zhang Weiwei, director at The China Institute of Fudan University, together with Bruegel senior fellow Alicia García-Herrero, for a discussion of EU-China trade relations.

With the United States pursuing a policy of imposing trade tariffs on its international partners, the geopolitical landscape is poised for change. What room is there, then, for closer economic ties between China and Europe in a world where a multilateral trading system cannot be taken for granted?

There are many points, political and economic, on which European and Chinese approaches diverge; nevertheless, there remains the opportunity to focus on common ground, establish a more mutually beneficial relationship, while also standing up for the multilateral system.

  <description>Immigration is one of the most contentious policy matters currently facing the EU. In this Director’s Cut of ‘The Sound of Economics’ Bruegel director Guntram Wolff welcomes Ana Palacio, member of the Spanish council of state and former foreign affairs minister, as well as Bruegel visiting fellow Elina Ribakova for a constructive discussion as to which approaches will yield the best results.&#13;
&#13;
Joining Bruegel director Guntram Wolff for this Director’s Cut of ‘The Sound of Economics’ is Ana Palacio, member of the Spanish council of state and former foreign affairs minister, and Elina Ribakova, Bruegel visiting fellow at Bruegel, to discuss the exact nature of the migration challenges currently troubling the EU.   &#13;
&#13;
Previous agreement upon the creation of disembarkation centres on the north African coast constitutes only a policy step rather than a resolution. Still very little has been done to draw up a common European migration policy and consensus remains difficult while&#13;
&#13;
Member States continue to operate their own independent, broadly disparate policies.&#13;
&#13;
Separating the concept of migration and refugees is also key to improving the general understanding of the challenges; likewise, being clear that the number of arrivals in the EU is now significantly lower than in 2015. &#13;
&#13;
There is also progress to be made in accepting that integration is a two-way street, and that legitimate concerns should not be written off without a hearing. &#13;
&#13;
For further reading, consider the Bruegel Blueprint publication [‘People on the move: migration and mobility in the European Union’](http://bruegel.org/2018/01/people-on-the-move-migration-and-mobility-in-the-european-union/), which contains a wealth of research on the various challenges that immigration poses to Europe’s policymakers. &#13;
&#13;
Also recommended is this blog post by Zsolt Darvas which illustrates that [Europe’s population growth would now be negative if it were not for the inflow of immigrants.](http://bruegel.org/2017/12/how-the-eu-has-become-an-immigration-area/)</description>

  <description>In the first episode of the new Backstage series on ‘The Sound of Economics’, Bruegel senior fellow Nicolas Véron takes time out from the Bruegel Annual Meetings to discuss the immediate future of European banking and capital markets union with Jörg Kukies, state secretary at the German ministry of finance.

The euro-area reform agenda hopes to prevent the repetition of problems that arose during the crisis at the beginning of this decade – to provide better protection for taxpayers and depositors and to avoid any perception of privilege for the banks of one country over those of another. Although there appears to be consensus on the necessity of completing banking union, the question remains open as to which elements are still missing.   

On the matter of capital markets union (CMU), though the current European Commission has given great emphasis to progressing with the project, we are still quite far from consensus on the exact shape that a more integrated supervisory framework should take.

This discussion gets into the details of the immediate challenges and the particular sticking points in negotiations over banking and capital markets union.  

For further reading, consider the [Policy Contribution on making a reality of Europe’s capital markets union](http://bruegel.org/2018/04/making-a-reality-of-europes-capital-markets-union/), co-written by Nicolas Véron, André Sapir and Guntram Wolff. Meanwhile, in a previous edition of the Director’s Cut podcast, Nicolas Véron discusses [the importance of developing deposit insurance as a part](http://bruegel.org/2018/04/directors-cut-developing-deposit-insurance-in-europe/) of Europe’s broader banking union aspirations.</description>

  <description>Bruegel senior fellow Zsolt Darvas joins Sean Gibson on ‘The Sound of Economics’ to expound on the themes of a Policy Contribution on the [macroeconomic implications of healthcare systems](http://bruegel.org/2018/08/the-macroeconomic-implications-of-healthcare/), which he has co-written with Nicolas Moës, Yana Myachenkova and David Pichler.

This episode is the first in a new Bruegel podcast series, ‘Deep Focus’, looking specifically at Bruegel research and elaborating on the insights contained therein, in conversation with the authors. 

The effects that healthcare systems can impose upon economies are pronounced and far-reaching. The health sector alone accounts for a significant portion of output and employment in the EU, even before we look at the pharmaceutical companies conducting research and development towards healthcare. From a fiscal point of view, health is one of the most expensive items on a government’s list of expenses.   

In this analysis, the scholars measured the efficiency of each EU healthcare system – and of several from beyond the EU’s borders. The results illustrate that improving healthcare outcomes is not as simple as investing more and more money in the system. In this podcast, we discuss some of the areas where real differences can be made both to the health of the general public and to the cost incumbent upon governments.

For further reading, consider our blog post digging into the details [of the ongoing lack of German public investment](http://bruegel.org/2018/06/understanding-the-lack-of-german-public-investment/), written by Alexander Roth and Guntram Wolff.</description>

  <description>Bruegel director Guntram Wolff welcomes Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and Jean Pisani-Ferry, mercator senior fellow at Bruegel, to discuss the deterioration of Turkey's economy.

Although a recent souring of relations with the US has provided the immediate prompt for Turkey's current crisis, the country's underlying economic malaise is more deeply rooted.   

Headlines have tracked the plummeting value of the lira, while the trust of external investors has been challenged by recent policy decisions. Though Turkey's case bears some of the hallmarks of a textbook emerging-market meltdown, there are key divergences. Meanwhile, President Erdogan's previous refutation of IMF policy recommendation does not bode well for potential assistance in the event that Turkey needs help brokering extension agreements with its creditors.   

In conversation with Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and Jean Pisani-Ferry, Mercator senior fellow at Bruegel, Guntram Wolff assesses not only the nature of the crisis in Turkey but how the country might navigate its way back to safer economic waters.

For further reading, consider the recent blog post written by Grégory Claeys and Guntram Wolff discussing how the EU might respond to the currency crisis unfolding in Turkey, including options for the EU to help Turkey in the absence of any agreed IMF assistance programme.</description>

<p>In conversation with Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and Jean Pisani-Ferry, Mercator senior fellow at Bruegel, Guntram Wolff assesses not only the nature of the crisis in Turkey but how the country might navigate its way back to safer economic waters.</p>

<p>For further reading, consider the recent blog post written by Grégory Claeys and Guntram Wolff discussing how the EU might respond to the currency crisis unfolding in Turkey, including options for the EU to help Turkey in the absence of any agreed IMF assistance programme.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description>More than two months after the Italian elections and its turbulent political negotiations, Italy finally has a new government. While this has had a calming effect on the financial markets, Italy's medium and long term economic outlook is yet to be determined. Bruegel affiliate fellow, Silvia Merler, is joined by Marcello Minenna, PhD lecturer at the London Graduate School and Head of Quants at Consob, and Lorenzo Codogno, LSE visiting professor, to examine the different ways the country can move forward.&#13;
&#13;
Starting off this Sound of Economics, Silvia examines the new government's policy priorities and discusses the message of uncertainty it sends to financial markets and investors. Indeed, the way in which the government will finance its promises is still uncertain, thus leaving room for unpredictability. In the short and medium term, Lorenzo puts forward the proposal that the new government should tread carefully by introducing policies gradually in order to maintain fiscal stability and discipline.&#13;
&#13;
The three guests address the widely discussed topic of Italy's euroscepticism. Italy's relatively stagnant economic growth over multiple generations is seen as a key factor in the country's present-day skepticism towards the single currency. They agree that, although an 'Italexit' is an unlikely scenario, it is nonetheless an important one to consider. Moreover, Marcello points out that Italy's situation is also a testament to ongoing issues at the European level, requiring a reform of the eurozone's policies and a tough look at its current functioning.</description>

  <description>Bruegel director Guntram Wolff and Ashoka Mody – visiting professor in international economic policy at Princeton University – explore subjects addressed in the latter’s latest book, Euro tragedy: a drama in nine acts.&#13;
&#13;
Kicking off this Director’s Cut of the 'The Sound of Economics', the two explore the historical development behind the EU's creation. Ashoka Mody argues that the adoption of the euro as a single currency has exacerbated economic divergences between EU Member States as some do not have the institutional maturity or capabilities to fully adopt monetary policy measures. Guntram Wolff points out that in the view of Helmut Kohl, the adoption of the euro was a means to further reunite the continent and support peace-building. They also discuss the role of social democracy in the drama on the future of Europe.&#13;
&#13;
The conversation from this episode explores the development of the EU from its early history until its present-day situation. Member States’ commitments to the European project from a political and economic point of view are touched upon, with a particular focus on Germany's role within the whole debate. For a more in-depth discussion on the subject, be sure to play back the full recording of the [Bruegel event](http://bruegel.org/events/euro-tragedy-a-drama-in-nine-acts/) chaired by Maria Demertzis and featuring Ashoka Mody and Guntram Wolff.</description>

  <description>According to Annamaria Lusadi, academic director at the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center, financial literacy requires both a knowledge of financial concepts and the confidence to make effective financial decisions in order to maximise one's well-being.

Financial literacy is not only limited to knowledge of monetary calculations, but is also measured by the extent to which individuals understand their financial rights and obligations, in addition to their ability to educate themselves on financial matters.

People are increasingly expected to have the appropriate skills to manage their own financial decisions; however, the rapidly shifting financial environment often proves to be extremely complex to understand and, thus, leaves many with poor financial literacy abilities. The young, the elderly, women, and people with low-education levels are particularly susceptible to the negatives effects of low financial literacy. The consequences of the situation are harmful both for the individual and at a national level.

Just as reading and writing skills are a part of the educational curriculum, Annamaria Lusadi believes that financial literacy courses should now be a requisite part of school programmes. Moreover, the adult population should also have access to workplace and public financial education programmes. All in all, good financial literacy skills have long-term beneficial effects; sound financial decisions take today's resources and invest them in the future. As a result, policy-makers should redouble their efforts in this area.

Maria Demertzis has co-authored a Bruegel Policy Contribution with Uuriintuya Batsaikhan on [financial literacy and inclusive growth in the European Union](http://bruegel.org/2018/05/financial-literacy-and-inclusive-growth-in-the-european-union/).

  <description>Paul Tucker, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, joins Bruegel director Guntram Wolff to discuss the thesis of his new book, as well as the current tensions within current models of central banking governance.&#13;
&#13;
On the agenda is the contention that there is, and even should be, a limit to the level of responsibility that a central bank can reasonably be expected to shoulder. Some decisions have such far-reaching consequences that we might prefer they be made by elected, rather than appointed, officials.&#13;
&#13;
[Paul Tucker presented his book in an event at Bruegel](http://bruegel.org/events/unelected-power-the-quest-for-legitimacy-in-central-banking-and-the-regulatory-state/) in May 2018, with Bruegel deputy director Maria Demertzis hosting a debate between Paul Tucker, Joanne Kellermann, former member of the Single Resolution Board, and Jean Pisani-Ferry, mercator senior fellow at Bruegel.&#13;

  <description>Technological advancements continue to drive change in every industry. In a recent working paper co-written with Francesco Chiacchio and David Pichler, Bruegel research fellow Georgios Petropoulos has explored the impact of the increasing number of robots on employment and wages in Europe.

The introduction of robots constitutes only one industrial advance among many, and each automated technology has different impacts on employment. The impacts across social strata can also be disparate.

In this episode of ‘The Sound of Economics’, Georgios Petropoulos discusses the findings of his study, which focuses on six EU countries (Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden) that account for 85% of robots in the EU market. Specifically this work sought to answer the question of whether robots have a positive or negative effect on EU employment and wages, and to place its conclusions in the context of other studies of automated technologies and their consequences for labour.

The research pertinent to this podcast can be found in our publication: ‘[The impact of industrial robots on EU employment and wages: A local labour market approach](http://bruegel.org/2017/04/do-we-understand-the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-employment/)’. Meanwhile, Georgios Petropoulos has previously detailed the specifics of [the growing presence of robots in EU industries in a Bruegel blog post](http://bruegel.org/2017/12/the-growing-presence-of-robots-in-eu-industries/).

He has also written an article questioning whether we understand the impact of artificial intelligence on employment.

  <itunes:summary>Technological advancements continue to drive change in every industry. In a recent working paper co-written with Francesco Chiacchio and David Pichler, Bruegel research fellow Georgios Petropoulos has explored the impact of the increasing number of robots on employment and wages in Europe.

The introduction of robots constitutes only one industrial advance among many, and each automated technology has different impacts on employment. The impacts across social strata can also be disparate.

In this episode of ‘The Sound of Economics’, Georgios Petropoulos discusses the findings of his study, which focuses on six EU countries (Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden) that account for 85% of robots in the EU market. Specifically this work sought to answer the question of whether robots have a positive or negative effect on EU employment and wages, and to place its conclusions in the context of other studies of automated technologies and their consequences for labour.

The research pertinent to this podcast can be found in our publication: ‘[The impact of industrial robots on EU employment and wages: A local labour market approach](http://bruegel.org/2017/04/do-we-understand-the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-employment/)’. Meanwhile, Georgios Petropoulos has previously detailed the specifics of [the growing presence of robots in EU industries in a Bruegel blog post](http://bruegel.org/2017/12/the-growing-presence-of-robots-in-eu-industries/).

He has also written an article questioning whether we understand the impact of artificial intelligence on employment.

  <description>The coalition agreement between Italy’s Five Star Movement and the League puts the country’s new government on a potential collision course with the European Union, and has prompted fears that the country could nosedive out of the euro zone.

Markets have already born witness to investor nervousness over the coalition’s proposed agenda, and the new government’s priorities run counter to the prevailing fiscal and monetary policies of the euro area. If Italy were to follow through on its new plans for spending, the expected reaction in among bond-buyers would make it very difficult for Italy to finance its already-significant amount of public debt.

Any discussion of a possible default necessarily involves the euro area – as Bruegel’s database of sovereign bond holdings illustrates. Just how exposed are the other members of the currency bloc, and what paths might be taken in order to avert a crisis?

In this week’s Director’s Cut, Bruegel senior fellow Francesco Papadia joins Guntram Wolff to assess the problems that currently occupy both Italy and the EU.

For further reading, note Guntram Wolff’s article on why Europe needs a strong Italy, whoever is leading the government.

Also consider looking at Jean Pisani-Ferry’s opinion piece on the opportunity that such political upheaval might offer Italy to overcome its longstanding internal issues.</description>

  <description>The global financial crisis exposed flaws in the methods and theories of macroeconomics. Certain aspects of the crisis were completely unexpected; other burgeoning problems were flagged up but explained away, and thus allowed to get worse.&#13;
&#13;
As the profession seeks to reinvent itself post-crisis and reassert its worth, what exactly has been learned and what changes have been made to the practice of macroeconomics? New models appear to be flourishing, but debate continues over whether we have improved our understanding and mitigated the potential for misreading the results that these models present.&#13;
&#13;
In this Director's Cut of 'The Sound of Economics' podcast, Bruegel deputy director hosts a conversation with Nicola Viegi, South African Reserve Bank professor of monetary economics at the University of Pretoria, and Frank Smets, director general of economics at the European Central Bank.   &#13;

  <description>The deepening and enlargement of Europe’s capital markets has long been a policy target for the EU – indeed, it is a flagship priority of the current Commission. Many legislative proposals have been forwarded, and there is widespread agreement on the necessity of the Capital Markets Union (CMU) project, but few tangible measures have been formally adopted.

Joining Bruegel director Guntram Wolff for this week’s Director’s Cut of ‘The Sound of Economics’ is Valdis Dombrovskis, vice-president of the European Commission, overseeing the department of Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union.

The Bruegel director met Vice-President Dombrovskis at the informal meeting of the EU’s Ecofin Council in Sofia, where the former presented a research paper (co-written by André Sapir and Nicolas Véron) advocating significant steps forward in the CMU project.

The vice-president here expounds on the Commission’s own planned measures to have significant initial elements in place before the end of the current term in 2019.</description>

  <description>The EU's transport sector is now a significant burden in the context of commitments made under the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon emissions. Transport is the only sector in which Europe's CO2 emissions are now higher than in 1990\.&#13;
&#13;
Countermeasures are imperative, but it is not a simple challenge to abandon car-friendly policies; policymakers are not blind to economic benefits brought about by the automotive industry in the past.&#13;
&#13;
In this episode of 'The Sound of Economics', Bruegel fellows Simone Tagliapietra and Georg Zachmann discuss the findings of a Policy Brief that they have co-written containing policy prescriptions for cleaning up Europe's transport sector.&#13;
&#13;
Utilising taxation, as well as funds already allocated within the current multiannual financial framework, the EU can incentivise change not only in the habits of Europe's citizens but its industry leaders too, promoting the policy discussion at country- and city-level where locally appropriate plans and changes can be introduced. Though the EU's research and development funding for transport is dwarfed by that of the continent's automotive sector, there are fields in which the EU can take the lead – fields which private money would otherwise leave undeveloped.</description>

  <description>As global trade war continues to unfold, Bruegel director Guntram Wolff is joined for this Director's Cut of 'The Sound of Economics' podcast by Bernd Lange MEP, chair of the Committee on International Trade (INTA), to discuss Europe's options.&#13;
&#13;
Increasingly it appears that the EU will have to choose between standing strong with the established laws of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), or striking a deal for a permanent reprieve from the US trade tariffs.&#13;
&#13;
There is no question that [the tariffs have significant implications for European industry](http://bruegel.org/2018/03/which-sectors-would-be-most-vulnerable-to-eu-us-trade-war/). Indeed, as the US and China brandish lists of further products on which they would consider imposing tariffs, the full scale of the potential future damage to EU exporters is unclear. Yet there remains some hope that the EU could align with other nations to use the WTO to bring US President Trump back on side.&#13;

<p>Increasingly it appears that the EU will have to choose between standing strong with the established laws of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), or striking a deal for a permanent reprieve from the US trade tariffs.</p>

<p>There is no question that <a href="http://bruegel.org/2018/03/which-sectors-would-be-most-vulnerable-to-eu-us-trade-war/">the tariffs have significant implications for European industry</a>. Indeed, as the US and China brandish lists of further products on which they would consider imposing tariffs, the full scale of the potential future damage to EU exporters is unclear. Yet there remains some hope that the EU could align with other nations to use the WTO to bring US President Trump back on side.</p>

<p>To discuss what opportunities as well as threats this current stand-off presents to the EU, Bernd Lange - member of the European Parliament and chair of the Committee on International Trade (INTA) - joins Bruegel director Guntram Wolff in this instalment of &#39;The Sound of Economics&#39;.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <description>In this week’s Director’s Cut of ‘The Sound of Economics’ podcast, Bruegel director Guntram Wolff talks with Nicolas Véron, senior fellow at Bruegel, about the implementation of a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), one of the three pillars needed for the completion of banking union.  

Significant progress has been made on European banking supervision and resolution schemes, but the debate on a common framework for deposit insurance has remained stuck since the first consistent proposal in 2012.

Member States are currently enjoying their own deposit insurance system, an example of financial fragmentation through the various national differentiations of policy instruments. The Cyprus case highlights the flaws of a national-level system, based only on a presumption of financial assistance between Member States in case of bail-out.

The financial crisis has proven this is not sufficient. Referring to his own research, Nicolas Véron, senior fellow at Bruegel, recommends strengthening trust by setting up a fully integrated, country-blind deposit insurance system to break the vicious circle of the linkage between banks and sovereign debt.

In this episode of ‘The Sound of Economics’, Nicolas Véron joins Bruegel director Guntram Wolff to debate the implementation and advantages of such a common system, aiming in the long-term at the completion of a harmonised banking union.</description>

  <description>Proponents of blockchain see it as the future – but when might it become the present? In this latest episode of ‘The Sound of Economics’ we welcome Julio Faura, global head of innovation at Banco Santander, and Johan Pouwelse, associate professor at Delft University of Technology, to help illuminate the blockchain concept and where it could be taking us.

The development and implementation of blockchain networks is meant to give everyone an opportunity to participate in a market that is not controlled by a central body.

Questions remain, however, over the practicality of blockchain networks; how to transition from proof-of-concept to real-world usefulness, how to integrate with and provide benefits for the world economy, and where the greatest benefits of such decentralisation might lie.

Shining a light on the brave new blockchain world in this latest episode of ‘The Sound of Economics’ is Julio Faura, the global head of innovation at Banco Santander, and Johan Pouwelse, associate professor at Delft University of Technology and found of the Tribler peer-to-peer service.

Both Julio Faura and Johan Pouwelse participated in the Bruegel event ‘The implications of blockchain platforms’, video and audio recordings of which can be reviewed on our events page. </description>

  <description>**In this week’s Director’s Cut of ‘The Sound of Economics’ podcast, Bruegel director Guntram Wolff hosts a discussion with Bruegel fellows Alicia García-Herrero and André Sapir on where Europe will position itself between the two major trading powers of China and the United States if relations continue to cool.**&#13;
&#13;
Bruegel director Guntram Wolff begins his regular Director’s Cut of ‘The Sound of Economics’ podcast with a broad assessment of the recent fomentation of global trade tension, joined in conversation by Bruegel fellows Alicia García-Herrero and André Sapir.&#13;
&#13;
Amid escalating trade tensions, Europe is still working out where it stands between China and the United States. Reprieved – for now at least – of inclusion in the US tariff on steel and aluminium imports, the EU remains regretful of the prospect of global trade war.&#13;
&#13;
China, and Asia more broadly, faces a range of difficulties in the event of a tariff tit-for-tat. Some countries will have to choose where they align themselves; other countries will not have the option to choose.&#13;
&#13;
For a more in-depth look at global trade balances, consider [Nicolas Moës recent Bruegel blog post](http://bruegel.org/2018/02/is-it-a-transatlantic-transpacific-or-eurasian-global-economy/) data on bilateral trade, services, investment and protectionism between Asia, Europe and the US in recent years.&#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile, Francesco Chiacchio has written [another blog post](http://bruegel.org/2018/03/which-sectors-would-be-most-vulnerable-to-eu-us-trade-war/) identifying which sectors would be most vulnerable to any deterioration in relations between the EU and the US.</description>

  <description>Ongoing negotiations over the next multiannual financial framework represent an opportunity for the EU to support its new priorities, such as increased investment in border control and defence.

However, new investment necessitates either an expansion in the size of the budget or cuts to other sectors – each a difficult sell to different Member States. Brexit compounds the problem of finding funds for the seven-year framework, which will run from 2021-27.

The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) accounts for a sizeable portion of the current budget, and Bruegel director Guntram Wolff here elaborates on the possibility of freeing up more space in the budget by freezing funding for CAP – either in real or nominal terms – based on a research paper he has co-authored with Bruegel senior fellow Zsolt Darvas.

Joining the conversation in this episode of ‘The Sound of Economics’ is Lars Hoelgaard, former deputy director general at the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, who explores specific options for reforming the CAP.</description>

  <description>Bruegel senior fellow André Sapir clarifies the UK's options for a new relationship with the EU in the wake of Brexit.&#13;
&#13;
The UK's position relative to the European Union following Brexit remains undecided. With negotiations ongoing, Bruegel senior fellow André Sapir explains the UK's options, and explores the scope for a new kind of relationship between the two parties.&#13;
&#13;
This latest episode of 'The Sound of Economics' considers what it might mean, in reality, for the UK to remain in a customs union with the EU but to leave the single market, as well as what the examples of Turkey and Norway can indicate about the UK's potential future dealings with the EU.&#13;
&#13;
André Sapir has also co-authored a blog post with Bruegel deputy director, Maria Demertzis, elaborating on the various paths open to the UK [in phase two of the Brexit negotiations](http://bruegel.org/2017/12/brexit-phase-two-and-beyond-the-future-of-the-eu-uk-relationship/).&#13;
&#13;
Maria Demertzis has more recently considered [in a blog post](http://bruegel.org/2018/02/why-a-good-brexit-outcome-matters-and-its-not-just-the-economy-stupid/) why a positive Brexit outcome matters not just for the UK, but for the EU too.</description>

  <description>Bruegel director Guntram Wolff frames the two debates that will dominate the upcoming meeting of the European Council on 23 February 2018 – the shape of the next EU budget, and the method by which a new European Commission president will be appointed.&#13;
&#13;
Major questions still hang over the next EU budget, or multiannual financial framework (MFF), and not just because of Brexit.&#13;
&#13;
The next budget, another seven-year MFF that will run from 2021 through to 2027, will likely reflect Europe’s developing priorities in sectors such as defence, border control and fighting climate change. Other sectors may face a cut in spending, particularly given the shortfall left as a result of the UK’s departure.&#13;
&#13;
Elsewhere, the European Council and European Parliament have still to reach agreement over the future of the Spitzenkandidaten process, by which the appointment of current European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker was decided in 2014\.&#13;
&#13;
These topics are lead items on the agenda for the European Council meeting on February 23\. Bruegel director Guntram Wolff features in this episode of ‘The Sound of Economics’, highlighting the key considerations and likely deciding factors in the debates still to be had.</description>

  <description>**Bruegel fellow Georg Zachmann joins Richard Tol, professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Sussex, and Pieter-Willem Lemmens, head of analysis at the climate policy think-tank Sandbag, for this episode of 'The Sound of Economics', to discuss the impact of Brexit on climate and energy policy in the European Union**

Britain's departure from the European Union poses questions not only for the EU energy market, but the bloc-wide climate-change targets and emissions trading system.

Presented by Sean Gibson, edited by Giuseppe Porcaro

In the energy context, Brexit not only marks the separation of Britain from the EU but also places Ireland in a uniquely difficult position, having previously utilised infrastructure in Britain to connect to the rest of the EU.

On the matter of climate change, the loss of Britain might make it more difficult for Europe to meet current targets, and set further ambitious goals for the future.

In this episode of 'The Sound of Economics', senior Bruegel fellow Georg Zachmann joins the conversation with Richard Tol, professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Sussex, and Pieter-Willem Lemmens, head of analysis at the climate policy think-tank Sandbag.

Georg Zachmann co-authored a research paper in November 2017 for the European Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, about the impact of Brexit on the Irish energy system - also writing a Bruegel blog post on the same topic. More recently Georg has written an opinion piece on how climate-change policies risk increasing social inequality.</description>

  <description>The final document on the German coalition agreement will have significant consequences for the European Union and the Eurozone. Bruegel director Guntram Wolff gives his assessment of the agreement's key features in this episode of 'The Sound of Economics'&#13;
&#13;
The negotiations to form the next German government have been a significant factor in European affairs for months now. With an agreement finally struck, this episode of 'The Sound of Economics' sees Bruegel director Guntram Wolff analyse the document of the agreement and what it means for the EU.&#13;
&#13;
In short, there is a lot of continuity: the Bundestag remains in charge of the European Stability Mechanism, and the EU's fiscal rules are praised; there will be money for the EU budget, too. More significant is the will to move towards a common tax base and minimum tax rate for corporate taxation. Overall, this is not a breakthrough for Europe.&#13;

  <description>SUMMARY:   &#13;
&#13;
Manufacturing in its 21st century guise is markedly different from its traditional portrayal. Innovations are not only improving the efficiency of production processes but are also allowing for the establishment of more complex supply chains, with smarter communications systems and big-data management systems driven by an increasing digitalisation.&#13;
&#13;
Companies in a variety of sectors in Europe are having to adapt quickly to keep pace with the change. In this episode of the Sound of Economics, Simone Tagliapietra discusses how the established energy companies are ensuring they stay relevant in this new age; J. Scott Marcus elaborates on the opportunities thus far missed in Europe to make e-commerce work better for everyone; and Reinhilde Veugelers looks at what Europe needs to do to maintain a global presence as new manufacturing takes hold, and what lessons might be learnt from elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
Each of these three scholars has contributed significant research to the Bruegel Blueprint publication ['Remaking Europe: the new manufacturing as an engine for growth'](http://bruegel.org/2017/09/remaking-europe/), which explores the topic of new manufacturing in Europe across many sectors.&#13;

  <description>The issue of member-state integration in two or more speeds is one of the recurring questions in the debate about the European project. While previously this was a subject for academic circles, it has now moved into policy circles. Is this the future of Europe? Would the idea of proceeding in two or more speeds provoke a break-up of the EU? Is it an opportunity for each country to rethink and renew its commitments to the European project? 

In this episode of the Sound of Economics, Bruegel's deputy director, Maria Demertzis, asks some of these questions to Sandro Gozi, Italy's State Secretary for European Affairs.

Currently, the organisation of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) is based on a sectoral approach with one ESA for each sector: separate authorities for banking, insurance, and securities and markets. Maijoor's institution, ESMA, is an independent EU Authority that contributes to safeguarding the stability of the European Union's financial system by enhancing the protection of investors and promoting stable and orderly financial markets.

  <description>Bruegel’s Alicia García-Herrero and Robin Niblett of Chatham House discuss a new joint report on EU-China relations. How easy was it to find common ground with Chinese partners? And what should be the priorities for economic cooperation between Europe and China?

In this episode of The Sound of Economics, we host a conversation between Alicia García-Herrero and Robin Niblett. Our guests talk about a new joint report, EU–China Economic Relations to 2025, produced by four leading institutes in Europe and China.

They discuss the process of finding common ground between the authors, and draw out some of the most interesting findings. It turns out that the most obvious sphere for EU-China economic cooperation, trade and investment, might be the most difficult. So what could be the next step for Europe and China?

  <description>In this episode of The Sound of Economics we focus on trade multilateralism. What are the advantages of a multilateral approach to trade, and what are the risks? What challenges is the global trade system facing, and how should Europe react?
Bruegel’s André Sapir explains the benefits of multilateral trade agreements, and calls on society’s to find ways to compensate those who lose out. Arancha González, executive director of the International Trade Center, makes a strong case against protectionsism. Petra Pinzler, journalist and author, highlights the weaknesses in some narrow economic thinking about trade and argues for better quality trade agreements that empower states. And Guntram Wolff, Bruegel’s director, discusses Europe’s place in the multilateral trade system.

  <description>This episode of The Sound of Economics focuses on the banking system in Europe and some of the challenges it is facing. The financial crisis made it clear that more should be done to create conditions for a safer financial system. The EU has taken measures to do that, and one of those measures is the creation of the banking union, which implies bringing all instruments of the banking sector policy to the eurozone level.&#13;
&#13;
Nicolas Véron explains to which extent the banking union has been completed, and shares his assessment on how successful the implementation of the new framework has been so far. While there are some aspects of the framework that can already be assessed, it seems that addressing the issues of Italian banks will be the first big test of how it will function in practice. Silvia Merler shares her opinion on the situation in Italy and reforms that have been taken so far.&#13;
&#13;
One of the key aspects of the banking union is the creation of the European deposit insurance scheme, which has proven to be the most challenging part of completing the banking union. Dirk Schoenmaker reflects on the topic.&#13;
&#13;
Our guests go on to discuss how Brexit will affect the European banking and which risks and opportunities it might bring. Finally, they identify some of the challenges that the European banking system will have to address in the longer run.&#13;

  <description>This episode of The Sound of Economics focuses on labour mobility in Europe. Anti-immigration sentiment is on the rise due to the perception that immigrants are taking away jobs and benefits. But what is the real impact of migration on European labour markets? What are the economic challenges for migrants and how do these challenges impact on social integration? These are some of the questions we explore with our guests.&#13;
&#13;
Alessandra Venturini speaks about the perception of migrants and how it differs from research findings. Samuel Engblom argues that the impact of migration on labour markets depends on political choices, and that it varies between countries. Anna Ilyina discusses IMF research on the economic impact of emigration from Eastern Europe, and Maria Demertzis emphasises the effect of migration on sending countries.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, our guests debate what the ideal policy response to migration should be, and how perception of migration could be improved.&#13;

  <description>This episode of The Sound of Economics focuses on artificial intelligence (AI). The important technological advancements in computer science and information systems move us towards the artificial intelligence era with the creation of computing machines and systems that perform operations analogous to human learning and decision making. How will our lives change in this new era?&#13;
&#13;
Robert Atkinson shares his opinion on how AI will develop in the future and what we can expect from this development. Anna Byhovskaya addresses the widespread perception that AI will replace jobs as we know them. Is that a myth to be debunked or something we should be ready for? Merja Kyllönen discusses the role of legislators in the process of AI advancement, and Georgios Petropoulos emphasises other important issues to consider, such as the role of companies.&#13;
&#13;
Our guests go on to discuss the specific ways in which AI might change the nature of work. They also debate whether it will have an impact on politics and the political process. Finally, they discuss what they think will be the biggest change resulting from AI development.&#13;

  <description>This year marks the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which started the process of European integration. This presents an opportunity to reflect on the progress that has been made so far, and to discuss what Europeans can expect in the future. We explore some of the central questions on this topic with our guests.

Europe is facing a period of doubt and uncertainty, but this is not the first time it has faced a crisis. We begin this episode by asking Emmanuel Mourlon-Druol how today's challenges compare to previous periods where Europe has faced difficulties. Ivan Krastev goes on to discuss how much control Europe has over its decision-making, and to what extent it responds to external circumstances.

As uncertainty especially affects the younger generation of Europeans, Johanna Nyman examines how young people perceive the future of Europe and what they have to look forward to. Guntram Wolff shares his view on what Europeans should be hopeful about, and what they should worry about.

Our guests go on to debate what Europe can offer its citizens and what questions it will have to answer to move forward. Finally they reflect on the impact of the Treaty of Rome over the last 60 years.

SPEAKERS

Emmanuel Mourlon-Druol, Non-resident fellow, Bruegel

Ivan Krastev, Chairman of the Centre for Liberal Strategies ,Sofia and Permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences, Vienna

Johanna Nyman, Expert on youth policy and human rights

Guntram B. Wolff, Director, Bruegel

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year marks the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which started the process of European integration. This presents an opportunity to reflect on the progress that has been made so far, and to discuss what Europeans can expect in the future. We explore some of the central questions on this topic with our guests.</p>

<p>Europe is facing a period of doubt and uncertainty, but this is not the first time it has faced a crisis. We begin this episode by asking Emmanuel Mourlon-Druol how today&#39;s challenges compare to previous periods where Europe has faced difficulties. Ivan Krastev goes on to discuss how much control Europe has over its decision-making, and to what extent it responds to external circumstances.</p>

<p>As uncertainty especially affects the younger generation of Europeans, Johanna Nyman examines how young people perceive the future of Europe and what they have to look forward to. Guntram Wolff shares his view on what Europeans should be hopeful about, and what they should worry about.</p>

<p>Our guests go on to debate what Europe can offer its citizens and what questions it will have to answer to move forward. Finally they reflect on the impact of the Treaty of Rome over the last 60 years.</p>

<p>SPEAKERS</p>

<p>Emmanuel Mourlon-Druol, Non-resident fellow, Bruegel</p>

<p>Ivan Krastev, Chairman of the Centre for Liberal Strategies ,Sofia and Permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences, Vienna</p>

<p>Johanna Nyman, Expert on youth policy and human rights</p>

<p>Guntram B. Wolff, Director, Bruegel</p>

  <description>This episode of The Sound of Economics focuses on non-performing loans (NPLs), a pressing issue for Europe's banks. The financial crisis and the recession that followed left European banks with € 1 trillion of NPLs. This has a negative impact on banks, borrowers, and the wider European economy.

A range of experts offer insights into why NPLs are a challenge for banks, and why they are a problem for the European economy as a whole. They also discuss cultural differences in our relationship with debts, and how NPLs affect borrowers and undermine entrepreneurship.

NPLs are a big issue for the European economy, and the show's guests explore how this issue can be solved. They explain what NPL workout entails, and assess Europe's progress in streamlining the process. Asset Management Companies (AMCs), so-called &quot;bad banks&quot; are part of the solution, and this episode asks if a European approach to AMCs can be effective. And finally, since both banks and borrowers are negatively affected by NPLs, we address the difficult question of who should bear the loss.</description>

  <description>In this episode of “The Sound of Economics” we examine the issue of inclusive growth and inequality in Europe.

We asked Zsolt Darvas, Senior Fellow at Bruegel, to explain us how is it possible to define and measure inclusive growth.

We spoke to Jana Hainsworth, President of the Social Platform, about the negative effects of social inequalities.

We also asked her which new policies should be implemented to support inclusive growth. Luca Visentini, Secretary General of the European Trade Unions Confederation, and Markus J. Beyrer, Director General of Businesseurope, also shared their opinion.

Finally, Zsolt Darvas highlighted the key policy recommendations from the Bruegel Blueprint “An Anatomy of inclusive growth”.

  <description>In this episode of The Sound of Economics, we focus on trade relations between the EU and China.

We asked Alicia Garcia Herrero, Senior Fellow at Bruegel, where relations between China and the EU stand at the moment, and why their trade relations are so important.

Currently the US seems more interested in the Pacific than its Atlantic alliance. Does this situation leave any room for the EU and China to get closer? We asked Pascal Lamy, former General Director- of the World Trade Organisation.

Lawrence Lau, Professor of Economics at the University of Hong Kong, told us why he believes that both China and the EU can benefit from closer relations.

We spoke with Jianwei Xu, Visiting Scholar at Bruegel, about the effects of Brexit on the EU-China relations: what would happen if the UK strikes a free trade agreement with China before the EU does?

Finally we discussed the Chinese Belt and Road initiative, which aims to reduce transportation costs between China and the EU.  We asked professor Lau what this initiative entails, and Alicia shared her opinion on potential opportunities and dangers that the initiative can bring to Europe.

  <description>In this episode of The Sound of Economics, we discuss the issue of indebtedness and debt resolution with Carmen Reinhart, Professor of the International Financial System at the Harvard Kennedy School.

Professor Reinhart highlights the scale of the debt overhang in many advanced economies. She also presents evidence that deleveraging has been notably slow since the last global financial crisis.

She discusses how this overhang is affecting the speed of recovery, and calls for debt restructuring – especially in the private sector.

We also hear from Bruegel Research Fellow Maria Demertzis, who explains the significance of non-performing loans and argues for simplified bankruptcy laws.

  <description>In this episode of The Sound of Economics, a panel of experts from Bruegel and the Financial Times discuss the outlook for the UK and Europe.

There is still a lot of uncertainty about the future, but some key questions are becoming clear.

What will be the impact of Brexit on politics and business?
Is the UK retracting not only from Europe, but also from globalisation?
How should Europe react to what is happening in the UK, and could the EU offer any flexibility on migration and ECJ jurisdiction?

This episode was recorded in conjunction with a Bruegel/Financial Times event about Brexit. Notes from this event, along with video and audio recordings, are available on the event page: http://bruegel.org/events/ft/

  <description>This episode of The Sound of Economics focuses on innovation. There is widespread agreement that innovation is vital for European economy, but how can we get from smart ideas to economic growth?

We asked Reinhilde Veugelers, Senior Fellow at Bruegel, why innovation matters for our economies, and why it is important for the components of the innovation system to be interconnected.

Dominique Guellec, Head of Science and Technological Policy in the Directorate of Science at the OECD, to shared with us his opinion on the main weaknesses in European innovation.

We also spoke with Scott Stern, Professor of Management of Technology at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He outlined why he believes Europe needs to think local if it wants to get the full economic benefit of innovation.

We asked Karen Wilson, another Senior Fellow at Bruegel, why Europe seems to fare badly on this compared to other regions such as the US. She stressed the importance of completing the Single Market to support high-growth firms.

Access to capital is a vital factor for expansion of innovative firms. Karen shared her opinion on what the EU can do on this topic, while Reinhilde discussed why funding for innovative growth should come from capital markets.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This episode of The Sound of Economics focuses on innovation. There is widespread agreement that innovation is vital for European economy, but how can we get from smart ideas to economic growth?</p>

<p>We asked Reinhilde Veugelers, Senior Fellow at Bruegel, why innovation matters for our economies, and why it is important for the components of the innovation system to be interconnected.</p>

<p>Dominique Guellec, Head of Science and Technological Policy in the Directorate of Science at the OECD, to shared with us his opinion on the main weaknesses in European innovation.</p>

<p>We also spoke with Scott Stern, Professor of Management of Technology at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He outlined why he believes Europe needs to think local if it wants to get the full economic benefit of innovation.</p>

<p>We asked Karen Wilson, another Senior Fellow at Bruegel, why Europe seems to fare badly on this compared to other regions such as the US. She stressed the importance of completing the Single Market to support high-growth firms.</p>

<p>Access to capital is a vital factor for expansion of innovative firms. Karen shared her opinion on what the EU can do on this topic, while Reinhilde discussed why funding for innovative growth should come from capital markets.</p>

  <description>In this episode of The Sound of Economics, we focus the issue of decarbonisation and the fight against climate change.

Decarbonisation is at the heart of EU energy and climate policy. And the recent ratification of the Paris Agreement makes decarbonisation targets some of the EU’s most important international commitments.

Progress towards the 2020 targets has been impressive. But the 2020 framework is now being replaced by new targets. The EU wants an 80-95 percent reduction in emissions by 2050, with an intermediate target of 40 percent by 2030.

We asked Simone Tagliapietra, Research Fellow at Bruegel, what progress the EU has already made towards its climate targets and what will change with the new emission targets.

We also spoke with Georg Zachmann, Senior Research Fellow at Bruegel, about the recent drop in Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions and the future of EU’s emission trading scheme.

Lászlo Varro, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, shared his insights on which energy sources will be most important in the future.

We discussed with Connie Hedegaard, former European Commissioner for Climate Action, which other sectors need to be prioritised in the fight against climate change.

Each episode will look at a key economic policy debate, discuss why it is important and explore some of the work that Bruegel's researchers have done in the area.

This episode is about European fiscal rules.

EPISODE 1

The strong fiscal tightening implemented in many European countries since 2010 has contributed to the poor economic recovery in Europe. This raises doubts about the effectiveness of the EU’s fiscal rules in achieving their two main objectives: public debt sustainability and fiscal stabilisation.

A key indicator in the framework is the structural budget balance, but it is very difficult to measure. Recommendations made based on the structural budget balance are often revised when initial estimates turn out to be wrong.

Another problem with the current EU fiscal framework is the opaque web of ‘flexibility’ clauses. This leads to never-ending bargaining between member states and the European Commission about the implementation of the rules, which undermines trust in them.

A recent Bruegel policy contribution by Gregory Claeys, Zsolt Darvas and Alvaro Leandro analyses and assesses the framework and proposes a new set of rules.
