			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiffany, 52, would like to lose about 5 kilos. For many years, she’s worried about what to eat, and believes that if she could only learn to “think like a thin person,” she could stop focusing so much on food. And that would in turn help her to lose weight. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiffany also holds a variety of other beliefs around food and body, such as what her ideal weight should be, that weight loss should be effortless, that she should never overeat, and many more. And she’s not alone: all of us hold beliefs about our health, bodies, and our patterns with food.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as Marc David teaches, many of the beliefs we hold end up getting in the way of achieving the goals we hold so dear.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the thing: it’s natural to focus on food when we’re trying to lose weight. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, what so many people don’t realize is that nutritional changes alone don’t automatically lead to weight loss. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s because weight challenges arise from the level of our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. In order to create lasting change, we have to do more than tinker with our nutrition – and instead dive into the key mindset issues that hold us back. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So be sure to tune into this fascinating episode, where we take a closer look at the psychology of weight loss, as well as the key nutritional, metabolic, and mind body factors that are influenced by our thoughts and beliefs about food. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">---------------</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about us at The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:</span> <a href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://psychologyofeating.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same. 👉Tune into The Ultimate Health Coach webinar here:</span> <a href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/become-a-coach-h/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://psychologyofeating.com/become-a-coach-h/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow us on social: </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- YouTube:</span> <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/c/Psychologyofeating"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://www.youtube.com/c/Psychologyofeating</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Facebook:</span> <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Instagram:</span> <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Pinterest:</span> <a href= "https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#psychologyofweightloss #weight #bodyimage #eatingpsychology #limitingbeliefs #mindset #selfcontrol #sustainableweightloss #selflove #bodypositivity #bodyconfidence #foodfreedom #marcdavid #psychologyofeating</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy, 48, would like to be more present in her body but multiple life experiences seem to stand in her way. After having mostly recovered from a frightening journey with multiple sclerosis (MS), Amy may have regained her health, but is realizing that her relationship with her body and sexuality is now calling out for healing at a deeper level. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you’ll hear, Amy’s story with food and body go way back to childhood, when she had the startling experience of rapid puberty-related changes. One day she had the body of a child, and the next, the body of a woman. She began attracting unwanted attention from men, and could tell that all her family and friends were highly uncomfortable with her body. This imprinted a deep sense of shame and a desire to hide her femininity, which has continued on into adulthood. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key concepts highlighted in this session is that “imprint vulnerability,” something that often occurs during the hormonal shifts of puberty. And as Marc shares, this early imprinted experience can become something that negatively influences the rest of us our life until we identify it, and retrain our brains and bodies to experience life in a different way.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this episode demonstrates, it’s natural to “zip up” our emotions in the face of traumatic life experiences. But it’s our job to learn how to not zip up, and instead metabolize the deep emotions that surface along the journey of life.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t miss this incredibly powerful episode exploring puberty, sexuality, illness, weight gain, and so much more.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">---------------</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about us at The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:</span> <a href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://psychologyofeating.com/</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same. 👉Tune into The Ultimate Health Coach webinar here:</span> <a href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/become-a-coach-h/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://psychologyofeating.com/become-a-coach-h/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow us on social: </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- YouTube:</span> <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/c/Psychologyofeating"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://www.youtube.com/c/Psychologyofeating</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Facebook:</span> <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Instagram:</span> <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Pinterest:</span> <a href= "https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#sexuality #illness #weight #selfconfidence #bodyimage #healthysexuality #pubertychallenges #healingtrauma #feminineembodiment #multiplesclerosis #selfworth #innerchildhealing #relationshipwithfood #marcdavid #eatingpsychology</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marc works with Lori, 57, who has been dieting for nearly 40 years. She’s exhausted from thinking about food and weight constantly, but still feels attached to losing weight. She believes she’d feel more accomplished once she loses the weight, and that how she feels on the inside would finally match the outside. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lori has lost weight in the past, and initially feels more confident. But somehow that starts to go away, and she gradually falls back into eating her favorite high-fat foods. And that inevitably brings the weight back. At these times, Lori asks herself what triggers her old behaviors so that she can avoid slipping back into the diet cycle yet again, but comes up short on answers.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Marc explains, people carry weight for many different reasons, including medical, metabolic, nutritional, food-related, and emotional. But regardless of the root cause, those of us who have focused on weight loss our entire lives have often never experienced their essential self, free from any weight loss goal. As they explore, taking the time to discover what fulfills us and who we are beyond our body’s shape and size is essential to finding the happiness we’re looking for. And it’s also important in our efforts to lose weight, as a negative mindset creates a physiological stress response that can cause us to become weight loss resistant.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">---------------</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about us at The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:</span> <a href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://psychologyofeating.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">👉 We’re now enrolling for The Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training!

Now the heaviest she’s ever been with about 100 pounds she’d like to lose, Kiersten is wondering where to go from here.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, Marc works with 41-year old Lisa who is battling body image challenges. She frequently judges her body, and often compares herself to others. She’d like to lose about 10 pounds, but more than anything she just wants to be free of body judgment. She knows she can find a happier and more peaceful relationship with herself, she just doesn’t quite know how.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they explore in her coaching session, Lisa learned early on as an 8-year old soccer player. She remembers noticing other girls’ legs, comparing hers to theirs, and wondering if hers were “right.” A lot of life has been lived since then - she’s grown up, been married, gotten divorced, switched careers, and is now in a wonderful new relationship with a man who loves her appearance. But she still finds that old familiar voice of comparison and judgment present at different times.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you’ll hear, Marc coaches Lisa and the rest of us who are challenged with body image to embrace self-awareness before trying to get to the holy grail of self-acceptance. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of what they explore:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">✅</span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The role of cultural conditioning around competition and “winning” when it comes to weight and body image</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">✅</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">The gift of maturation that arrives around the age of 40 for both women and men, and how the “Queen-in-Training” (or “King-in-Training”) archetypes can help us overcome challenges with body image</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">✅</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">Why having a “perfect” weight number in your head is an unhelpful concept</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">✅</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">How fear of gaining weight creates a stress response in our body, which in turn makes it harder for the body to lose weight</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">✅</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">And much more…</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">---------------</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about us at The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:</span> <a href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">https://psychologyofeating.com/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">👉 We’re now enrolling for The Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training!

And that’s a great thing. But sometimes, we can start to worry and overanalyze our food choices. Taken to its extreme, that can lead to orthorexia, a type of eating disorder characterized by an obsession around making healthy food choices. </span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> In this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast, you’ll meet Caitlin, 26, who would like to let go of worrying so much about what to eat.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Many of us who are into health and wellness learn to be discerning in our choices around food and nutrition. And that’s a great thing. But sometimes, we can start to worry and overanalyze our food choices. Taken to its extreme, that can lead to orthorexia, a type of eating disorder characterized by an obsession around making healthy food choices.     In this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast, you’ll meet Caitlin, 26, who would like to let go of worrying so much about what to eat. For a period of time, Caitlin was experiencing health challenges and wanted to understand which foods would make her feel better. But after watching numerous documentaries on the dark side of food production and manufacturing, she grew in her words  “paranoid  and freaked out” about some of the foods she had been eating. Eager to free herself from these worries and learn how to live a simple, healthy life, Caitlin turns to the Institute’s lead teacher and host of the podcast, Marc David, for help.    Don’t miss this highly-relatable episode!    ---------------    Learn more about  us at  The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     We’re now enrolling for The Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.

She was trained as a health coach, which she thought would help her find clarity about what to eat — but it only seemed to create more uncertainty about what foods are truly best for her health and well-being. The experts she follows in the health and nutrition space all seem to contradict each other, and so does the research.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Tareshvari  (Tish)  from  Australia  joins Marc David for this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast. Tish, 59,  finds herself in a place of deep nutritional confusion. She was trained as a health coach, which she thought would help her find clarity about what to eat — but it only seemed to create more uncertainty about what foods are truly best for her health and well-being. The experts she follows in the health and nutrition space all seem to contradict each other, and so does the research. Listen into this powerful episode to learn how you can get out of nutritional confusion and find the eating style that works for your unique body.    Key Insights:      There’s a lot of conflicting information about food, eating, and weight loss.  Knowing how to choose what’s right for your unique body can be understandably confusing.      The  science of nutrition is still in its nascent stages, which is  one of the reasons there’s so much conflicting information.       An important distinction for all of us is the concept of being a nutritional explorer: someone who acknowledges the unique and changing physiological needs of their own body, and who is willing to experiment to find what foods help the body thrive.      So many of us are looking for the  “one  perfect diet” that we can follow for the rest of our life. But this isn’t realistic given the changing needs of the body. Things like stress, illness, age, and more all influence our body’s nutritional needs at any given time. Tuning into our body and following our intuition is as important as following the latest research or listening to our favorite health experts.      Nutritional confusion versus nutritional uncertainty are very different. Confusion keeps us paralyzed and feeling torn in many directions, while uncertainty recognizes that we simply haven’t quite figured it out yet. When it comes to our relationship with food and body, be careful about the words you use as they deeply influence our eating challenges.     ---------------    Learn more about  us at  The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     We’re now enrolling for The Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast, guest coaching client Diana works with eating psychology teacher, Marc David. Diana, 57, has been trying for at least 16 years to lose about 40 pounds to no avail. Told that she has metabolic resistance, her latest functional medicine doctor has told her she may never be able to lose the weight. With several autoimmune conditions and having gone into early menopause, Diana is confused about what’s going on with her body and whether weight loss in the cards for her.    In her eating psychology coaching session with Marc, they explore some of the key underlying causes that may be behind her weight loss resistance, including hormonal imbalance, prediabetes, and possible heavy metal toxicity.     Key Insights:       Examining all potential underlying causes for metabolic resistance is key, and working with a naturopath or functional medicine practitioner is recommended      Why low calorie diets can cause weight loss resistance      If we’re living a healthy lifestyle and have excluded causal factors for weight loss resistance, how we learn to adapt to the body we have now      Part of this internal conversation? Identifying what we can do to have the best chances for a healthy life, and not living the mindset of  “if  I don’t lose weight, I will never be healthy.”      How gentle exercise supports a healthy weight and body, and the particular benefits of sweating and infrared saunas    ---------------    Learn more about  us at  The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     We’re now enrolling for The Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Marc David  coaches  43-year-old  clinical nutritionist,  Jenny, who would like lose twenty pounds. At 14, Jenny moved to the United States from Russia, and almost immediately gained weight, which she attributes to the stress of relocating to a new country. Since then, Jenny has always been able to lose weight, but during times of stress, puts it right back on again.     As many health professionals can attest, Jenny feels a certain pressure to conform to ideas of what a nutritionist or dietitian should look like. But her real concern is the potential long-term health consequences of holding additional weight, particularly as she enters menopause in the coming years … a time when many women can experience unwanted weight gain.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Rhonda, age 53, has dreams of becoming an actress, traveling the world, kayaking, scuba diving, and finding her life partner. But one thing has been holding her back: her weight. Rhonda would like to lose about 100 pounds, weight she slowly gained over the years but has been unable to lose since quitting smoking four years ago.    In her coaching session with eating psychology expert Marc David, Rhonda shares that she frequently binge eats as a way to deal with stress, loneliness, and boredom. She has a robust career, managing twenty people in her position, but many of Rhonda’s dreams remain unfulfilled. With a lust for life, love, and drama, Rhonda’s inner life simply doesn’t match her outer life … and she’s ready for a big change.    As Marc explores, so often we’ll wait to live out our dreams and become the  “real”  us until we’ve achieved our weight loss goals. But that has too many of us waiting our entire lives, whether we have 10 pounds or 100 to lose.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, Marc David speaks to  esteemed  filmmaker  of the  “Transcendence”  docuseries and the documentary,  “Hungry  for Change,” James Colquhoun. Like many of us passionate about health and wellness, James’ journey into healthy living began after a life-changing and tragic event. His father developed multiple medical conditions, and did what most people do: go to their doctor and start taking various medications. As his father’s health continued to decline, James became determined to figure out how to use nutrition and holistic health to reverse his dad’s medical diagnoses.     After reading book after book, beginning with the classic,  <em>Diet for a New America</em>  by John Robbins, James and his partner Laurentine learned everything they could about health and nutrition. And as he became more informed, James gradually convinced his father to let go of the medications that seemed to only worsen his conditions and lead to terrible side effects.     And the result? His father was able to drop all his medication within three months of implementing nutritional changes, lost 50 pounds, and resumed his active lifestyle of running every day.    From this, James’ career as a health crusader and educator was born. In this interview, you’ll hear some of his powerful distinctions around the healing power of food that have changed the lives of millions of people around the world.     Tune in now for a truly inspiring conversation between two of the world’s leading voices in health and nutrition!    For more on James, his films, guided programs, and nutrition certification training, visit his global online wellness hub  <a class="attrlink" href="https://www.foodmatters.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://www.foodmatters.com/">FoodMatters.com</a>  and streaming channel FMTV  (now  <a class="attrlink" href="https://www.gaia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://www.gaia.com/">Gaia.com</a>).    And to learn more about the Food Matters Nutrition Certification program, please visit https://www.foodmattersinstitute.com/program/nutrition-certification     ---------------    Learn more about  us at  The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Listen to  Marc share about  the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training, our 8-month coach certification training for aspiring health coaches and established practitioners.

Then you won’t want to miss this week’s episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast, where you’ll hear the story of 44-year old Aldona from the Netherlands.</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> Ten years ago, Aldona was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, a diagnosis that affects an estimated 20 million people in the U.S. alone. When she was newly diagnosed, Aldona tried to heal her condition with high-quality foods. She has tried many diet approaches, like Paleo, and has done strict elimination diets in an attempt to see which foods might be most problematic.</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> Unfortunately, none of her attempts have improved her Hashimoto’s. And now, to complicate things, Aldona has developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome</span> <span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z h-lparen"> (IBS),</span> <span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> which she attributes to the stress of trying to manage her Hashimoto’s. Never having experienced digestive issues or food intolerances before, Aldona has become stressed out and very confused about what to eat. In her words, she no longer trusts her instincts about which foods are best for her.</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> In their coaching session, master eating psychology coach Marc David helps Aldona look beyond nutritional solutions. How are these conditions asking Aldona to transform as a human being? How can she learn to quiet her mind, and tune into what her body needs? In what ways can she discover how to live with these conditions, while improving her quality of life and nurturing herself along the way?</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> ---------------</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> Learn more about</span> <span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> us at</span> <span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:</span> <span class= "attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z url"> <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/"><u>https://psychologyofeating.com/</u></a></span><span class="author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> </span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> Listen to</span> <span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> Marc share about</span> <span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training</span><span class="author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z">, our 8-month coach certification training for aspiring health coaches and established practitioners.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Do you have a nutrition-linked health condition? Then you won’t want to miss this week’s episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast, where you’ll hear the story of 44-year old Aldona from the Netherlands.    Ten years ago, Aldona was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, a diagnosis that affects an estimated 20 million people in the U.S. alone. When she was newly diagnosed, Aldona tried to heal her condition with high-quality foods. She has tried many diet approaches, like Paleo, and has done strict elimination diets in an attempt to see which foods might be most problematic.    Unfortunately, none of her attempts have improved her Hashimoto’s. And now, to complicate things, Aldona has developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome  (IBS),  which she attributes to the stress of trying to manage her Hashimoto’s. Never having experienced digestive issues or food intolerances before, Aldona has become stressed out and very confused about what to eat. In her words, she no longer trusts her instincts about which foods are best for her.    In their coaching session, master eating psychology coach Marc David helps Aldona look beyond nutritional solutions. How are these conditions asking Aldona to transform as a human being? How can she learn to quiet her mind, and tune into what her body needs? In what ways can she discover how to live with these conditions, while improving her quality of life and nurturing herself along the way?    ---------------    Learn more about  us at  The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Listen to  Marc share about  the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training, our 8-month coach certification training for aspiring health coaches and established practitioners.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In this episode,  we meet Jenny, 42, who is ready for a serious relationship after many years of monogamy. But she feels very self-conscious about her body, so much so that it feels almost impossible to open up to new love. Jenny’s last relationship ended in her late 20s, and ever since, she’s thrown herself into work and tried to ignore both the deep desire for a romantic relationship, and the poor body image that has prevented her from finding it.    In her eating psychology coaching session, Jenny works with founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, Marc David. As Jenny shares, she’s avoided dating out of fear that she’ll be rejected, telling herself that she’ll be better able to date once she’s happier with her body.     As Marc reflects, so many of us assume that others hold the same judgments of ourselves and our bodies that we do. But very rarely is this actually the case.     Others usually observe what’s good about us: the beauty in our curves, the special way we smile, or the twinkle in our eyes. As well as what makes us attractive on the inside … our kindness, caring, sense of humor, generosity, quirkiness, and so much more.    For all of us learning to love and accept ourselves  (and  hey, that’s most of us!), this episode is for you.     -------------------------    Learn more about  us at  The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Explore a career as Mind Body Eating Coach specializing in Eating Psychology & Mind Body Nutrition by signing up for our free ebook series:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   - Facebook:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a>  - Instagram:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a>  - Pinterest:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a>     <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bodyinsecurities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bodyinsecurities</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23intimacy" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#intimacy</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23dating" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#dating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bodypositive" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bodypositive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">bodypositive</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23embodiment" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#embodiment</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23intimacy" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#intimacy</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23personalgrowth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#personalgrowth</a>   <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23marcdavid" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#marcdavid</a>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In this episode, Marc David, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, speaks with 38-year-old Juliana who has faced challenges around body weight and image since she was mocked for being a  “chubby”  kid.  Originally from Brazil, Juliana now lives in Bonn Germany, where she finds the cultural attitudes on weight and body image are significantly different.     Despite there being a decidedly less stringent idea of beauty in Germany, Juliana is finding it hard to let go of beauty concepts she grew up with in Brazil. She often worries about food and whether she’s getting the whole experience of eating  “right”  - whether that’s eating the  “right”  foods or eating the  “right”  amount of calories each day.     Marc coaches Juliana and the rest of us trying to lose weight to see that, while weight loss is a fine goal for many, it becomes problematic when it becomes paramount to everything else in our life. When weight loss is more important than almost anything else, it’s very likely we hold the toxic nutritional belief that we’ll be happier when we’re thinner.    In their conversation, Marc speaks to this rampant belief, why it causes so many of us to suffer unnecessarily, and how to begin to forge a new path.    -------------------------    Learn more about  us at  The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Explore a career as Mind Body Eating Coach specializing in Eating Psychology & Mind Body Nutrition by signing up for our free ebook series:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   -

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Alison is almost 50, and has been trying to lose weight – without success – for 20 years.  A  mother of four, Alison  has tried various diets and got expert help but nothing has worked for her. Marc David, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, helps Alison get a new perspective about her weight loss journey and empowers her to be in her body. Don’t miss this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast.    Key Insights:      Alison has been trying to lose weight but only starvation diets seem to work for her. After a time the weight always comes back. She wants to  not  be consumed by  weight loss, but is uncertain what to do at this point.       Alison suffered a miscarriage in her 20s and later lost a teenage child to cancer. Marc  explores the role of  bereavement  in her  weight gain.      In the past, Alison  has experimented with letting go of food restriction just to see if eating like the rest of her family might give her the chance to re-regulate her body’s metabolism. After gaining weight, Alison considered this experiment a failure and returned to her starvation diets.      Marc explains the rubber band effect that causes a body to gain weight suddenly after a long period of restricted eating.  The fact that Alison gained weight is no surprise, nor does it make her experiment a failure.      Marc suggests that  the key to  Alison  creating vibrant health is by tuning into her body’s unique needs - what many think of as  ‘intuitive  eating’ and, at least for a time, give up weighing herself and dieting. For many, dieting can be a never-ending cycle of self-punishment that doesn’t ultimately lead to what we’re truly looking for: being healthy, feeling good about ourselves, and living a fulfilling life. It’s time to try a different approach.       ---------------------    Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Sign up for our free professional series on training with us as a health coach:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   - Facebook:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a>  - Instagram:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a>  - Pinterest:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a>     <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionexpert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionexpert</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritioncoach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritioncoach</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightlossresistance" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightlossresistance</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightlossjourney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightlossjourney</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23starvationdiet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#starvationdiet</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23ketodiet" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#ketodiet</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23emotionaleating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#emotionaleating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23obesity" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#obesity</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23sustainableweightloss" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#sustainableweightloss</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23dealingwithgrief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#dealingwithgrief</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bereavement" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bereavement</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23relationshipwithfood" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#relationshipwithfood</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23loveyourbody" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#loveyourbody</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23marcdavid" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#marcdavid</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthcoach" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthcoach</a>]]></content:encoded>

So giving up the foods that make her feel good sounds like a recipe for an even less fulfilling life.    What is Samaria to do?     Eat the foods she loves but will perhaps cost her a longer life?    Or avoid unhealthy food, but live a life with no real pleasure or fulfillment?    As Marc explores, there’s an important third option that Samaria — and the rest of us who find emotional sustenance from food — will do well to consider.    ---------------------    Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Sign up for our free professional series on training with us as a health coach:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   - Facebook:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a>  - Instagram:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a>  - Pinterest:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a>     <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthcoach" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthcoach</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23emotionaleating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#emotionaleating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23type2diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#type2diabetes</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23cholesterol" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#cholesterol</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthylifestylehabits" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthylifestylehabits</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionist" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionist</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthyfood" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthyfood</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23difficultemotions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#difficultemotions</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23depression" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#depression</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23anxiety" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#anxiety</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23instantgratificaion" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#instantgratificaion</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23mentalwellness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#mentalwellness</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23marcdavid" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#marcdavid</a> ]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast,  Marc David works with guest coaching client Susan around her frequent habit of stress eating. Like many of us, Susan’s life was hugely impacted by COVID-19. After enjoying working from home for many months of the pandemic,  Susan has returned to her workplace  only to find it a pretty stressful experience.  She’s not so much worried about her personal safety, but is missing the sense of freedom she experienced working from home.     In their conversation, Marc coaches Susan on the psychological reasons we turn to food in times of stress, and how our eating challenges are often symbolic of our need for control and freedom in other areas of life. Marc helps Susan recognize how she can shift her stress eating - not by focusing on food, but by looking at how this unwanted eating challenge is asking her to grow as a person. As Susan acknowledges, she’s ready to make some necessary changes in her relationship to her work and career, as well as ensure that she doesn’t let go of the daily self-care habits she developed while working at home.     ---------------------    Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Sign up for our free professional series on training with us as a health coach:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   - Facebook:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a>  - Instagram:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a>  - Pinterest:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a>     <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#eatingpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightlossjourney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightlossjourney</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23stresseating" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#stresseating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bingeeating" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bingeeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23emotionaleating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#emotionaleating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingchallenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#eatingchallenges</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23workfromhome" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#workfromhome</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23control" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#control</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23discomfort" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#discomfort</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23feelbetter" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#feelbetter</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23relationshipwithfood" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#relationshipwithfood</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23workplace" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#workplace</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23backtotheoffice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#backtotheoffice</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthymindset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthymindset</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23mindbodynutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#mindbodynutrition</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23marcdavid" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#marcdavid</a>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Lenka, 43 and from Prague, recognizes a pattern with food that many of us will relate to: turning to food as a form of self-abuse. At the age of 15, Lenka developed bulimia, beginning a troubled relationship with food, and body dysmorphia that told her she wasn’t good enough if she wasn’t thin.    Now an academic with a very busy life, Lenka has improved her relationship with eating, even finding herself somewhat relaxed around food at times. But in general, Lenka is not relaxed - not about food, and not particularly about anything else in her life. She’s single and can’t quite understand why, has been called a workaholic by her family and friends, and often feels alone and confused about her path in life.     In their coaching episode - part of the  “In  Session with Marc David” series on The Psychology of Eating Podcast, Marc David works with Lenka to uncover what’s really at the root of her eating challenges.    As Marc teaches, our relationship with food often mirrors our relationship with life itself. And our challenges with food and body are always asking us to learn and grow, and to be open to what they’re here to teach us.    As they explore, at an early age Lenka developed a core toxic belief that she needs to make her life perfect. And that deep desire to get everything  “right”  inevitably sets her up for failure. In this light, turning to food to self-abuse makes great sense if we think we’re to blame … and therefore deserve punishment.    So tune into this episode of the podcast where we take a deep look at the core beliefs that hurt and hold us back, and how we can instead find the flow, beauty, and freedom with food and life that we all deserve.    ---------------------    Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Sign up for our free professional series on training with us as a health coach:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   - Facebook:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a>  - Instagram:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a>  - Pinterest:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a>     <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionexpert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionexpert</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodandbody" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodandbody</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23EDrecovery" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#EDrecovery</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bulimia" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bulimia</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodandbody" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodandbody</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23disorderedeating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#disorderedeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23perfectionism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#perfectionism</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23embraceimperfection" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#embraceimperfection</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23journaling" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#journaling</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23grounding" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#grounding</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23yoga" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#yoga</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23relationshipwithfood" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#relationshipwithfood</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23simplepleasures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#simplepleasures</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthymindset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthymindset</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23loveyourbody" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#loveyourbody</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23marcdavid" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#marcdavid</a>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast, eating psychology expert Marc David works with 28-year old dietitian,  Leah. A graduate of the Institute’s Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training, Leah loves her profession and has a special affinity for working with Highly-Sensitive people  (HSP).  An HSP herself, Leah has been eating more sugar than she feels is good for her, and looks to Marc for guidance on what’s truly at the root of her habits with sugar.    Through the course of their conversation, Marc and Leah explore some fascinating connections between her sugar habit and her experiences as a Highly-Sensitive Person. Part of what they identify is a need to be aware of the effects of overstimulation  (technology,  noise, etc), and how sugar can be a strategy to feel more embodied … something we ideally do through healthier mind-body practices.    So many of us see our challenges with food as weaknesses or as a willpower problem. But as this episode demonstrates, there’s usually a deeper reason for our unwanted eating habits - not all of them immediately apparent.    -------------------------    Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Sign up for our free professional series on training with us as a health coach:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   - Facebook:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a>  - Instagram:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a>  - Pinterest:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a>    <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionexpert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionexpert</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23dietitian" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#dieti</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23dietitian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">t</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23dietitian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">ian</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23hsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#hsp</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23highlysensitiveperson" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#highlysensitiveperson</a>   <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23embodiment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#embodiment</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23inhabitthebody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#inhabitthebody</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23overstimulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#overstimulation</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23sugarcravings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#sugarcravings</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodcravings" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodcravings</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23sugaraddiction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#sugaraddiction</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodcravings" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodcravings</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23emotionaleating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#emotionaleating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23marcdavid" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#marcdavid</a> ]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast, Marc David  works  with  28-year-old Aamina  from  New Delhi, India. Aamina  would like to improve her health and fitness levels, but she’s feeling stumped by why she seems to frequently self-sabotage with food. For the past several years, Aamina has found herself in a sort of  “all-or-nothing”  mentality with food - either in a healthy cycle with eating, or binging on foods that she knows aren’t great for her.     Marc explores some of the hidden psychological reasons humans can get stuck in all-or-nothing behaviors with food, and offers a new framework for all of us when it comes to shifting our unwanted eating challenges. If you struggle with emotional eating, binge eating, food anxiety, or other food and body challenges, be sure to tune into this inspiring episode!    --------------    Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Sign up for our free professional series on training with us as a health coach:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   - Facebook:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a>  - Instagram:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a>  - Pinterest:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a>     <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">eating</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">psychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23mindbodynutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#mindbodynutrition</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23marcdavid" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#marcdavid</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23relaxationresponse" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#relaxationresponse</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23junkfood" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#junkfood</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodcravings" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodcravings</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23stressrelief" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#stressrelief</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23guiltypleasure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#guiltypleasure</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23allornothingmentality" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#allornothingmentality</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23emotionalregulation" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#emotionalregulation</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23emotionaleating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#emotionaleating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bingeating" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bingeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthylife" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthylife</a> ]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In this week’s episode of the Psychology of Eating Podcast, Marc David works with  Jessica, who  was diagnosed with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism  over ten  years ago. She  would like to  find natural alternatives for the pharmaceuticals she’s been using to manage her condition, as well as find ways to heal the Hashimoto’s-related digestive challenges she’s been experiencing.     Eating psychology  expert and nutrition consultant  Marc David  does a deep dive with Jessica on some of the most important things she can do for her health, including how to find a great functional medicine practitioner who can over see her care. He offers a variety of nutritional and supplemental strategies to experiment with including high-quality fats especially essential fatty acids, and natural alternatives to Synthroid, along with a discussion of why certain approaches — like avoiding gluten — don’t seem to work for everyone affected by Hashimoto’s.    --------------------    Interested in becoming a health coach, or inspired to heal your own challenges with food and body?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In this special guest edition of The Psychology of Eating Podcast, Marc David interviews Dr. Eric Zielinski, author, aromatherapist, researcher, Biblical health educator, and founder of NaturalLivingFamily.com.     In their expansive interview, Dr. Zielinski offers a compelling look into the world of essential oils, and how they can serve as an important anchor in creating vibrant health. With a rich history extending back thousands of years, essential oils have an amazing ability to transform our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health.    As the foremost expert in America on essential oils, Dr. Zielinski’s passion for natural living and essential oils began decades ago. Since then, his work has attracted millions of followers who share his belief in the healing properties of essential oils.    Show Highlights:      The use of essential oils goes back millenia, but were also used widely just before the advent of modern medicine when combat medics in World Wars I and II used them for their antibacterial properties. Oils like clove, oregano, lemongrass, and tea tree oil were the antibiotic equivalents at that time.       Essential oils are increasingly recognized in scientific research for their ability to fight infection, balance blood pressure, protect against cancer, alleviate anxiety and depression, and detoxify the body.       Modern manufactured products, whether detergents, deodorizers, aerosols, or sprays contain neurotoxins that have stunted our natural human sensory abilities to detect substances that are bad for our health. For this reason, it’s vital to minimize our exposure to toxic products, as much as possible. Essential oils have a remarkable capability to retrain our sense of smell to more accurately detect noxious substances in our environment.       Dr. Zielinski emphasizes the important role of essential oils in getting people reconnected to the natural world, among others. He highlights the Japanese ancient healing art of Shinrin-yoku, or forest bathing, where one gets out in nature - preferably a densely wooded area, as another example. Simply by being outside, breathing in the volatile organic compounds from the living world, and stimulating every touch, we naturally improve our health and vitality.      Dr. Zielinski shares his background in Biblical health education, a field he is presently helping to develop.  Biblical health recognizes our God-given right to an abundant life: spiritual, emotional, financial, and social.     -------------------------    For more on Dr. Zielinski, head to  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://www.naturallivingfamily.com" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.naturallivingfamily.com</a>, or learn more about his bestselling book, The Healing Power of Essential Oils at  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://go.naturallivingfamily.com/free-essential-oils-book/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://go.naturallivingfamily.com/free-essential-oils-book/</a>.    And for more about Marc David and The Institute for the Psychology of Eating, visit us at  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.psychologyofeating.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.psychologyofeating.com">www.psychologyofeating.com</a>.     <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23ericzielinski" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#ericzielinski</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23aromatherapist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#aromatherapist</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23aromatherapy" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#aromatherapy</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23biblicalhealth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#biblicalhealth</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23essentialoils" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#essentialoil</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23essentialoils" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">s</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23naturalhealing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#naturalhealing</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23pharmaindustry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#pharmaindustry</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23plantchemistry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#plantchemistry</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23biblicalhealth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#biblicalhealth</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23abundantlife" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#abundantlife</a>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast, Marc David speaks to Francesca from Brisbane, Australia. Francesca has had weight challenges since she was a young girl, and would like to lose 50 kilos.    She’s tried Weight Watchers over the last few years, but frequently falls off the program … the  food restriction feels too hard, and her motivation to continue drops. For Francesca, food restriction feels like being told what to do — and she’s at a point where she just doesn’t want any more restraints on her life.     Growing up, her mother died at birth and her father was very disciplinarian, making it hard to know where to go to for comfort. He eventually set up an arranged marriage for Francesca, to a good husband who himself didn’t quite know how to provide the comfort and care her heart yearned for.    Marc identifies that food became a source of safety, security, intimacy, and bonding. It was a strategy that made sense when she was young, but now at 64, she’s being called to invoke the more mature parts of herself that can challenge the idea that having the right body will make her happy. And he points out that the teenage rebel archetype inside her is a beautiful one, it just needs channeling into other parts of her life instead of her relationship with food.    --------------------    Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Sign up for our free professional series on training with us as a health coach:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   - Facebook:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage">www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a>  - Instagram:  <a class="attrlink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a>  - Pinterest:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych">www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a>     <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#eatingpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionexpert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionexpert</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightlossjourney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightlossjourney</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23thinkingaboutfood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#thinkingaboutfood</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23feelingheavy" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#feelingheavy</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23beingpresent" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#beingpresent</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23lovefood" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#lovefood</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23sloweating" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#sloweating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23childhoodtrauma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#childhoodtrauma</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23emotionregulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#emotionregulation</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bodypositivity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bodypositivity</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthyweightloss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthyweightloss</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bingeeating" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bingeeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodasfriend" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodasfriend</a>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast, we meet 32-year old  Sofia from Bulgaria,  who would like to stop binge eating. Working with Marc David, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, Sofia shares that she uses food as a weapon for self-destruction. And she’s been doing so for quite a while … all the way back to her father’s suicide attempts when she was just 15 years old.     Recently, Sofia moved to a new country where she’s been adjusting to an entirely new life, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and she had a heartbreaking miscarriage. Through it all, Sofia has struggled with major depression, and often turns to food for comfort.    As Marc explains, it’s exceedingly common to turn to food to help regulate our emotions. And to a limited degree, this can be a useful strategy - until it isn’t.     So what can Sofia do to heal her relationship with food? A key strategy is harnessing the power of the artist archetype.    Tune in now to learn more about this unique approach!    --------------------    Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Sign up for our free professional series on training with us as a health coach:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   - Facebook:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage">www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a>  - Instagram:  <a class="attrlink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a>  - Pinterest:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych">www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a>    <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#eatingpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightlossdiet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightlossdiet</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightlossjourney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightlossjourney</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bingeeating" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bingeeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23selfempowerment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#selfempowerment</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23overeating" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#overeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23overcomingdepression" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#overcomingdepression</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23junkfood" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#junkfood</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23perfectionist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#perfectionist</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23selfacceptance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#selfacceptance</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23selfcompassion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#selfcompassion</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23loveyourself" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#loveyourself</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23selfimprovement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#selfimprovement</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23lifestylechanges" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#lifestylechanges</a>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Struck with night-time cravings? Then you’ll want to tune into this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast!    Emily, 27, likes to snack after meals. But after dinner, her food cravings become really intense. So intense, in fact, that it seems like she can’t control herself at all. As soon as dinner is finished, Emily’s brain starts wandering to what’s in the pantry, and before she knows it, she’s eating all kinds of foods she promised herself earlier in the day she wouldn’t.     While Emily can’t quite figure out what’s driving her to binge after dinner, she knows that stress has something to do with it.    As their coaching session unfolds, Marc David, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, shares some key insights as to what Emily’s night-time binging is all about — and what she can do moving forward.    One of Marc’s distinctions? Our challenges as human beings often express themselves in our relationship with food and in our relationship with our bodies. But that doesn’t mean we have a  “problem”  with food. We’re simply learning to have a relationship with food that truly works for us, mind, body, heart and soul.    --------------------    Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Sign up for our free professional series on training with us as a health coach:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   - Facebook:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage">www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a>  - Instagram:  <a class="attrlink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a>  - Pinterest:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych">www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a>     <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#eatingpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutrition" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutrition</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23mindbodynutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#mindbodynutrition</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nighttimecravings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nighttimecravings</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23relationshipwithfood" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#relationshipwithfood</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23overcominganorexia" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#overcominganorexia</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23snacking" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#snacking</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23underweight" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#underweight</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23EDrecovery" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#EDrecovery</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23appetite" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#appetite</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bodyfat" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bodyfat</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23perfectionism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#perfectionism</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23perfectionist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#perfectionist</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weighthate" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weighthate</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23journaling" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#journaling</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23selflovejourney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#selflovejourney</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23instituteforthepsychologyofeating" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#instituteforthepsychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23marcdavid" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#marcdavid</a> ]]></content:encoded>

Then you won’t want to miss today’s episode, where Marc David, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, coaches 39-year old Hayley from South Africa on how to best work with her fibromyalgia.</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> Hayley first noticed symptoms of pain and hypermobility after finishing a career as a long distance runner. She was used to being in pain, but expected that it would subside after she quit running. Unfortunately, the pain did not go away. Hayley went for 12 years not understanding why she was in such intense physical pain, only to be diagnosed just a few months ago with fibromyalgia.</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> Since her diagnosis, Hayley recognizes the key role that her diet plays.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Living with fibromyalgia? Then you won’t want to miss today’s episode, where Marc David, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, coaches 39-year old Hayley from South Africa on how to best work with her fibromyalgia.    Hayley first noticed symptoms of pain and hypermobility after finishing a career as a long distance runner. She was used to being in pain, but expected that it would subside after she quit running. Unfortunately, the pain did not go away. Hayley went for 12 years not understanding why she was in such intense physical pain, only to be diagnosed just a few months ago with fibromyalgia.    Since her diagnosis, Hayley recognizes the key role that her diet plays. If she strays from eating healthy food, her pain increases substantially - as does her anxiety and her sleep challenges.    But is working with food enough? What else can Hayley do to manage her symptoms and live the vibrant, fulfilling life she desires?    --------------------    Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Sign up for our free professional series on training with us as a health coach:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   - Facebook:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage">www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a>  - Instagram:  <a class="attrlink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a>  - Pinterest:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych">www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a>     <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionexpert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionexpert</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23chronicpain" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#chronicpain</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23chronicfatigue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#chronicfatigue</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23disorderedeating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#disorderedeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23fibromyalgia" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#fibromyalgia</a>   <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23chronicpainsyndrome" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#chronicpainsyndrome</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bingeeating" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bingeeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23ptsd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#ptsd</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23dnrsystem" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#dnrsystem</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23chemicalsensitivity" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#chemicalsensitivity</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthcoach" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthcoach</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23marcdavid" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#marcdavid</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23mindbodynutrition" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#mindbodynutrition</a>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Sumi, aged 40, joins  eating  psychology expert Marc David in this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast. Sumi is a  functional medicine doctor  in Malaysia who is self-treating for Hashimoto’s disease. She has been successfully managing her Hashimoto’s through dietary and lifestyle changes, supplements, and stress reduction. Currently a low-carbohydrate pescatarian, Sumi has a vegan before and would like to return to veganism out of ethical concerns. But her health has improved so much since eating fish and eggs that she’s hesitant to cut those foods out. What’s more, Sumi commonly counsels her patients that eating meat can be helpful in the healing process — but she feels torn between what she believes is best for her patients  (and  for herself), and her deeply-held spiritual and ethical beliefs.    How does Sumi get herself out of this medical and ethical conundrum?    --------------------    Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Sign up for our free professional series on training with us as a health coach:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   - Facebook:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage">www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a>  - Instagram:  <a class="attrlink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a>  - Pinterest:  <a href= "http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych">www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a>     <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">eatingpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionexpert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionexpert</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23autoimmunedisease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23autoimmunedisease" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">autoimmunedisease</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23thyroid" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#thyroid</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23hashimotos" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#hashimotos</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23thyroidfood" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#thyroidfood</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23thyroidhealth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#thyroidhealth</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23vegan" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#vegan</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23veganismandhealth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#veganismandhealth</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23paleo" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#paleo</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23mindbodynutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#mindbodynutrition</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23marcdavid" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#marcdavid</a> ]]></content:encoded>

If you can relate to feeling stifled by food control and worry, this episode will give you some great takeaways for how you can transform your own relationship with food.    Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>     Sign up for our free professional series on training with us as a health coach:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://lp.psychologyofeating.com/eating-psychology-video-series/</a>    Follow us on social:   - Facebook:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage">www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a>  - Instagram:  <a class="attrlink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a>  - Pinterest:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych">www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a>     <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#eatingpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutrition" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutrition</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightloss" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weight</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightloss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">loss</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23disorderedeating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#disorderedeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23anorexiarecovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#anorexiarecovery</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bellyfat" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bellyfat</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23perfectionist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#perfectionist</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23flatstomach" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#flatstomach</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23femininemind" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#femininemind</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23masculinemind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#masculinemind</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23embody" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#embody</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nourishment" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nourishment</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23internalfeminine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#internalfeminine</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23relationshipwithfood" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#relationshipwithfood</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bodyimage" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bodyimage</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23trustyourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#trustyourself</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23mindbodynutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#mindbodynutrition</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23marcdavid" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#marcdavid</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthcoach" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthcoach</a>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Alexandra, 42,  from Lisbon, Portgual,  speaks with  eating  psychology expert  and founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating,  Marc David, about how to stop binge eating and overeating. Also on her  “food  and body wish list” is the desire to lose an extra few kilos. Alexandra has been working to transform her relationship with food for some time, and has amazing awareness of the emotional roots of her eating challenges. Alexandra recognizes that — like so many of us — she turns to food for comfort from loneliness and other challenging life experiences. But she also knows that’s not ultimately the best way to self-soothe. In their coaching session, Marc identifies several powerful paradigm shifts that will help Alexandra better manage her emotional state, and look at her challenges with food from an entirely different perspective.

As Elise explains, our food story is our unique set of thoughts, beliefs, feelings, and past experiences with food and body.

In this powerful interview, Elise breaks down why understanding and transforming our food story is key to changing our unwanted food and body challenges.</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class=

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In this special edition of the Psychology of Eating Podcast, Marc David interviews Eating Psychology and Nutrition expert  Elise Museles, author of  <em>Food Story</em><em>: Rewrite the Way You Eat, Think, and Live</em>, and  podcast host of  <em>Once Upon a Food Story</em>. Elise holds four certificates in holistic health and integrative healing, and is a graduate of Marc’s Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training at the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, a five-time National Institutes of Health  (NIH)  grant recipient, and a frequent expert cited in such publications as O: The Oprah Magazine, Forbes, Health, Self, ELLE, Well&Good, mindbodygreen, Yoga Journal, and more.    In their interview, Elise shares with us her fascination with all things  <em>food story</em>, and why our food story is so important to transforming our eating challenges such as emotional eating, binge eating, chronic dieting, weight, body image, and more. As Elise explains, our food story is our unique set of thoughts, beliefs, feelings, and past experiences with food and body. So many of us focus on nutrition and lifestyle protocols, but spend little time considering how our mindset affects our eating patterns. In this powerful interview, Elise breaks down why understanding and transforming our food story is key to changing our unwanted food and body challenges.    If you’re intrigued about your own personal food story, and how to cut out the  “food  noise”  (all  the external chatter about what and what not to eat, weight, and more), tune in to learn more!     For more on Elise, visit  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.elisemuseles.com" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "http://www.elisemuseles.com">www.elisemuseles.com</a>, discover her book at  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.elisemuseles.com/book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.elisemuseles.com/book/">www.elisemuseles.com/book</a>, or follow her on Instagram at  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.instagram.com/elisemuseles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.instagram.com/elisemuseles/">www.instagram.com/elisemuseles</a>.     And to learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating, visit us at  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.psychologyofeating.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.psychologyofeating.com">www.psychologyofeating.com</a>.     <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionexpert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionexpert</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightloss" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightloss</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightlossdiet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightlossdiet</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23holistichealth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#holistichealth</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23elisemuseles" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#elisemuseles</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23oprah" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#oprah</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23forbes" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#forbes</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23mindbodygreen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#mindbodygreen</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#eatingpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionexpert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionexpert</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23mindbodynutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#mindbodynutrition</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23perfectionism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#perfectionism</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23lovemybody" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#lovemybody</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodystory" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodystory</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23whatisyourfoodstory" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#whatisyourfoodstory</a>]]></content:encoded>

If so, you’ll relate to today’s podcast episode, featuring 34-year old Victoria from the UK. Victoria is a former fitness model who has overcome anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating. She knows she wasn’t truly happy in her modeling days, but she can’t help but look back on photos of her old self with envy. In their eating psychology coaching session, Marc David, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, works with Victoria on her persistent desire to lose weight and look a certain way. What unfolds is a moving conversation on the negative impact conditioning has on all of us around our appearance and weight, and how to finally move out of self-rejection and into self-acceptance. Regardless of whether you’ve personally ever struggled with an eating disorder, this episode will inspire you to think differently about your own challenges with food and body.

She’s tried numerous dietary approaches including a low FODMAPS diet, and reports that her past restrictive diets seem to have only increased her food intolerances. Regardless of what she eats, she’s frequently struck with extreme discomfort, causing her intense anxiety and worry about the consequences of trying to engage in the simple — and necessary — act of eating. To boot, Michelle is often ravenous and snacks a lot throughout the day, contributing to some weight gain that she would like to shed. Unsure of how to proceed, she consults with Marc David, eating psychology expert and founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, for help.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Forty-five-year-old Michelle from Australia has been dealing with IBS  (Irritable  Bowel Syndrome) for the last 10 years. She’s tried numerous dietary approaches including a low FODMAPS diet, and reports that her past restrictive diets seem to have only increased her food intolerances. Regardless of what she eats, she’s frequently struck with extreme discomfort, causing her intense anxiety and worry about the consequences of trying to engage in the simple — and necessary — act of eating. To boot, Michelle is often ravenous and snacks a lot throughout the day, contributing to some weight gain that she would like to shed. Unsure of how to proceed, she consults with Marc David, eating psychology expert and founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, for help. Listen in as Marc helps her hone in on the true cause of her IBS, and how she can work to unwind the unfortunate state of digestive distress she finds herself in each day.

In 2014, Heidi was at a point of peak fitness, preparing for a hiking trip to Machu Picchu — until she was afflicted with a rare spinal staph infection that caused temporary paralysis in her legs. Now on lifelong antibiotics, Heidi is experiencing pain, inflammation, gut challenges, and weight gain. An incredibly resilient person, Heidi has remarried after her former partner left her during her illness, and has mostly made peace with no longer being an athlete. In their coaching session, Marc works with Heidi to explore ways to lose weight and improve her symptoms.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In this episode of the Psychology of Eating Podcast, we meet 60-year old Heidi from Catalina Island, California. In 2014, Heidi was at a point of peak fitness, preparing for a hiking trip to Machu Picchu — until she was afflicted with a rare spinal staph infection that caused temporary paralysis in her legs. Now on lifelong antibiotics, Heidi is experiencing pain, inflammation, gut challenges, and weight gain. An incredibly resilient person, Heidi has remarried after her former partner left her during her illness, and has mostly made peace with no longer being an athlete. In their coaching session, Marc works with Heidi to explore ways to lose weight and improve her symptoms.

That’s what we explore in this episode, where Marc David, Founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, speaks with 35-year old Angela from Australia. Since the age of about 20, Angela has been dealing with constipation and pelvic floor pain, and a prior diagnosis of endometriosis. She’s tried every diet she knows to try to improve her condition, but with very limited success. Angela has recently realized that pelvic floor dysfunction may be playing a role in her chronic constipation and has started seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist. Through the course of their conversation, Marc talks with Angela about the role of stress and trauma in pelvic floor dysfunction and coaches her on non-dietary solutions for her condition. Tune in now for a fascinating conversation on a little-known but highly prevalent condition affecting many women – and men – around the world.</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> ------------------------</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A., has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> A 35-Year-Old Woman Works with Pelvic Floor Dysfunction</p>  What’s the role between stress, pelvic floor dysfunction, and gut issues like constipation? That’s what we explore in this episode, where Marc David, Founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, speaks with 35-year old Angela from Australia. Since the age of about 20, Angela has been dealing with constipation and pelvic floor pain, and a prior diagnosis of endometriosis. She’s tried every diet she knows to try to improve her condition, but with very limited success. Angela has recently realized that pelvic floor dysfunction may be playing a role in her chronic constipation and has started seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist. Through the course of their conversation, Marc talks with Angela about the role of stress and trauma in pelvic floor dysfunction and coaches her on non-dietary solutions for her condition. Tune in now for a fascinating conversation on a little-known but highly prevalent condition affecting many women – and men – around the world.    ------------------------    With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A., has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, Marc is the author of the bestselling books, Nourishing Wisdom: A Mind Body Approach to Health & Well-Being, and The Slow Down Diet: Eating for Pleasure, Energy, and Weight Loss.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Changing Our Minds About Our Bodies</p>  Arina, 33,  arrives at her coaching session with Marc David with several challenges with food she would like to transform: anxiety that she spends much of her day thinking about food, fast eating habits, food cravings, and a dislike of certain parts of her body. Tune into Marc’s  transformational conversation with Arina, and find answers to your own  eating  challenges.    Key Insights: <ul> <li> Arina, a 33-year-old mother, wishes she could change some parts of her body and cut down on sweet foods and cravings. She wants to make sure she and her family eat healthy and worries  that her cravings and eating habits are interfering with her deeper desires for good health.</li> <li> Marc David urges Arina to move away from the sort of perfectionism that so many women in their 30s have. He advises her to start embracing herself and her body rather than judging and punishing herself for  what she perceives as personal flaws. </li> <li> Marc reminds Arina that the people who love her, do so just as she is. Her son, for instance, doesn’t love her based on the way she looks. Arina must learn to love herself as unconditionally as others in her life love her.</li> <li> Sweet cravings are natural, and there’s truly nothing wrong with enjoying  the experience of eating sweet things.  Limiting and regulating our sugar intake is important, but it’s also vital to allow ourselves pleasure in eating. If you’re eating sweets  (or  any other foods) and feeling guilty, it’s a good moment for self-reflection. Why eat something if you’re going to feel guilty, and why feel guilty if you’ve decided to eat something when you can instead open up to the pleasure that food provides?</li> <li> Fast eating is a  common  habit, and it often signals that we’re  “checking  out” of the body.   To begin to change this habit, check back in. Notice how your food tastes, and tune into your thoughts and emotions.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> 33-Year Old Jess Works to Transform Stress Eating & Food Guilt</p>  Jessica, a recently divorced 33-year old mother of three,  is discovering how to find freedom with food. For her, that means not constantly tracking her food, controlling her cravings for sweets, or feeling guilty when she eats forbidden foods.  Founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, Marc David explains to Jessica the evolutionary reasons behind  her  cravings  and normalizes her desire to control what she eats.  Listen to this enlightening and insightful episode now!    Key Insights: <ul> <li> Jessica, 33, speaks to Marc David about her challenges around eating and weight. She  would ideally like to lose weight but admits that even when she weighed less, she wasn’t satisfied with her appearance. She believes that if she could get rid of her cravings for sugar and junk food, she would find the weight and freedom around food she desires.</li> <li> As Marc explains, humans — like other living creatures — evolved to enjoy eating. We developed specialized taste buds including those that are stimulated by sweet foods as an evolutionary imperative.</li> <li> While it’s part of our  natural  biology to crave sweets and other foods, societal conditioning causes us to feel guilty and self-punish. </li> <li> Part of the key to working with intense cravings is by bringing understanding to this natural biological wiring. In doing so, we’re better able to recognize what drives these urges and to let go of the guilt we feel when we indulge.</li> <li> As we begin to normalize our cravings, we also want to bring consciousness to the table. As Marc coaches, consciousness allows us to check in with ourselves and have a deeper conversation about what we really want and need in a given moment. </li> </ul>  With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A., has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, Marc is the author of the bestselling books, Nourishing Wisdom: A Mind Body Approach to Health & Well-Being, and The Slow Down Diet: Eating for Pleasure, Energy, and Weight Loss. He reaches millions of people each year who are struggling with unwanted eating challenges and body image concerns through his speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>    Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same.

As Cheryl’s guest coaching session with eating psychology teacher Marc David demonstrates, changing our lifestyle can be challenging — particularly when our loved ones aren’t making similar healthy food choices. At 51, Cheryl reports that she’s carrying some extra weight around her midsection, which she’d like to let go of. She’s been trained in Marc’s Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training, where she learned a lot about the nuances of behavior change and has moved away from tired approaches that focus on notions of</span> <span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z h-ldquo"> “good”</span> <span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> and</span> <span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z h-ldquo"> “bad”</span> <span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> foods, calorie restriction, and</span> <span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z h-ldquo"> “calories-in”</span> <span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> and</span> <span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z h-ldquo"> “calories-out.”</span><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> </span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> But after visiting a functional nutritionist who has given her some strict nutrition instructions and a long list of supplements to take each day, she’s at a crossroads. She doesn’t want to follow all of her nutritionist’s advice and believes that her pattern of resisting things that are good for her is at fault. Marc turns the conversation upside down, pointing out to Cheryl that sometimes what seems like resistance is something else entirely. Tune in to hear the insights Marc has for Cheryl and the rest of us who feel like we sometimes can’t get out of our own way.</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David</span><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z">, M.A.,</span> <span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Overcoming Resistance to Improving Our Health</p>  In today’s episode, we explore a topic that many will relate to: wanting to improve one’s health, but struggling with resistance to making healthy changes. As Cheryl’s guest coaching session with eating psychology teacher Marc David demonstrates, changing our lifestyle can be challenging — particularly when our loved ones aren’t making similar healthy food choices. At 51, Cheryl reports that she’s carrying some extra weight around her midsection, which she’d like to let go of. She’s been trained in Marc’s Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training, where she learned a lot about the nuances of behavior change and has moved away from tired approaches that focus on notions of  “good”  and  “bad”  foods, calorie restriction, and  “calories-in”  and  “calories-out.”     But after visiting a functional nutritionist who has given her some strict nutrition instructions and a long list of supplements to take each day, she’s at a crossroads. She doesn’t want to follow all of her nutritionist’s advice and believes that her pattern of resisting things that are good for her is at fault. Marc turns the conversation upside down, pointing out to Cheryl that sometimes what seems like resistance is something else entirely. Tune in to hear the insights Marc has for Cheryl and the rest of us who feel like we sometimes can’t get out of our own way.    With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A.,  has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating,  Marc is the author of the bestselling books,  <em>Nourishing Wisdom: A Mind Body Approach to Health & Well-Being,</em>  and  <em>The Slow Down Diet: Eating for Pleasure, Energy, and Weight Loss</em>. He reaches millions of people each year who are struggling with unwanted eating challenges and body image concerns through his  speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>    Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same.

As she moved through adolescence, she became increasingly uncomfortable with how her body was changing. She began a 20-year journey with dieting — an experience that SO many of our listeners can relate to. Now 39, Justyna lives in Antwerp, Belgium, and is at a very different point in life. She recognizes that dieting hasn’t made her happy and that she’s been trying to force her body into a shape that it simply doesn’t want to inhabit. Her body has been giving her clear messages that it wants to live on its terms, which Justyna wants to honor but doesn’t quite how to do that. Tune into her wonderful conversation with Marc David as they talk about how to tune into one’s body wisdom.</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> -------------------</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David</span><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z">, M.A.,</span> <span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Growing up in Poland, today’s guest,  Justyna, didn’t learn much from her parents or teachers about the body changes that came with puberty. As she moved through adolescence, she became increasingly uncomfortable with how her body was changing. She began a 20-year journey with dieting — an experience that SO many of our listeners can relate to. Now 39, Justyna lives in Antwerp, Belgium, and is at a very different point in life. She recognizes that dieting hasn’t made her happy and that she’s been trying to force her body into a shape that it simply doesn’t want to inhabit. Her body has been giving her clear messages that it wants to live on its terms, which Justyna wants to honor but doesn’t quite how to do that. Tune into her wonderful conversation with Marc David as they talk about how to tune into one’s body wisdom.    -------------------    With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A.,  has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Discovering the Rhythm of Life: One Woman’s Journey</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    Taunya has come a long way since the days of her disordered eating patterns. Here she speaks to bestselling author and coach Marc David,  who has helped countless people develop a healthy relationship with food. Taunya would like to learn to be her body’s best friend. In this fascinating discussion, Marc  connects some important dots between showing up for herself, her husband, and her deepest desires in their relationship.  Listen in to Marc and Taunya’s freewheeling chat about connecting more deeply with her husband and about the ways to fulfill her intellectual and emotional needs.    Key Insights: <ul> <li> A lot of people try to manipulate the body instead of being with and present for the body. However, controlling the body is not the same as caring for it.</li> <li> Overcoming disordered eating patterns is joyous and liberating.  Part of how we do this is by being truly present with ourselves, our feelings, and our needs. And surrounding ourselves with positive energy along the way.   </li> <li> Be your body's friend. This means nourishing  and supporting  the body rather than rigidly controlling intake, exercising punishingly, weighing  and timing  everything and feeling guilty at every little slip up.</li> <li> It is not unreasonable to want to create a new, deeper and more fulfilling connection with a life partner; to look for greater intellectual and emotional fulfillment. This can be done in a gentle, loving way devoid of demand or expectation.</li> <li> Learning to find a safe space within oneself is essential for easing stressful situations and improving relationships.</li> </ul>  With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A.,  has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating,  Marc is the author of the bestselling books,  <em>Nourishing Wisdom: A Mind Body Approach to Health & Well-Being,</em>  and  <em>The Slow Down Diet: Eating for Pleasure, Energy, and Weight Loss</em>. He reaches millions of people each year who are struggling with unwanted eating challenges and body image concerns through his  speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>    Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same.

She comes to her session with Marc David seeking to feel good about herself regardless of her body size or shape.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> A 29-Year-Old Woman Works with Wanting A Different Body</p>  Lauren, 29,  spent much of her life feeling underweight, until about three years ago when she went through a traumatic breakup and gained weight. She comes to her session with Marc David seeking to feel good about herself regardless of her body size or shape. As Marc reflects, that’s a beautiful goal, but the path to getting there might just be a little different than she’s imagining right now. Tune into their inspiring conversation about love, loss, body image, and so much more.    Key Insights: <ul> <li> Sometimes a traumatic incident such as a bad breakup can have  us turn  to food for comfort.  This is a natural coping mechanism that, while not ideal for our health and weight, is understandable. </li> <li> An important first step in changing unwanted eating behaviors is recognizing the usefulness that these patterns can have at difficult times in our lives. As we step away from self-judgment and towards self-compassion, we can more easily establish healthy habits for ourselves.</li> <li> Wanting to feel good about yourself at any size or shape is an admirable goal. However, for some of us, there can be an unhelpful thought process that undermines our ability to love our body as it is right now. We often think that we need to totally get rid of the thought,  “I  need to lose weight for me to be happy.”</li> <li> Instead, as Marc invites Lauren to do, the way to let go of any thoughts of needing to lose weight to be happy is to instead tune into other kinds of hopes and wishes that are more interesting. As we create a life we love, letting go of unwanted eating habits or a negative body image happens naturally.</li> <li> It’s also important to recognize the natural human desire to take pride in our appearance. That’s not necessarily a  “bad”  thing. The paradox for all humans is allowing ourselves to be OK with this desire, while also unabashedly embracing ourselves, as we are in any given moment. The two are not mutually exclusive.</li> </ul>  With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A.,  has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating,  Marc is the author of the bestselling books,  <em>Nourishing Wisdom: A Mind Body Approach to Health & Well-Being,</em>  and  <em>The Slow Down Diet: Eating for Pleasure, Energy, and Weight Loss</em>. He reaches millions of people each year who are struggling with unwanted eating challenges and body image concerns through his  speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>    Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> A Man Embraces His Power</p>  Does your health span match your lifespan? This is the question Marc David, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, answers for Augustine, who is striving to not just live longer, but healthier. Join them in this inspiring conversation about physical, emotional, and mental  vitality  that goes beyond just food, working out, and weight loss.    Key Insights: <ul> <li> Augustine, 49, shares his journey about health goals and life aspirations with Marc David. As the owner of a CrossFit gym,  he  is eager to learn the strategies and approaches to increasing his longevity. </li> <li> A key concept in the longevity universe is that of our  “health  span,” which is the length of our lives spent in good health and free from chronic disease. While it’s good to focus on longevity, it’s equally important to consider how we can maintain our health as long into the future as possible.</li> <li> As this episode explores, physical fitness is not the only type of fitness that is important. Mental  and emotional health, relationships, and spirituality  are  also vital  aspects of one’s wellbeing, and necessary for a long and healthy life.</li> <li> When it comes to longevity, it’s easy to stray into perfectionism, which ultimately can hamper our progress with health and well-being. </li> <li> Ironically, the more we learn about longevity  (often  referred to as  “bio-hacking”  or  “DIY  biology”), the easier it is to become hyperfocused on all the strategies we can use to increase it. Getting clear on what your personal goals are, learning how to weed out what’s not useful to your unique longevity quest, and staying out of overwhelm is key.</li> </ul>   With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A.,  has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating,  Marc is the author of the bestselling books,  <em>Nourishing Wisdom: A Mind Body Approach to Health & Well-Being,</em>  and  <em>The Slow Down Diet: Eating for Pleasure, Energy, and Weight Loss</em>. He reaches millions of people each year who are struggling with unwanted eating challenges and body image concerns through his  speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>    Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same. Tune in here:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>    Follow us on social:  <ul class="listtype-bullet listindent1 list-bullet1"> <li> Facebook:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage">www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a></li> <li> Instagram:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a></li> <li> Pinterest:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych">www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a></li> </ul>      <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">eatingpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionexpert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionexpert</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightloss" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightloss</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightlossdiet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightlossdiet</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthspan" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthspan</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23perfectionism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#perfectionism</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23selfimage" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#selfimage</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23selfcare" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#selfcare</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bodywisdom" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bodywisdom</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23lifegoals" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#lifegoals</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bodypositive" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bodypositive</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bodylove" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bodylove</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23selflovejourney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#selflovejourney</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23peacewithyourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#peacewithyourself</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthcoach" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthcoach</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23longetivy" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#longetivy</a> ]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> What Illness is Asking of Us When It Comes to Self-Care</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    In this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast,  eating psychology  teacher  Marc David speaks with 56-year-old Veronica who has just been diagnosed with diabetes. She’d like to lose weight and become better organized about her food and health. Marc  takes the conversation in an unexpected direction, helping Veronica to recognize the importance for self-care that goes beyond good nutrition. Tune in now!    Key Insights <ul> <li> Being diagnosed with a condition such as  diabetes  inevitably brings up new and unexpected realities. Among them is the need to prioritize oneself and engage in regular self-care like never before.</li> <li> A new health diagnosis represents a certain crossroads. We’re no longer who we were, but we’re not exactly sure yet what our new life will look and feel like. Being mindful of how you talk to yourself about your condition is vital. </li> <li> Diabetes  is a condition that is greatly influenced by good nutrition. In some cases, Type II diabetes can be reversed through early diagnosis and key lifestyle changes. </li> <li> When managing diabetes, look for all the help you can get. Find apps to help you organize your day-to-day food plans, get support from family members to help you plan your food shopping, or consider joining a support group.</li> <li> For all of us, whether or not we’re dealing with a health condition: let go of the lifetime of conditioning you’ve received that self-care is bad or shameful. Just as you want your loved ones to feel good and enjoy life, learn to embrace your worthiness around self-care. You not only deserve it, you need it … truly.</li> </ul>   With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A.,  has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food.

We believe it’s bad and that we’re bad for engaging it. But humans are emotional creatures. Eating, by its very nature, is an emotional act. We’re biologically wired to love food, it’s built into our DNA. Part of the solution to emotional eating is to stop believing that loving food is wrong. </span></li> <li><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> Another key reframe is emotional eating vs. being an emotional eater.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Allowing Discomfort: A Key to Transforming Emotional Eating</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    Kelly has  struggled with emotional eating since  age 10. Now 56, she’s happier than she’s ever been - she’s in a wonderful relationship and loves her life, except for the 30+ pounds that have crept up in the past few years.  Eating psychology teacher and master coach  Marc David helps Kelly understand the reasons behind her challenging relationship with food, and the guilt and shame  she feels  around food and body image. Watch this thought-provoking conversation as Kelly achieves an important  breakthrough.    Key Insights: <ul> <li> There’s a massive stigma against emotional eating. We believe it’s bad and that we’re bad for engaging it. But humans are emotional creatures. Eating, by its very nature, is an emotional act. We’re biologically wired to love food, it’s built into our DNA. Part of the solution to emotional eating is to stop believing that loving food is wrong. </li> <li> Another key reframe is emotional eating vs. being an emotional eater. The former is simply a behavior, it doesn’t define who we are as a person. Identifying as an emotional eater puts us into a box, and once we’re in that box, we have a big problem that needs solving. </li> <li> What’s true about emotional eating is that it’s a symptom of a deeper issue, typically unrelated to issues with food. When we find ourselves reaching for food to distract or self-soothe, it’s a good time to stop and ask,  “What  am I feeling right now? Am I really hungry? Is there something else that I’m needing?”</li> <li> Staying present  and self-connected is vital.  Find positive ways to do this such as walking the dog, talking to your partner, calling a friend, or listening to music.  What’s key is finding  something that helps you stay connected with yourself.</li> <li> Learning to  savor and truly relish the food we eat  is important.  Often when we have eating challenges, we’ll rush and miss the pleasure that makes the experience of eating so wonderful.</li> </ul>   With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A.,  has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating,  Marc is the author of the bestselling books,  <em>Nourishing Wisdom: A Mind Body Approach to Health & Well-Being,</em>  and  <em>The Slow Down Diet: Eating for Pleasure, Energy, and Weight Loss</em>. He reaches millions of people each year who are struggling with unwanted eating challenges and body image concerns through his  speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>    Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same. Tune in here:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>    Follow us on social:  <ul class="listtype-bullet listindent1 list-bullet1"> <li> Facebook:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage">www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a></li> <li> Instagram:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a></li> <li> Pinterest:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych">www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a></li> </ul>      <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#eatingpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionexpert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionexpert</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightloss" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightloss</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightlossdiet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightlossdiet</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23emotionaleating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#emotionaleating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23overcomingperfectionism" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#overcomingperfectionism</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bepresent" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bepresent</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingchallenge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#eatingchallenge</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23perfectionism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#perfectionism</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthyweight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthyweight</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthyweightloss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthyweightloss</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23diettips" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#diettips</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritiontips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritiontips</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthylifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthylifestyle</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthcoach" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthcoach</a>]]></content:encoded>

Lilja is underweight and has been recently diagnosed with anorexia. While part of her wants to gain weight, she’s simultaneously afraid of becoming overweight and staying that way for the rest of her life. As she’s coached by Marc, Lilja reveals that she’s deeply Christian, but sometimes finds herself spiritually shut down. During these times, Lilja often turns to food for comfort. Through their conversation, Marc offers a powerful reframe on what’s going on for her and what’s needed to create a healthy relationship with food and body.</span> <span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> Don’t miss this inspiring episode!</span></div> <div> </div> <div><strong><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> Key Insights</span><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z">:</span></strong></div> <ul> <li><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> Food and body challenges are deeply intertwined with every area of life, including our spirituality.

Learning to trust yourself is also multi-layered. It might mean trusting your body’s cravings, for example. At a higher level, it means knowing that no matter what you do, what foods you eat or don’t eat, and how you feel afterward, you know you’ll stand by you and not punish yourself.</span></li> <li><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> For sensitive souls like Lilja, eating challenges can be a reflection of not knowing how to deal with life’s hardships.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> A 25-Year Old Releases the Need to Control Food … and Life</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    In this episode of  <em>The Psychology of Eating Podcast</em>, eating psychology teacher Marc David speaks with 25-year old Lilja from beautiful Reykjavik, Iceland. Lilja is underweight and has been recently diagnosed with anorexia. While part of her wants to gain weight, she’s simultaneously afraid of becoming overweight and staying that way for the rest of her life. As she’s coached by Marc, Lilja reveals that she’s deeply Christian, but sometimes finds herself spiritually shut down. During these times, Lilja often turns to food for comfort. Through their conversation, Marc offers a powerful reframe on what’s going on for her and what’s needed to create a healthy relationship with food and body.  Don’t miss this inspiring episode!    Key Insights: <ul> <li> Food and body challenges are deeply intertwined with every area of life, including our spirituality. When one area of our life is challenged, food is an easy substitute to find comfort and balance our nervous system.</li> <li> When we perceive ourselves as having lost our spiritual connection, we can feel unmoored and look for things to control so we feel safe. Food is one of the easiest things to control.</li> <li> When it comes to healing eating challenges, trusting oneself is a key ingredient. Learning to trust yourself is also multi-layered. It might mean trusting your body’s cravings, for example. At a higher level, it means knowing that no matter what you do, what foods you eat or don’t eat, and how you feel afterward, you know you’ll stand by you and not punish yourself.</li> <li> For sensitive souls like Lilja, eating challenges can be a reflection of not knowing how to deal with life’s hardships. For those of you who identify with Lilja’s story, pay particular attention to the part of Marc’s coaching session where he talks about agreeing to be here on planet Earth and learning to allow pain and difficulty.</li> <li> Always, always:  Self-love and self-forgiveness are essential  keys to establishing a healthy relationship with food.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> A 39-Year Old’s Journey with Food, Loneliness, and Self-Soothing</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    In this episode of  <em>The Psychology of Eating</em>  podcast, Marc David works with 39-year old Linda, who has been binge eating since the age of eight. As a young person, Linda felt unable to express her true feelings and needs with her family and turned to food to self-soothe. Decades later, Linda feels like life has passed her by, consumed by a habit that, as she says,  “has  taken me away from discovering who I am.” Now at the cusp of a breakthrough, Marc empowers her with the right mindset to embrace her life path, forgive herself, and redefine her relationship with food. Don’t miss this uplifting and inspiring conversation.    Key Insights: <ul> <li> Like other unwanted eating challenges, binge eating often develops in childhood as we try to cope with circumstances outside our control.</li> <li> Emotionally sensitive children can have a challenging time figuring out how to navigate family challenges - which can sometimes be perceived as a threat to our safety. Some children, like Linda, will try to be the peacemaker in the family. When this doesn’t work, the child can go to despair and hopelessness.</li> <li> As adults, we may not see the connection between our childhood experiences and what we’re struggling with currently. Difficulty establishing intimate relationships or caring friendships, a lack of motivation in one’s career, and other similar life challenges are often reflections of unmetabolized childhood feelings.</li> <li> Therefore, part of the deeper work in healing our eating challenges is recognizing that these challenges are often a coping mechanism for unresolved feelings that we simply don’t know how to deal with. </li> <li> Progress with our eating challenges accelerates as we stop focusing so much on stopping the unwanted behavior, and begin to instead harness the courage to feel our feelings — including and especially the ones that have been with us a long time. </li> </ul>   With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A.,  has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating,  Marc is the author of the bestselling books,  <em>Nourishing Wisdom: A Mind Body Approach to Health & Well-Being,</em>  and  <em>The Slow Down Diet: Eating for Pleasure, Energy, and Weight Loss</em>. He reaches millions of people each year who are struggling with unwanted eating challenges and body image concerns through his  speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>    Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same.

Samantha is a 43-year old originally from Johannesburg, South Africa who is now living in London, and is struggling with a variety of eating challenges, including binge eating, emotional eating, and overeating. After quitting smoking 8 years ago, Samantha put on weight that she has since not been able to shed. She’s tried plant-based diets to good effect, but eventually returns to unwanted eating habits.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Why We Self-Sabotage with Food & How to Stop    <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    Food and body challenges aren’t confined to certain regions or countries, they’re truly found all over the world as today’s episode of the podcast demonstrates. Samantha is a 43-year old originally from Johannesburg, South Africa who is now living in London, and is struggling with a variety of eating challenges, including binge eating, emotional eating, and overeating. After quitting smoking 8 years ago, Samantha put on weight that she has since not been able to shed. She’s tried plant-based diets to good effect, but eventually returns to unwanted eating habits. Tired of struggling with her weight, low energy, poor sleep, and weak digestion, Samantha turns to eating psychology expert, Marc David, who helps her find a deeper understanding of  what’s driving her food challenges.    Key Insights: <ul> <li> Certain diets like Keto, Paleo, or plant-based diets can be therapeutic for the body — whether we stay on them over the long-term or use them as tools to recalibrate our health. Whatever our approach to eating may be, it’s important to recognize that these diets don’t address the psychological drivers behind our eating challenges.</li> <li> Taking this a step further, we can’t fix eating challenges — which stem from our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs — using nutrition alone. To address unwanted eating habits such as binge eating or emotional eating, we need to understand and ultimately transform our psychology.</li> <li> A common way we stay stuck in our eating challenges is by self-attacking ourselves that we have these challenges in the first place. This negative self talk can be truly endless. If you find yourself saying things like  “why  can’t I just get over this already?” or  “I’m  terrible at controlling myself around food,” it’s time to bring loving attention to these thoughts.</li> <li> Look for where you can begin to make small shifts in your internal self talk. Where can you acknowledge your efforts and your progress, no matter how small? Recognizing the shifts you’re making helps solidify those positive changes over time. </li> <li> No matter what your brain may try to convince you of, remember you're  a unique and  wonderful  human. You’re not broken, there’s nothing to fix. Keep reminding yourself of this … eventually, you’ll feel the truth of that in your bones.</li> </ul>   With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A.,  has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating,  Marc is the author of the bestselling books,  <em>Nourishing Wisdom: A Mind Body Approach to Health & Well-Being,</em>  and  <em>The Slow Down Diet: Eating for Pleasure, Energy, and Weight Loss</em>. He reaches millions of people each year who are struggling with unwanted eating challenges and body image concerns through his  speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>    Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same. Tune in here:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>    Follow us on social:  <ul class="listtype-bullet listindent1 list-bullet1"> <li> Facebook:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage">www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a></li> <li> Instagram:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a></li> <li> Pinterest:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych">www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a></li> </ul>      <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#eatingpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionexpert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionexpert</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightloss" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightloss</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightlossdiet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightlossdiet</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23selflovejourney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#selflovejourney</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23reparenting" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#reparenting</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthymindset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthymindset</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthylifestyletips" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthylifestyletips</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23selfcompassion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#selfcompassion</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthyweightloss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthyweightloss</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionadvice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionadvice</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritiontips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritiontips</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23loveyourbodynow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#loveyourbodynow</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23keto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#keto</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23plantbasediet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#plantbasediet</a> ]]></content:encoded>

As a pre-teen, Jenna dealt with anorexia - something she overcame with tremendous support from her parents and mentors. However, Jenna still struggles with body image issues and a tendency to skip meals, and she ultimately wants to let that go and find freedom with food.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Overcoming The Belief That We’re Not Worthy Of Health</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    In this episode, Marc David speaks with 30-year old Jenna. As a pre-teen, Jenna dealt with anorexia - something she overcame with tremendous support from her parents and mentors. However, Jenna still struggles with body image issues and a tendency to skip meals, and she ultimately wants to let that go and find freedom with food. Through the course of their conversation, Marc and Jenna speak about her roots as a first-generation American, the unique cultural conditioning she’s received from her Chinese lineage, and how that has affected her relationship with food and body.     Key Insights: <ul> <li> Eating challenges are often strongly correlated  with  our culture’s unique conditioning. Depending on we’re from, the expectations placed on us to look or eat a certain way can be quite severe.</li> <li> Overcoming cultural conditioning first requires an awareness of it. We need to recognize:  “there’s  something driving me to behave in a certain way or believe in a certain idea, that didn’t originate from me. It came from outside me.” Once we’ve identified unwanted conditioning, we can then start to get to work on letting it go.</li> <li> It’s possible to honor and respect our  lineage, culture, and parents while still being  our  own person.  Choosing to not meet outside expectations isn’t a rejection of others, it’s simply a decision to honor ourselves and what’s best for us.</li> <li> Disembodiment is a strategy for not feeling things we don’t want to feel. It can be related to pressures from others to look or act a certain way, a response to trauma or painful life circumstances, or even just everyday disappointments and let downs.</li> <li> We ultimately heal disembodiment by bringing conscious awareness of all the big and small ways we  “check  out” of the body. We take each day at a time, loving ourselves, our bodies, and our lives as fully as we can.

Yeny had a precipitating event — an accident while on vacation in Utah — that forever changed her life. After several months in a wheelchair, Yeny defied all odds and regained the ability to walk.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> What’s The Connection Between PTSD & Emotional Eating?</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well    In today’s episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast, Marc David speaks with  Yeny, a 41-year old Venezuelan about her challenges with emotional eating. Yeny had a precipitating event — an accident while on vacation in Utah — that forever changed her life. After several months in a wheelchair, Yeny defied all odds and regained the ability to walk. To others, Yeny now appears in perfect health, but she’s struggling to let go of the memory of her accident and the dark days of her recovery. Marc makes a powerful connection for Yeny between PTSD and emotional eating, and gives her key tools to begin to unwind from all she’s been through.    Key Insights: <ul> <li> Regardless of  the  cause, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder  (PTSD)  can  give rise to emotional eating  and other unwanted eating challenges.  It is the brain’s way of trying to cope with past traumas.</li> <li> When under stress, our natural instinct is to  self soothe. One of the easiest ways to do this is to turn to food. This is both normal and natural, and this is nothing to beat yourself up about.</li> <li> Eating is an emotional experience.  From  birth,  we are hard wired to experience joy, comfort, and nourishment  through  eating. </li> <li> We often respond to stress by eating. And guess what? This isn’t always a bad thing. It’s time to get off the self-judgment train, while also discovering other ways to create a relaxation response in our bodies. As we do this, the impulse to reach for food in times of stress diminishes.</li> <li> Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing  (EMDR)  is a powerful  therapeutic  technique  for transforming PTSD.  If you’re dealing with persistent PTSD, finding a therapist who specializes in EMDR is highly recommended.</li> </ul>   With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A.,  has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating,  Marc is the author of the bestselling books,  <em>Nourishing Wisdom: A Mind Body Approach to Health & Well-Being,</em>  and  <em>The Slow Down Diet: Eating for Pleasure, Energy, and Weight Loss</em>. He reaches millions of people each year who are struggling with unwanted eating challenges and body image concerns through his  speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>    Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same. Tune in here:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>    Follow us on social:  <ul class="listtype-bullet listindent1 list-bullet1"> <li> Facebook:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage">www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a></li> <li> Instagram:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a></li> <li> Pinterest:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych">www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a></li> </ul>      <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23EmotionalEating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#EmotionalEating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DisorderedEating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23DisorderedEating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">DisorderedEating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23EmotionalEatingIn2021" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#Emotional</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23EmotionalEatingIn2021" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">E</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23EmotionalEatingIn2021" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">ating</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23EmotionalEatingIn2021" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">I</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23EmotionalEatingIn2021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">n2021</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23emotionaleatingsolutions" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#emotionaleatingsolutions</a>   <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23PTSDandweightgain" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23PTSDandweightgain" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">PTSDand</a><a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23PTSDandweightgain" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">weightgain</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightloss" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightloss</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bingeeating" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bingeeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23selfcompassion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#selfcompassion</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodisadoorway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodisadoorway</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthcoach" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthcoach</a>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ A 30-Year Old Former Gymnast Reclaims Her Power Around Food & Body  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?     In this episode of The Psychology of Eating, Marc David speaks to Chanel, a former gymnast  whose self-criticism is driving her to binge and purge. After taking Marc’s Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training, she now recognizes what’s driving her nearly two-decades-long eating challenge. Most importantly, Chanel realizes that binging and purging are unconscious strategies she’s used in  an  attempt to deal with emotions she hasn’t known how to cope with. As Marc helps her recognize, part of Chanel’s current journey is learning to embrace where she is right now without judgment that she should be further along. It’s a reminder we can all use, regardless of the challenges we’re facing.    Key Insights: <ul> <li> Contrary to what many believe, binge eating is not a problem. It doesn’t need fixing. It’s simply a strategy to deal with another issue we don’t know how to address.</li> <li> An important thing to understand about the binge-purge cycle: binge eating creates physiologic and psychological stress, which purging then relieves. </li> <li> Repressing negative emotions like anger or sadness can lead us to engage in any number of unwanted eating challenges, including binging and purging. Find healthy ways to honor your emotions, such as listening to music that has special meaning for you, or regularly journaling your thoughts and feelings.</li> <li> Learning to bring conscious awareness in the moment when we’re about to binge eat is absolutely key to transforming this unwanted behavior. What are we thinking about? What emotions are we feeling? What do we feel in the body? Tune into this.</li> <li> Show yourself generosity for the progress you make and celebrate your success. Acknowledge that  you’ll have setbacks, and bring the self-forgiveness forward that you so deeply deserve. </li> </ul>   With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David, M.A.,  has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating,  Marc is the author of the bestselling books,  <em>Nourishing Wisdom: A Mind Body Approach to Health & Well-Being,</em>  and  <em>The Slow Down Diet: Eating for Pleasure, Energy, and Weight Loss</em>. He reaches millions of people each year who are struggling with unwanted eating challenges and body image concerns through his  speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://psychologyofeating.com/">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>    Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same. Tune in here:  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>    Follow us on social:  <ul class="listtype-bullet listindent1 list-bullet1"> <li> Facebook:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage">www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</a></li> <li> Instagram:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</a></li> <li> Pinterest:  <a class="attrlink" href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych">www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</a></li> </ul>      <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23psychologyofeating" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#psychologyofeating</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23foodpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#foodpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23eatingpsychology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#eatingpsychology</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23nutritionexpert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#nutritionexpert</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23weightloss" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#weightloss</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23healthyweightloss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#healthyweightloss</a>   <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bingepurge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bingepurge</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23bingepurgecycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#bingepurgecycle</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23fightorflight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#fightorflight</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23stressresponse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#stressresponse</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23celebrateprogress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">#celebrateprogress</a>  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23loveyourself" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">#loveyourself</a> ]]></content:encoded>

What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    A Naturalist Grandmother Learns to Become Her Own Health Advocate    Listen to eating psychology expert  Marc David as he speaks with Holly, a 52-year old grandmother seeking to lose weight so she can be more active with her family and enjoy being active outdoors. Holly has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and is dealing with sleep issues, low mood, and a lack of energy. Marc helps Holly zero in on some key diagnostics to pursue … and also helps her see better understand the places she gets stuck making good decisions for her health. Tune in now!    Key Insights: <ul> <li> Hypothyroidism can lead to a cascade of challenging symptoms, including weight gain, insomnia, low energy, and mood issues.</li> <li> Another physiological cause  (among  many) for unwanted weight gain is undiagnosed diabetes. Undergoing diagnostic testing is important when looking at physiological causes of weight gain.</li> <li> Naturopaths  or functional medicine practitioners can be a great resource when looking at possible causes of weight issues.</li> <li> Learning to become one’s own health advocate is of prime importance when dealing with any health issue — whether related to weight or other challenges.</li> <li> Sometimes, our dearest loved ones don’t always know how to best support us in our health and weight challenges. It doesn’t mean they don’t care, however finding the support you need is vital … whether from a friend or a trained professional. </li> </ul>  With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Healing Family Lineage: A 37-Year Old Man’s Journey with Anger, Weight, & Reparenting</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?     In this episode of  <em>The Psychology of Eating</em>  Podcast, Marc David speaks to 37-year-old Eric who opens up about weight loss challenges, his relationship with his father, being a stay-at-home dad, and much more. The episode offers unique insight into the emotional healing that has to come  on the path to resolving  food and weight challenges. Through the enlightening conversation,  Eric learns to give himself the kindness, presence, and gentleness that he missed  receiving  from his father. Watch now!    Key Insights: <ul> <li> Your  relationship with  your  same-sex parent can have a huge bearing on  your  relationship with self, and consequently  your  relationship with food. Learning to  reparent  yourself  is a vital first step towards resolving food  and body  issues.</li> <li> Bring presence to eating and learning to  inhabit your body  are important keys to losing weight sustainably. </li> <li> Learn to be  comfortable  in your  body.  Love it,  accept it,  and to give it a hug – literally and figuratively. It is OK to ask for and get the help and support you need, however you need it.</li> <li> Inhabiting your body can come through doing physical activities you love … whether through resistance training, dancing, hiking, or any other kind of movement. </li> <li> Anger is a powerful emotion that many of us don’t know how to work with constructively.  Honor it, listen to it, learn from it.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Taking Responsibility for Our Relationship with Food</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    In this episode of  <em>The Psychology of Eating Podcast with Marc David,</em>  we meet Agnes who struggles with avoiding sugar and gluten. Food psychology expert Marc David traces Agnes's challenges with food back to her 14-year-old self when bullying in school made her feel the need to lose weight. Agnes now has an uneasy relationship with food and tries to avoid bingeing. Marc identifies her need to be in control as a possible issue, and reveals how she can enjoy and have fun with healthy eating. Listen now!    Key Insights      Many of the challenges people have around food start early, such as during one's teens. Peer pressure or bullying in school can create an unhealthy body image and an adversarial relationship around food. This can be healed even later in life.      Wanting to control what one eats and all other aspects of life is a natural instinct and that control feels good. However, there is a difference between control and taking responsibility, and it is taking responsibility that will help resolve challenges around eating.      Food is a reflection of life. Wanting to be in control of everything one eats then spills over into the need to be in control of every other aspect of life as well. It can be tough to let go, but learning to do this can be freeing.      Remember to savor the process of eating  --  to eat the things that give pleasure, taste good and bring satiety to the body. Learn not to rush through the meal either out of habit or because that is what we are taught to do.      Eating can be fun. Wanting that bar of chocolate could actually be the voice of wisdom from inside the body, but we deny ourselves the fun of eating because we fear losing control.

Tracy seeks to lose about 15 kilos, while finding equanimity in her relationship with food and body. Quarantined in her apartment during Covid, Tracy feels alone and isolated, and reflects on a series of losses that have defined her life including the loss of her father when she was just four years old. As Marc helps her recognize, Tracy has never really integrated the losses she’s endured … something that is true for so many of us. When emotions aren’t metabolized, whether grief, anger, or other emotions, they can show up in other ways — often as symptoms in the body. Listen in as Tracy discovers a new path not just for losing weight, but finding a beautiful and healing path through the grief that so deeply colors her life.</span><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> </span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> Key Insights:</span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> <img title="check mark button" src= "https://paper.dropboxstatic.com/static/img/ace/emoji/2705.png?version=6.0.0" alt="check mark button" height="16" data-emoji-ch="✅" /></span> <span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz82zpigz122zhz69zz78zz85zz85zz77zsz75zez77zz87zz122z2z78zz69zy7oohz76zz84zfz69z9z76z"> Of the numerous psychological contributors to weight gain or weight loss resistance,</span> <span class= " author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qowz81zz66zkz122zf0z85z6iy8z90zcz84zu8z68znl6z88zz86zz76zz78zertr2z74zz87z"> grief is often one of the overlooked causal factors.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Unresolved Grief and Weight Gain - Is There a Connection?</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    Primary teacher  at the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, Marc David  speaks with 45-year old Tracy, originally from New Zealand and newly living in Australia. Tracy seeks to lose about 15 kilos, while finding equanimity in her relationship with food and body. Quarantined in her apartment during Covid, Tracy feels alone and isolated, and reflects on a series of losses that have defined her life including the loss of her father when she was just four years old. As Marc helps her recognize, Tracy has never really integrated the losses she’s endured … something that is true for so many of us. When emotions aren’t metabolized, whether grief, anger, or other emotions, they can show up in other ways — often as symptoms in the body. Listen in as Tracy discovers a new path not just for losing weight, but finding a beautiful and healing path through the grief that so deeply colors her life.     Key Insights:      Of the numerous psychological contributors to weight gain or weight loss resistance,  grief is often one of the overlooked causal factors. Unacknowledged  or  unresolved grief  can be a key factory underlying our  eating challenges.      Losing a parent early in life  can mean so much more than just the loss of that parent. Children who have lost a parent early in life often find their other parent struggling to cope with their grief, resulting in the child having to do a lot of self-parenting. This is yet another form of loss — that of an innocent childhood, and can ultimately lead to unresolved grief as an adult.      Sometimes  the grieving we need to do in life is that of letting go of who we used to be. Whether it’s a role we used to inhabit, a certain time of life, or having a certain athleticism or healthy body, it can be hard to move on from aspects of ourselves that we took a lot of pleasure or pride in.      Speaking to a therapist or a counselor, particularly a grief counselor, can be a vital first step towards resolving one's past and moving on.      Journaling is another  effective way to acknowledge and give expression to grief. Figuratively writing a letter to a deceased parent is another.  Writing, in whatever form, can be a powerful way to express, transform, and release emotions that are calling out for our attention.     With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.      Are you experiencing unwanted food and body challenges?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 34-Year-Old Learns To Find Firm Ground in Life – And Her Body</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?     In this episode of the  <em>Psychology of Eating</em>  Podcast,  eating psychology expert  Marc David speaks to 34-year-old Tricia about her  difficulty  shedding  stubborn pounds. Tricia opens up to Marc about her history of sexual abuse,  and Marc unearths the connection between her trauma and her challenge with weight loss. Listen in to this powerful and inspiring episode as Tricia learns how to trust herself and her body again, and works towards a personal breakthrough.     Key Insights:      Suffering sexual assault can make a person feel insecure and fearful, and may have a significant bearing on a person’s ability or inability to lose weight. Finding firm ground in life has the happy consequence of finding firm ground within the body.      There are many ways to practice feeling safe. Gather evidence of being and feeling safe and catalog these in some way so that it is possible to let go of the fear and the insecurity.      Sometimes challenges around weight have less to do with the physical weight and more to do with conflicting emotions. Coming to terms with those emotions can be the important first step for a person looking to lose weight.      The body will lose weight when it is ready. Take care of yourself and heal so that the body feels confident in relinquishing the weight that it has been holding on to for so long.      We are conditioned to believe that weight loss is just about creating a caloric deficit  --  about eating less and exercising more. However, there’s more to the story of weight and its loss than a simple  “calories  in, calories out” approach, including our eating psychology and our unique physiology, which is always in an intimate dance with things like stress, connection with others, spirituality, and so much more.    With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.      Having your own challenges with food and body?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Session With Marc David: When Rebelliousness Leads To Binge Eating</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?     In this week’s episode of  <em>The Psychology of Eating Podcast with Marc David</em>, we meet 25-year old Caitlin, a former safari camp manager hailing from Harare, Zimbabwe. Caitlin has been binge eating since she was 13, often on bread and sweets. She reports that she can go for months at a time without binge eating, and then suddenly find herself back in her old pattern. Confused about what’s going on for her, Caitlin turns to Marc for insight into why she binge eats and how she can put an end to this undesired eating habit.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Young Woman Deals with Gluten Sensitivity</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    Briana  is a busy graduate student who  lives with gluten sensitivity.  While Briana doesn’t have celiac disease, she has all the markers of gluten sensitivity: bloating and stomach pain, fatigue, and mood fluctuations. She’s taken breaks from gluten before with amazing benefits but is struggling to let go of her love of gluten-based foods.  Listen  in as Marc David, Founder and  Primary  Teacher at the Institute for the Psychology of Eating works with Briana on practical strategies for managing her gluten sensitivity, while also helping her understand the important connections between stress and food sensitivities.    Key Insights:      Gluten-based foods are everywhere and they can be hard to give up. The first step in dealing with gluten sensitivities is recognizing you have them. This means tuning into your body as you’re eating a given food and noticing how you feel afterward.       If you suspect you have a sensitivity to gluten, getting tested with your doctor or functional medicine practitioner is an important next step.      Symptoms of gluten sensitivity can include  bloating,  stomach pain, skin issues like breakouts, mood changes, lethargy, forgetfulness, and difficulty focusing.       When we binge on food that makes us feel bad, a common response is to beat ourselves up. It’s important to acknowledge that giving up foods we enjoy is tough, and giving ourselves a hard time is counterproductive to changing our eating habits.      Finding support from others is also important as we retool our diet. Sometimes the people we love the most have a hard time supporting us as we make changes. While that doesn’t feel great, that doesn’t mean that others can’t be there for us. Look for those people and find the support you need and deserve.    With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.      Are you experiencing unwanted food and body challenges?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coming Into Our Queenly Power Around Body Image</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    In this episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast, Marc speaks with  Gabriela, a Mexico City resident and health-based entrepreneur who  has  recently  completed  The Mind Body  Eating Coach Certification Training  from the  Institute for the Psychology of Eating.  Gabriela has been dealing with body image issues for many years and recognizes that these issues are affecting her ability to effectively coach her clients. Tune in as Marc helps Gabriela identify how she can find peace around her body image so that she can do the same for her own clients.     Key Insights:      Many of us get fixated on being a certain size or shape, while largely ignoring self-care or engaging in practices that improve our health, energy, and vitality. If this is you, just know you deserve more than trying to get yourself to fit into a certain size. You’re worthy of your love, of which self-care is a direct reflection.      Ironically, those of us who are fitness or health professionals can be particularly prone to obsession around dieting, food restriction, excessive exercise, and the like.  So there’s an opportunity to ask ourselves: are we engaging in these activities out of self-love? If not, we must cultivate the wisdom to refine our approach and learn to give our bodies what they need and want.      We’ve all heard it before, but in order to help others, we truly do have to learn how to walk our talk.       But please understand: this doesn’t mean being perfect. It means opening up our hearts and moving from a place of self and other compassion. It means understanding we’re all humans, here to learn and grow on this journey of life.      Exercising  and eating  right for our unique bodies should create a kind of natural  joy and happiness.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our Relationship with Food is Like A Dance</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?     Maria is a  31-year old  director of a dance and cardio training program who has a lifelong love of nutrition and finds herself generally happy with her relationship to food and body. But she finds herself often busy at work on her computer, and often missing her body’s cues for when and what to eat. In today’s episode of The Psychology of Eating Podcast, eating psychology expert Marc David helps Maria develop a more present and nuanced relationship with her appetite. Tune in now!    Key Insights:      Digestive problems, disordered eating, and body image issues have  as much to do  with why and how we eat, as they do with what we’re eating.       To become an intuitive and mindful eater, identifying  and trusting  the body’s hunger cues  is key.      Part of trusting our body’s cues is learning to trust ourselves as humans. Give yourself  permission to experiment. Listen to what your body is telling you as you make different choices, and then refine those choices as you develop more body awareness.      Our relationship with  food is much like dance.  When we see eating from a place of self-connection, creative self-expression, and deep presence, we can find ourselves in a natural state of flow, joy, and true health.      Reframing our relationship with food in this way allows us to move away from old thought patterns of  “good  food” versus  “bad  food,” or  “good  choices” versus  “bad  choices.” This creates so much more internal space for ourselves, and we begin to experience food in an entirely different way.    With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.      Are you experiencing unwanted food and body challenges?

Nikol acknowledges she’s a sensitive person who often turns to food, especially sugar, to manage her emotions.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Woman Turns The Tide On Negative Self-Talk</p>  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    In this week’s episode of  <em>The Psychology of Eating</em>  Podcast, Marc works with Nikol, a 40-year old law professor from Croatia. Nikol acknowledges she’s a sensitive person who often turns to food, especially sugar, to manage her emotions. While Nikol is looking to lose weight, more than anything she wants to find freedom around food … to be able to enjoy it, but not need it to calm or numb her feelings. Tune in as Marc David, founder of The Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training, helps her redefine what freedom around food truly means.      Key Insights:       Childhood challenges and traumas go right to the core. As children, we have very simple means of regulating emotions – food being a key way to soothe and comfort.       The residue of these challenges continues  through adulthood until we consciously face and work through them.       As adults, we can find ourselves confused why we have unwanted eating habits such as binging – and often completely overlook the deeper psychological reasons these habits were formed in the first place.         Therefore, changing any unwanted eating habit must involve more than simply trying to eat less sugar or adhering to strict food rules. If you want sustainable change, learn about yourself, your past, and your psychology. Discover and tend to the places inside where you’re hurting.          Paying attention to our inner dialogue – meaning how we speak to ourselves and about ourselves – is a good place to start changing from the inside out. Speak kindly, compassionately, and lovingly … you deserve it.     With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.      Are you experiencing unwanted food and body challenges?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Why  Emotional Metabolism  is Key to a Vibrant, Healthy Life</p>  Eating psychology expert  and founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, Marc David explains the concept of emotional metabolism.  While physiological metabolism governs the literal breakdown of what we eat and drink, emotional metabolism is all about processing emotions that come up in the course of everyday life. As Marc explains, metabolizing our emotions is vital not just to our psychological health — but to our physical health as well.  Don’t miss this insightful podcast!    Key Insights:      The body’s metabolism takes the air we breathe and the food and water we consume, and turns it into fuel while removing toxins. This is nutritional metabolism.       Emotional metabolism involves the deliberate, consistent practice of allowing our emotions to surface. We then have the opportunity to become more conscious and present human beings.      When we don’t allow ourselves to feel and process our emotions, there can be a literal effect on the body’s physiology and organ systems.      Unwanted eating challenges such as overeating, binge eating, and emotional eating are often signs of unprocessed emotions or trauma.      Societal  conditioning  tells us to  “suck  it up” or  “get  with the program” — meaning, we’re often encouraged to suppress and deny our feelings. Rejecting this conditioning and embracing our feelings — including the challenging ones — is fundamental to enjoying a healthy and fulfilling life.     With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Having your own challenges with food and body?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In Session With Marc David: A 48 Year Old Woman Ends The Battle With Her Body  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    Melanie is a 48-year-old yoga instructor who had no weight issues before her pregnancies. She then gained 65 pounds, which she has been unable to lose. Marc David, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating,  explains to Melanie why dieting is not working for her, and describes what will help and why.  Listen now!    Key Insights:      Even those who have no problem with weight can develop weight issues later in life and may find it difficult to lose the weight.  Our bodies are constantly changing, and there can be a multitude of reasons weight loss isn’t happening.      The thyroid can be implicated in weight gain, so getting worked up by a medical practitioner is a key step in ruling out possible causes.      Trying to lose weight  can be  a stressor. Dieting  often  makes the body hungry, stressed.  Therefore, getting off the diet cycle and aligning with the long-term goal of sustainable, gentle weight loss is key.      Eating too fast  robs us of enjoying our food, as well as the sensation of satiation after a meal.  Ironically, part of effective weight loss means owning the pleasure we receive from food. Why not allow yourself to slow down a little and truly savor every bite?       Pleasure from a meal regulates the appetite.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ The Most Important Exercise Secret    Founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, Marc David shares a vital secret about exercise. For those who dislike exercise, find it burdensome and do it only for reasons of weight loss, he provides a vital reframe. Check out this podcast where Marc explores this important topic.    Key Insights:      There are some people who love exercising, to whom being active comes naturally.  But for many of us, exercising is a chore and a burden. If that’s you, it’s time to reimagine your approach to exercise.       Exercising against your will results in the release of stress hormones. The stress perception makes the body store fat, and in the end,  the body  can  end up losing little or no weight.      Forced exercise that comes from  hating the body is rarely sustainable and feels terrible. Finding a relationship with inspired movement is a much better path to being in healthy relationship with ourselves and our bodies.      Instead of exercise that you hate doing, find other enjoyable ways to be active.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ When Life Challenges Lead to Weight Gain  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    Sabine was a healthy weight for much of her life, before the end of a marriage resulted in acute stress and sudden, sharp weight gain.  Eating  psychology expert  Marc David offers insight into Sabine’s weight gain and explains how she can lose the weight  --  without trying  so hard  to do so. Listen now!    Key Insights:      The desire to lose weight can be more than just about looks. It can be about freedom and self-respect.      A lot of people learn to respond to stress by turning to food or drink early in life. It takes time and patience to decouple stress and the eating/drinking response.      There could be some benefits of carrying some extra weight. One can feel more grounded,  solid,  and  stronger.      Sometimes,  life is asking you to go beyond a single-pointed focus on losing weight. It’s asking us to step into our bodies and our lives, fully - as we are, right now.       Your  relationship with  your  body  mirrors your  relationship with life.  How are you showing up for yourself?     With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.      Are you struggling with unwanted food and body challenges?

Now, however, our modern lifestyles have created a bio-rhythmic confusion where our environment has changed but the urge to consume carbs has not.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Evolutionary Reason the Human Body Craves Carbs</p> <p> <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a></p> <p> Marc David, visionary, teacher, and consultant in the novel field of Eating Psychology, explains why the human body has evolved to crave carbs, and how this has helped us survive and adapt over the ages. Now, however, our modern lifestyles have created a bio-rhythmic confusion where our environment has changed but the urge to consume carbs has not. Check out this podcast to know how carbohydrates fool the body and what you can do about it.</p>    Key Insights:      There is an evolutionary reason for the human body craving sugar and looking to instinctively load up on carbs whenever available. The body evolved to eat during summer and during times of plenty to ride out hard winter times.      This instinctive human urge has not changed though the availability of carbs has. Carbs fool the body and make us consume more than the body can metabolize.      Hibernating animals such as bears demonstrate this behavior of fattening up during the plentiful summer months to tide over the lean winter months. Here, the high blood pressure and diabetic state actually help in survival.      In our modern lifestyles, we consume carbs all around the year, signaling the pre-hibernation stage to the body. This,  along with artificial light and less sleep,  causes the body to store fat and prevents the body from reaching its metabolic potential.      Changing the quantity and quality of carbs consumed, and making changes in sleep patterns helps the body relinquish its fat stores. Learning what works best for your body will help you make the most informed choices.    With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Having your own challenges with food and body?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ In Session With Marc David: It’s Not About Cutting Out Sugar … It’s About Adding In Life    <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    Tracy is a fitness instructor who has been hooked on sugar since she was a toddler. She recently turned 50 and still  struggles  with sugar. Listen in as Marc David, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, explores  the reasons behind Tracy’s sugar cravings and why it doesn’t have to be all or nothing for her.  Listen now!    Key Insights:      Emotional attachments to sugary foods can start  as early as  infancy. For some of us, sugar cravings can dominate our lives and make us feel out of control with our eating habits.      It’s important to recognize that there are fundamental reasons rooted in our biology, psychology, or both, for sugar cravings.       Food is in our genetic memory. It is the first feel-good experience for most human beings.       Turning to  sugar  as a  source of comfort  or emotional regulation  during stressful times  is not a sign that we’re weak or undisciplined - it simply means we’re humans trying to find methods for emotional regulation. Looking to other ways to manage our stress is key to lessening our reliance on sugar.       Finding balance  with food cravings such as sugar is not  so much  about cutting out  the  “bad”  or unwanted food out.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Why Suppressing Hunger Never Works For Weight Loss    <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    Are You Trying to Control Your Appetite?    In this short video, author of the groundbreaking and bestselling books  ‘Nourishing  Wisdom’ and  ‘The  Slow Down Diet’, Marc David  takes a look at appetite, and why trying to control it might not be such a great idea.  If you’re trying to lose weight, you won’t want to miss this episode!     Key Insights:      People looking to lose weight  will often  try to suppress their appetite. However, this never works as a  long-term  weight loss strategy, as we’re constantly at war with our natural physiology.       Appetite is not the enemy. We are designed to enjoy  and find pleasure in  food,  it’s hard-wired into our biology.  If you are waging a war on your appetite,  it’s time to  call a ceasefire.      Learning  to  honor and  listen to our appetite  is essential  to developing  a healthy  relationship with food.      Using food as a de-stressor is not only natural, but perfectly OK. The key is making a conscious choice that you’re using food to relax, and to simply allow yourself to feel encumbered pleasure while eating. If you’re trying to lose weight, it becomes even more important to make eating consciously - and to begin identifying other ways to let go of stress.      One of the most effective strategies to  tuning into your natural appetite is to  practice slow eating.  Over time, slow eating transforms  appetite dysregulation  and helps us know when we’re truly hungry.    With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Having your own challenges with food and body?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    In Session With Marc David:  Life Transitions  & Letting Go    When it comes to eating challenges, it’s easy to overthink the simple act of nourishing ourselves with food. In this week’s episode, eating psychology expert Marc David works with Juliet, a fitness instructor and graduate of The Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training. Juliet reports making amazing progress in her struggles with food and body but still finds herself overanalyzing food choices. Tune in  as they explore ways for Juliet to find more peace and freedom around food,  and embrace a new milestone in her life.     Key Insights:      There is so much information out there about what  (and  what not)  to eat,  that it can be difficult to know what’s best for one’s own body.      A great first step in learning to eat more intuitively is letting go of the idea that there is a  “right”  way to eat. The truth is that every BODY is different and has unique nutritional needs.      Another important early step in adopting a more intuitive eating style is bringing increased awareness to how different foods make your body feel. Do you have energy after eating a certain food? Do you feel light and happy? Or are you sluggish or bloated or moody? These are the kinds of signals your body gives you to communicate what it likes - and what it doesn’t.       As you positively transform your relationship with food, there can be a sort of identity confusion where how you defined yourself previously  (as  a binge eater or an emotional eater, for example) no longer stands - but you’re not quite sure who the next version of you is yet.       In this way, food and body transformations are part of the overall growth and evolution we experience over a lifetime. We’re often saying goodbye to some aspect of ourselves while welcoming in a new, lesser-known part of our emerging self.    With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.      Having your own challenges with food and body?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ The Psychology of Cleansing and Detoxing    <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    The process of fasting or undergoing a detox or cleanse has many benefits for the body.  But did you know that one’s mindset going into a cleanse is as important as the cleanse itself? Join Marc David, an  innovator in Eating Psychology and Mind Body Nutrition, to learn more about the positive benefits of cleansing, and how to cultivate the mindset necessary for a great experience.   If you would like to get the best out of your cleanse or detox, be sure to listen in as Marc explains  the psychology behind cleansing.    Key Insights:      When undergoing a detox or cleanse,  your  mindset will  undoubtedly  impact the outcome.  Understanding the psychological components of cleansing is key to achieving great results.       Ancient cultures have long understood the importance of fasting and cleansing the body of toxins. These were practices that were seen to optimize the body and all its functions  --  an intelligent nutritional defense for the body.      Today human beings are bombarded with all sorts of pollutants from the air, water and earth around us. The body has to combat tens of thousands of artificial chemicals  every year. This is why a cleanse or detox can be so important.       The process of fasting or undergoing a detox has value beyond just the physical. It can help to eliminate poisons stored in the body and bring about emotional detox as well.      The healing, repair and maintenance of body tissue happens when there is a physiologic relaxation response from the body.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?     Marc David, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating,  speaks to Kathy, a 38-year old woman diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease, Celiac disease, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and chemical sensitivities. She comes to Marc looking for help in making peace with food restrictions she’s had to put into place to ease her autoimmune reactions. Listen in as Marc helps reframe some of the ways she’s been perceiving her challenges, and gives her some surprising advice about the usefulness of strict food rules in healing her body.    Key Insights:      Autoimmune conditions and chemical sensitivities can have numerous causes; among them can be a triggering event of some kind — whether a physical, environmental, or emotional trauma.      When traumatic events happen early in life, our young brains are not always able to process them - and this can lead to physiological dysfunction later in life.      Taking on the role of family mediator or  “helper”  as a young child can create a psychological pattern where one learns to prioritize others’ needs over their own. As a result, a hyper-alert, anxious, and stressed state develops that affects our physiology, including our immune system.      Creating a nourishing  relationship with food, reducing stress  as much as possible,  getting into nature regularly, and  using tools such as meditation and breathing techniques can help to  reduce autoimmune symptoms      A highly useful program for people with autoimmune issues and chemical sensitivities is  DNRS or the Dynamic Neural Retraining System.    With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.      Having your own challenges with food and body?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Did You Know You're on a Metabolic Journey?    Marc David, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, shares some fascinating insights into the body’s metabolism in this video. He explains why people’s plans to lose weight and boost energy tend to fail simply because they don’t have the entire picture of their metabolism. Tune in to understand how one's metabolic journey starts at conception, and how that journey has high and low points that we can learn from and grow with.    Key Insights      Weight loss and fat burning plans often don’t succeed because people do not have the full picture of their metabolism. The body’s metabolism has to be seen in a holistic way to achieve these goals.      The body’s metabolism is a lifelong story that begins at conception and continues till a person draws their last breath. The high and low points of that journey can tell us a lot, if we learn to listen.      We can learn a lot from the high points of the body’s metabolic journey, such as good health and vitality. We also learn from the low points such as disease, illness, weakness, pain and weight challenges, and can grow from these.      Fighting hunger, judging your body and other such self-abuse prevents the body from reaching its health, weight and fitness goals. A positive strategy needs to be employed to reach those goals.      Loving and nurturing the body is the way to travel along with the body on its metabolic journey. This is the way to  transform our food and body challenges, for good.    With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.     Having your own challenges with food and body?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?     A 25-Year Old Works with Weight & Womanhood    In this episode, Marc David, teacher and eating psychology pioneer, works with  Tess,  a 25-year-old  woman from New Zealand. Tess often finds herself compulsively eating, and seeks to transform this pattern, lose weight, and feel more confident. Additionally, Tess wants to be a mother and believes losing weight is key to a healthy  pregnancy.   Tune in to listen as Marc helps Tess begin a new chapter in her relationship with food and body.     Key Insights:      Many eating challenges, such as compulsive eating, are rooted in negative psychology.      Transforming compulsive eating is multidimensional and unique to each person — there truly isn’t a  “one-size-fits-all”  approach.      Compulsive eating, like other eating challenges, can create euphoria in the body. Recognizing this, we can begin to look for other ways to relieve stress.      Learning to love oneself into a better relationship with food means, in part, loving ourselves through our perceived eating  “mistakes.”      Many of us benefit from the mantra,  “I’m  not a disappointment. I’m a success.” Train yourself to believe it.    With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.      Having your own challenges with food and body?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?     Why Do I Sabotage Myself with Food?    Do you feel like you sabotage yourself with food?  Join Marc David,  Founder of  The Institute for the  Psychology of Eating,  on the topic of self-sabotage and why we sometimes use food to thwart ourselves. So often, the reasons why we go against our own best interests are not so obvious. Learn more in today’s episode!    Key  Highlights:      Here’s the true definition of the word sabotage: Sabotage means to deliberately destroy, damage, or obstruct.  Please note the word  “deliberate.”      Some of the most compelling psychological models have this to say:  we're not just one person,  we're a crowd...watch the episode to learn more!      We all have a child within us who wants what it wants when it wants it. We also  have an inner teenager or a rebel who could care less about what anybody else thinks…      When we go against ourselves, what most people call self-sabotage is more likely the voice of  our inner child, or our inner teenager, or the  inner  rebel inside us that takes over.      Your job is to  never  fight, belittle, or attack yourself. Your job is to listen, to learn, to embrace, to forgive, and to act with skill and kindness.    Have  questions? We’re here to help!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?     In today’s episode, 57-year old  Deborah  wishes to improve her health while losing 70+ pounds, and she comes to Marc David looking for help. A teacher who dreams of becoming a chef, Deborah is frustrated by her efforts to lose the weight and keep it off. Through the course of their work, Marc helps Deborah recognize the key role that stress plays in her emotional eating habits, and the need to find other ways to regulate her nervous system outside of food. Listen now!    Key Insights:      Stress can drive many of us to engage in disordered eating, whether emotional eating, overeating, binge eating, or other related patterns.       “Stress  eating” is a natural phenomenon rooted in both our psychology and biology. Bringing compassion and self-understanding to ourselves is the first step in changing this unwanted pattern.      There  are  biological reasons  why we feel good after eating.  Turning to food in times of stress isn’t inherently  “wrong”  or  “bad.”       The first step to transforming emotional eating is through awareness. Because only once you become aware of something, can you change it.      Forgiving oneself for one’s perceived failures and shortcomings is another key  towards choosing life and initiating effective weight loss.    Marc David’s twin areas of expertise in nutrition and psychology has helped numerous people overcome  challenges  with food and emotional eating.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    A Mother Works with Her Long Term Eating Disorder    In this episode of The Psychology of Eating podcast, Marc David, Founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating,  talks to  Rachelle, who has been dealing with bulimia  for  nearly 30 years.  Rachelle began binging and purging as an adolescent going through some difficult life changes. Despite her considerable efforts to overcome her disordered eating, she’s still struggling with it all these years later. This is compounded by the fact that she’s hidden her disorder from her 4 children, and has shared only minimal details with her husband. Now, she seeks Marc’s counsel to help her find a path towards greater self-love and a more peaceful relationship with food.    Key Insights: <ul> <li> Challenges with food  often  start in one's adolescence and  can  continue even decades later.  However, the duration of an eating disorder shouldn’t be equated with one’s ability to overcome it. Growth and healing are possible at every age.</li> <li> An eating disorder can manifest as a coping mechanism to deal with a traumatic event or stressful situation.  Working with the trauma event(s) is a key first place to begin on the path to healing.</li> <li> When an eating disorder developed as a childhood coping mechanism to stress or trauma, later in life we can find this part of ourselves is still stuck in childhood. </li> <li> A woman's relationship with her mother – or her daughter – can often determine her relationship with food.  Therefore, doing inner work - whether with a psychotherapist or other skilled practitioner - can be very helpful in understanding the familial dynamics of one’s eating patterns.</li> <li> Stepping out of shame and guilt, and  cultivating  honesty with oneself  (and  ultimately with others)  is  vital  as we walk a more intentional path around food and body.</li> </ul>  With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food. As the  Founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, he reaches millions each year through his books, speaking engagements, celebrated podcast series, and his internationally-acclaimed Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training.    Having your own challenges with food and body?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?    Getting Out of The Trap of Endless Dieting    Did you know that an estimated 45 million Americans go on a diet every year? Many of these same people are actually chronic dieters - meaning they’ve been on a diet for many years. And what’s even more shocking is that so many dieters never achieve lasting success for themselves; they either never get to their desired weight, or they only do so for a short time and then put the weight right back on.    If you’ve been dieting for years without lasting results, it might be time to take a different approach. Watch today’s episode to learn more about how to get out of the trap of endless dieting! <ul> <li> The majority of people I work with over the years report that they achieved their weight loss goal with extreme dieting, often accompanied by intense exercise. In other words, they got where they wanted to go by unsustainable measures. </li> <li> The interesting thing is that so many people have the false belief that,  “When  I look or weigh differently, then I'll be happy.” By the way,  you didn't invent this kind of thinking, if you have it. The world did.</li> <li> Diets don't work because when we consistently eat in a way that is too low in calories for the body, which means too low in nutrition, too low in essential nutrients, and too low in what the body needs as its energy requirements...When we do that, our metabolism adjusts downwards over time.</li> <li> Dieting instructs the body very directly to store fat and to not build muscle. Muscle tissue, by the way, is by far and away the main source of calorie burning in the body. So you want your body creating muscle.</li> <li> Your job is to learn how to nourish yourself with food.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?     In Session With Marc David: A Beautiful New Beginning With Food and Body    Join  Eating  Psychology expert  Marc David in conversation with Lisa in this episode of the  <em>Psychology of Eating</em>  <em>Podcast</em>  as they delve deep into the difference between losing weight and getting healthy. Marc shows us how to develop the right frame of mind to move towards our natural  weight, rather than strive to be unrealistically thin.     Key Insights: <ul> <li> Eating challenges  can start during childhood. However, you can  transform these challenges at any age … whether you’re in your 40s, 50s, 60s, or beyond. </li> <li> Nutrient-rich food choices make you healthier and result in natural weight loss, while intuitive eating  allows you to tune into what your body is truly hungering for.</li> <li> Societal conditioning  helps perpetuate  ‘diet  culture’ and  often causes disordered eating patterns.  Learning to identify these unhelpful messages is key to turning the corner in unwanted eating challenges.</li> <li> Being happy with yourself marks the return to consistent nourishment and good health.</li> </ul>  With his dual training in clinical nutrition and psychology, Marc David has spent the last 40 years helping people around the world heal their relationship with food.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?     Are You an All-or-Nothing Dieter?    When it comes to dieting,  many people take an all-or-nothing approach. Meaning, they’re either perfectly following their diet … or they’re  completely going off the  rails.  So often, we set ourselves up for disappointment by adopting a strict set of food rules that we can’t possibly follow in the long run.    If this sounds familiar, you won’t want to miss  today’s episode where Marc David reveals the truth behind  all-or-nothing dieting  and how  to put a stop  to this unwanted pattern! Watch now!    Highlights:      All-or-nothing dieting has its roots in the part of us that wants to be the archetypal good boy or good girl, and the part of us that actually enjoys being a bad boy or a bad girl.     What makes all-or-nothing dieting patterns so hard to get out of is that not only is the bad boy/bad girl part taking over, but it's also the voice of the rebel in us, the part of us that doesn't want to be told what to do.      Chances are, if we are all-or-nothing with food and diet, we're likely using the all-or-nothing strategy in other parts of life.      Perfectionism is often found at the root of our eating challenges,  our  body hate, our incessant self-attack and our constant silent self-criticism. The voice ultimately harms us. It's truly a soul assassin.       Many  all-or-nothing dieters,  are  people who deeply believe that they must eat very low-fat or very low-calorie, or very low-pleasure foods, or a hundred percent raw food diet, or no sweet foods whatsoever…  These approaches are bound to fail.    In this episode, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, Marc David, M.A., uses scientific research and proven methods for approaching all-or-nothing dieting in a way that promotes healing and transformation. Don’t miss out on learning some of the ground-breaking techniques that are helping people worldwide to find a path to greater health, joy, and freedom with food.    Have  questions?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?     In Session With Marc David: A 17 Year Old Works With Binge Eating    Join  Eating Psychology expert  Marc  David  as he  connects  with 17-year-old Ella who has been stuck in a binge and restricted cycle for two years.  Watch as Ella connects some important dots and discovers what’s truly at the heart of her disordered eating. You won't want to miss this wonderful episode of The Psychology of Eating podcast!     Key Insights   <ul> <li> Those who eat - meaning, all of us -  can benefit from learning to eat slowly and consciously.  By doing so, we not only  help to break  unconscious eating habits, but we find a simple and easy way to bring ourselves more fully into the present moment.</li> <li> Eating can be a beautiful, nourishing, and wonderful  experience. Retrain the brain to love food and to enjoy the experience of eating and the feeling of satiety that comes from it.</li> <li> It is important to recognize that food is not the enemy. Try to make friends with  food: love it, appreciate it, and bring as much fun and joy as you can to it. </li> <li> Experimental studies  have revealed that stress can cause weight gain.  Reducing  stress can be an effective means to repairing  one's relationship with food.</li> <li> Rather  than cutting out some foods entirely,  moderation truly  is the key to  a balanced approach to eating. </li> </ul>    If you or a loved one has a  challenging  relationship with food  and body,  eating psychology expert  Marc David is uniquely qualified to help. His series of  <em>Psychology of Eating</em>  podcasts are designed to help people overcome  unwanted eating concerns and understand these challenges in an entirely new and inspiring way.     If you have questions or comments about your own journey with food and body, please post them  in the comment box below or get in touch with  us  directly  at:    info@psychologyofeating.com  <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.com/</a>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <a class="dynamiclink" href="https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://psychologyofeating.online/ss/</a>  Are you ready to transform your relationship with food in a lasting and meaningful way? What if you could help others find the path to greater freedom and joy with food as well?     Will Fasting Help Me Lose Weight?    Yes! But probably not for the reason you may think.  In today’s episode,  we take a closer look at fasting, why it is good for your body, and why it may not be the best method for long-term weight loss.    Highlights:      What I've observed over the years is that there is a subset of people who, when they reduce their caloric intake via dieting or fasting,  do  indeed lose weight. But guess what? The human body cannot sustain itself for very long on a deficiency in calories and nutrition.      What many people experience is that they can indeed fast, indeed lose weight, but they tend to gain it right back.      Fasting can provide the kind of detoxification that allows our metabolism to shift to a more normal and healthy state. Research has shown that liver detoxification can lead to weight loss.      When fasting, we're generally eliminating the most common food allergens that smart clinicians will notice can cause weight loss resistance.       Fasting can create a potent and powerful state of being that is not just about shedding pounds. It's about cleaning out the mind. It's about detoxifying ourselves of harmful thoughts and outdated beliefs about who we are.     Fasting is a practice that dates back to biblical times, but what are the practical applications for modern living?
