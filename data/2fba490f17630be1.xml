		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Tired of starting your diet over every Monday and ending up at the drive-thru by Wednesday? Have you ever thought, "I know what to do I just don't know WHY I don't do it?"

If that's you then you need Corinne who lost 100lbs. She gets what it is like to be overweight and feel defeated. She did a complete mental and physical transformation and teaches you how to do the EXACT same thing.

In this podcast, we don’t focus on doing things that lead to yo-yo dieting, like counting calories, weight watchers, time-consuming workouts or extremely low-carb diets. Instead, you’ll learn practical tools that have helped 1000s of women lose weight from someone just like you telling you like it is each week. No sugar coating here!

For show notes, her free video weight loss course, blogs and more, visit Losing100Podcast.com. Corinne is changing the weight loss industry, cutting the crap diet advice and telling you exactly how to lose weight and keep it off.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Making a decision can bring up a lot of crap. It can feel overwhelming because you have a load of options and bring on a ton of fear you'll choose the wrong thing.

			<description><![CDATA[<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">I was broke-ass poor growing up. Momma worked minimum wage jobs, trying her best to keep my baby brother and I fed. Those days were when I learned a lot of my eating habits. Things like:</p> <p>"Eat all you can because who knows when the next meal is coming..."</p> <p>"Fast food is not only cheap, but it's a good way to get a lot of food after a long, hard day."</p> <p>But those days also taught me something else. A lot of people can't afford to lose weight. They don't have the money for programs, kits, and trainers.</p> <p>My mother tried many diets and often quit because she didn't have the money.</p> <p>I wish she had someone like me pumping out help. Knowing my mom, and how scrappy she was, she'd be all over my podcast and free course like stink on shit.</p> <p>Today's podcast is all about making the most out of all the free resources I offer. Maybe you'll join No BS one day because you love what I teach so much. But, you might be someone who can never join and need all the help you can get.</p> <p>Either way, today I'm going to lay out exactly how I would use the Losing 100lbs Podcast and the Free Course to lose all the weight you want.</p> <p>First, take the Free Course. I know you've done that already because you got this email. Just in case you want to share it with a friend, the link to the course is: <a href= "http://www.NoBSFreeCourse.com">www.NoBSFreeCourse.com.</a></p> <p>Second, make the podcast your weightloss university. In the podcast, we'll tell you what to do and give you some episodes to listen to that help with food planning, getting support from your family, mistakes most of us make (and how to avoid them) and how to quit overeating.</p> <p>Third, follow me on social. I post a lot of motivational stuff you don't want to miss.</p> <p>You can follow me at:</p> <p><u><a class="ProsemirrorEditor-link" href= "https://www.instagram.com/corinne_crabtree/">https://www.instagram.com/corinne_crabtree</a></u></p> <p><u><a class="ProsemirrorEditor-link" href= "https://www.facebook.com/losing100podcast">https://www.facebook.com/losing100podcast</a></u></p> <p>Last, always read my emails. I send two a week, and each one will link you to new resources or give you a little kick in the ass. You'll want to move them to your SAFE SENDER (because email service providers can be asshats sending my good shit to the spam).</p> <p>Listen to Episode 261: How to Use the Podcast for Weightloss.</p> <p>You'll thank yourself for taking the time to listen.<br /> <br /></p> <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Get the Free Course here:<br /> <u><a class="ProsemirrorEditor-link" href= "http://NoBSFreeCourse.com">http://NoBSFreeCourse.com</a></u></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Get the Free Course here:<br /> <a href= "https://phit.click/freecourse">https://phit.click/freecourse</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Think about this. To lose weight you MUST be willing to eat just enough. You have to learn how to eat until satisfied. No one who "stuffs themselves" or is a card carrying member of the Clean Plate Club is going to lose weight easy.</p> <p>To lose weight you have to be able to leave food behind.</p> <p>Restaurants will over serve you, your mom will insist you have more, if you order pizza you get a better deal when you buy two, and sometimes even what you prepare yourself is just too much for that meal.</p> <p>Your inability to "waste" food will make losing weight harder. You just can't overeat and expect losses.</p> <p>When I work with clients I ask them how often they are overeating. A lot of them think overeating is limited to a binge-fest on a bad day.</p> <p>Nope! In fact, for most of us, that's the LEAST damaging. Give-up moments are easy to spot.</p> <p>What's elusive and often WAY harder to stop is the justified overeating.</p> <p>"I"m full, but I portioned this so I should finish it."</p> <p>"It's just a couple of bites left in the pan."</p> <p>"OOOHHH a bite of Mac and Cheese left on juniors plate."</p> <p>"I hate to waste the food...I paid for it."</p> <p>"It's free! I'm broke so I need to take advantage."</p> <p>All of this is waste. Waste going straight to your waist.</p> <p>When you overeat you aren't saving money or getting your money's worth.</p> <p>Overeating wastes your mental energy day dreaming about losing weight, it wastes your time on this earth toting around too many pounds, and it wastes your ability to know how much food you need.</p> <p>One interesting concept I was teaching a Tribe member the other day was that you will NEVER know how much food to buy at the store if you keep polishing off food that you aren't hungry for. Think of the money you waste over-buying each week!</p> <p>If you have head drama over leaving food behind OK. That's fine. Have some head drama but toss the food. Toss the food knowing you are teaching yourself how to quit wasting time wanting to lose weight. You will eventually teach yourself how much food you need and probably start buying less.</p> <p>In this podcast we talk about how to put into practice leaving food behind deliberately.</p> <p>Trust me. I still work on leaving food behind. When I do I think someone should march in with confetti and celebrate. Even after 13 years of keeping my weight off I feel like not cleaning my plate is an amazing feat. I don't know if wasting food will ever feel natural but I'm OK with that. I kind of like this body and willing to just keep working at it.</p> <p>Plus, maybe that confetti will erupt. I sure hope I get a selfie.</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

Give-up moments are easy to spot.</p> <p>What's elusive and often WAY harder to stop is the justified overeating.</p> <p>"I"m full, but I portioned this so I should finish it."</p> <p>"It's just a couple of bites left in the pan."</p> <p>"OOOHHH a bite of Mac and Cheese left on juniors plate."</p> <p>"I hate to waste the food...I paid for it."</p> <p>"It's free! I'm broke so I need to take advantage."</p> <p>All of this is waste. Waste going straight to your waist.</p> <p>When you overeat you aren't saving money or getting your money's worth.</p> <p>Overeating wastes your mental energy day dreaming about losing weight, it wastes your time on this earth toting around too many pounds, and it wastes your ability to know how much food you need.</p> <p>One interesting concept I was teaching a Tribe member the other day was that you will NEVER know how much food to buy at the store if you keep polishing off food that you aren't hungry for. Think of the money you waste over-buying each week!</p> <p>If you have head drama over leaving food behind OK. That's fine. Have some head drama but toss the food. Toss the food knowing you are teaching yourself how to quit wasting time wanting to lose weight. You will eventually teach yourself how much food you need and probably start buying less.</p> <p>In this podcast we talk about how to put into practice leaving food behind deliberately.</p> <p>Trust me. I still work on leaving food behind. When I do I think someone should march in with confetti and celebrate. Even after 13 years of keeping my weight off I feel like not cleaning my plate is an amazing feat. I don't know if wasting food will ever feel natural but I'm OK with that. I kind of like this body and willing to just keep working at it.</p> <p>Plus, maybe that confetti will erupt. I sure hope I get a selfie.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

The problem with this is that we EAT to avoid the pain in our life.</p> <p>Why is THAT a problem?</p> <p>Because food doesn't comfort you. There's no benefit to eating through pain.

But, I also don't define it like most people.</p> <p>Self-care, for me, is taking time each day to clean out my brain. I need to know what's going on in there that needs re-directing. Just because I wake up in a sour mood doesn't mean the day is shot. It means I need to ask myself to generate the feelings I want for the day.</p> <p> </p> <p>To me planning and assessing is self-care. The ultimate form of self-care is my mental health. Knowing I am prepared for my day, thought ahead, decided how I was going to show up for the world is the best gift I give myself.</p> <p>Sure I get my hair done, go out to dinner every now and then, but the real form of self-care I love is taking a few minutes to just figure out how I am CHOOSING to show up each day in thought and action. What will I eat? When will I shower? What times are my meetings? What podcasts and books will I listen to on my drive? What do I want to feel at the end of the day?</p> <p>That's self-care.</p> <p>When you start to feel bad that you are last on your list...don't. Waste of time.</p> <p>Take a look at what you might be doing now that IS for you. Game your brain. Stop telling yourself that just makes you feel terrible. Heck, I count doing dishes and getting coffee ready as self-care. One, I love me a clean dish to eat off of. Two, I really like that coffee waiting on me like a sweet friend each morning.</p> <p>I challenge you to ask one question of yourself? How can I care for me today? Get creative momma!</p> <p>Don't play victim to life. How you respond to your life is your responsibility.</p> <p>In our podcast today you will hear a lot about how we care for ourselves. I share a story about Logan and start bawling. Warning! And poor Kathy didn't know it was coming. I swear she looked at me and was like, "Holy crap! I think I have to take over the podcast."

When you have this information you are READY to move to the next step.</p> <p>Decide when you will have eat and drink things you know SLOW down weightloss.

Sorry.</p> <p>But, you don't have to "give up" everything you love. If you want to keep booze you can. You just have to plan it and when you weigh in each week you get to decide if the results are what you want. If not, you choose to plan less. If they are, you choose to keep on track.</p> <p>Nowhere in here you are deprived. It's just you planning, committing, assessing and choosing. That's it.</p> <p>I go deeper into how I've gone from drinking three nights a week to once a week (without tons of deprivation and crying)...and seen an extra 5lbs of booze bloat naturally go away the last couple of months.</p> <p>I, too, was in the trap of drinking when I wanted and wondering why I was up 8lbs! LOL. Yes. Me!</p> <p>The podcast is pretty honest about how even 13 years into maintenance I can get sloppy. But, I also teach you how I decided to get my act together in an honest way that taught me good habits. And when I teach me I teach YOU, too.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Get the Free Course here:<br /> <a href= "https://phit.click/freecourse">https://phit.click/freecourse</a></p> <p>  </p> <p>Do you ever dread weighing yourself?</p> <p>I had a PNPTribe member call weighing in an "emotional rollercoaster."</p> <p>When you weigh in you do you know what you are ACTUALLY weighing? Probably not. If you did then you would have zero problems getting on that scale no matter how you showed up with food this week.</p> <p>Your issue might be you are weighing your self-judgement. That's a waste of time. Ever thought these things?</p> <p>"I'll never lose weight."</p> <p>"OOOHHH I was so good this week!!!!"</p> <p>"I lost 2lbs. but I have like 78lbs. to go."</p> <p>"I lost 2lbs. so tonight I can have that extra margarita and chips."</p> <p>That's weighing your self-judgement. You are weighing how you think about that number instead of the your body weight. Those thoughts are not helpful.</p> <p>Here's what you must know...</p> <p>When you weigh the only thing the scale reflects is your fat, muscle, water, and organs.<br /> Each of those are responding to hormones, your actions, and the barometric pressure.</p> <p>Yes, weather and the temperature of the room you weigh in can move the number up or down a pound or two.</p> <p>That's why shaming yourself is USELESS! What if you decide you are a failure and chug a doughnut after a good week because the bathroom was two degrees cooler than last week?</p> <p>Did you just go "Oh no!" Girl, I've been there, too.</p> <p>The most important thing to do prior to weighing (besides getting naked after you poop) is to think, "No matter what I weigh I will take an honest look at how I ate this past week."<br /> This is the REAL DEAL. Your weigh-in must be a trigger you to honestly assess what went RIGHT and what you can improve this week. That's how you will lose weight FAST. Not with crazy shakes. With knowledge.</p> <p>Your weight should NOT ever be a trigger to cry, shame, or eat. That's USELESS.</p> <p>I want you to become a master at feedback. Why?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Get the Free Course here: <a href= "https://phit.click/freecourse">https://phit.click/freecourse</a></p> <p>  </p> <p>Do you ever dread weighing yourself?</p> <p>I had a PNPTribe member call weighing in an "emotional rollercoaster."</p> <p>When you weigh in you do you know what you are ACTUALLY weighing? Probably not. If you did then you would have zero problems getting on that scale no matter how you showed up with food this week.</p> <p>Your issue might be you are weighing your self-judgement. That's a waste of time. Ever thought these things?</p> <p>"I'll never lose weight."</p> <p>"OOOHHH I was so good this week!!!!"</p> <p>"I lost 2lbs. but I have like 78lbs. to go."</p> <p>"I lost 2lbs. so tonight I can have that extra margarita and chips."</p> <p>That's weighing your self-judgement. You are weighing how you think about that number instead of the your body weight. Those thoughts are not helpful.</p> <p>Here's what you must know...</p> <p>When you weigh the only thing the scale reflects is your fat, muscle, water, and organs. Each of those are responding to hormones, your actions, and the barometric pressure.</p> <p>Yes, weather and the temperature of the room you weigh in can move the number up or down a pound or two.</p> <p>That's why shaming yourself is USELESS! What if you decide you are a failure and chug a doughnut after a good week because the bathroom was two degrees cooler than last week?</p> <p>Did you just go "Oh no!" Girl, I've been there, too.</p> <p>The most important thing to do prior to weighing (besides getting naked after you poop) is to think, "No matter what I weigh I will take an honest look at how I ate this past week." This is the REAL DEAL. Your weigh-in must be a trigger you to honestly assess what went RIGHT and what you can improve this week. That's how you will lose weight FAST. Not with crazy shakes. With knowledge.</p> <p>Your weight should NOT ever be a trigger to cry, shame, or eat. That's USELESS.</p> <p>I want you to become a master at feedback. Why? The more you move into the mindset of appreciating feedback from your scale and food journals the more weight you will lose.</p> <p>Losing weight requires you to get out of your head and into your details.</p> <p>Our podcast dives deeper into this. We go over things we have our clients do each week to lose their weight FOR GOOD.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>
