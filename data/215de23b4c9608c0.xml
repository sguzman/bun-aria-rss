How to Do This Practice:


Take a few deep breaths. File up your belly on each inhale. Drop your shoulder and soften your body on each exhale.
Say these eight phrases to yourself, or your own variation of them. Consider which resonates with you the most:


a. “In the presence of fear, I will make space for courage.”

b. “In the presence of self-doubt, I will make space for self-belief.”

c. “In the presence of hurriedness, I will make space for slowing down.”

f. “In the presence of chaos, I will make space for inner peace.”

g. “In the presence of confusion, I will make space for clarity.”

h. “In the presence of pain, I will make space for self-compassion.”


Bring your attention to the line from this meditation that resonates with you the most. Think about all the ways you wish to make space so you can bloom into the best version of yourself.
Write it down, perhaps on a sticky note, and keep it somewhere you can see it.

      <title>How Humor Helps us Cope</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>Hardships in life are a given, but what if we found a way to laugh about it? Our guest shares how he's used humor to cope with the deepest pains in his life.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>When we go through hardships and struggles, finding the humor in them can help us relieve stress and change our perspective. This week on The Science of Happiness, our guest shares how he’s used humor to triumph over hardship in his life. Kerry Rudd is a former member of the Bay Area Freedom Collective, a re-entry home where formerly incarcerated people can find community and connections. He started performing comedy based on his personal experiences during the 12 years he spent in and out of the prison. Kerry shares with us how processing his experiences by writing jokes about them changes his perspective on his traumatic past and helps him cope. Later, we hear from psychologist Andrea Samson about how humor can help us  face down  some difficult situations.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How to Do This Practice:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Every day for one week, spend 10 minutes thinking about the things you found really funny that day.</p></li>
<li><p>Write them down in as much detail as possible and describe how each of those things made you feel. It’s important to write it out, as opposed to only doing it in your head.</p></li>
<li><p>Write down the reason why these things were funny. You can also answer the question, “Why did this funny event happen?”</p></li>
</ol>

        <![CDATA[Hardships in life are a given, but what if we found a way to laugh about it? Our guest shares how he's used humor to cope with the deepest pains in his life.



Episode summary:

When we go through hardships and struggles, finding the humor in them can help us relieve stress and change our perspective. This week on The Science of Happiness, our guest shares how he’s used humor to triumph over hardship in his life. Kerry Rudd is a former member of the Bay Area Freedom Collective, a re-entry home where formerly incarcerated people can find community and connections. He started performing comedy based on his personal experiences during the 12 years he spent in and out of the prison. Kerry shares with us how processing his experiences by writing jokes about them changes his perspective on his traumatic past and helps him cope. Later, we hear from psychologist Andrea Samson about how humor can help us  face down  some difficult situations.



How to Do This Practice:


Every day for one week, spend 10 minutes thinking about the things you found really funny that day.
Write them down in as much detail as possible and describe how each of those things made you feel. It’s important to write it out, as opposed to only doing it in your head.
Write down the reason why these things were funny. You can also answer the question, “Why did this funny event happen?”

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>When was the last time you spent a moment savoring silence? Tricia Hersey, aka The Nap Bishop, guides us through an appreciation of silence and its restorative powers.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Scientists have found that spending just two minutes in silence can lower your blood pressure and heart rate, even when compared to listening to slow, relaxing music.</p>

<p><strong>How to Do This Practice:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find a quiet place to rest. Set a two-minute timer and put it aside.</p></li>
<li><p>Close your eyes and soften your face. Allow yourself to listen to the silence and rest your body.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of the two minutes, slowly open your eyes and notice how you feel in your body. Or, continue resting in silence for as long as you need.</p></li>
</ol>

        <![CDATA[<p>Jeopardy! champion Amy Schneider tries a body scan meditation to sharpen her focus and calm her nerves as she prepares for the Tournament of Champions.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>Amy Schneider is the most successful woman to ever compete on Jeopardy!. Part of her winning strategy was to shut down all her mental chatter and completely focus on the competition. But when the cameras are off, she struggles to find the same calm. For today’s show, Amy tries a body scan practice to connect with her body and quiet her busy mind. Later we hear from Jonathan Greenberg, a Harvard psychology professor. He explains how mindfulness can make us better problem solvers, and how that can benefit our emotional health, too.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How to Do This Practice:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find a quiet place where you feel safe and comfortable. You can be standing, sitting, or lying down.</p></li>
<li><p>Close your eyes, and take a few deep, long breaths.</p></li>
<li><p>Move your attention through your body slowly, part by part, starting with your feet. Focus on your feet, then your calves, knees, and so on, until you get to the top of your head. Without judgment, notice what sensations you can identify in each part of the body.</p></li>
<li><p>When your mind wanders, gently and with self-kindness, guide your attention back to the part of the body you’re focusing on in the present moment.</p></li>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>These days, it's hard to imagine befriending people with different politics than your own. But these two men did it using a tried and true practice.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>When a graphic work of art depicting two men having sex was hung up in a busy hallway on a community college campus, it stirred up a huge controversy. Some students wanted it taken down, while others opposed the idea of censoring art. Instead of retreating to their respective echo chambers, two students who disagreed had a public debate. It was so successful, they actually went on to create a discourse club on campus. We learn the tactics that helped them navigate a divisive topic with their civility and differing values intact. Later, we hear from psychologist Cynthia Wang on how taking someone else’s perspective can bring people of different backgrounds together and disrupt stereotyping.</p>

<p><strong>Practice:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Think of someone whom you might be at odds with — perhaps they have different political beliefs, or they’re not part of your ethnic or religious group, or they have arguments with you.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a moment to imagine yourself as this person, seeing the world through their eyes. Recall a moment you shared with this person and think how you, as this person, experience that shared situation. What does the world look like from their point of view?</p></li>
<li><p>Try to imagine how it feels to be them as vividly as possible. Ask yourself questions such as, what emotions are they experiencing? How might that feel in their body? How might their feelings in the situation differ from yours?</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re in a debate with this person, try taking their side and formulate an argument on their behalf. You might understand more nuances about their views.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have the time, you can even try to imagine a day in your life as this person.</p></li>

        <![CDATA[These days, it's hard to imagine befriending people with different politics than your own. But these two men did it using a tried and true practice.



Episode summary:

When a graphic work of art depicting two men having sex was hung up in a busy hallway on a community college campus, it stirred up a huge controversy. Some students wanted it taken down, while others opposed the idea of censoring art. Instead of retreating to their respective echo chambers, two students who disagreed had a public debate. It was so successful, they actually went on to create a discourse club on campus. We learn the tactics that helped them navigate a divisive topic with their civility and differing values intact. Later, we hear from psychologist Cynthia Wang on how taking someone else’s perspective can bring people of different backgrounds together and disrupt stereotyping.

Practice:


Think of someone whom you might be at odds with — perhaps they have different political beliefs, or they’re not part of your ethnic or religious group, or they have arguments with you.
Take a moment to imagine yourself as this person, seeing the world through their eyes. Recall a moment you shared with this person and think how you, as this person, experience that shared situation. What does the world look like from their point of view?
Try to imagine how it feels to be them as vividly as possible. Ask yourself questions such as, what emotions are they experiencing? How might that feel in their body? How might their feelings in the situation differ from yours?
If you’re in a debate with this person, try taking their side and formulate an argument on their behalf. You might understand more nuances about their views.
If you have the time, you can even try to imagine a day in your life as this person.

      <title>Nine Steps to Forgiveness</title>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 10:00:00 -0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://beta.prx.org/stories/384289</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>How do you forgive someone while still holding them accountable? What if that person is yourself? This week, our guest tries a practice in forgiving herself and someone else.</p>

<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>Anoosha Syed appreciates her name now, but as a kid, she struggled with feeling different from everyone else. She had friends call her “Annie” and even dyed her hair blonde in an effort to look less Pakistani. Anoosha joins us after trying a practice in forgiveness. Anoosha explores the complexities of forgiving someone who’s in a position of power and privilege and should know better, like the teacher who always mispronounced her name. Then, Anoosha took the practice a step further and directed it inward. She shares what it was like to forgive her younger self for not being as proud of her culture as she is today.  Later, we hear from psychologist Dr. Lydia Woodyatt about the power of self-compassion and affirming our important values to release us from destructive self-blame while still holding ourselves accountable when we need to.</p>

<p><strong>Practice:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make sure you know how you feel about what is going on and be able to articulate it. Then, tell someone you can trust about your experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell yourself <em>you</em> will feel better because of this forgiveness. Forgiveness is for you, not for others.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember, forgiveness does not necessarily mean reconciling with the person who upsets you or condoning the behavior.</p></li>

        <![CDATA[How do you forgive someone while still holding them accountable? What if that person is yourself? This week, our guest tries a practice in forgiving herself and someone else.

Episode summary:

Anoosha Syed appreciates her name now, but as a kid, she struggled with feeling different from everyone else. She had friends call her “Annie” and even dyed her hair blonde in an effort to look less Pakistani. Anoosha joins us after trying a practice in forgiveness. Anoosha explores the complexities of forgiving someone who’s in a position of power and privilege and should know better, like the teacher who always mispronounced her name. Then, Anoosha took the practice a step further and directed it inward. She shares what it was like to forgive her younger self for not being as proud of her culture as she is today.  Later, we hear from psychologist Dr. Lydia Woodyatt about the power of self-compassion and affirming our important values to release us from destructive self-blame while still holding ourselves accountable when we need to.

Practice:


Make sure you know how you feel about what is going on and be able to articulate it. Then, tell someone you can trust about your experience.
Tell yourself you will feel better because of this forgiveness. Forgiveness is for you, not for others.
Remember, forgiveness does not necessarily mean reconciling with the person who upsets you or condoning the behavior.
Recognize that your primary pain comes from hurt feelings, thoughts, and physical discomfort you are experiencing now, not from the thing that offended or hurt in the past.
Practice stress management to soothe yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed. Try things like mindful breathing or going for a walk.
Remind yourself that you cannot expect others to act in the way you think they should, but it’s ok to hope that they do.
Find another way to achieve the positive outcome you had hoped for in the first place.
Instead of focusing on your hurt feelings, look for the bright side of things. Focus on what’s going well for you.
Change the way you look at your past so you remind yourself of your heroic choice to forgive..

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Letting go of our regrets can motivate us to improve and help us grow. Alex Elle, a certified breathwork and writing coach, guides us through a meditation to forgive and accept ourselves.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How to Do This Practice:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Take a deep breath. As you exhale, remember all you have done in the past that led you to come to be where you are today.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remember that you are allowed to forgive yourself and let it go. Give yourself permission to release any shame that you’re carrying. Forgive yourself.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Think of the good things about yourself. Trust your worth and acknowledge that you are evolving. Remember, you are worthy of good things even when you think you are now.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>When you're ready, you can bring your attention back to the present moment. Take a few deep breaths in through the nose, and out through the nose. Drop your shoulder and unclench your jaw.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you'd like to take this practice a step further, you can write your own letter of self forgiveness, it can start with “Dear self, I forgive you for …”</strong></p></li>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>When's the last time you made a good memory — intentionally? Our guest tries a practice in cultivating positive experiences and taking time to savor them.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>Life doesn't always hand us good times, but we can benefit as much or more when we create our own happy memories and take time to appreciate them. This week on The Science of Happiness, our guest tries a practice to intentionally create good experiences and reflect on them. Deandrea Farlow is a member of the Bay Area Freedom Collective, a re-entry home where formerly incarcerated people can find community and connections. Deandrea  brings us into his experience with this practice, and shares what it’s like to find strength through the hardest times as well as  positive events, like the ones he created for our show. Psychologist Meg Speer explains how ruminating on good times can actually change the way we respond to stress. .</p>

<p><strong>Practice:</strong> Creating and Recalling Positive Events</p>

<p>1. Do an activity that you enjoy doing alone.</p>

<p>2. With a friend, do something that you enjoy doing with others.</p>

<p>3. Do something that you consider personally important and meaningful.</p>

<p>4. Then take a step back and really think about these three events. Write about how they make you feel. Talk about it with a friend, or just really think about it.</p>

Episode summary:

Life doesn't always hand us good times, but we can benefit as much or more when we create our own happy memories and take time to appreciate them. This week on The Science of Happiness, our guest tries a practice to intentionally create good experiences and reflect on them. Deandrea Farlow is a member of the Bay Area Freedom Collective, a re-entry home where formerly incarcerated people can find community and connections. Deandrea  brings us into his experience with this practice, and shares what it’s like to find strength through the hardest times as well as  positive events, like the ones he created for our show. Psychologist Meg Speer explains how ruminating on good times can actually change the way we respond to stress. .

Practice: Creating and Recalling Positive Events

1. Do an activity that you enjoy doing alone.

2. With a friend, do something that you enjoy doing with others.

3. Do something that you consider personally important and meaningful.

4. Then take a step back and really think about these three events. Write about how they make you feel. Talk about it with a friend, or just really think about it.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>When was the last time you thought about your ancestors? This guided meditation by indigenous scholar Yuria Celidwen will help you connect to your heritage and reap the potent benefits of remembering your roots.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How to Do This Practice:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Bring your attention to the center of your chest, allow the chest to open, and relax.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notice an open space in your chest when you breathe in. Pause before exhaling, resting your awareness in the space between breaths, then breathe out. Contemplate the pause that connects the constant flow between openings and returning.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>In that pause, contemplate your  lineage. Think about the origin stories of your elders, their own elders, and their own elders, moving back in time.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Think about those elders and the lands that touched their feet. Imagine bringing that land into the center of your chest, into the pause between breaths.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Today’s Happiness Break host:</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Dr. Yuria Celidwen</em></strong> <strong>is an Indigenous scholar of Nahua and Maya descent. She also works at the United Nations to advance the rights of Indigenous peoples and environmental sustainability.</strong></p>

        <![CDATA[When was the last time you thought about your ancestors? This guided meditation by indigenous scholar Yuria Celidwen will help you connect to your heritage and reap the potent benefits of remembering your roots.



How to Do This Practice:


Bring your attention to the center of your chest, allow the chest to open, and relax.
Notice an open space in your chest when you breathe in. Pause before exhaling, resting your awareness in the space between breaths, then breathe out. Contemplate the pause that connects the constant flow between openings and returning.
In that pause, contemplate your  lineage. Think about the origin stories of your elders, their own elders, and their own elders, moving back in time.
Think about those elders and the lands that touched their feet. Imagine bringing that land into the center of your chest, into the pause between breaths.


Today’s Happiness Break host:

Dr. Yuria Celidwen is an Indigenous scholar of Nahua and Maya descent. She also works at the United Nations to advance the rights of Indigenous peoples and environmental sustainability.

<hr>

<p><strong>Episode summary:</strong></p>

<p>Comedian Aparna Nancherla has always struggled with anxiety. Starting a new task at work, writing her book, talking to a baby — you name it, she worries about it. And while she’s built a career in stand-up comedy making light of her struggles, she still suffers. Aparna joins us to share what it’s like to try a new technique to cope with her anxiety. She tries to see her anxiety through a new lens, and actually lean into it. We also hear from psychologist and anxiety expert Dr. Tracy Dennis-Tiwary about this radical new approach to understanding anxiety and coping with it by understanding it not just as a crucial part of being human, but as a strength unto itself. </p>

<p><strong>Practice:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Ask yourself: what am I feeling anxious about? What do I want to happen? Take a few minutes to write out your answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, ask yourself: Is there something I can do right now to get closer to the outcome I described in question 1? If the answer is yes, go to part A. If the answer is no, go to part B.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A. Remind yourself: My body is preparing me to do what I need to do. I will be better at what I need to do because of these feelings. Then, do whatever it is you identified in question 2. If you still feel anxious and there’s nothing more you can do right now, go to part B.</p>

<p>B. Sometimes there are circumstances in our life that make us feel nervous or scared, and there’s nothing we can do in the moment to change our situation. When that’s the case for you, try a mindfulness practice to ground yourself in the present moment. Here are a few you can try:</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>What if you could fall in love, or forge deep connections in just 45 minutes? Our guests try out 36 questions with their partners to see if they can strengthen their connection.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>There are 36 questions that have been shown over and over again in lab studies to help people fall in love or form fast connections. In this week’s episode, we bring back Kristen Meinzer and Jolenta Greenberg of <em>By the Book</em> podcast*.* They recruit their husbands to ask and answer these questions and then fill us in on the surprising ways they helped each of their relationships. Later, we hear from psychologists Arthur and Elaine Aron, the married duo who co-created the 36 questions this practice is based on. They explain the principles behind the questions, so you can come up with your own conversation starters to foster closeness with anyone — family, friends, or your partner.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Practice:</strong></p>

<p>36 Questions for Increasing Closeness</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Identify someone with whom you’d like to become closer. Find a time when you both have about 45 minutes to meet in person.</p></li>
<li><p>Take 15 minutes answering the questions in Set I below. Each person should answer every question, but alternate who answers first. If you don’t finish the set in 15 minutes, move on to Set II.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the steps above for sets II and III.</p></li>
</ol>

There are 36 questions that have been shown over and over again in lab studies to help people fall in love or form fast connections. In this week’s episode, we bring back Kristen Meinzer and Jolenta Greenberg of By the Book podcast*.* They recruit their husbands to ask and answer these questions and then fill us in on the surprising ways they helped each of their relationships. Later, we hear from psychologists Arthur and Elaine Aron, the married duo who co-created the 36 questions this practice is based on. They explain the principles behind the questions, so you can come up with your own conversation starters to foster closeness with anyone — family, friends, or your partner.



Practice:

36 Questions for Increasing Closeness


Identify someone with whom you’d like to become closer. Find a time when you both have about 45 minutes to meet in person.
Take 15 minutes answering the questions in Set I below. Each person should answer every question, but alternate who answers first. If you don’t finish the set in 15 minutes, move on to Set II.
Repeat the steps above for sets II and III.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Connect to yourself and the land you stand on in under 10 minutes with this grounding practice led by Indigenous scholar Dr. Yuria Celidwen.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How to Do This Practice:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>If possible, go outside and find some natural ground, like grass or dirt. If you're wearing shoes or socks, take them off and place the soles of your feet directly on the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>Bring your attention to the earth beneath you. Allow it to hold you, paying attention to how it feels — soft, firm, reliable. Imagine you're starting to grow roots from the tip of your toes, digging deep into the earth.</p></li>
<li><p>Visualize energy and wellness flowing through your roots to your toes, into the soles of your feet, your thighs and knees, then base of the spine and upwards into your chest, expanding the whole center of your chest. Take a full, deep breath and contemplate the  openness you feel in your chest.</p></li>
<li><p>Look up towards the sky and open your eyes, allowing all of your senses to awaken to the sounds, smells, colors, and life around you. Feel their presence.</p></li>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>When we feel more connected, we're kinder and care more for others. After 21 years of being incarcerated, our guest Simon Liu, of Bay Area Freedom House Collective, tries a practice that helps him remember the profound connections he's made both inside and out of prison // throughout his life.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>When’s the last time you felt a deep connection with someone, and then really reflected on your connections? This week on The Science of Happiness, our guest tries a writing practice to feel more connected to those close to him. Simon Liu is the co-founder of the Bay Area Freedom Collective, a home where other formerly incarcerated people can find community and connections. Simon talks about the importance of the social connections he made while in prison, and outside. Psychologist David Cwir explains how finding and building connections not only supports our emotional well-being, but can also change our bodies.</p>

<p><strong>Practice: <br>
Feeling Connected</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Think of a time when you felt a strong bond with someone in your life. Choose a specific experience where you felt especially close and connected to them. Spend a few minutes writing about what happened during the experience. In particular, consider how the experience made you feel close and connected to the other person.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Today’s guests:</strong><br>
<em>Simon Liu</em> co-founded the Bay Area Freedom Collective, a home by and for formerly incarcerated people, which provides resources and support for their re-entry. Simon is also a software engineer.</p>

        <![CDATA[When we feel more connected, we're kinder and care more for others. After 21 years of being incarcerated, our guest Simon Liu, of Bay Area Freedom House Collective, tries a practice that helps him remember the profound connections he's made both inside and out of prison // throughout his life.



Episode summary:

When’s the last time you felt a deep connection with someone, and then really reflected on your connections? This week on The Science of Happiness, our guest tries a writing practice to feel more connected to those close to him. Simon Liu is the co-founder of the Bay Area Freedom Collective, a home where other formerly incarcerated people can find community and connections. Simon talks about the importance of the social connections he made while in prison, and outside. Psychologist David Cwir explains how finding and building connections not only supports our emotional well-being, but can also change our bodies.

Practice: 
Feeling Connected


Think of a time when you felt a strong bond with someone in your life. Choose a specific experience where you felt especially close and connected to them. Spend a few minutes writing about what happened during the experience. In particular, consider how the experience made you feel close and connected to the other person.


Today’s guests:
Simon Liu co-founded the Bay Area Freedom Collective, a home by and for formerly incarcerated people, which provides resources and support for their re-entry. Simon is also a software engineer.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Can practicing mindfulness make us wiser? Judge Jeremy Fogel explores how being present in the moment helps him keep a clear mind and stay connected to his true values.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>What do you think it takes to become wiser, more compassionate, and more open-minded? This week on The Science of Happiness, we bring you one of our most popular episodes. Former district judge Jeremy Fogel shares his insights on how being present can help us make more mindful decisions. He recounts how, after experiencing stress as a judge, his wife suggested he try an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course. After taking the course, Jeremy felt more connected to himself and his surroundings, and decided to make mindfulness a part of his everyday life. The changes Jeremy made had profound impacts on his work as a judge. We also hear from Dr. Shauna Shapiro, a clinical psychologist and professor at Santa Clara University, about how mindfulness affects our moral reasoning.</p>

<p><strong>Practice:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mindful Breathing</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find a comfortable, seated position and invite your body to relax.</p></li>
<li><p>Tune in to the sensations it experiences — the touch, the connection with the floor or the chair. Do your best to relax any areas of tightness or tension.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to the natural rhythm of your breath, in and out, without trying to control it. Notice where you feel your breath in your body. It might be in your abdomen, chest, throat, or nostrils. See if you can feel the sensations of breath, one breath at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>As you do this, you may start thinking about other things. Try to notice that your mind has wandered, and say “thinking” or “wandering” in your head softly. Then gently redirect your attention right back to the breathing. Stay here for 5-7 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, notice your whole body seated here once more. Let yourself relax even more deeply, and thank yourself for doing this practice today.</p></li>

Practice:

Mindful Breathing


Find a comfortable, seated position and invite your body to relax.
Tune in to the sensations it experiences — the touch, the connection with the floor or the chair. Do your best to relax any areas of tightness or tension.
Listen to the natural rhythm of your breath, in and out, without trying to control it. Notice where you feel your breath in your body. It might be in your abdomen, chest, throat, or nostrils. See if you can feel the sensations of breath, one breath at a time.
As you do this, you may start thinking about other things. Try to notice that your mind has wandered, and say “thinking” or “wandering” in your head softly. Then gently redirect your attention right back to the breathing. Stay here for 5-7 minutes.
Finally, notice your whole body seated here once more. Let yourself relax even more deeply, and thank yourself for doing this practice today.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Having close bonds with others is one of the most important things to our happiness. Host Dacher Keltner walks you through a practice you can do with someone else to create new bonds or strengthen old ones. Plus, hear some of his answers to these questions alongside his wife, Molly.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How to Do the 36 Questions for Increasing Closeness Practice:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Take a few deep breaths, and notice how you feel.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify someone with whom you’d like to become closer. Find a time where you both have about  45 minutes</p></li>
<li><p>Take 15 minutes answering the questions in Set I below. Each person should answer each question, but alternate who answers first. If you don’t finish the set in 15 minutes, move on to Set II.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the steps above for sets II and III.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here’s a sample of the questions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Set I</strong></p>

<p>1. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?</p>

<p>2. Would you like to be famous? In what way?</p>

<p>3. Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why?</p>

<p>4. What would constitute a “perfect” day for you?</p>

<p>8. Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common.</p>

<p><strong>Set II</strong></p>

<p>14. Is there something that you’ve dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven’t you done it?</p>

<p>15. What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?</p>

<p>16. What do you value most in a friendship?</p>

<p>17. What is your most treasured memory?</p>

<p>18. What is your most terrible memory?</p>

<p>19. If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are now living? Why?</p>

<p>20. What does friendship mean to you?</p>

<p><strong>Set III</strong></p>

<p>25. Make three true “we” statements each. For instance, “We are both in this room feeling…”</p>

<p>26. Complete this sentence: “I wish I had someone with whom I could share…”</p>

<p>28. Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things that you might not say to someone you’ve just met.</p>

<p>29. Share with your partner an embarrassing moment in your life.</p>

<p>30. When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?</p>

<p>32. What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?</p>

        <![CDATA[Having close bonds with others is one of the most important things to our happiness. Host Dacher Keltner walks you through a practice you can do with someone else to create new bonds or strengthen old ones. Plus, hear some of his answers to these questions alongside his wife, Molly.

How to Do the 36 Questions for Increasing Closeness Practice:


Take a few deep breaths, and notice how you feel.
Identify someone with whom you’d like to become closer. Find a time where you both have about  45 minutes
Take 15 minutes answering the questions in Set I below. Each person should answer each question, but alternate who answers first. If you don’t finish the set in 15 minutes, move on to Set II.
Repeat the steps above for sets II and III.


Here’s a sample of the questions:

Set I

1. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?

2. Would you like to be famous? In what way?

3. Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why?

4. What would constitute a “perfect” day for you?

8. Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common.

Set II

14. Is there something that you’ve dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven’t you done it?

15. What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?

16. What do you value most in a friendship?

17. What is your most treasured memory?

18. What is your most terrible memory?

19. If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are now living? Why?

20. What does friendship mean to you?

Set III

25. Make three true “we” statements each. For instance, “We are both in this room feeling…”

26. Complete this sentence: “I wish I had someone with whom I could share…”

28. Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things that you might not say to someone you’ve just met.

29. Share with your partner an embarrassing moment in your life.

30. When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?

32. What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Apologies are key to successful relationships. But are you doing them right?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>We all have moments when we say or do something we later regret. Then the time comes to make an apology. But a halfhearted “I’m sorry” rarely gets the job done. On this episode of The Science of Happiness, public defender Sam Dugan joins us for a second time to try science-backed tips for making an effective apology. First, she takes a moment to cultivate mindfulness through a mindful breathing practice. Next, Sam invites us in as she apologizes to her husband Nate. Sam reflects on how she took out her stress on Nate, what led her to lash out, and the importance of making a true, heartfelt apology — as opposed to the mindless ones many of us make on a near-daily basis. Then we hear from Sana Rizvi, a professor at the University of New Brunswick, about the science of how mindfulness can make us more apologetic.</p>

<p><strong>Practice:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mindful Breathing</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Invite your body to relax into a comfortable position.</p></li>
<li><p>Tune into the rhythm of your breath, and pay attention as you breathe in through your nose, hold your breath, and exhale through your mouth.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat as many times as you’d like.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Making an Effective Apology</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Acknowledge the offense by showing that you recognize who was responsible, who was harmed, and the nature of the offense.</p></li>
<li><p>If helpful, provide an explanation, especially to convey that it was not intentional and that it will not happen again.</p></li>
<li><p>Express remorse.</p></li>
<li><p>Make amends. When considering how to best make amends, be sure to ask the offended person what would mean the most to them.</p></li>

Episode summary:

We all have moments when we say or do something we later regret. Then the time comes to make an apology. But a halfhearted “I’m sorry” rarely gets the job done. On this episode of The Science of Happiness, public defender Sam Dugan joins us for a second time to try science-backed tips for making an effective apology. First, she takes a moment to cultivate mindfulness through a mindful breathing practice. Next, Sam invites us in as she apologizes to her husband Nate. Sam reflects on how she took out her stress on Nate, what led her to lash out, and the importance of making a true, heartfelt apology — as opposed to the mindless ones many of us make on a near-daily basis. Then we hear from Sana Rizvi, a professor at the University of New Brunswick, about the science of how mindfulness can make us more apologetic.

Practice:

Mindful Breathing


Invite your body to relax into a comfortable position.
Tune into the rhythm of your breath, and pay attention as you breathe in through your nose, hold your breath, and exhale through your mouth.
Repeat as many times as you’d like.


Making an Effective Apology


Acknowledge the offense by showing that you recognize who was responsible, who was harmed, and the nature of the offense.
If helpful, provide an explanation, especially to convey that it was not intentional and that it will not happen again.
Express remorse.
Make amends. When considering how to best make amends, be sure to ask the offended person what would mean the most to them.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Apologies are key to successful relationships. But are you doing them right?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>We all have moments when we say or do something we later regret. Then the time comes to make an apology. But a halfhearted “I’m sorry” rarely gets the job done. On this episode of The Science of Happiness, public defender Sam Dugan joins us for a second time to try science-backed tips for making an effective apology. First, she takes a moment to cultivate mindfulness through a mindful breathing practice. Next, Sam invites us in as she apologizes to her husband Nate. Sam reflects on how she took out her stress on Nate, what led her to lash out, and the importance of making a true, heartfelt apology — as opposed to the mindless ones many of us make on a near-daily basis. Then we hear from Sana Rizvi, a professor at the University of New Brunswick, about the science of how mindfulness can make us more apologetic.</p>

<p><strong>Practice:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mindful Breathing</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Invite your body to relax into a comfortable position.</p></li>
<li><p>Tune into the rhythm of your breath, and pay attention as you breathe in through your nose, hold your breath, and exhale through your mouth.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat as many times as you’d like.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Making an Effective Apology</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Acknowledge the offense by showing that you recognize who was responsible, who was harmed, and the nature of the offense.</p></li>
<li><p>If helpful, provide an explanation, especially to convey that it was not intentional and that it will not happen again.</p></li>
<li><p>Express remorse.</p></li>
<li><p>Make amends. When considering how to best make amends, be sure to ask the offended person what would mean the most to them.</p></li>
</ol>

      <title>The Questions to Ask Yourself in an Argument</title>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Our guest explores how reminding yourself that you don't know everything can have a profound impact on your relationships, and our society.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>Jinho “Piper” Ferreira is a playwright, a rapper, and a former deputy sheriff. His band Flipsyde toured the world, but Jinho wanted to make real change to end police violence against his community – so he became a deputy sheriff himself. He was on the force for eight years before resigning in 2019. Jinho joins us today after trying a practice in cultivating intellectual humility. It asks us to consider how our memories and understanding of the world might be fallible, so we might not have all the answers. When Jinho tapped into the practice during a disagreement with a bandmate, he was able to navigate the conflict and come to a resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Check out Jinho’s band, Flipsyde: <a href="https://flipsyde.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://flipsyde.com/</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Try this practice: Cultivate Intellectual Humility</strong></p>

<p><em>If you can, write out your answers.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>When you encounter information or an opinion that contradicts your opinion or worldview, ask yourself these questions:</li>
</ol>

<p>Why do you disagree?</p>

<p>Are you making any assumptions about the other person and the source of their opinion?</p>

<p>Might those assumptions be wrong?</p>

<p>What about your own opinion, how did you come to believe it?</p>

<p>Do you really have all of the information?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Now think about the scenario from the perspective of a person who disagrees with you. Try to imagine how they came to believe what they believe.</p></li>
<li><p>What information might they be basing their opinion off of?</p></li>
<li><p>What values do you think they’re weighing in how they think about this topic?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you imagine how they came to hold those values?</p></li>
<li><p>If you find yourself getting stuck, imagine yourself as a third person weighing in with an opinion that’s different from both of yours. Try to generate an entirely new perspective. Can you think of another way to understand this issue?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>3. Tap into your intellectual humility:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Identify places where, before, you weren’t acknowledging the limitations of what you know about the issue. Can you find any?</p></li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve worked to see this issue from another person’s point of view, do you see more value in their perspective than you were able to see before?</p></li>
<li><p>What other ways do you engage with viewpoints that challenge your own? Do you notice any patterns?</p></li>
</ol>

        <![CDATA[Our guest explores how reminding yourself that you don't know everything can have a profound impact on your relationships, and our society.

Episode summary:

Jinho “Piper” Ferreira is a playwright, a rapper, and a former deputy sheriff. His band Flipsyde toured the world, but Jinho wanted to make real change to end police violence against his community – so he became a deputy sheriff himself. He was on the force for eight years before resigning in 2019. Jinho joins us today after trying a practice in cultivating intellectual humility. It asks us to consider how our memories and understanding of the world might be fallible, so we might not have all the answers. When Jinho tapped into the practice during a disagreement with a bandmate, he was able to navigate the conflict and come to a resolution.

Check out Jinho’s band, Flipsyde: <a href="https://flipsyde.com/" target="_blank">https://flipsyde.com/</a>

Try this practice: Cultivate Intellectual Humility

If you can, write out your answers.


When you encounter information or an opinion that contradicts your opinion or worldview, ask yourself these questions:


Why do you disagree?

Are you making any assumptions about the other person and the source of their opinion?

Might those assumptions be wrong?

What about your own opinion, how did you come to believe it?

Do you really have all of the information?


Now think about the scenario from the perspective of a person who disagrees with you. Try to imagine how they came to believe what they believe.
What information might they be basing their opinion off of?
What values do you think they’re weighing in how they think about this topic?
Can you imagine how they came to hold those values?
If you find yourself getting stuck, imagine yourself as a third person weighing in with an opinion that’s different from both of yours. Try to generate an entirely new perspective. Can you think of another way to understand this issue?


3. Tap into your intellectual humility:


Identify places where, before, you weren’t acknowledging the limitations of what you know about the issue. Can you find any?
Now that you’ve worked to see this issue from another person’s point of view, do you see more value in their perspective than you were able to see before?
What other ways do you engage with viewpoints that challenge your own? Do you notice any patterns?

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Take 10 minutes to be guided through a practice of meaningful self-kindness: A self-compassion break with Kristin Neff.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How to Do This Practice:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Think of a situation in your life that is difficult and is causing you stress. For this practice, especially if you are new to it, it's better to choose something that is moderately difficult in your life, rather than overwhelming.</p></li>
<li><p>Call the situation to mind and get in touch with what happened or what you think might happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Now say to yourself, “This is a moment of suffering.” This acknowledgment is a form of mindfulness—of noticing what is going on for you emotionally in the present moment, without judging that experience as good or bad. You can also say to yourself, “This hurts” or “This is stress.” Use whatever statement feels most natural to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, say to yourself, “Suffering is a part of life.” This is a recognition of your common humanity with others—that all people have trying experiences, and these experiences give you something in common with the rest of humanity rather than mark you as abnormal or deficient. Other options for this statement include “Other people feel this way,” “I’m not alone,” or “We all struggle in our lives.”</p></li>
<li><p>Now, put your hands over your heart, feel the warmth of your hands and the gentle touch on your chest, and say, “May I be kind to myself.” You can also consider whether there is another specific phrase that would speak to you in that particular situation. Some examples: “May I give myself the compassion that I need,” “May I accept myself as I am,” “May I learn to accept myself as I am,” “May I forgive myself,” “May I be strong,” and “May I be patient.”</p></li>

Other options for this statement include “Other people feel this way,” “I’m not alone,” or “We all struggle in our lives.”</p></li>
<li><p>Now, put your hands over your heart, feel the warmth of your hands and the gentle touch on your chest, and say, “May I be kind to myself.” You can also consider whether there is another specific phrase that would speak to you in that particular situation. Some examples: “May I give myself the compassion that I need,” “May I accept myself as I am,” “May I learn to accept myself as I am,” “May I forgive myself,” “May I be strong,” and “May I be patient.”</p></li>

        <![CDATA[<p>Have you ever known you're dreaming while you're asleep? Our guests try practices to help induce lucid dreams, and we hear what they can teach us about consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>How do you know you’re awake? Are you sure? Practicing lucid dreaming means taking a step back to question your very consciousness — throughout your day, and even when you’re asleep. It’s no wonder lucid dreaming is associated with mindfulness. In this episode, journalists Marylee Williams and Michaeleen Doucleff try a practice to induce lucid dreaming, and researcher Benjamin Baird explains what lucid dreaming is teaching scientists about consciousness, plus how it might benefit our well-being. Lucid dreaming appears to help foster creativity and can boost your mood when you wake up.</p>

<p><strong>Try Lucid Dreaming</strong></p>

<p>There are a few different ways to induce lucid dreams. All of them take time and practice. Find a brief summary below and more information at this link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2m86pw7p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://tinyurl.com/2m86pw7p</a></p>

<p>(i) Reality Testing (RT), a technique that involves checking your environment several times a day to see whether or not you’re dreaming;</p>

<p>(iii) MILD, a technique that involves waking up after five hours of sleep and then developing the intention to remember that you are dreaming before returning to sleep, by repeating the phrase ‘The next time I’m dreaming, I will remember that I’m dreaming;’ you also imagine yourself in a lucid dream;</p>

<p>(iv) SSILD, a technique that involves waking up after five hours of sleep and then repeatedly focusing your attention on visual, auditory, and physical sensations for 20 seconds each before returning to sleep; this technique is similar to mindfulness meditation but involved repeatedly shifting your focus;</p>

<p><strong>How to Do this Three Good Things practice:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Take a few deep breaths, and notice how you feel.</p></li>
<li><p>Think back on your day. Start from when you woke up, and mentally trace your steps forward in time.</p></li>
<li><p>What was the most beautiful, amazing, or interesting thing you saw all day? How did it make you feel? Take a moment to feel grateful for it. Think what had to happen so you could see that thing today, and let yourself appreciate those things.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep reflecting on your day. What’s the best sound you heard all day? How did it make you feel? Take a moment to feel grateful for that, and think about how you came to hear that thing today.</p></li>
<li><p>Look back over your day again: What’s the best thing that happened all day? It could be anything. Sit with your gratitude for that thing. What caused that thing to happen? Take a moment to appreciate all the factors that led to this good thing happening today.</p></li>
<li><p>Notice how you feel now.</p></li>

We guide you through a reflection of three things you're grateful for today. This practice is shown to boost happiness, connection, and motivation while reducing stress. Happiness Break is a new series by The Science of Happiness.


How to Do this Three Good Things practice:


Take a few deep breaths, and notice how you feel.
Think back on your day. Start from when you woke up, and mentally trace your steps forward in time.
What was the most beautiful, amazing, or interesting thing you saw all day? How did it make you feel? Take a moment to feel grateful for it. Think what had to happen so you could see that thing today, and let yourself appreciate those things.
Keep reflecting on your day. What’s the best sound you heard all day? How did it make you feel? Take a moment to feel grateful for that, and think about how you came to hear that thing today.
Look back over your day again: What’s the best thing that happened all day? It could be anything. Sit with your gratitude for that thing. What caused that thing to happen? Take a moment to appreciate all the factors that led to this good thing happening today.
Notice how you feel now.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Do you struggle with sleep? This week Drew Ackerman of Sleep with Me podcast tries tips for a good night's sleep, and we explore why it's so important to our well-being.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>A good night’s sleep can be hard to come by, and beating yourself up over not sleeping enough will only make it worse. On this episode of The Science of Happiness, the host of Sleep With Me podcast Drew Ackerman joins us to try science-backed tips for finding your natural sleep rhythm. Drew, also known as “Dearest Scooter,” talks about his history with insomnia and sleep anxiety, sleep hygiene, and his philosophy on bringing more self-compassion into his approach to trying to fall asleep. Then we hear from sleep scientist Eti Ben Simon about how sleep affects your social life.</p>

<p><strong>Practice:</strong></p>

<p>Here are four tips to help you sleep from Dr. Eti Ben Simon.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Avoid alcohol and caffeine after 2 p.m. to unmask your true biological sleep needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep lights dim in the evening and limit access to LED lights after 9 p.m.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to sleep as soon as you feel tired (even if you're in the middle of something). This will help you figure out the earliest window it is physiologically possible for you to fall asleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use an alarm clock to wake up.</p></li>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>

<p>Emanuel Hahn has never been great at asking for help. He didn’t live with his parents after age 12, and consequently, he says he learned to only rely on himself. But now that he’s launching his first book and juggling a freelance career, he knows he can’t do it all on his own. He tried our <a href="https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/ask_for_help_at_work" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ask for Help at Work</a> practice, which challenges you to make a direct request when you need a hand from someone. <br>
<br>
Emanuel had to pack 800 pre-ordered books into boxes for shipping. It’s a laborious task, and he knew he couldn’t handle it all on his own. It was a Sunday, and people probably already had plans. He took a beat, and then he sent the texts out anyway. Before long, he had eight people packing books. **<br>
**<br>
Vanessa Bohns of Cornell University has studied exactly what Emanuel experienced: When it comes to asking for help, we underestimate how likely others are to say “yes” to our request. But when we put ourselves in the shoes of a person being asked for help, it’s hard to imagine saying “no.”</p>

<p>“People do get this warm glow from helping,” Bohns says. “People enjoy being helpful.”<br>
<br>
This Happiness Practice might benefit you as much as the person you ask.</p>
