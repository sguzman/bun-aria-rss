   <media:description>Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Michael Franzese discuss being raised in a mafia environment, having a high-ranking father within the crime family, the schemes and successes of his career, and the ultimate reasons for why he walked away.
 
Michael Franzese is an American former mobster once affiliated with the Colombo crime family. Most notable for his gas-tax scheme from the mid 80’s, it is estimated that Franzese at one point was personally making eight million dollars a week. At his height Franzese had achieved the rank of Caporegime, or the equivalent of a captain or general within the mob ranks, and was nicknamed the “Yuppie Don” as well as the “Prince of the Mob,” by his contemporaries. In 1986, Franzese was sentenced to 10 years in prison for conspiracy charges, and despite being released early, spent the next decade in and out of jail. In 1994 he was finally released, chose to retire from crime, and bought an estate in Florida. Since then he has traveled the world as a public speaker, and has written many books about his life and crimes, such as 1992’s Quitting the Mob, or his most recent 2022 publication, Mafia Democracy.

As former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gingrich is well known as the architect of the “Contract with America” that led the Republican Party to victory in 1994, creating the first conservative majority in the House in 40 years.

He is the author of 41 books, including 18 fiction and nonfiction New York Times bestsellers.

Warning: this book is decidedly not for children. 

Wickedly penned by Dr. Jordan B Peterson, best-selling author of 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, An ABC of Childhood Tragedy unforgettably depicts the doomed and desperate lives of Adella, Bertram, Cynthia and their cohort of catastrophe.

Twenty-six dark and witty poems, each a tragic comedy of innocence and vulnerability. Twenty-six hauntingly beautiful portrayals of injustice and suffering, each from the gifted imagination of Juliette Fogra, illustrator of Beyond Order: 12 More Rules of Life.

If A Nightmare before Christmas or Coraline struck you to the heart;
if the gothic raillery of Edward Gorey’s Gashlycrumb Tinies seduced you to smile satirically;
if the Brothers Grimm were nowhere near grim enough for you;
then An ABC of Childhood Tragedy might just be the book you’ve been pining for.

This video/audio project is an adjunct to the first volume of the illustrated book An ABC of Childhood Tragedy (verses by Jordan B Peterson; illustrations by Juliette Fogra). One song will be released every two weeks, and a vinyl album is in the works. 

Note: The lyrics of Parents Lament are not part of An ABC of Childhood Tragedy, although the photographic portraits are derived from the book illustrations.

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Senator Josh Hawley discuss the leftist ideology surrounding men and their diminished worth, the current Republican swing as a result, and the potential future of American politics as we move towards the midterm elections.

Senator Hawley is recognized as one of the nation’s leading constitutional lawyers. He has litigated at the Supreme Court of the United States, the federal courts of appeals, and in state court, fighting for the people’s liberties. He previously fought Obamacare at the Supreme Court — and won — as one of the lead attorneys in the landmark Hobby Lobby case. Since taking office in 2019, Senator Hawley has been a leading champion in Congress for working families. He’s worked across the aisle to deliver protections for kids online, led the fight for direct payments to working people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and taken steps to crack down on predatory landlords. Currently, Senator Hawley is writing a book set for a 2023 release.

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. Dennis McKenna discuss the science behind psychedelics, the entities found through the looking glass, the current pharmaceutical approach to long life, and why it needs to change.

Dr. Dennis McKenna is an American ethnopharmacologist, lecturer and author. He is a founding board member and the director of ethnopharmacology at the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit exploring the therapeutic uses of psychedelic medicines. McKenna received his masters in botany at the University of Hawaii in 1979, followed by his doctorate in the same field at the University of British Columbia in 1984. Dennis is the brother of Terrence McKenna, a cultural figure and proponent for the exploration of psychedelics. Together they co-authored The Invisible Landscape. Much later Dennis would write a memoir, Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss,  detailing he and his brothers exploits in the field.

Most decidedly NOT for children. 

Wickedly penned by Dr. Jordan B Peterson, An ABC of Childhood Tragedy unforgettably depicts the doomed and desperate lives of Adella, Bertram, Cynthia and their cohort of catastrophe. 

Twenty-six dark and witty poems, each a tragic comedy of innocence and vulnerability. Twenty-six hauntingly beautiful portrayals of injustice and suffering, each from the gifted imagination of Juliette Fogra, illustrator of Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life. 

If A Nightmare before Christmas or Coraline struck you to the heart; 
if the gothic raillery of Edward Gorey’s Gashlycrumb Tinies seduced you to smile satirically;
if the Brothers Grimm were nowhere near grim enough for you; 
then An ABC of Childhood Tragedy might just be the book you’ve been pining for. 

This video/audio project is an adjunct to the first  of the illustrated book An ABC of Childhood Tragedy (verses by Jordan B Peterson; illustrations by Juliette Fogra). One song will be released every two weeks, and a vinyl album is planned. 

Note: The verse for the letter W spoken/whispered in this prelude is part of An ABC of Childhood Tragedy, and the photographic portraits are derived from the book illustrations. One song will be released every two weeks for the next few months, and a vinyl album is in the works.

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. Karl Friston discuss the world as we perceive it through micro narratives, how those narratives exist within a structured hierarchy, and how we can manipulate the system, and thus change our own mindsets.

Dr. Karl Friston is a renowned neuroscientist, and one of the leading researchers in brain imagery. He is credited for inventing statistical parametric mapping, an international standard for the analysis of imaging data. His work also pertains to the free energy principle, and predictive coding theory. Currently, he works as a professor of neuroscience at the University College London.

   <media:description>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, and Mohammed Hijab discuss comparative religion, what is said about Islam versus what Islam has to say, and how the uncomfortable conversation - whether contentious or unnerving, is well worth having. 
 
Mohammed Hijab is an author, comparative religionist, and philosopher of scripture. He is the co-founder of the Sapience Institute and is a researcher and instructor for the organization. He has a BA in Politics and a master’s degree in History. He has also acquired a second master’s in Islamic Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, as well as a third master’s degree in Applied Theology from the University of Oxford. Currently, he is working toward his PhD in Philosophy of Religion. Having completed Islamic seminary courses, he is one of very few Muslims who has been given formal permission to relay Islamic knowledge on selected Islamic fields, dealing with comparative, political, and theological issues. In his efforts, he has amassed a substantial following on YouTube, aided in part by authoring books such as “The Scientific Deception of the New Atheists.”
 
Jonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.

   <media:description>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Piers Morgan discuss the art of interviewing, the importance of living truthfully, the pitfalls of sycophancy, and they go into depth regarding the 2016 election, and the aftermath of Donald Trump.
 
Piers Morgan is a British journalist and television personality who started his career working as a freelance writer for the Sun. Later he would be chosen by Rupert Murdock as editor for his publication, News of the World. This appointment would make Morgan the youngest British news editor (29) in more than fifty years. He would go on to be the editor of publications such as the Daily Mirror and MailOnline before ramping into a career on television. He would introduce documentaries for the BBC, and had a channel 4 political interview show with Amanda Platell, all before his stint as a judge on America’s Got Talent. Morgan would compete on and win the 2008 season of Celebrity Apprentice, and later famously interview the show's host, Donald Trump, after he had become the 45th US President. Morgan would work on numerous talk shows and documentary series before starting his current day production, Piers Morgan Uncensored. This show, on which controversial and celebrity guests debate Morgan, would be the first launched on talkTV, and welcome back President Trump for its premiere and second episodes.

Alex Story and Dr. Jordan B. Peterson discuss biology and overpopulation, the misguided thinking behind eugenics, and the tendency of politics to weaponize our totalitarian impulses.
 
Alex Story was an Olympic class rower for Great Britain, and attended the University of Cambridge. There he set the rowing course record against Oxford in the 1998 Boat Race, a record held for multiple decades. After suffering a career-ending back injury, Story turned his attention to politics, and quickly became a notable voice in the Conservative party. He stood for parliamentary office three times, representing some of the poorest areas in the country. Today he works in the finance sector as head of sales for a US brokerage firm. He has also become a writer, seeing his articles published weekly in magazines such as the National Inquirer and Express.

Stella Assange and Dr Jordan B Peterson discuss the freedom of information, the age of journalism on the internet, and the foremost political prisoner in the west: Julian Assange.

Stella Assange is a lawyer with a degree in law and politics from the SOAS University in London, an MSC in refugee law from Oxford, and a masters degree in public International law from Madrid. Her husband, Julian Assange, is somewhat infamous not only for founding Wikileaks, but for publishing classified government documents that lead to his unlawful imprisonment. Today, Stella leads the charge for his freedom and for the freedom of information.
