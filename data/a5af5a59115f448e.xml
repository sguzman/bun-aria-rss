It's almost impossible to know how many species are going extinct in a given time without being sure how many species there actually are on the planet - which we're not. The 150 species per day figure was suggested at the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and it sounded suitably horrible so in the figure went.</media:description>

An apology if required:
I've been a bit quiet of late. Sorry about that. Sometimes a while goes by when nothing worth making turns up. However. A new book will be out in the next few months – not depressing sci-fi for once – and more stuff is coming, promise. If that's something you're waiting for, then thank you kindly for waiting. I'm not sure why you're reading so far down in the description, but thanks for that too. In return, please accept this masterpiece: https://youtu.be/MKp30C3MwVk</media:description>

As part of the 'research process' for this video I stayed up one night and got a bit blasted on red wine and watched a lot of scifi movies about Mars. The Martian was very good. Mission to Mars was slightly odd in places, but damn the soundtrack is just gorgeous: https://youtu.be/HZkta5p6qQE?t=368</media:description>

So. 6 months later and I can confirm Geometry for Ocelots is coming to print and audiobook in January. I know I said it'd only be a little while, but I suppose 6 months is a little while for cosmic bodies like stars or deities. If you don't know what Geometry for Ocelots is, please ignore this message and I hope you're having an adequate day.

   <media:description>I think therefore I bork.
*the adverb mention is just straight up wrong. &quot;F-ing unhinged&quot; is still an adjective. Excuse my silliness. (More things to waste your time with below.)

The grammatical variations of a certain f-word were of course yoinked from George Carlin's bit which did it better: (Seems to be George Carlin originally anyway.) https://youtu.be/xZkb4TPI-Lo

The mention about toile and toilet was put extremely badly. &quot;Toilette&quot; was the diminutive, not the other way around as poor wording implied.

There's some controversy surrounding how efficient a bee's waggle dance actually is. I'm no apiologist (no seriously, that's a specialist of bee science), but the problem doesn't seem to bee (heh) with the waggle dance. Rather, the dispute is over how much of a difference it makes to bees watching the dance itself. For 1000x more depth than this video went into: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3153927/

One of the opening slides shows the greatest copypasta known to humankind: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta

The &quot;If this little lion could speak...&quot; line is lifted almost directly from Wittgenstein. The original line is &quot;If a lion could speak, we could not understand him.&quot; As in: even *with* complex language, alien minds might still be incomprehensible. 

Quite a lot of the silliness with English was taken from John McWhorter's brilliant Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue: The Untold History of English. It's a great read: https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/3143472-our-magnificent-bastard-tongue

This one was largely inspired by a friend trying to convince me that animals don't just have a 'smaller' form of human intelligence,  they've gone off in other evolutionary directions and we should probably count those different types of smarts as valid too. So, thank you to HF for that.

The thumbnail is an axolotl, and just in case you haven't come across them yet they're quite fantastic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl

Bonus fun: I spent about a month trying to come up with the title for this one. &quot;The Tower of Babble&quot; seemed like a fun comedy twist on the biblical story. I looked it up. No one seemed to have used it already. Well, I felt terribly proud of that and walked with a spring in my step for several weeks. Just before uploading today I thought I'd check again. I hadn't noticed Google was kindly correcting the typo for me. Of course The Tower of Babble is already a thing; books, films, podcasts. Almost threw myself out the window.

If you’re interested in Buddhism, this is some stuff I certainly got a kick out of over the years: 

So, a massive amount of this video came from a lecture series by Malcolm David Eckel. You can listen to it here, and no - no one's sponsoring me for this, it's just ace - https://www.audible.com/pd/Buddhism-Audiobook/B00DDUVALC

Also:

My favourite version of the Dhammapada, the sayings of the Buddha - https://youtu.be/4afDXAvbl0A

A great written intro to Zen -  Zen Mind Beginner's Mind by Shunryu Suzuki - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402843.Zen_Mind_Beginner_s_Mind

Another brilliant intro to Zen by Alan Watts - https://youtu.be/f7F_SGCnVdI

Act Normal (a great documentary about a Western Buddhist monk) - https://vimeo.com/27590176</media:description>

   <media:description>This is not a good summation of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. This is what happens when you stay up reading about it while imbibing moderate-to-inadvisable amounts of beer. (I’m sure Nia and Soren were fine in the end. (More stuff below.))

A little note about where I’ve been: I’m not dead, unless you mean spiritually. I’m trying my hardest to finish the new book and it takes up most of my time and allotted crying episodes. I’ll do my best to return to something bordering on a ‘normal’ upload schedule when it’s finally finished and out, promise. Hope you’re doing well :)</media:description>

   <media:description>“We have been to the moon, we have charted the depths of the ocean and the heart of the atom, but we have a fear of looking inward to ourselves because we sense that is where all the contradictions flow together.” – Terence McKenna

This one was inspired after a chat I had with the magnificent mystiverse. He makes wonderful stuff  ► https://www.youtube.com/c/mystiverse
To hear all this stuff explained better than me (though admittedly with less cats) ► https://youtu.be/uhRhtFFhNzQ
It was also heavily influenced by Chrstof Koch’s brilliant ‘Consciousness: Confessions of a Romantic Reductionist’ (which I suggest you give a read if you’d like to) ► https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13557108-consciousness

I made this one after years of getting stuck in debates with people about stuff I changed my mind about only a year later, and regretted being so adamant that tabasco is disgusting or whatever. (It’s not, it’s amazing.) 
We’re clearly not going to solve the problems in the centuries ahead with compassion alone. But we could sure end the world without it.</media:description>

Bonus trivia: This video is not finished. But if I don’t let it go now, I will be. 
The beginning fell into my head several months ago. I assumed it would take a few weeks to make, at most. Little did I know it would sprout multiple heads and take over my life for two and a half months. If you didn’t enjoy watching it, take comfort that I didn’t enjoy making it. (Just jokez. Thanks for watching my stuff as always, and hope you’re well :) )

Bonus bonus trivia: The original title was supposed to be &quot;The Nine Isles of Neverdead&quot;, but google told me Neverdead is already a thing; apparently a video game about demons and stuff. 

I'm sorry this one took a while. I'm especially sorry to folks on Patreon. I think I told you it would only be another week about three weeks ago? Apologies, but I didn't want to put the thing out half baked.

 A very, very big thank you to a friend who wishes to go by the name Jimmy Cakeshoes. When the editing was almost done, it was impossible to render the video because my PC kept having little meltdowns and locking up. One genius technical fix later from Dr. Cakeshoes and all was well. Big love to you, man. 

The poems mentioned at the end are: 

The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T. S. Eliot
https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/44212/the-love-song-of-j-alfred-prufrock

The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge 
https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43997/the-rime-of-the-ancient-mariner-text-of-1834

Kubla Khan also by Samuel Taylor Coleridge 
https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43991/kubla-khan

I fully admit to stealing that line from the end of The Great Gatsby.

   <media:description>So let’s go back, eh?

More spacey stuff and some recommendations below ►

Enormous liberties have been taken with this one; some of the footage isn’t from Apollo 11 (the mission we chat about here), but subsequent missions to the moon. Footage was really quite difficult to find, so hopefully you can forgive me playing a little visually loose with the truth.

Also the Soviet space program was barely even mentioned in the video. I’ve often thought it’s a bit sad that the Soviet Union got the first satellite into space, the first doggos (let’s not discuss it), the first man, the first woman, the first probe to the moon, the first spacewalk, and the first robot on another celestial body – yet the winner’s medal generally goes to the US for reaching the moon, and doing it so brilliantly. (Which they did, and which it was.)

Not in any way meaning to discredit the US here, I’d just like to urge you to spare a thought for those other clever men and women a continent away who were – at the very same time – also taking marvellous and brave strides into space. 

I’ve had quite a fascination with the Apollo program over the years, and space in general. If it’s something you’re interested in too, here’s the stuff I really, really enjoyed reading and watching. (No one’s paying me for this, I just dig them. The audiobook versions are great too.)

Mike Massimino - Spaceman

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0925248/

Before uploading this video I had a fairly long conversation with a meme-knowledgeable friend about whether dabbing would be appropriate in a thumbnail. I wasn’t sure what dabbing is.

She assured me that since an astronaut’s doing it, it’s fine.
