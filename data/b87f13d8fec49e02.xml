      <title>Kristi Yamaguchi: Asian American Idol</title>
      <description>For many Asian Americans, seeing Kristi Yamaguchi win the gold in women’s figure skating at the 1992 Olympics was everything. She was more than a famous athlete — she was one of the few Asian Americans on TV, period. Yet for Kristi, the polished, glamorous image that we all saw was very different from her experience on the inside. From her choice to skate solo to seeking endorsements in an anti-Asian climate, reporter Stefanie Ritoper looks at the moments that almost stopped Kristi from becoming the Kristi Yamaguchi that we all know.

      <title>Mabel Fairbanks: Beyond The Edge</title>
      <link>https://blindlanding.com/</link>
      <description>Mabel Fairbanks changed figure skating forever. As a Black figure skater in the 1940s, Mabel made a name for herself skating in ice shows all over the world — but was barred from entering competitions because of the color of her skin. Mabel made it her life’s mission to get Black skaters into the sport and to reach the highest peaks. Using excerpts of interviews with Mabel never before heard by the public, we’re bringing you not just the story of Mabel Fairbanks, but Mabel herself — her voice, in her own words.
