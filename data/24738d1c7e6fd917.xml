<p>Unlike Twitter, which is a centralized service controlled by one entity – arguably, one individual person – Mastodon comprises many servers (or instances) controlled by the people or persons who set them up. The users on each can communicate freely with others on other instances, and of course, with each other. Individual users can block messages from instances that are the source of material they don&#8217;t want, and, like Twitter, can block individual users&#8217; posts (or &#8220;toots&#8221;).</p>
<p>A user&#8217;s feed comprises toots from other members of their instance, and the users can see messages from other instances that can be relayed and publicly boosted on their &#8220;home&#8221; instance.</p>
<p>While that might sound more complex than a central service where, theoretically, anyone can see everything, it has the effect of creating communities with shared interests, opinions, or political leanings gathering around particular instances or servers. And, of course, while there are white supremacist, racist hate-mongers on Mastodon, the instances (and therefore their denizens) on which they congregate are usually blocked by the administrators of other instances.<br />

<p>Becoming an administrator is relatively easy, although, like anything else that provides a service, it comes with costs for hosting, backup, data throughput, and so on. The community often covers these costs via voluntary contributions; as a rough guide, an instance with 100,000 users may cost around $500 per month in cloud fees or power – around half a cent, per user, per month.</p>
<p>Part of becoming an administrator involves signing up for the <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/covenant">Mastodon Server Covenant</a>, which asks administrators to actively moderate against hate speech of any type, ensure backups are made properly, and give three months&#8217; notice to users if they decide to shut the service down.</p>
<p>The arguably tenuous nature of a single instance is one of the major criticism leveled at the federated network: a user&#8217;s identity is tied to the instance they sign up to, so an instance going away overnight can have a significant impact on a user&#8217;s online identity and network of relationships. However, successful communities often continue despite changes in administration as members step up to take on the burden of administration when an admin moves on, gets a more stressful day job, has kids, or experiences similar inconveniences to their geek life.</p>
<p>Despite this decentralized approach, users get a unified experience regardless of their &#8220;home&#8221; instance and can roam the &#8220;fediverse&#8221; (federated universe), building relationships, friendships, and even finding romance. To date, most users of the fediverse are generally left-leaning or at least liberal, as are each instance&#8217;s administrators – users of hate speech, racists, and other detritus are almost always banned from an instance quick-smart. In general, Mastodon is a much safer place for people to exist than on the centralized Twitter network.<br />

<p>Whether Elon Musk&#8217;s intentions for moderation changes on Twitter may make Mastodon or its alternatives more popular is, statistically speaking, moot. There are nearly half a billion active daily Twitter users, and a rise in 70,000 in Mastodon fediverse members is a drop in the ocean comparatively.</p>
<p>Like many of the new Twitter CEO&#8217;s pronouncements, there remains a great deal of vagueness around any plans for his new toy, AKA the Twitter platform. On the one hand, he has said he doesn&#8217;t see Twitter as a money-making vehicle, yet on the other, he has said to employees that making Twitter into the US version of WeChat (a so-called super-app) would be &#8220;a win.&#8221;</p>

That prevalence of opinion is a reflection of US employers who, like Microsoft itself (owner of LinkedIn), feel their teams achieved less than when they were on-premises.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work-is-just-work">Microsoft survey</a> found that 85% of managers felt they &#8220;couldn&#8217;t tell if employees were getting enough done,&#8221; a turn of phrase that&#8217;s indicative of some shortfall in managerial practice rather than workers necessarily slacking off while working from home. The same survey found that 87% of workers thought their productivity was &#8220;just fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more recent LinkedIn survey comes on the back of figures showing that the number of jobs advertised on the platform containing the word &#8220;remote&#8221; in the Location field has fallen for a fifth consecutive month to 12% of all those positions currently open. That 12% of positions get 20% of applications, it&#8217;s worth noting: working from home in the UK, even part-time, is still attractive to most staff.<br />

<p>Without a doubt, the peak in remote work during the COVID epidemic is falling away significantly, and, at the same time, there are generally fewer job postings. With national unemployment figures in the UK hovering at around the 3.5% mark, employers are, however, still operating in a &#8220;buyers market,&#8221; in that staff remain in relatively strong positions when it comes to picking and choosing from advertised jobs. Offers of positions that are remote, or part-remote, remain a strong draw among the labor force.</p>
<h3>Working from home in the UK</h3>
<p>According to Josh Graff, managing director of LinkedIn for EMEA and Latin America, speaking on <em>Bloomberg Radio</em>, there is a &#8220;growing disconnect between what professionals want and what employers are offering.&#8221; Every organization is therefore treading a fine line between what are perceived as lower levels of productivity from remote workers and the desire to keep valued employees who are more entrenched in their home offices than before COVID.</p>
<p>&#8220;While difficult decisions undoubtedly have to be taken, it&#8217;s important to remember that your employees are your company&#8217;s most precious asset,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They have experience of your systems, your processes. They&#8217;re aligned with your culture and values and importantly they are the ones that hold deep customer relationships as well.&#8221;<br />

<p>The UK government&#8217;s position on remote working hit the headlines several times throughout 2022, most notably when the Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency, Jacob Rees Mogg, left notes on remote-working civil servants&#8217; (staffers) desks that said &#8220;Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon.&#8221; Since then, the same minister (whose Wikipedia entry is top of the Google SERP for a search for &#8220;Minister for the 18th Century&#8221;) has begun the sale of over £1.5bn of empty office real estate belonging to the government to give taxpayers a better deal.</p>

<p>One of Britain&#8217;s best-known entrepreneurs, James Dyson, has spoken publicly against home-working. Writing in The Telegraph in March 2022, he said, &#8220;The Government ignores the fact that for many companies […] [home-working] kills essential learning and collaboration, stunts development of our people, prevents access to vital equipment and laboratories, and undermines the security of our intellectual property.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, for smaller companies, using home workers can <a href="https://www.smetoday.co.uk/features/small-businesses-set-to-stick-with-home-working-with-average-wfh-business-saving-almost-50k-a-year/">save a great deal of cost</a>, estimated by one survey to be almost £4,000 a month for companies with fewer than 50 employees.</p>

<li><strong>EU Digital Markets Act will force interoperability between competing services and protocols.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Digital Services Act to oversee algorithms&#8217; effects on the people of the European Union.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The annual revenues of many tech giants dwarf the GDPs of most nations. In resources and in terms of global influence, big tech companies are effectively significant world powers, seemingly operating outside or above national jurisdictions and concerns. The ubiquity of big technology companies&#8217; services makes them able to act almost as a law unto themselves. There is no right of recourse, other than not to use many services, and doing so can make life extremely difficult for the individual.</p>
<p>However, that situation is likely to change, at least in the European Union (EU) – the bloc of countries on the European mainland comprising 27 nation states and with a total internet-using population of over 400 million. Change is coming with a new EU-wide law that comes into effect November 1, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA).</p>
<p>The DMA is designed to break down the closed nature of many common digital applications and open jealously-guarded proprietary services and protocols to competition and interoperability.<br />

<p>The most-quoted example is iOS users&#8217; inability to load and run apps from any source other than the Apple App Store. To date there&#8217;s been a blanket ban, baked into every iteration of iOS, on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/11/ios-sideloading-questions-answered/">sideloading applications</a> from third parties. After the Digital Markets Act comes into effect, EU residents should, by law, be able to do just that – download compiled iOS app files, load and run them on their iPhone or iPad, all without hindrance from any element in the operating system.</p>
<h3>Slowly does it for the Digital Markets Act</h3>
<p>The November 1 deadline is not, however, going to change things overnight. Bureaucracy moves slowly, and the EU is well-known for proceeding at a pace that&#8217;s hardly white-knuckle. The measures in the DMA only affect large companies, and the EU is yet to decide how &#8220;large companies&#8221; <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/information/digitisation_2018/contributions/anna_gerbrandy.pdf">are defined</a>[pdf]. It&#8217;s expected that ten or twelve organizations will be affected initially, and few readers could fail to name a good number: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, Samsung, and so on.</p>
<p>Although the EU moves slowly, when it does move, it moves effectively. Antitrust investigations in the past have forced Apple to pay tax on EU sales, made Microsoft stop promoting its Internet Explorer browser over its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/publications/cpn/2010_1_12.pdf">competitors&#8217; browsers</a>[pdf], and has recently backed French regulators currently forcing Google to pay French news sites&#8217; owners for the material it scrapes.</p>
<p>And while Australia and South Korea are making similar legislative inroads into what many see as market abuses of monopoly positions by big tech in those countries, the sheer mass of population and conjoined governments the EU represents makes this legislation important for big tech&#8217;s global policies.</p>
<p>One such effect of the new laws will be the enforced opening-up of messaging protocols and platforms, meaning that Apple Messages, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger will have to be interoperable with smaller, lesser-known messaging apps like Telegram, Signal, and Session.<br />

<h3>Round Two: the Digital Services Act</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s also a second EU law waiting in the wings, the <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/dsa-explained/">Digital Services Act (DSA)</a>, which will force big tech into transparent risk assessments of the societal effects of their back-end algorithms, and make large technology companies accountable for bias in, for example, the AI engines used to power their platforms.</p>
<p>This second tranche of legislation will require the setting up of a whole new arm of bureaucracy (something that the EU does really too well) with plenty of on-site data experts as guides. The European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency will act as arbiter between large companies and national digital rights bodies, generally overseeing big tech&#8217;s effects on the bloc.</p>
<p>While previous efforts like GDPR have been arguably effective in at least raising awareness of the effects of big data and technology on all our lives, the new DMA and DSA will, in all likelihood, evolve from the form in which they start out.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, having a body as powerful as the EU draw some kind of line in the sand between rampant digital <em>laissez-faire</em> and the rights of the citizen will be comforting for those who still believe that government has a role to play in the welfare of its people.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for semiconductors at the peak of the pandemic was off the charts, and that lasted for quite a while. Then briefly, there was a mismatch between demand and supply, </span><a href="https://techhq.com/2022/10/chip-supply-chain-delivery-time-shrank-by-four-days-the-most-in-years/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushing lead times even longer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Lately however, supplies of some semiconductors started piling up, and what could spell good news for consumers spelled the opposite for industry executives. To make matters worse, the new US restrictions against China have only created more obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semiconductor shares have been tumbling amid a series of corporate warnings about slowing demand for chips used in an array of electronic devices. Last month, Korean chipmakers manufactured 3.5% fewer than a year earlier, deteriorating from a 0.1% fall in August, the country&#8217;s national statistics office said separately on Monday. Then when sales data was released, the industry, for the first time in two years, witnessed a fall in global chip sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) last Friday announced global chip sales for the month of September 2022, and they were down 0.5% compared to August 2022 and 3% less than September 2021. “Worldwide sales of semiconductors totaled US$141 billion during the third quarter of 2022, a decrease of 3% compared to the third quarter of 2021 and 6.3% less than the second quarter of 2022,” the </span><a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/monthly-semiconductor-sales-decrease-0-5-globally-in-september/?utm_campaign=Press%20Releases&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=231652182&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_CHyl7-PUvlGZTKNiT6PkPqHsR9HexLkapvnYToevYSY5kD7UHSKld877xoZop8o1jqTfN9hNqkWuapHgvUWCZWzfiHA&amp;utm_content=231652182&amp;utm_source=hs_email"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Following strong growth through the first half of 2022, global semiconductor sales have slowed in recent months, decreasing in September on a year-to-year basis for the first time since January 2020 amid a range of macroeconomic headwinds,” SIA president and CEO John Neuffer said. Considering how semiconductors represent the biggest source of income for the Korean economy, the slowdown last quarter was a reflection of waning consumer demand for the nation’s technology exports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Separately in Taiwan, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, is also seeing reduced orders from four of its largest customers, reflecting slowing global demand. JPMorgan Chase said in a report in early September that </span><a href="https://techhq.com/2022/10/chip-slump-bites-amd-in-the-revenues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nvidia, Qualcomm and MediaTek slashed chip orders with TSMC.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To top it off, while reporting a record quarterly profit surge for the July-to-September quarter two weeks ago, TSMC warned of a likely decline for the entire semiconductor industry in 2023 and cut its capital spending forecast by 10% in 2022. TSMC is not alone; other semiconductor companies which had been looking forward to immense demand and opportunity, are suddenly seen grappling with big challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMD lowered its revenue forecast recently, citing significant weakening in the PC market. Concurrently, Intel, Nvidia and Micron Technology all issued subdued outlooks. Maintaining their optimism, SIA’s Neuffer however reckon that the long-term market outlook remains strong, as semiconductors continue to become a larger and more important part of our digital economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reiterate Gartner, although chip shortages are abating, the global semiconductor market is entering a period of weakness, which will persist through 2023 when semiconductor revenue is projected to decline 2.5%. “We are already seeing weakness in semiconductor end markets, especially those exposed to consumer spending. </span><a href="https://techhq.com/2022/05/is-tsmc-considering-another-round-of-price-hike-for-its-chips-blame-the-inflation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rising inflation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, taxes and interest rates, together with higher energy and fuel costs, are putting pressure on consumer disposable income. This is affecting spending on electronic products such as PCs and smartphones,&#8221; said the company&#8217;s Richard Gordon.<br />

Companies are expected to ship goods on time without fail, and that requires them to have a firm grasp on what&#8217;s happening inside their facilities at every moment. Companies are looking for digital transformation initiatives to solve their supply chain challenges by using the latest technologies to reduce unplanned downtime, improve throughput and productivity, and increase visibility into day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>No technology or process change can by itself be expected to solve these challenges. But combining technologies under the broad term &#8220;digital&#8221; is proving to deliver positive results. Still, with so many moving parts, companies must use a strategic, targeted approach to realise the benefits of digitisation.</p>
<p>There are plenty of opportunities that upheavals in the EU are presenting to companies in the Nordic region. Logistics and supply chain challenges, for example, are throwing into relief the differences between companies that put customer experience first, and those that have no choice but to pass on their internal problems to the customer.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how companies can leverage technology and changes to business processes to gain competitive advantage.</p>
<ol>
<li>Rather than &#8220;following the leader,&#8221; <strong>apply digital solutions to tackle the most meaningful challenges </strong>unique to your business.</li>
</ol>
<p>As consumers demand more and faster, it&#8217;s tempting to jump right into operationalising systems to meet rapid delivery demands. However, the first step for most companies should be to perform an assessment of facilities and operations to define desired business outcomes. The logistics space, especially for grocers and other food service providers, is crowded by competitors trying to deliver goods to consumers in record time. Determine which areas are most critical to address for <em>your</em> business, then identify the right solution for your needs. For example, one company might have issues with unplanned downtime and need improvements in predictive maintenance, while another may have bottlenecks in their operations that limit their ability to ship products at certain times. Problems (and solutions) are myriad, so an initial assessment will ensure your investments are effective. In general, most distribution facilities should start by addressing one of these two areas:</p>
<p>&#8211;   Modernising operational networks and IT systems to improve cybersecurity. This serves as the foundation for digital investments,</p>
<p>&#8211;   Implementing advanced analytics to optimise operations with efficient inventory management or predictive maintenance.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Once you&#8217;ve identified what you&#8217;d like to digitise, <strong>resist the urge to do everything at once</strong>. Instead, start small and broaden your focus as you achieve success.</li>
</ol>
<p>Companies typically pursue one of two pathways for digitisation:</p>
<p>&#8211;   Apply digital transformation narrowly at first to address specific, high-value key performance indicators (KPIs) — like grocery pickup and delivery time. And then apply it more broadly across prioritised aspects of operations over time,</p>
<p>&#8211;   &#8220;Go big&#8221; with next-generation facilities — think of, for example, retailers, building distribution centres for online grocery ordering where they don&#8217;t otherwise have a brick-and-mortar presence.</p>
<p>We generally recommend starting with targeted business outcomes that are high-value and quick to implement, then focus on longer implementation opportunities as those begin to show results.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Know when to lean on technology or when <strong>a problem might be better solved with a human touch</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Integral components of digital transformation have been around for years — artificial intelligence, machine learning, the cloud — just to name three. What&#8217;s new is using the connectivity and intelligence of these technologies to allow smarter optimisation decisions, whether those decisions are made by humans, software, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Many organisations tend to jump to shiny, new technologies before assessing or fully understanding internal user requirements and the need for collaboration among departments, vendors, and suppliers. Understanding organisational change management and having a plan of an area are critical for successfully implementing a digitisation initiative. Avoid the trap of kaleidoscopic analytic applications that require by perpetual clicking to get actionable information (if any at all). Technology must be an enabler and analytic applications must be intelligent enough to facilitate user tasks. So first prioritise user experience requirements over technology.</p>
<p>When you connect your Operational Technologies (OT) with your company&#8217;s Information Technology (IT) and network infrastructure, you begin to connect the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) dots in your facility and facilitate a more comprehensive view of operations and maintenance — a view that drives results. The advent of Industry 4.0 technological advancements (big data, the cloud, IIoT, digital sensors, etc.), makes connecting the right data with the right intelligence easier than previously.</p>
<p>While consumer demands are certainly a leading source of pressure points, food shortages and recalls cause their own disruptions. These disruptions present another case for moving toward digitised logistics in a planned and purposeful way. Whether you are relying on traceability to track a tainted product or real-time inventory data to move product to where it&#8217;s most needed, the key to transformation is thoughtfully considering the solutions that have the biggest impact on your business.</p>
<p>With the right digital transformation approach, companies can expect to see annual productivity improvements of more than five percent in inventory, lead time, data collection, quality, and more.</p>

But in retail, C-Suites currently have a particularly tough challenge on their hands. Economic conditions are putting a squeeze on consumer spending as high energy prices cut into disposable income, and rising inflation means that what’s left doesn’t stretch as far as it used to. But that’s not to say that profits can’t be found. Today, success in retail means being able to seamlessly connect customers, workers, and data, which explains why expertise in enabling retail in the cloud has become highly prized.</p>
<h2>Enterprise-scale</h2>
<p>Retail in the cloud puts mission-critical services on a central, accessible, and secure platform. Combining customer insight, payments services, merchandising / range management, inventory management, business intelligence, logistics / transport management and more, in the cloud, allows firms to get ahead of their competition by lifting retail performance.</p>
<p>Naturally, transitioning from legacy solutions to a unified retail in the cloud platform comes with its own costs – and that’s why CFOs are right to ask tough questions of potential partners. Experienced IT services providers such as <a href="https://www.wipro.com/">Wipro</a>, which has more than two decades of experience in working with retail clients, are capable of accelerating digital business transformation so that productivity gains far outweigh overheads and setup costs.</p>
<p>Skills to look for, more specifically, include the ability to modernize retail operations. Artificial intelligence (AI) can streamline customer interactions – for example, through smart chatbots that can engage with shoppers to maximize sales conversions. Recommendation engines are another powerful use case. AI can generalize large data sets to efficiently pull out trends in sales, help with inventory, recommend next best action, improve fulfilment, and identify patterns to reduce fraud.</p>
<p>At the board level, especially for big-name retailers with large numbers of stores and complex operations, machine learning tools can cluster important metrics to guide strategy. Supply chains can be examined to optimize warehouse utilisation and suggest logistical efficiencies.</p>
<p>As Chief Data Officers are aware, there’s an abundance of insight to be gained from information gathered across sales and fulfilment. But – to maximize value – AI and machine learning tools need to be at the core of retail operations, not just on the periphery. CIO’s need to look for an IT services provider with experience in moving from legacy systems to best-in-class platforms capable of seamlessly ingesting data and creating powerful, unified information models.</p>
<p>Putting business data at the core gives workers a real-time window on performance. It also makes it more straightforward to pull information in from retail stores across the sales network, warehouses, and coordinate with delivery providers.</p>
<h2>Omni-channel agility</h2>
<p>Operationally, retail in the cloud can provide big gains in inventory management. Stock queries are just a quick API call away, and alerts can be sent efficiently to branches to facilitate customers wishing to collect their goods in-store. Having a unified, single source of truth, builds confidence in the data and goes hand in hand with improving supply chain management. In sectors such as fashion and food, retail in the cloud allows operators to be much more responsive – for example, to cater for changing trends or keep track of stock with a limited shelf life.</p>
<p>Physical and online stores offer rich sources of information on shopping habits and give retailers the capacity to deliver more personalized experiences to their customers. Loyalty schemes, particularly in highly competitive sectors such as food retail, can make the difference between being a leader in the industry or falling to the back of the pack. Wiring customer behaviour into the fabric of retail in the cloud, allows firms to do more than just put the right goods into the hands of shoppers.</p>
<p>Data-driven solutions enable retailers to be creative and road-test new ideas, and IT services providers with first-hand experience of helping clients to achieve their ambitions are key partners in the process.</p>
<h2>Value-driven experiences</h2>
<p>Retailers at the top of their game want to provide customers with a superior shopping experience – for example, by integrating a virtual store within a physical retail setting. Wipro – an IT services provider that’s gained deep expertise in the sector through major collaborations with various global brands – notes extra services that can be added on top. Opportunities include bringing past purchase patterns into play to further personalize the interaction for shoppers. And then to make payments as frictionless as possible, technology allows retailers to seamlessly transfer virtual transactions at a kiosk to in-store point-of-sale systems.</p>
<p>Transitioning from a patchwork of legacy systems to retail in the cloud provides a convenient, central ‘plug-in’ point for a wide range of digital products. Retailers can pick from the best of different vendor solutions and rely on the expertise of IT services providers to apply the feature set to the client’s digital operations. Much like the trend for smart cities with a network of sensors providing meaningful inputs, retail is moving to a ‘smart shopping’ model. Here, IT service providers such as Wipro, and others, can bring Internet of Things (IoT) skills into play. IOT is playing a significant role in areas like digital manufacturing where risks associated to supply chain failure are mitigated through predictive maintenance of supply chain assets.</p>
<p>Sensors and other smart endpoints add to the value proposition of retail in the cloud by supporting greater automation of operations as well as adding big data rewards. Digital transformation has the capacity to shift retail into a higher gear and – most importantly – provide C-Suites with powerful tech platforms for achieving growth and cost targets.</p>

The latest is the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-31/department-of-defence-investigating-details-released-in-hack/101599102">hacking of ForceNet</a>, a social media platform used by Australia&#8217;s armed forces, their families, and some contractors.</p>
<p>The ForceNet hack apparently exposed up to 40,000 accounts contained in a data set from 2018. The breach was via a third-party IT service provider that is currently being grilled so the Australian government can &#8220;make sure we&#8217;ve got a full picture of what sort of data was there and available,&#8221; according to Matt Keogh, the minister for veterans&#8217; affairs and defense personnel.</p>
<p>At the end of September, one of Australia&#8217;s big telcos, Optus, informed its customers that up to 10 million people had had their details revealed after it suffered the biggest cyberbreach in the country&#8217;s history. That incident has exposed one in three Australians to the possibility of identity theft or financial fraud and has led to an <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/other-industries/10-per-cent-of-optus-customers-leave-after-cyberattack/news-story/431a0661233a698eb3a6d2bb7c68562c">exodus of customers</a>.</p>

<p>Since then, other Australian household names have also announced that they too have been victims of cybercrime. EnergyAustralia, Woolworths&#8217; MyDeal, and Medibank are just three. According to the latest reports, the Medibank breach exposed over 200GB of data to the attackers.</p>
<h3>Cybersecurity courses for Australian horses</h3>
<p>Australia isn&#8217;t a particularly insecure country in respect of its cybersecurity (or its national character, it has to be said). What&#8217;s different is that companies and organizations have to declare cyberbreaches that affect them and their customers above a nominal level. That mandatory disclosure mechanism makes reporting cybersecurity breaches easier – thus a greater number of press reports – and removes the option for companies simply never to release details of how, when, and to what extent their defenses have been breached.</p>
<p>The Australian government&#8217;s mandatory data breach notification scheme received just over 850 filings last year. In a country with a population of 26 million, that&#8217;s one successful cyberbreach of note per 30,000 population. In the US, with a population of 332 million, that would equate to 11,000 serious breaches per year.</p>
<p>The Australian government is categorizing larger sections of industry as &#8220;critical infrastructure&#8221; (such as food production and transport, for example). Organizations thus classified have to operate under stricter controls on what has to be reported via the government&#8217;s mandatory cyberbreach disclosure scheme. That, too, increases the statistical evidence available for mainstream reporting.</p>
<p>Taken together, these circumstances provide a more accurate explanation of the seeming abundance of successful cybersecurity breaches in Australia.</p>

<h3>Network security when &#8220;network&#8221; means internet</h3>
<p>The difference between Australia and the rest of the world is not that its organizations have no cybersecurity playbook but that they are legislatively bound to release details when they suffer a successful attack. Most companies would prefer not to announce when they have had their data stolen and take measures to keep news of any attacks secret. In Australia, that&#8217;s often not an option.</p>
<p>The decision to hush up any attacks by organizations outside Australia reduces public awareness of the preponderance of successful attacks and removes cybersecurity from the front-of-mind position when company boards allocate IT spending. Consequently, investment in protection is lower than it should be, and attackers will find more low-hanging fruit; targets that could have been protected with relatively trivial expenditure.</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s insistence on at least a degree of openness in cybersecurity matters may do the country&#8217;s &#8220;brand&#8221; some harm. But to a hacker, the internet is just a network of potential victims. Whether an organization&#8217;s physical facilities are in San Francisco or Sydney is irrelevant.</p>

But even in the last couple of days since, there has been a raft of speculation about how the platform is to continue to ensure its financial stability. Rumors are more rife than usual since the takeover and the ensuing departure over the weekend of the company&#8217;s chief executive, chairman, and finance officer will have done little to calm investors&#8217; nerves.</p>
<p>One report in <em>The Verge</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/30/23431931/twitter-paid-verification-elon-musk-blue-monthly-subscription">speculates</a> that the platform plans to alter its $5 per month subscription service, Twitter Blue, into an alleged $20 per month extended &#8220;verified user&#8221; feature. Twitter Blue is the tick mark against individuals&#8217; and companies&#8217; accounts that shows the account owner is kosher.</p>
<p>The new Twitter boss stated on Monday, &#8220;The whole verification process is being revamped right now.&#8221; He also used the platform to deny rumors that he planned to lay off Twitter staff before the start of next month (November) when workers were due to receive company shares as part of their pay. However, <em>The Washington Post</em> has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/31/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs/">reported</a> on weekend meetings at which the first round of redundancies was discussed. Twitter currently employs around 7,500 workers and Musk is thought to want to lose around 75% of them.<br />
<div class="see-also left"><div class="row columns" data-equalizer="left219044"><h3 class="read-next-title">READ NEXT</h3><a href=https://techhq.com/2022/10/legal-tech-engagement-higher-than-ever/><div class="large-12 medium-12 small-4 columns see-also-thumbnail" data-equalizer-watch="left219044"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://cdn2.techhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_2218034677_1440px-150x150.jpg" class="ratiosquare wp-post-image" alt="legal tech" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn2.techhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_2218034677_1440px-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdn1.techhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_2218034677_1440px-361x361.jpg 361w, https://cdn.techhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_2218034677_1440px-160x160.jpg 160w, https://cdn2.techhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_2218034677_1440px-167x167.jpg 167w, https://cdn2.techhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_2218034677_1440px-409x409.jpg 409w, https://cdn.techhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_2218034677_1440px-125x125.jpg 125w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></div><div class="large-12 medium-12 small-8 columns see-also-text" data-equalizer-watch="left219044"><h4>Legal tech engagement higher than ever</h4></div></a></div></div></p>
<p>The Post states that layoffs would likely be across the company, covering sales, marketing, engineering, and HR, with high-earning salespeople slated to receive their marching orders in round two of layoffs to be announced at some time in the future.</p>
<h3>After the Twitter takeover…</h3>
<p>As well as the appointment to the Twitter staff of several long-time Musk collaborators such as legal guru Alex Spiro, Elon Musk now describes himself (at least, on the platform) as the&#8221; Chief Twit.&#8221; One user-facing change made with immediate effect was the re-implementation of the Twitter Explore home page, in place of the sign-up-or-log-in holding page that users have grown accustomed to over recent months.</p>
<p>Perhaps the least surprising financial news since the Twitter takeover is the large spike in the value of DOGECOIN, a cryptocurrency endorsed by Musk and one that&#8217;s being positioned as the Twitter platform&#8217;s medium of exchange. One of the new CEO of Twitter&#8217;s other companies, Tesla, already accepts DOGECOIN as payment on some of its <a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/support/dogecoin">branded merchandise</a>. It&#8217;s not a giant leap to make the assumption that the cryptocurrency created as a joke will now play a role wherever it can in Musk&#8217;s portfolio.</p>
<p>Co-founder of Ethereum and Cardano blockchains Charles Hoskinson Tweeted over the weekend, &#8220;Now that Twitter is in the hands of @elonmusk I can see a real possibility that DOGE will somehow merge with the platform.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now that Twitter is in the hands of <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a> I can see a real possibility that doge will somehow merge with the platform.</p>
<p>&mdash; Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1586044408923033606?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Since the Twitter takeover was completed on October 26, the market value of DOGECOIN rose sharply, nearly doubling in value to $0.119 per coin. It&#8217;s now in the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap of $16.3bn. Investors who bought just before the finalization of the acquisition, or DOGECOIN <em>hodlers</em>, will now likely be in profit – unlike owners of the better-known cryptocurrency assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum that have had prices in the doldrums for nearly eighteen months.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s first dalliance with DOGECOIN began with a Tweet in 2020, &#8220;One Word: Doge,&#8221; and since then, his every mention has led to a surge in market price. Another rumor currently popular on platforms such as Reddit (where fans of DOGECOIN are known to congregate) is the impending decision by Starlink – another of Musk&#8217;s companies – to take DOGECOIN payments for its services.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s financial position is currently relatively sound, with 2021 revenues at $5bn but an operating loss of $493m. In 2021, Musk told prospective investors that he had plans to cut the company&#8217;s payroll by $800m a year. Layoffs and increased fees for verification might be enough to turn the platform&#8217;s financial fortunes into year-on-year profit. Musk&#8217;s buy-out deal involved leveraging a great deal of Tesla stock, tying the two companies&#8217; financial futures together.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things were looking up for the cloud computing market, especially since the pandemic &#8212; with players like AWS, Google and Microsoft recording stellar growth as the whole world moved online. Things however have started to shift in 2022. With economies worldwide in flux, what once was a promising industry now appears to be steeped in uncertainty. Since June, there have been more reports of organizations feeling the acute burden of the spike in cloud spending over the last two years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, the market is down, companies are looking to cut costs, and many are reassessing their cloud spending &#8212; a trend that is reflected in the earnings of the biggest cloud computing players in the industry, including </span><a href="https://techhq.com/2021/12/aws-tech-predictions-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Web Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. For context, a recent report by Wanclouds indicated that </span><a href="https://wanclouds.net/resources/reports/2022_Cloud_Cost_Optimization_Outlook.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">81% of companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were directed by their C-Suite to cut down on cloud spending or incur no additional cloud-related costs in the third quarter of 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breaking this down further, the survey indicates that 39% will aim to maintain their cloud spending at the same level, while 28% intend to cut cloud expenditures marginally, and 14% plan to drastically pull back on cloud expenses. Of those that are planning to cut costs, there is an almost even split between companies that intend to slash the budget by less than 25% and those that prefer a 25% to 50% reduction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, only 10% of companies are looking to marginally increase their cloud spending, and 8% are looking to drastically increase cloud expenditures. This may come as a surprise since cloud computing solutions, based on global business needs, still have a high demand. But the </span><a href="https://techhq.com/2022/05/is-tsmc-considering-another-round-of-price-hike-for-its-chips-blame-the-inflation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rising costs of goods stemming from high inflation and the fears of entering a recession</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have dampened plans to further pursue deeper levels of digital transformations.</span></p>
<h2>How did AWS, Google Cloud and Azure perform?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on Canalys’ second quarter report, the top three cloud vendors are the usual suspects: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, which together accounted for 63% of global spending in 2022 and collectively grew 42%. In fact, up till the second quarter, cloud infrastructure services continued to be in </span><a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-services-Q2-2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high demand </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with worldwide spending increasing 33% year on year to $62.3 billion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the third quarter, the amount of money invested in cloud computing companies began to drop, and a report from venture capital firm Accel showed that in Europe, Israel and the US, spending dropped 42%, indicating an industry in the middle of a &#8220;reset.&#8221; AWS for instance, has seen growth ticking down consistently over the past four quarters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters </span></i><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tech-giants-feel-pain-cloud-spending-cuts-suggest-slowdown-2022-10-28/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, net sales for AWS grew 28% in the July-September period, versus 39% a year earlier, the slowest since the fourth quarter of 2020. They fell short of a 31% average analysts&#8217; forecast. &#8220;The AWS slowdown is a clear sign that businesses are beginning to trim costs, so this will likely put more of a squeeze on Amazon&#8217;s bottom line in the coming quarters,&#8221; said Insider Intelligence principal analyst Andrew Lipsman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Microsoft&#8217;s cloud business Azure, which has supercharged revenue growth at the software giant for years, dropped to 35% in growth for the July-September quarter &#8212; from 50% a year earlier, missing estimates of a 36.5% increase, according to Visible Alpha. Microsoft is projected to see another revenue drop in the holiday quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As opposed to the rest, Alphabet&#8217;s Google Cloud revenue actually <em>grew</em> 38% in the quarter, beating estimates. That is still a far cry from the 45% growth the company posted a year earlier, however. Then there is Intel, which makes chips for data center customers including AWS. Its third-quarter revenue from its data center chip making business slumped 27% and profits were nearly wiped out. According to Intel’s Pat Gelsinger, the business was hurt partly due to soft demand from Chinese enterprise customers.</span></p>
<p>The general trend of slowing cloud infrastructure spending feels like a global adjustment to a post-pandemic model. Concerns like the cost of living and the inflationary spiral in the world&#8217;s supply chains, are being weighed more heavily than additional cloud investment in fiscally challenging times.</p>
