			<description><![CDATA[<p>After a long hiatus, we're back to release this short, breadcrumb episode, number 89, with Dr. Jane Roland Martin on Education and Gender. Dr. Martin has been a prolific author on the philosophy of education, and in this short episode, explains some of her thinking about past figures in that area, who excluded some things that need to be taught to everyone, and considered their narrower visions the right approach to education for boys. Then, when education for girls caught on, they were thought to need the same education that boys received, excluding those things long considered feminine, which all people should learn. </p>]]></description>

Then, in segments two and three, we return to some material we recorded on the Upper West Branch of the Penobscott River in Maine, on a Philosophy Bakes Bread trip we took with Apeiron Expeditions. Our friends in the conversations were Seth Walton, Ben Vockley, and Alex Strong. Alex was our main guide and is the owner of Apeiron Expeditions. The three of them were our guests in</span> <a href= "https://www.philosophersinamerica.com/2018/09/29/078-ep74-outdoor-education/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Episode 75 of the show, titled “Outdoor Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” And, Alex was our guest earlier in</span> <a href= "https://www.philosophersinamerica.com/2018/01/26/061-ep57-philosophy-outdoors/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Episode 57, “Philosophy Outdoors.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” Then, in the final segment of this episode, Anthony and I think back on our second year hosting the show, 2018. We list a bunch of our favorite episodes of the year. Give a listen and check out those episodes!</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen for our “You Tell Me!” questions and for some jokes in one of our concluding segments, called “Philosophunnies.” Reach out to us on Facebook</span> <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">@PhilosophyBakesBread</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">and on Twitter</span> <a href= "http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">@PhilosophyBB</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">; email us at philosophybakesbread@gmail.com; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We are releasing this 69th episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast a little early, as there are a few spots left to join a philosophical canoe trip that Eric Thomas Weber and Anthony Cashio will be holding with Alejandro Strong of <a href= "https://apeironexpeditions.com/">Apeiron Expeditions</a>.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this fifty-ninth episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast, we interview Dr. Annie Davis Weber yet again, this time on the subject of "Finding Peace" with Buddhism. This episode is different and special, as the very first wholly live episode, recorded while on the air live on WRFL Lexington, 88.1 FM in Lexington, Kentucky. The episode aired and was recorded on December 18th, 2017.</p> <p>Dr. Annie Davis Weber earned her doctorate in Higher Education Leadership and Policy at Vanderbilt University and is the Assistant Provost for Strategic Planning and Institutional Effectiveness at the University of Kentucky. In this episode, she is representing only her own point of view. This episode is a follow-up of sorts on Ep0.1 from the "pilot season," titled "Acceptance and Happiness with Stoicism." We talk about Annie's experience learning about and growing from some challenges that arose at the start of Eric and Annie's daughter's life, when Helen suffered a stroke and other medical difficulties. Annie learned a great deal from Buddhism and joined Anthony and Eric in this episode to talk about her experience and the insights that she found most valuable from the Buddhist tradition. We also celebrate the end of our first official season of Philosophy Bakes Bread. </p> <p>Listen for our “You Tell Me!” questions and for some jokes in one of our concluding segments, called “Philosophunnies.” Reach out to us on Facebook <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at <a href="mailto:philosophybakesbread@gmail.com" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">philosophybakesbread@gmail.com</a>; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this fifty-fifth episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast, Anthony and Eric talk about “Evaluating Public Philosophy,” in an episode based upon their recently co-authored paper, titled “Lessons Learned Baking Bread.” In this episode and in our paper, Anthony and Eric propose four criteria by which public philosophy can be evaluated: substance, accessibility, invitingness, and community building.</p> <p>Anthony and Eric presented this paper in the summer of 2017 at the Future of Philosophical Practice conference at UNC Asheville, in the beautiful hills of Asheville, North Carolina. We are grateful to Brian Butler for hosting a great event there, as well as for all the great feedback that we received at the event. In fact, that is where we met and interviewed Cole Nasrallah, our guest from episode 36, “<a href= "https://www.philosophersinamerica.com/2017/08/25/040-ep36-quality-philosophy-for-everyone/">Quality Philosophy for Everyone</a>.” While we were there, we also interviewed John Shook and Randy Auxier for episode 34, on “<a href="https://www.philosophersinamerica.com/2017/08/18/038-ep34-saving-american-culture-in-a-yurt/">Saving American Culture in a Yurt</a>.”</p> <p>Listen for our “You Tell Me!” questions and for some jokes in one of our concluding segments, called “Philosophunnies.” Reach out to us on Facebook <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at <a href="mailto:philosophybakesbread@gmail.com" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">philosophybakesbread@gmail.com</a>; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.

He had been the guest in the very first episode of the show, and in this episode, he turns the tables and grills co-host Dr. Eric Thomas Weber as the guest for the day. The show focuses on Weber's 2013 book, <em>Democracy and Leadership</em>, and then relates Weber's theory of democratic leadership to his work as Executive Director of the Society of Philosophers in America, a.k.a. SOPHIA. </p> <p>Dr. Weber is the author of four books, including most recently <em>Democracy and Leadership</em> (2013) and <em>Uniting Mississippi</em> (2015). In 2015 he was awarded the Mississippi Humanities Council's Humanities Scholar Award in their Public Humanities Awards program. At the University of Mississippi, he was associate professor of public policy leadership from 2007 to 2016. In 2016, he moved to the University of Kentucky, where he is visiting associate professor in the philosophy department. In 2017, SOPHIA was awarded the major prize from the APA and the Philosophy Documentation Center for excellence and innovation in philosophy programs. </p> <p>Listen for our “You Tell Me!” questions and for some jokes in one of our concluding segments, called “Philosophunnies.” Reach out to us on Facebook <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at <a href="mailto:philosophybakesbread@gmail.com" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">philosophybakesbread@gmail.com</a>; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This forty-third episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast is a special new show format, more of a round-table discussion than usual, and with a new theme: The Stories of Our Day. In this first "Stories of Our Day" episode, we're talking about The Game of Thrones! For this discussion, we knew that we wanted to bring Dr. Shane Courtland back on the show, given his specialty in Thomas Hobbes's somewhat bleak philosophy, which has a lot to tell us about the harshness and quasi-realism (if you focus on human beings rather than the dragons) of Game of Thrones. </p> <p>Dr. Courtland was our guest once before, in Episode 8 of the show, on "<a href= "https://www.philosophersinamerica.com/2017/03/05/012-ep8-selfish-ethics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selfish Ethics?</a>" <a href= "http://business.wvu.edu/faculty-staff/directory/profile?pid=192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Courtland</a> is director of the Center for Free Entreprise at Western Virginia University.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This forty-second episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast is a second “breadcrumb” episode with Dr. Larry A. Hickman, who was our featured guest in <a href= "https://www.philosophersinamerica.com/2017/07/05/029-ep25-assessing-assessment/https://www.philosophersinamerica.com/2017/09/17/044-ep40-democracy-and-education-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Episode 40</a>. In that episode, Larry spoke about democracy and education in the United States today. While he was with us, we asked him to comment on a question that we received from a listener earlier this year. Larry, Anthony, and Eric each live or have lived in states that are sometimes prejudged and stigmatized for characteristics you might call "redneck," being significantly rural and agricultural. Jason Fultz had called a few weeks before and asked us to comment on what one can do to overcome stigma for your state. So, we played his question and asked Larry what he thought. Then, we all thought about it and a few answers emerged that may prove helpful for "Overcoming Redneck State Stigma."</p> <p>We especially want to thank Jason for calling in and leaving us a great voicemail and question. Of course, we're grateful to Larry also, who is the former Director of the Center for Dewey Studies at Southern Illinois University and who is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy there. It is worth noting also in particular that Larry brought up progress that the state of Mississippi has made especially given the leadership and example that the University of Mississippi, affectionately called Ole Miss, has offered for the state. He also kindly mentioned Eric's book on leadership and higher education in Mississippi, <a href="http://amzn.to/2xBDAha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Uniting Mississippi: Democracy and Leadership in the South</em></a>.  </p> <p>As always, you can reach out to us on Facebook <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at <a href="mailto:philosophybakesbread@gmail.com" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">philosophybakesbread@gmail.com</a>; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.

Of course, we're grateful to Larry also, who is the former Director of the Center for Dewey Studies at Southern Illinois University and who is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy there. It is worth noting also in particular that Larry brought up progress that the state of Mississippi has made especially given the leadership and example that the University of Mississippi, affectionately called Ole Miss, has offered for the state. He also kindly mentioned Eric's book on leadership and higher education in Mississippi, <a href="http://amzn.to/2xBDAha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Uniting Mississippi: Democracy and Leadership in the South</em></a>.  </p> <p>As always, you can reach out to us on Facebook <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at <a href="mailto:philosophybakesbread@gmail.com" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">philosophybakesbread@gmail.com</a>; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.

In that episode, Larry raised a question for listeners for which he said he has an answer: "What's the meaning of life?" </p> <p>It's the age-old question, the stereotypical philosophical question, yet Larry believes that there can be serious, meaningful answers to it. And, he said that he has one! We want to know our listeners thoughts, of course. At the same time, we couldn't resist and had to hear Larry's answer to the question of the meaning of life.

Caltagiarone has charted his own course, given that there are not many resources designed for helping people to teach philosophy at that level. His story is inspired and inspiring, and can offer guidance for other high school teachers interested in trying their hands at teaching philosophy to high schoolers.</p> <p>Listen for our “You Tell Me!” questions and for some jokes in one of our concluding segments, called “Philosophunnies.” Reach out to us on Facebook <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at <a href= "mailto:philosophybakesbread@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">philosophybakesbread@gmail.com</a>; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.

We may occasionally also record short Breadcrumb episode to have a little more time for a proper "You Tell Me" segment, in which we get to reply substantively to listener feedback. This first Breadcrumb includes questions that Dr. Anthony Cashio really wanted to add after our interview with <a href= "https://phil.washington.edu/people/jana-mohr-lone" target= "_blank">Dr. Jana Mohr Lone</a>, especially about how one can get started teaching philosophy to children. </p> <p>Recall that Dr. Lone is the Director and founder of the University of Washington's <a title= "University of Washington's Center for Philosophy for Children" href="http://depts.washington.edu/nwcenter/" target="_blank">Center for Philosophy for Children</a>.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This first episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast features an interview with Dr. Anthony Cashio of the University of Virginia at Wise, on the topic of the relevance of Plato's Cave today, in the time when "there are no facts," we've been told. The audio quality gets better in the first several episodes, and starts here with not the best online voice quality. Subsequent episodes get much better in quality, but if you bear with us, you can still enjoy a fun conversation with a lively philosopher who after Episode 1 serves as co-host for the show. Listen for our "You Tell Me!" questions and for some jokes in one of our concluding segments, called "Philosophunnies."

The address was delivered in the Old Capitol Building in Jackson, MS, on Friday, February 13, 2015. NOTE: This recording was made with my cellphone in my suit jacket. Consequently, there are clothing-noises and odd sounds related to a bit of an awkward way of recording the speech. You can hear most everything well enough. I thought I should explain, however. My future podcasts will likely be made on a great mic that I now have and that I can use when I'm not giving a formal address at a public function of this kind. </p>]]></description>
