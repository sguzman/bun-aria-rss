Today I decided to debunk Youtube's various body language 'expert' channels, who say they're providing their expert analysis on non-verbal communication, but it's all based on opinion, conjecture and pseudoscience. I explain how, and why, and how this is all based on debunked science that could even affect us all in the court system and at border control, and in the future, even with the use of AI deception detection for job screenings and even in classrooms.

Well this time I decided to investigate the Manosphere. The cult mentality of Red Pill think, how they monetise it, the narrative they are selling to their followers, and how this can result in some young men being funnelled into the alt-right pipeline.

I looked into influencers like Fresh and Fit, Kevin Samuels, Rich Cooper, Anthony Dream Johnson of the 21 Convention, Donovan Sharpe, Roosh V, Owen Cook and Julien Blanc to weave together how they are selling the ‘alpha male’ dream to their followers - some of whom will end up classing themselves as incels, after realising that the ‘foolproof’ pickup artist game techniques don’t work for them.

And they’re all having their misogynistic ideas backed up by the one and only Jordan B Peterson, of course.

In today’s video I’m looking into all the hype surrounding Web3, blockchain technology, NFTs, and trying to work out WHY this is all happening. The Folding Ideas video ‘Line Goes Up’ came out as I was researching this, and I found that even though we had come to the same conclusion on many aspects of this, I actually came to a different conclusion as to why I think this is all happening - and it’s much more dystopian than most people think. This technology is dangerous and could ruin people’s lives in more ways than just losing out on their investments when the bubble deflates or pops. I have found that many people on the left don’t like this technology but they’re not quite sure why - so my video focusses more on how Bitcoin in particular has strong ties to far-right extremism which was birthed out of the Great Depression in the 1930s, and how the extremely libertarian &amp; conservative Ethereum founder, Peter Thiel, wants to harvest data for the purposes of governing society with rigid code, and he’s getting Jordan Peterson to help.

Hello again, today we are looking at the huge amounts of copium taken every day by conservatives in the UK &amp; the US as they talk about climate change. This includes denying it exists, denying it is caused by humans, and denying government regulation will fix anything.

We will be tearing apart a terrible Ben Shapiro take, looking at the UK's Tory pundits and analysing the way Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain have been approaching the issue by blocking streets in protest and generally holding street parties that look like Burning Man. 

I'll also be critising the way the media has been participating in false balance by platforming denial, and pushing the blame onto the consumer with 'carbon footprint' propaganda, all of it funded by right-wing libertarian think-tanks, and the Koch Brothers among other oil barons, of course.

And then, we shall be asking, well, how do we fix this? Is there a solution? Has neoliberalism doomed us all, or is there hope? Does Jeffrey Bezos have the answer?

Today we're looking at Gary Vee - analysing how he runs his business, makes his money and separates himself from all the 'fake gurus' out there. But is he as legit as he likes to try and make out...?

Copy to stroke the YT algo under its chinny chin chin like a little kitten:

Gary Vaynerchuk has always been one of those entrepreneur guru type figures on social media, constantly pumping out endless content on TikTok, Instagram, Youtube and Facebook to the younger generations with motivational content for young business wannabes needing inspiration. He's also used the fact that he was an early investor in Facebook and Twitter to market himself as some sort of genius of the digital age. He has also made a couple of accurate predictions, such as Joe Rogan moving to Spotify. But his predictions aren't always correct.

But he's managed to skirt the same reputation as the likes of Tai Lopez and his ilk of 'contrepreneurs' by not directly and aggressively pushing an expensive course or event. He seems to be very concerned about separating himself from these people, and he makes his money in many other subtle ways, which I discuss in this video. This includes angel investing, in which he can get himself generous equity deals from startups just by simply being Gary Vee. 

He also likely gets a huge chunk, if not most of his income through keynote speeches. He will get paid allegedly up to around $200,000 for a 1 hour keynote. However he doesn't seem to have much of a moral compass around who he makes keynote speeches for. For instance, he has accepted money to make keynote speeches at MLM events and at Success Resources events, at which he gets paid to be the bait to lure people to sit infront of 8 hours of speeches from get rich quick gurus, so his fans who have come to see him get suckered into paying grifters up to $10,000 to become a 'millionaire'.

Gary also runs Vaynermedia, which is a marketing agency that targets millennials and Gen Z. Billionaires will invest in this company to ensure it stays afloat because they believe Gary Vaynerchuk is the marketing gateway to the youth because he has positioned himself as this on social media. Gary seems to be underpaying his young workers at Vaynermedia however, and there are plently of accusations of a poor workplace environment there, unpaid overtime and a toxic hustle culture. 

Gary's message also includes advocating for toxic, over the top work ethic and constantly insinuates that hustling hard is the only thing that matters for getting rich. He also reckons being born poor or in an ethnic minority or being an immigrant or being African American is actually a privilege, because it makes you 'tougher', and that capitalism will rise you up if you're tough enough and just work hard enough.

(UK) The Gordon Moody Association: 01384 241292 or help@gordonmoody.org.uk

Today I'm questioning whether those Twitch crypto gambling streams are &quot;scams&quot; as many are suggesting, and how the companies (Roobet, Stake etc) involved with these sponsored streams are involved, via their Curacao casino gaming licenses, with a world of money laundering and the drug trade - culminating in events which have rocked the small island of Curacao, a country which has suffered from policital corruption via gambling interests for the past decade.

In this video I am investigating the history behind the UK's conservative and reactionary tabloid industry and how it's successfully promoting racist and misogynistic viewpoints along with the &quot;anti-woke&quot; agenda, and how this ended up with a country-wide hatred of Meghan Markle, leading to her and Prince Harry bolting to America.

   <media:description>There's a bit of a dodgy cut at 59 mins due to a manual copyright claim after my video went live, so it's had to be trimmed out in the youtube studio.

Hello, it's great to be back with my analysis of the Markle Debacle. It feels like it's taken me a million years to rummage through every single article &amp; video to figure out what happened, but we're here, baby!! This video is going to be focussed on how the tabloids, in my opinion, basically manipulated an entire country (and people in other countries too) to believe a certain narrative for profit, and for the next video in this series I'm going to be analysing the Oprah interview, picking apart the alleged lies they told and the fall-out following, plus more overall analysis of the tabloid industry's relationship with the Royal Family and its women, and women in general - and the social media conspiracy theories about Meghan's pregnancies, and Archie and Lilibet being either fake dolls or born by surrogates, plus loads of other CRAY CRAY stuff like that. It is a journey. Join me on it.
