I AM ATHLETE | SEASON 3 - Episode 52
Reggie Bush joins Brandon Marshall, Adam "Pacman" Jones, and LeSean "Shady" McCoy and in episode 52 of I Am Athlete. Reggie opens up about the depression he battled early in his NFL career because of the NCAA probe he and the USC Trojans faced because of claims he and his family profited from his collegiate career. Bush hopes a recent multi-million settlement the NCAA paid to his former position coach will help clear his name, and potentially lead to the Heisman Trophy taken away from him being returned.

I AM ATHLETE | SEASON 3 - Episode 52
Reggie Bush joins Brandon Marshall, Adam &quot;Pacman&quot; Jones, and LeSean &quot;Shady&quot; McCoy and in episode 52 of I Am Athlete. Reggie opens up about the depression he battled early in his NFL career because of the NCAA probe he and the USC Trojans faced because of claims he and his family profited from his collegiate career. Bush hopes a recent multi-million settlement the NCAA paid to his former position coach will help clear his name, and potentially lead to the Heisman Trophy taken away from him being returned.

      <description><![CDATA[IAA Tonight got the chance to chop it up with freshly married Rams HC Sean McVay who had a well known player crash his wedding. Shoutout to Pacman's son, 14-year-old Chris Henry Jr., who has received an offer from Ohio State & has heard from Texas and other major programs. Pacman has adopted all of Chris Henry Sr.'s children and they are all doing extremely well. Plus, the latest in the Deshaun Watson saga as more news has come out. What role did the Texans play in all of this? Is this Carson Wentz's last chance at a starting job in the NFL with the Commanders?

      <title>I AM ATHLETE | CHRIS JOHNSON Talks Near Death Experience, Embracing Culture &amp; Life After NFL</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I AM ATHLETE | Season 3: Episode 24

Former NFL running back Chris Johnson joins "I AM ATHLETE" with Brandon Marshall, Chad "Ochocinco" Johnson and Omar Kelly. Chris opens up about embracing his culture while in the NFL, his historic 2000+ yard season and the drive-by shooting that nearly ended his career in 2015. 

Chris walks us through the moments leading up to the drive-by shooting that left he and a friend wounded and another dead. After the shooting Chris experienced nerve issues in his hand and struggled with effective rehab solutions. Because of this he feared his injury would lead to the end of his career but ultimately he got the care he needed to recover and continue his NFL career.

Former NFL running back Chris Johnson joins &quot;I AM ATHLETE&quot; with Brandon Marshall, Chad &quot;Ochocinco&quot; Johnson and Omar Kelly. Chris opens up about embracing his culture while in the NFL, his historic 2000+ yard season and the drive-by shooting that nearly ended his career in 2015. 

Chris walks us through the moments leading up to the drive-by shooting that left he and a friend wounded and another dead. After the shooting Chris experienced nerve issues in his hand and struggled with effective rehab solutions. Because of this he feared his injury would lead to the end of his career but ultimately he got the care he needed to recover and continue his NFL career.

      <title>I AM BLACK | MICHAEL BENNETT on Celebrating The Beauty And Resiliency of The African Diaspora</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I AM BLACK | Season 2: Episode 3

Athlete, activist, author, and former NFL player, Michael Bennett, along with Athletes for Impact celebrate the beauty and resiliency of the African Diaspora with family and friends. The beginning of the event started out with greetings, connecting and a whole lot of food hosted by African Chop House.

Michael Bennett gives a warm welcome to the audience and explains why he’s doing this event, and the main focus of it. “So this is a great opportunity to not focus on the victimization of it but focus on how we’re building…”.Guerline M. Jozef, President of the Haitian Bridge Alliance started off the panel by focusing on what’s happening down at the Mexican border. She starts to become emotional when explaining how the Haitians who made the journey from Brazil to the United States were being whipped by white people on the back of horses. She explains how the people are just trying to escape their internal crisis by seeking refuge through the United States.  

A woman in the crowd speaks up and asks the group “What are the plans to teach us how to  fish?” when referring to the analogy of giving a man a fish. The Co-Founder of ‘Black Lives Matter’, Patrisse Cullors and the Founder of Alaffia, Olowo n’djo Tchala both respond to the woman. Patrisse explains how the black community needs to create things that are self-sustaining, and that can be reused, shared but also taken care of over time by other black people. She refers to using black farmers as a way to teach people how to take care of a water source over long periods of time. Olowo explains how he would set people up in the right situations for success if he can. He can teach his students what to do and how to do it, but ultimately it is up to them whether or not they try and get a job and perform the task at hand.

Michael ends the panel by thanking everyone for showing up and thanking the hosts for the conversations that were made.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE: BRIAN FLORES | We Can&apos;t Be Silenced</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I AM ATHLETE | Season 3: Episode 20

Brandon Marshall, Chad Johnson and Omar Kelly welcome former head coach of the Miami Dolphins, Brian Flores. Tune in as they discuss his recent firing, lawsuit against the NFL and what the NFL and ownership needs to do to improve the status of minority leadership hires. 

The show opens up with the cast all giving their best shot at defining the "Patriots Way" and how the organization has been able to be so successful over the years. After spending time as an assistant coach with the Patriots, Brian Flores shares that he's learned alot under Bill Belichick but they both still take a different approach to coaching. 

The conversation shifts to Brian's recent firing after 3 seasons with Miami and how it came as a surprise to most of the world after he started the season off at 1-7 but ended it with a 9-8 record. Flores shares that he believes his firing was racially driven and how his open lawsuit against the NFL will help minority coaches in the future. Flores also shares his thoughts on ways that the NFL can implement changes right away that can benefit coaches in similar situations in the future. 

Brandon wraps the episode up by asking Brian, who is the X and who is the Z. As Brandon and Chad battle it out, Omar shares his thoughts to help move the conversation along. Omar shares that they both are talented receivers in their own ways but he has to go with Chad as the X.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE: J.R. Smith Talks NBA Future, Community and Being Misunderstood</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I AM ATHLETE | Season 3: Episode 19

Brandon Marshall and D.J. Williams welcome J.R. Smith and Antoine Walker to the show as they discuss basketball, HBCU’s, what really happened in the 2018 NBA Finals and much more.

The show opens up with J.R. talking about his time in Denver and what it was like playing with Carmelo Anthony and company. Antoine goes on to talk about the similarities between him and J.R. when it came to how they played the game. Antoine felt judged when playing for the Boston Celtics because of the way he celebrated and showboated around the court. He explains how people looked at him differently because of that and understands the weight J.R. felt from the public eye because he chose to do things differently when he played.

Brandon brings up HBCUs and asks J.R. to explain his thoughts on the topic. J.R. begins by saying how he went to a high school that was predominately white and explains that he never felt as if he was accepted and belonged. He goes on by saying how much he admires Deion Sanders and what he is doing at Jackson State. He explains how there needs to be more Brandon Marshall’s and D.J. Williams’ going to HBCUs to play football in order to see a change in popularity. 

The conversation shifts to the 2018 NBA Finals as Brandon asks what really happened during the infamous moment when J.R. chose to hold the ball with seconds left in their tied game with the Golden State Warriors. He talks about the miscommunication between the team which ultimately led to that mistake. He opens up to talk about the struggles he faced mentally after that game with the world putting all the blame on him for what happened. He says, “That’s not my legacy…not if I have something to do with it.” He explains how the world gives you labels and creates your identity for you, when referring to his nickname of ‘Henny God’. He says, “I don’t even drink Hennessy.” He explains how he feels he’s been misrepresented but has finally come to peace with what happened back in 2018.

Brandon Marshall and D.J. Williams welcome J.R. Smith and Antoine Walker to the show as they discuss basketball, HBCU’s, what really happened in the 2018 NBA Finals and much more.

The show opens up with J.R. talking about his time in Denver and what it was like playing with Carmelo Anthony and company. Antoine goes on to talk about the similarities between him and J.R. when it came to how they played the game. Antoine felt judged when playing for the Boston Celtics because of the way he celebrated and showboated around the court. He explains how people looked at him differently because of that and understands the weight J.R. felt from the public eye because he chose to do things differently when he played.

Brandon brings up HBCUs and asks J.R. to explain his thoughts on the topic. J.R. begins by saying how he went to a high school that was predominately white and explains that he never felt as if he was accepted and belonged. He goes on by saying how much he admires Deion Sanders and what he is doing at Jackson State. He explains how there needs to be more Brandon Marshall’s and D.J. Williams’ going to HBCUs to play football in order to see a change in popularity. 

The conversation shifts to the 2018 NBA Finals as Brandon asks what really happened during the infamous moment when J.R. chose to hold the ball with seconds left in their tied game with the Golden State Warriors. He talks about the miscommunication between the team which ultimately led to that mistake. He opens up to talk about the struggles he faced mentally after that game with the world putting all the blame on him for what happened. He says, “That’s not my legacy…not if I have something to do with it.” He explains how the world gives you labels and creates your identity for you, when referring to his nickname of ‘Henny God’. He says, “I don’t even drink Hennessy.” He explains how he feels he’s been misrepresented but has finally come to peace with what happened back in 2018.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE: Brandon Marshall and Chad Johnson Sit With NFL Draft Prospects Chris Olave, Zamir White &amp; David Bell</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I AM ATHLETE | Season 3: Episode 18

Brandon Marshall and Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson welcome Chris Olave, Zamir White and David Bell to the show as they dive into the pre-draft process, future goals as well as hardships that they overcame that helped them grow as individuals.

Brandon starts off by asking each guy what their pre-draft process looks like and some of the challenges that have come with it. David Bell explains how he needs to stay true to himself and follow his own path as he prepares for the draft. He talks about the differences between the level of focus here compared to the college level. He’s watching his diet more than ever because of the amount of money on the line. Chris Olave explains how there are some days you don’t want to get out of bed, but those end up being the best days for training. He admits to not having the best eating habits at the college level. Chad immediately backs Chris’ statement by explaining how what he has eaten has not affected his skill set or the level of production that he’s put on the field. Brandon shifts the conversation and asks Zamir about winning the national championship just a couple weeks ago. Zamir explains how “huge” it was to win that game after all the work he and his teammates put in through the off-season. 

Chad asks the group what their future goals are for themselves as they prepare for the NFL. David explains how his short term individual goal is to win Rookie of the Year, while his team goal is to better their record compared to the previous year. Chris explains how he’s “all about the team” and talks about making the team better and winning as many games as possible. Zamir explains how he wants to “grind it out” and put the team and coaches first. Brandon jokes around saying “did they prep y’all to say that?” as their answers were very centered around the team. 

The conversation takes a turn to hardships, as David explains losing a friend back in high school to gun violence. He talks about the effect that had on his school and all the students and staff. Brandon asks if there is anything he is focused on when it comes to gun violence. David wants to open a boys and girls club one day to help keep kids off the streets from an early age. Chris talks about how he slipped on a route during one of the biggest games of his career and the ball ended up getting intercepted by a Clemson player. He felt as if he was the reason for that loss. Zamir talks about how his toughest moment started from birth, having to overcome being “different” due to being born with a cleft lip, cleft palate and a leaky kidney. Brandon circles back around with the group to talk about overcoming these hardships and learning how to process them, and not let them haunt you for years until after you’re out of the league.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE: Bun B, Arian Foster, Kendrick Perkins &amp; Lil’ Keke Talk Tom Brady, Lebron James &amp; Music</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I AM ATHLETE | Season 3: Episode 17

Brandon Marshall and D.J. Williams welcome Bun B, Arian Foster, Kendrick Perkins and Lil’ Keke to the show as they discuss Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers, as well as the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to the music industry. 

Arian Foster opens up saying he believes Barry Sanders is the G.O.A.T when it comes to the NFL. The group immediately responds with their opinions starting out with D.J. explaining how Tom Brady is an absolute leader and has the seven rings to back him up. Bun B jokes around and says that D.J. has no idea what kind of battery he is putting in Keke’s back right now since Lil’ Keke is a big Tom Brady fanatic. He says “You’re the energizer bunny right now.” 

Brandon asks the group which musical artist is most similar to Tom Brady, as well as Aaron Rodgers. Bun B explains how Tom Brady is most related to Jay Z, while Aaron Rodgers is most similar to Naz. He explains how most new quarterbacks inspire to be Tom Brady, similar to rapper inspiring to be Jay Z. He says Aaron Rodgers is most similar to Naz because he doesn’t love the spotlight and then he goes back in the shadows when he’s off the field. 

Bun B shifts the conversation forward and talks about how easy it is nowadays to get your music to the consumers. He explains how Jay Z used the rap to perpetuate other business details that made him a billionaire. The same thing happened to P Diddy. Bun B says that most people would rather be famous, than be rich. Brandon laughs and says that they might need to break down this show and turn it into a Part 2.

I AM NASCAR | SEASON 2: EPISODE 15

Brandon Marshall, Channing Crowder and Dion "Rocko" Williams sit down with American professional stock car racing driver and Corey Lajoie. Corey and the cast discusses mental health 

Brandon starts the episode by asking what it was like to be good friends with Bubba Wallace, Denny Hamlin, Joey Logono and watch them blossom and become successful drivers without him. 

Corey talks about how he went from signing a 5 year deal with Richard Petty Motor Sports to not having anything.  Corey tells a story of how he made a tough career decision after being offered a Crew Chief position but turning it down because he still believed in himself and wanted to live the dream and race. 

Corey mentions how mental health played a role early in his career and how he started seeing a sports phycologist after his first 7 weeks of competing on the biggest stage of his life. He tells the cast the story of  how the motto "Stacking Pennies" came to life and how he used it to recover from one of the lowest moments of his life.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE: Antonio Brown on Mental Health, NFL Future, Tom Brady and More</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I AM ATHLETE | Season 3: Episode 16

Brandon Marshall, Jared Odrick and Nick “Swaggy P” Young connect with former Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Antonio “AB” Brown in episode 16 of I Am Athlete. AB is currently at the center of the conversation after he was released by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for taking his jersey off and running off the field mid-game vs the New York Jets at Met Life Stadium. Brandon and Jared travel across the country from Miami to L.A. to sit down with AB in efforts to find out if AB’s actions were reactionary or responsive. 

Antonio sits down with the I Am Athlete crew in a Kumbaya session to answer questions surrounding the week 17, 3rd quarter incident vs the Jets. AB walks the crew through what led up to the moment on the sideline where he made the decision to strip off his shoulder pads, shirt and gloves and throw them into the crowd before running into the locker room as he flashed a peace sign. AB emphasizes that coach Bruce Arians tried to get him to play while he was injured, and that Arians then told him to get the F--- out after brown pleaded with him that he couldn’t play. 

Brandon shares how he would have handled the situation with head coach Bruce Arians and then asks Antonio if he thinks he could have handled his situation in differently. AB explains that he doesn’t regret the way that he handled the moment at MetLife Stadium and explains that there isn’t anything wrong with his mental health and that he refuses to compromise his integrity. AB brings mental health into the center of the discussion after he questions how do NFL players maintain their mental health while still protecting and keeping their integrity? 

Moving the conversation along, AB reveals that his relationship with Tom Brady is still intact and that he believes Brady is a great leader and that he is one of the best in NFL. Brandon asks AB what quarterbacks he thinks is next in line behind Brady. AB responds that he believes Lamar Jackson is the next greatest NFL quarterback and that everyone needs to give him his flowers now.

Wrapping things up, the group decides to give out “flowers” to those that have made an impact in their lives or others. Brandon, Jared and Swaggy end the episode by sharing that the I Am Athlete family is rooting for him and wishes him the best.

Brandon Marshall, Jared Odrick and Nick “Swaggy P” Young connect with former Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Antonio “AB” Brown in episode 16 of I Am Athlete. AB is currently at the center of the conversation after he was released by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for taking his jersey off and running off the field mid-game vs the New York Jets at Met Life Stadium. Brandon and Jared travel across the country from Miami to L.A. to sit down with AB in efforts to find out if AB’s actions were reactionary or responsive. 

Antonio sits down with the I Am Athlete crew in a Kumbaya session to answer questions surrounding the week 17, 3rd quarter incident vs the Jets. AB walks the crew through what led up to the moment on the sideline where he made the decision to strip off his shoulder pads, shirt and gloves and throw them into the crowd before running into the locker room as he flashed a peace sign. AB emphasizes that coach Bruce Arians tried to get him to play while he was injured, and that Arians then told him to get the F--- out after brown pleaded with him that he couldn’t play. 

Brandon shares how he would have handled the situation with head coach Bruce Arians and then asks Antonio if he thinks he could have handled his situation in differently. AB explains that he doesn’t regret the way that he handled the moment at MetLife Stadium and explains that there isn’t anything wrong with his mental health and that he refuses to compromise his integrity. AB brings mental health into the center of the discussion after he questions how do NFL players maintain their mental health while still protecting and keeping their integrity? 

Moving the conversation along, AB reveals that his relationship with Tom Brady is still intact and that he believes Brady is a great leader and that he is one of the best in NFL. Brandon asks AB what quarterbacks he thinks is next in line behind Brady.

      <title>I AM NASCAR: DANIEL HEMRIC on Defining Moments</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I AM NASCAR | SEASON 2: EPISODE 14

Brandon Marshall, Channing Crowder and Dion "Rocko" Williams sit down with American professional stock car driver and the 2021 NASCAR Xfinity Series Champion Daniel Hemric in Episode 14 of I Am Nascar. Daniel walks the crew through his career path that birthed from the struggles of seeing his family barley make ends meet and put food on the table for him. 

Daniel, Brandon and Channing begin this episode with sharing key defining moments in their career that help them propel their careers to another level. Daniel shares his defining moment of competing in over 150 races total while racing 3-4 times in one week all while working on his own car. Channing jumps in and shares that his defining moment was when an orthopedic doctor told him he shouldn't play football anymore after a knee injury. He used that moment to stand his ground and refuse the doctors diagnosis and seek a second opinion.  

Daniel Shares a story of how he won $250,000 in his first major race and how he had no gas in his 95 Honda Civic to return home after the race and how he had to suck gas from his race car and out into his Honda civic just to return home. 

Brandon pushes the conversation forward to how Daniel became the 2021 Xfinity Series title champion. Daniel tells a detail story to how he used a last lap, overtime pass of Cindric at the season finale at Phoenix Raceway to not only win the first race of his NASCAR career, but also the 2021 Xfinity Series title. Daniel goes on to explain how that one race defined his entire life. 

Wrapping things up Daniel recaps his journey and encourages others to never give up and continuing to fight.

I AM ATHLETE Miami | Season 3: Episode 14

Brandon Marshall, Chad Johnson, D.J. Williams and Omar Kelly welcome 2x Super Bowl Champion, Lesean Mccoy to episode 14 of I AM ATHLETE Podcast. The group discusses a range of topics that ultimately lead to the controversial subject about Antonio Brown and the situation that led him to taking his pads off and leaving the field during a live game.

The cast start the show by bringing up the topic of women, and why they choose to go down the plastic surgery route when it comes to beauty. 

The conversation begins to take a turn from Antonio Brown to Tom Brady. Lesean explains how he believes Tom is the greatest football player to ever play, stating that he was a complete competitor and knew how to make an entire team better. Lesean says how he has never seen someone prepare the way Tom has. 

Brandon talks about the Antonio Brown situation and says he needs to get some help in order to learn how to become emotionally intelligent. He relates this back to when he was a young player and didn’t know how to control his emotions which put a target on his back when it came to the league and the media. He really hopes that Antonio can figure out how to properly handle these situations, even if he is right in the conflict.

      <title>I AM NASCAR: Female Pit Crew Members Making Their Mark</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WATCH MORE → https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70YdJ...

I AM NASCAR | SEASON 2: EPISODE 12

Dalanda Ouendeno, Breanna O’leary and Brehanna Daniels join Brandon Marshall, Channing Crowder and Dion “Rocko” Williams on this week’s episode of I Am Nascar. These women are  the first wave of female pit crew members in Nascar. Channing opens up the conversation by asking the women if it took time for the men in the pit crew to get adjusted to seeing women do the job beside them. Breanna answers by saying that she always looked at herself as a pit crew member since the beginning. She wanted to seize the opportunity that was presented to her. She realized that organizations can’t grow when there is no diversity and inclusion. Brehanna adds that without the help of the Nascar Drive for Diversity Program, they wouldn’t be in this position. 

The women begin to tell their individual stories on how they were introduced into the sport and how they became a part of the pit crew. Brehanna talks about the tryout and mentioned how Breanna was also there with her. She explains how they were the only girls that were focused during the tryout, and Brehanna knew they had a shot at the job because of that. There were more than twenty girls at the try out, and only ten were going to get picked to come back. After the tryout, Brehanna was heading home on a plane and received a call from the coach. The coach explained how he really shouldn’t be telling her this news right now but couldn’t wait while extending the invitation for her to come back and be a professional pit crew member.

Brehanna shifts the conversation to talk about the fellow men that she works with in the pit crew. She says the “guys be hating”. She continues to say that a lot of the guys can’t stand that they can do the job just as good as they can. Brandon asks Dalanda why she ended up picking West Virginia to play soccer with all the different offers she had on the table. Dalanda says how big their soccer program is and they had top of the line facilities. Dalanda ended up transferring to Miami because she felt it was time to try it out. 

Channing asks if the male pit crew members get jealous when the cameras are on the female pit crew members. Brehanna quickly answers and talks about how common it is for them to get jealous. Breanna mentions that “we didn’t ask for this”, referring to the cameras and the attention that the media brings. Breanna explains how difficult it is for them just trying to find a bathroom. She explains how they usually just “hold it” until the end of the race because it is very difficult with their suits. The group starts to laugh together at this while Brehanna explains how disgusting the porter potties are and what she will typically see in the morning if she decides to use one.

Brehanna talks about how she lost her mom to breast cancer when she was in high school. She would spend a lot of time doing her everyday activities around her mom at the house so she can be close to her. While doing her homework one night, she heard a difference in her mom’s breathing and it concerned her. Brehanna ended up hearing her mom take her last breath. She talks about how she uses her mom’s passing as motivation because her mom always believed in her and knew she would do something special in life. Brehanna says her mom’s message to the group would be to keep spreading positivity, you guys are doing a great job. She adds by saying her mom would tell her how proud she is.

I AM NASCAR | SEASON 2: EPISODE 12

Dalanda Ouendeno, Breanna O’leary and Brehanna Daniels join Brandon Marshall, Channing Crowder and Dion “Rocko” Williams on this week’s episode of I Am Nascar. These women are  the first wave of female pit crew members in Nascar. Channing opens up the conversation by asking the women if it took time for the men in the pit crew to get adjusted to seeing women do the job beside them. Breanna answers by saying that she always looked at herself as a pit crew member since the beginning. She wanted to seize the opportunity that was presented to her. She realized that organizations can’t grow when there is no diversity and inclusion. Brehanna adds that without the help of the Nascar Drive for Diversity Program, they wouldn’t be in this position. 

The women begin to tell their individual stories on how they were introduced into the sport and how they became a part of the pit crew. Brehanna talks about the tryout and mentioned how Breanna was also there with her. She explains how they were the only girls that were focused during the tryout, and Brehanna knew they had a shot at the job because of that. There were more than twenty girls at the try out, and only ten were going to get picked to come back. After the tryout, Brehanna was heading home on a plane and received a call from the coach. The coach explained how he really shouldn’t be telling her this news right now but couldn’t wait while extending the invitation for her to come back and be a professional pit crew member.

Brehanna shifts the conversation to talk about the fellow men that she works with in the pit crew. She says the “guys be hating”. She continues to say that a lot of the guys can’t stand that they can do the job just as good as they can. Brandon asks Dalanda why she ended up picking West Virginia to play soccer with all the different offers she had on the table. Dalanda says how big their soccer program is and they had top of the line facilities. Dalanda ended up transferring to Miami because she felt it was time to try it out. 

Channing asks if the male pit crew members get jealous when the cameras are on the female pit crew members. Brehanna quickly answers and talks about how common it is for them to get jealous. Breanna mentions that “we didn’t ask for this”, referring to the cameras and the attention that the media brings. Breanna explains how difficult it is for them just trying to find a bathroom. She explains how they usually just “hold it” until the end of the race because it is very difficult with their suits. The group starts to laugh together at this while Brehanna explains how disgusting the porter potties are and what she will typically see in the morning if she decides to use one.

Brehanna talks about how she lost her mom to breast cancer when she was in high school. She would spend a lot of time doing her everyday activities around her mom at the house so she can be close to her. While doing her homework one night, she heard a difference in her mom’s breathing and it concerned her. Brehanna ended up hearing her mom take her last breath. She talks about how she uses her mom’s passing as motivation because her mom always believed in her and knew she would do something special in life. Brehanna says her mom’s message to the group would be to keep spreading positivity, you guys are doing a great job. She adds by saying her mom would tell her how proud she is.

I AM ATHLETE Miami | Season 3: Episode 13

Brandon Marshall, Chad Johnson, Chantel Tremitiere and D.J. Williams welcome former basketball player and current cannabis entrepreneur Al Harrington to episode 13 of I AM ATHLETE Podcast. Al and the cast discuss everything from Basketball to the stigmas and benefits of cannabis. 

Before the cameras start “recording” Chantel expresses how much she enjoyed Chad’s reaction to his wife’s pregnancy announcement in the new hit Netflix series “Selling Tampa”. She shares that Chad’s raw and organic reaction to the news is what society needs and she wishes that there were more avenues in mainstream media that would present athletes in similar light. 

Brandon starts the show off with business and ask Al to share his story on how his company Viola Brands was born after he retired from the NBA. AL shares a story of how his grandmother’s found relief with cannabis during her battle with glaucoma and diabetes led to him becoming a proponent for the legalization of cannabis. 

The cast go on to share their personal stories of using Marijuana for the first time. D.J shares how as a kid he was embarrassed of his mother and father for their evolvement and usage of cannabis. He also shares that he has since then become a user and advocate for cannabis after seeing the benefits it has over alcohol. 

Al dives deeper into his work with Viola Brands. He shares how cannabis has traditionally been used to hurt the black and brown community for many years. He shares the powerful truths behind the hemp plants and how he plans to use it to build the black and brown community back up with the same plant that was used to break it apart. 

Wrapping things up, the cast talk basketball. Brandon asks Al what’s the biggest difference between Reggie Miller and Steph Curry. Al admits that Steph is the better shooter but if Reggie played in this era he would have made another 1500 three point shots by now. Chantel prompts one of the most controversial questions in this modern era by asking AL who he thinks the all time G.O.A.T is between Michael Jordan and Lebron James.

      <title>I AM NASCAR: Brandon Thompson</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Brandon Thompson joins Brandon Marshall, Channing Crowder and company on this week’s episode of I Am Nascar. He is the Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion with Nascar. The group discusses how most people haven’t been exposed to Nascar and the joys that it brings to people. Brandon Thompson explains “You can hear it, you can feel it, you can taste it”. Brandon Marshall’s uncle is featured on the show as well and he talks about how he balanced watching Brandon play in the NFL and his Nascar races. He talks about how it’s a lot more than just going in circles. Every little factor is important when it comes to racing, he says.

Brandon Marshall talks about how Rowdy became his driver. They took him and his wife Michi up to the pit box for the very first time and showed both of them an amazing time. Uncle Clinton shifts the subject to confederate flags and explains how he never let those flags affect him or who he was with. He chose to enjoy himself despite the company of the flags. Brandon Thompson interrupts and thanks Uncle Clinton for being able to stick it through all of those years despite his feelings for the flag. Sharwyn Greene who is originally from Brooklyn, NY talks about how he first got into the sport. He has always loved cars, and the fact that he can taste and smell the sport, it changed the person he was. He hands his flowers over to Brandon Thompson and compliments him as being a Vice President for Nascar. Sharwyn brings up “The King” and jokes to Channing because he doesn’t know who that is. Channing tries to play it off to the group as they laugh, but he really doesn’t know.

Brandon Marshall brings up the topic of the Next Generation Vehicle, and everyone is eager to discuss their thoughts on it. Uncle Clinton starts off and explains how he wants to be able to see if the crew can hit all their “lugs”  from his 75 inch TV while using his binoculars. The group begins to laugh at the thought of Uncle Clinton wearing binoculars to look at his 75 inch TV. Channing believes the Next Gen will create an even playing field. Sharwyn says his priority with the Next Gen is safety. As long as it can make sure everyone involved is safe and is able to get home, he is all about it. Brandon Thompson explains how people don’t understand how Nascar has actually rocket scientists that work through data and different trials to find the best solution for the Next Gen vehicle. He continues by saying that some teams won’t be able to afford using those scientists as allies for their vehicles. 

Sharwyn says his favorite drivers that he would want on the show would be “The King”, the Wood brothers, Dale Earnhardt Jr., and Kyle Busch. Brandon Marshall explains that they’ve already had Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Sharwyn jokes and says “Yeah, but with me!”.

I AM ATHLETE Miami | Season 3: Episode 12

Brandon Marshall, Chad Johnson, D.J. Williams and Chantel Tremitiere welcome Devin Hester to the show as they find out who really was the best returner in the NFL between him and Pac-Man Jones.

Devin starts out by saying “I’m trying to figure out what numbers he’s looking at?” They start talking through the numbers as a group and learn that Devin has 14 career punt return touchdowns, 5 career kickoff return touchdowns as well as the only player to ever take an opening kickoff in a Super Bowl back for a touchdown. Chantel explains how Pac-Man Jones has 5 punt return touchdowns and 0 kickoff return touchdowns. Devin explains how he was upset to see Brandon and Chad “agree” with Pac-Man by not saying anything when he was on the show.

D.J. begins to explain how throughout his playing career, he has never been in a special teams meeting that talked about game planning against Pac-Man Jones. But he has always game planned for Devin Hester. 

Chad shows up fashionably late to the show and is ecstatic to see Devin. The group informs Chad on what he missed out on. Devin calls him and out and says how he is mad at him, as well as Brandon for not defending his name after Pac-Man said his statement. Chad doesn’t remember him saying that and requests to see a video clip. Devin talks about how his favorite kickoff return touchdown was from the Super Bowl and explains the story behind that. 

The conversation shifts as Brandon asks Devin about a story Devin told about his relationship with Jay Cutler. Devin explains how him and Julius Peppers noticed that Brandon and Jay were arguing before practice and said that he heard Brandon say “I own you. If it weren’t for me there would be no Jay Cutler.” Devin and Julius made a bet to see whether Jay would end up throwing to Brandon in practice. He ended up throwing the ball to Brandon about 20 times. The group starts to joke about getting either Devin, Brandon or Chad to call Jake to find out the truth behind this story. 

Brandon, D.J. and Devin start to talk about their time at the Bears and how they were set up for success but couldn’t figure it out internally. They had all the weapons they needed to win football games but felt disorganized as a team. D.J. said “We had too many great players…but it wasn’t clicking.”

Chad starts to relate to Frank by saying how hard it is to fight for that long in the ring. He can tell Deron has been doing it for a while. Chad believes Frank will be back. D.J. explains how it made him upset see Deron push him to the ground and uppercut him, and how if he was Frank they would need to “black this out.”

I AM ATHLETE Miami | Season 3: Episode 12

Brandon Marshall, Chad Johnson, D.J. Williams and Chantel Tremitiere welcome Devin Hester to the show as they find out who really was the best returner in the NFL between him and Pac-Man Jones.

Devin starts out by saying “I’m trying to figure out what numbers he’s looking at?” They start talking through the numbers as a group and learn that Devin has 14 career punt return touchdowns, 5 career kickoff return touchdowns as well as the only player to ever take an opening kickoff in a Super Bowl back for a touchdown. Chantel explains how Pac-Man Jones has 5 punt return touchdowns and 0 kickoff return touchdowns. Devin explains how he was upset to see Brandon and Chad “agree” with Pac-Man by not saying anything when he was on the show.

D.J. begins to explain how throughout his playing career, he has never been in a special teams meeting that talked about game planning against Pac-Man Jones. But he has always game planned for Devin Hester. 

Chad shows up fashionably late to the show and is ecstatic to see Devin. The group informs Chad on what he missed out on. Devin calls him and out and says how he is mad at him, as well as Brandon for not defending his name after Pac-Man said his statement. Chad doesn’t remember him saying that and requests to see a video clip. Devin talks about how his favorite kickoff return touchdown was from the Super Bowl and explains the story behind that. 

The conversation shifts as Brandon asks Devin about a story Devin told about his relationship with Jay Cutler. Devin explains how him and Julius Peppers noticed that Brandon and Jay were arguing before practice and said that he heard Brandon say “I own you. If it weren’t for me there would be no Jay Cutler.” Devin and Julius made a bet to see whether Jay would end up throwing to Brandon in practice. He ended up throwing the ball to Brandon about 20 times. The group starts to joke about getting either Devin, Brandon or Chad to call Jake to find out the truth behind this story. 

Brandon, D.J. and Devin start to talk about their time at the Bears and how they were set up for success but couldn’t figure it out internally. They had all the weapons they needed to win football games but felt disorganized as a team. D.J. said “We had too many great players…but it wasn’t clicking.” 

Chantel continues to move the conversation by asking why football players try to fight each other when they have helmets on. D.J. answers her questions by explaining the aggression that comes from playing with a passion. He says players fight so much because that’s what the game is built on. Brandon immediately brings up the Deron Williams vs Frank Gore fight that took place.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE TONIGHT with Leger Douzable and More..</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I AM ATHLETE TONIGHT | Season 1: Special

I Am Athlete Tonight is a show hosted by former NFL defensive end Leger Douzable along with co-host Brandon Marshall, Michael Vick and Chantel Tremitiere. This show is focused on everything sports and brings you an inside look at some of the top headlines in sports. 

Kicking things off Leger, Brandon, Michael and Chantel all introduce themselves by sharing three things about themselves before jumping into some of the top trending headlines in sports.

Starting off the cast discuss the struggles of Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Urban Myer after making the jump from collegiate football to the NFL. Brandon questions the cast on what they think the owner of the jaguars should do with Urban. The cast all agree with Chantel when she shares that Urban must be fired. They all go on to individually explain why they believe it’s time for Jacksonville to cut the cord on Urban Myers.  

The cast jumps to the status of Ben “Big Ben” Roethlisberger and discuss if it’s time for Big Ben to hang up his cleats or not. Leger Douzable reminisces and shares personal stories about sacking Big Ben when he and Michael Vick played for the Jets. Vick, chimes in and shares that he believes that Big Ben knows his career is over and he should hang his cleats. Vick goes on to share a personal story to what moments led him to knowing it was time for him to walk away from the game. 

Brandon changes gears as he questions the differences between Big Ben and Seattle Seahawks’ Quarterback Russell Wilson’s predicaments this season. The cast discuss rather or not Russell can be success if he doesn’t have help from his offensive line and other offensive weapons on the field. Brandon questions rather the issues is with Head Coach Pete Carroll and share that he believes that Seattle’s issues start with the teams philosophy and Coach Carroll has to change his ways and adjust to the game. 

Wrapping things up Leger brings up Lebron James and questions the longevity of his game and prompts the cast with the question of how much longer do they think Lebron can last in the NBA? Brandon shares that he looks at athletes the same way he looks at entertainers like Jay-Z. He shares that Jay-s longevity is because he was able to evolve and adjust. Brandon believes that as an athlete you must be able to evolve and Lebron must pass the torch in order to play less and prevent the injuries and the wear and tear on his body.

I Am Athlete Tonight is a show hosted by former NFL defensive end Leger Douzable along with co-host Brandon Marshall, Michael Vick and Chantel Tremitiere. This show is focused on everything sports and brings you an inside look at some of the top headlines in sports. 

Kicking things off Leger, Brandon, Michael and Chantel all introduce themselves by sharing three things about themselves before jumping into some of the top trending headlines in sports.

Starting off the cast discuss the struggles of Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Urban Myer after making the jump from collegiate football to the NFL. Brandon questions the cast on what they think the owner of the jaguars should do with Urban. The cast all agree with Chantel when she shares that Urban must be fired. They all go on to individually explain why they believe it’s time for Jacksonville to cut the cord on Urban Myers.  

The cast jumps to the status of Ben “Big Ben” Roethlisberger and discuss if it’s time for Big Ben to hang up his cleats or not. Leger Douzable reminisces and shares personal stories about sacking Big Ben when he and Michael Vick played for the Jets. Vick, chimes in and shares that he believes that Big Ben knows his career is over and he should hang his cleats. Vick goes on to share a personal story to what moments led him to knowing it was time for him to walk away from the game. 

Brandon changes gears as he questions the differences between Big Ben and Seattle Seahawks’ Quarterback Russell Wilson’s predicaments this season. The cast discuss rather or not Russell can be success if he doesn’t have help from his offensive line and other offensive weapons on the field. Brandon questions rather the issues is with Head Coach Pete Carroll and share that he believes that Seattle’s issues start with the teams philosophy and Coach Carroll has to change his ways and adjust to the game. 

Wrapping things up Leger brings up Lebron James and questions the longevity of his game and prompts the cast with the question of how much longer do they think Lebron can last in the NBA? Brandon shares that he looks at athletes the same way he looks at entertainers like Jay-Z. He shares that Jay-s longevity is because he was able to evolve and adjust. Brandon believes that as an athlete you must be able to evolve and Lebron must pass the torch in order to play less and prevent the injuries and the wear and tear on his body.

      <description><![CDATA[WATCH EPISODE → https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-J2W...

I AM WOMAN | Season 2: Episode 10

In the season finale of I Am Woman, Michi Marshall, Kijafa Vick, Aja Crowder, Alexis Stoudemire, Ashley Wheeler and Chef Tre’ host rapper and songwriter Katrina Taylor. 
The cast discuss everything from Trina’s career, the death of her brother and mother, and her becoming recently engaged. 

Michi starts off the show by gifting Trina her “roses” for paving the way for her and other woman to express themselves in a raw, sexual and feminine way that wasn’t always so accepted in the late 90s to early 2000’s. Michi, questioned where Trina gained her confidence during this time that led to her empowering woman nationwide. Trina responds that she grew up around a host of strong woman throughout her childhood. She was taught to have a “make it happen” and “get it done” attitude because in life if you want something you can obtain it if you focus on it.

After a successful career, Trina is noted as one of the most influential women to change the face of Hip-Hop. Aja is curious about how Trina’s successful career in music got started and asks her if it started by her having interest in writing poetry. Trina explains that before her career in music began, she was a successful realtor with no intentions to become a rapper. It was not until her good friend and former schoolmate Trickdaddy asked her to be apart of the iconic track known as “Naan” as a favor. Little did she know that this track alone would his would kickstart her career as a rapper. 

After Trina experienced the loss of her brother Wilbrant Bain in 2013 and her mother Vernessa “Nessa” Taylor in 2019, Kijafa prompts the tough question on how Trina was able to manage the loss while still pursuing a career as a rapper.  Trina shared that these two losses was one of the darkest moments throughout her life. She also shares that she tried to use her music as a answer and drown herself in work.  After about 2 years after the loss of her mother, Trina admits that she hadn’t fully addressed the pain from the death of her mother. It wasn’t until she was invited to a long-awaited festival in Atlanta where fans showed her unbelievable support that she decided it was time to address the pain. 

Kijafa navigate the conversation to a more positive vibe and discuss Trina’s news on becoming newly engaged to Raymond Taylor. Trina then drops gems for other women in relationships and shares how she has navigated the dating scene. 

Chef joins the ladies and serves up Chocolate Ferrero Rocher cake. Chef goes on to share how Trina’s music impacted him from a male perspective and questions her on what her thought are on the current environment for female rappers in the Hip-Hop industry. She shares that female artist must value themselves and understand that they are assets and that they bring a lot more value to the table and they should recognize this and not jump at the first opportunity presented to them.

The cast discuss everything from Trina’s career, the death of her brother and mother, and her becoming recently engaged. 

Michi starts off the show by gifting Trina her “roses” for paving the way for her and other woman to express themselves in a raw, sexual and feminine way that wasn’t always so accepted in the late 90s to early 2000’s. Michi, questioned where Trina gained her confidence during this time that led to her empowering woman nationwide. Trina responds that she grew up around a host of strong woman throughout her childhood. She was taught to have a “make it happen” and “get it done” attitude because in life if you want something you can obtain it if you focus on it.

After a successful career, Trina is noted as one of the most influential women to change the face of Hip-Hop. Aja is curious about how Trina’s successful career in music got started and asks her if it started by her having interest in writing poetry. Trina explains that before her career in music began, she was a successful realtor with no intentions to become a rapper. It was not until her good friend and former schoolmate Trickdaddy asked her to be apart of the iconic track known as “Naan” as a favor. Little did she know that this track alone would his would kickstart her career as a rapper. 

After Trina experienced the loss of her brother Wilbrant Bain in 2013 and her mother Vernessa “Nessa” Taylor in 2019, Kijafa prompts the tough question on how Trina was able to manage the loss while still pursuing a career as a rapper.  Trina shared that these two losses was one of the darkest moments throughout her life. She also shares that she tried to use her music as a answer and drown herself in work.  After about 2 years after the loss of her mother, Trina admits that she hadn’t fully addressed the pain from the death of her mother. It wasn’t until she was invited to a long-awaited festival in Atlanta where fans showed her unbelievable support that she decided it was time to address the pain. 

Kijafa navigate the conversation to a more positive vibe and discuss Trina’s news on becoming newly engaged to Raymond Taylor. Trina then drops gems for other women in relationships and shares how she has navigated the dating scene. 

Chef joins the ladies and serves up Chocolate Ferrero Rocher cake. Chef goes on to share how Trina’s music impacted him from a male perspective and questions her on what her thought are on the current environment for female rappers in the Hip-Hop industry. She shares that female artist must value themselves and understand that they are assets and that they bring a lot more value to the table and they should recognize this and not jump at the first opportunity presented to them.

I AM NASCAR | SEASON 2: EPISODE 8

Justin Marks joins Brandon Marshall, Channing Crowder and Dion “Rocko” Williams in episode 8 of I Am NASCAR. Justin takes us inside his decision to transition from being a professional racing driver to becoming an entrepreneur and owner of the NASCAR Cup Series team Trackhouse Racing Team. 

After 80 NASCAR starts, former NASCAR Driver Justin Marks started a new Cup Series Team called Trackhouse Racing Team in 2021. He shares that he loves racing more than anything else in the world behind his wife and kids but realized that he wanted to be successful but felt he could be more successful on the business and ownership side of NASCAR to do that. 

Rocko takes us down memory lane and shares what Justin was like as a racer. He described Justin as a driver with a chip that liked to look good and play good. He explains that there are a lot of team owners that were former drivers but there aren’t a lot of owners that were good drivers outside of Justin.

Brandon jokingly proposes that Channing becomes a driver for Justin after wining a couple of GoKart races against Chad Johnson and himself earlier this year. Channing responds that if he were to race for any one he would love the opportunity to race for Justin because he’s young and progressive. Justin says with all of the changes happening around NASCAR within the last 2 years that now is the time to be progressive and embrace the changes and build his business around that vision. 

Justin shares that he believes success for Trackhouse Racing starts with ownership. He wants to be the owner that is involved with his team on and off the track. He is committed to hiring the best people and providing them with the necessary tools to be effective at their role. He also believes that in order to be a good owner he has to be present and being there with his team on all levels. 

Wrapping things up, Channing and Brandon ask Justin what the future of Trackhouse and NASCAR looks like. Justin responds NASCAR looks a lot different within its fanbase in the last 2-3 years. He adds that Trackhouse has the most diverse pit crew in the sport and it important to him because he wants to win races and amplify their voices. He shares that it is his mission to find a way to make a difference and that NASCAR is a sport that can be for everybody but all owners need to be pushing in that direction to accomplish this with NASCAR’s support.

      <title>Untold Stories of Wendell Scott | I AM NASCAR with BRANDON MARSHALL</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Brandon Marshall, Channing Crowder and Chad Johnson sit down Frank and Warrick Scott of the Wendell Scott family and discuss the legacy of Wendell Scott and his impact on NASCAR and his community. 
 
Starting off, Frank discusses the making of the 1977 film Greased Lighting that tells the story of his father and stock car racer Wendell Scott. Frank shares that the movie has several deleted scenes in efforts to reach a broader audience. Because of this, Frank believes that the movie doesn’t depict the true Wendell Scott Story and he and his son Warrick vow to tell their father’s uncut story to the world. 
 
Frank goes on to share a quote he father shared with him as a young boy “Just because I lose a race, doesn’t mean that I’m defeated”. Frank shares that he has always wanted to be a boxer and he uses this quote to share with Ocho to encourage him to keep training and fighting.
 
Channing prompts the question of the pressures of upholding the legacy and name of their father Wendell. Warrick responded that there isn’t any pressure because he grew up in a “pressure cooker” experiencing and hearing the hardships that his grandfather endured while still being successful. He goes on to share that his life work is solely dedicated to liberating his grandfather’s legacy. 
 
Warrick and Frank go on to share untold stories of Wendell Scott and the hardships he endured during the civil rights movement as his career began to blossom. They shared how he often feared for his life before and after races and how he navigated a sport that didn’t embrace people who looked like him. 
 
Warrick and Frank share their father’s dream and how the birth of the Wendell Scott Foundation came to life. Warrick lays out the purpose and goals of the foundation to advocate and broker for young black kids going to college. Frank gets emotional after seeing his father’s vision being manifested through his son Warrick after over 50 years.

      <title>RAJAH CARUTH: Seeing Bubba Wallace Race Gave Me Confidence | I AM NASCAR With BRANDON MARSHALL</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>WATCH MORE → https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70YdJ...<br /><br />I AM NASCAR | SEASON 2: EPISODE 6<br /><br />Brandon Marshall, Channing Crowder and Chad Johnson sit down with professional stock car driver Rajah Caruth and his father Rodger Caruth. Rajah walks the crew through his career path that birthed from competing in iRacing from his bedroom. <br /><br />Rajah started his career racing at the age of 16, driving the virtual 2018 eNASCAR Ignite Series on iRacing. He would go on to end his rookie season with two top 10s and also ended up 13th in the Semi-pro points. <br /><br />Being a true gamer, Chad Johnson challenges Rajah to a game of NBA 2k online.

      <title>DERRELL EDWARDS: Being Comfortable With Being Uncomfortable | I AM NASCAR With BRANDON MARSHALL</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><br />I AM NASCAR | SEASON 2: EPISODE 5<br /><br />RCR pit crew member Derrell Edwards joins Brandon Marshall, Channing Crowder, Fred Taylor and Dion “Rocko” Williams in episode 5 of I AM NASCAR. The five discuss everything from racing, Diversity and innovating the world of NASCAR. <br /><br />Darrell would have never thought he would have grown up to be a successful member of a pit crew team. HE found his way to the sport after a successful career with the High Point University men’s basketball team in North Carolina. He earned an internship with RCR in his final year of school where he met Rocko Williams who led NASCAR's Drive for Diversity program and the rest was history.<br /><br />Growing up Derrell was always told in order to make it out of the hood he would have to make it to the NFL or NBA. Darrell is making it his obligation to educated and show the culture that there are other avenues and opportunities in life to pursue. <br /><br />Derrell Edwards would go on to become the first African-American over-the-wall pit crew member to win the Daytona 500. Derrell's competitive nature and determination led him to become one of the most well known trailblazers in NASCAR.<br /><br />Rocko talks about being nicked-named "Pioneer of Pit row"  and what it was like being  a member on pit row before his retirement. He goes on to tell the story of how NASCAR implemented the<br />"Rocko Rule" after he introduced innovative techniques within pit row. <br /><br />Wrapping things up Derrell and Rocko talk about the opportunities that NASCAR has opened up to them outside of the track. Derrell goes on to stress the importance of being uncomfortable and opening your mindset to new and different opportunities.  <br /><br /><br />I AM ATHLETE:<br />Official Site: https://iamathletetv.com/<br />YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/iamathlete<br />Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamathletep...<br />Twitter: https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpod<br />TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@iamathlete_po...<br /><br />HOUSE OF ATHLETE:<br />Official Site: https://houseofathlete.com/<br />Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thehouseofa...<br />Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/houseofathlete<br />Apparel Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/houseofathl...<br /><br /><br />#IAANascar<br />#IAMATHLETE<br />#BrandonMarshall<br />#ChadJohnson<br />#ChanningCrowder<br />#DerrellEdwards<br />#RockoWilliams<br />#MoreThanAPodcast<br /><br /><br />DRAFTKINGS:<br />If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL).<br /><br />Gambling problem?

      <title>Hailie Deegan: Embracing The Villain Role | I AM NASCAR With BRANDON MARSHALL and MORE</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I AM NASCAR | SEASON 2: EPISODE 4<br /><br />Professional stock car racing driver, Hailie Deegan joins Brandon Marshall, Chad Johnson, Channing Crowder in episode 4 of I AM NASCAR. The four discuss everything from Racing, YouTube, and being a Villain.<br /><br />Starting the conversation off Brandon asks Hailie the burning question of how it feels to be a female driver in NASCAR. Haile responds that starting out there was a natural expectation for her to fail from other male drivers. She goes on and shares that her entire life she had to earn respect form fellow male drivers but she enjoys the satisfaction of proving them wrong on the track.<br /><br />Hailie discusses how she developed her passion for racing at an early age and what it was like growing up as the daughter of Brian Deegan. Brian is the most decorated Freestyle Motocross rider in X Games history. <br /><br />Channing acknowledges Hailie only being 19 years old and that at that age he was enjoying his youth and partying. Hailie explains that her focus is on racing because it is all she ever wanted to do. She goes on to share her love for creating YouTube content and using it as an outlet outside of racing. <br /><br />Wrapping things up Chad gifts Hailie the advice of enjoying the journey while embracing the role as the Villain in racing.  <br /><br /><br />I AM ATHLETE:<br />Official Site: https://iamathletetv.com/<br />YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/iamathlete<br />Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamathletepodcast/<br />Twitter: https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpod<br />TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@iamathlete_podcast?<br /><br />HOUSE OF ATHLETE:<br />Official Site: https://houseofathlete.com/<br />Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thehouseofathlete/?utm_medium=copy_link<br />Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/houseofathlete<br />Apparel Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/houseofathleteapparel/?utm_medium=copy_link<br /><br /><br />#IAANascar<br />#IAMATHLETE<br />#BrandonMarshall<br />#ChadJohnson<br />#ChanningCrowder<br />#HailieDeegan<br />#MoreThanAPodcast</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I Am Athlete LA is a newly expanded series of the successful franchise. The I Am Athlete LA Podcast is filmed in Los Angeles, California. IAA LA, short for I Am Athlete LA, is hosted by former NBA and NFL players Nick Young, Brandon Jennings, Michael Bennett, Duke Ihenacho, and led by successful entrepreneur Keenan Beasley. These public figures are all-stars on the field, on the court, in business, and behind the mic. This crew covers popular, controversial, and relatable topics surrounding culture, entertainment, business, and sports, with an LA twist. Through their discussions and viewpoints, they all convey they are much bigger than an “athlete.” <br /><br />IAA LA Season 1: Episode 2<br />Nick, Brandon, Michael, Duke, and Keenan kickoff episode 2 by discussing whether or not they would allow their kids to play football and why. While most of the cast used sports as an outlet while growing up, discussions grew as they tackled topics surrounding parenting children who don’t play sports for the same reasons as they did. Conversations then take a turn even more as the cast gives their opinions on the best ways to prioritize marriage and relationships as an athlete.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE | I Am Athlete Welcomes OWN&apos;s David Makes Man &amp; Friends</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I Am Athlete welcomes special guests from OWN Network’s David Makes Man and friends for a family discussion centered on Mental Health in the black community.<br /><br />As a long time champion of Mental Health, Brandon welcomes Tarell Alvin McCraney, an equal champion in Mental Health Awareness.  Tarell is an Oscar-winning screenwriter, playwright, and actor who co-wrote the 2016 film Moonlight, based on his own play, for which he received an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and is the creator of OWN hit series David Makes Man.  <br /><br />Tarell invites some of his close friends to join and shape the discussion.  The cast is led by Sterling K. Brown, an Emmy Award-winning actor that stars in NBC's Emmy and Golden Globe nominated drama series THIS IS US. For his role as Randall Pearson, Brown won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, as well as a Golden Globe, becoming the first African American actor to win his category in the award show's 75-year history. <br /><br />Offering a younger perspective to the conversation, Akili McDowell, best known for his starring role in David Makes Man and The Astronaut Wives Club on ABC, adds insight from his personal experiences to bring a different angle to the topics. Rounding out the panel is actor, John Michael Hill, who stars as Detective Marcus Bell in the CBS series Elementary and actor Glenn Davis who has been featured in hit shows Billions, Jericho, The Unit and 24.<br /><br />The guys watch a few scenes from the upcoming Season 2 of David Makes Man and break down the impact of the clip, and its connection to their own lives as youth and adults. Tarell talks about the reason he created the show David Makes Man, and why it matters for dialogue in the community.<br /><br />Sterling connects the power of media and its ability to validate an overall experience, while using it to change traditional narratives held about black men. Brandon discusses a clip with Tarell and Akili from Season One of David Makes Man that impacted him while Akili offers a more pointed description and interpretation of the segment.<br /><br />Teasing season two themes, Tarell introduces a clip emphasizing the need to properly deal with anxiety and trauma.  The guys talk about recovery and rest for the body and mind which gives Brandon an opportunity to bring up the ongoing debate of Ocho vs. Science. <br /><br />Tarell also previews a powerful moment from the upcoming season in which he shares the screen with director Barry Jenkins from his Oscar Winning Film, Moonlight and opens up about the need to write his “truth” within the pages of his scripts. It leads to a very poignant discussion <br /><br />And no show is complete without a home cooked meal and the guys are treated to a local speciality from a guest Chef. <br /><br />With Season 2 of I Am Athlete wrapped, the platform will continue to feature special content on Mondays at noon throughout the summer until the new season launches in August!<br /><br />I AM ATHLETE is a thought provoking and in-depth podcast that offers multiple perspectives<br />on subjects ranging from sports to controversial topics to fashion to lifestyle covering all cultural conversations and building a platform to educate but encourage viewers to engage.<br /><br />For I Am Athlete merchandise and apparel, visit www.HouseOfAthlete.com and for Chef Nancie's collection, visit www.ChefNancie.com. <br /><br />David Makes Man – Season 1, Now Streaming on HBO Max<br />David Makes Man – Season 2 airs Tuesdays at 9|8c on OWN</p>

      <title>I AM ATHLETE (S2E36) | A Prime Time Season Finale</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the season finale of I Am Athlete, the legendary Deion Sanders joins Brandon, Chad, Channing and Fred for an entertaining and powerful discussion as Prime brings his unique energy and puts his personal stamp on various topics throughout the episode. </p><p>Prime Time, a mentor to Chad, starts the show off demonstrating what it would have been like covering the wide receiver back in the day which leads into inside football talk as the guys reminisce about some of the best players over time. Brandon tells a funny story about playing in front of Prime and then lures him into the ongoing X and Z debate in which Deion delivers the final answer on who is who between Chad and Brandon. </p><p>Channing starts poking Deion on his latest endeavour of becoming the new Head Football Coach at Jackson State University and why he would take on such a challenge while Brandon questions Deion walking away from millions being on tv and other opportunities to choose this. Deion describes the coaching decision as easy and the journey as is his calling as he wants to be a conduit of change for these young men while bringing the same exposure and respect to HBCU programs as other top college programs. Respecting his efforts, Fred agrees that there is strong talent in these schools but Channing says no way would he as a young talented player choose a HBCU program over a power five school which sparks some heated discussion between the guys. </p><p>With both of Deion's sons playing for him at Jackson State, Fred asks if there is favoritism and if it's hard coaching your own kids at that level...Deion responds, "No" which leads to a funny conversation about ranking his own children not just on the field but in family hierarchy too. One important aspect the men discuss is about being role models and the roles people actually play and also the importance of Deion's coaching staff working day time shifts to be home with their family in time for dinner and to raise their families- an aspect foreign to many professional and college coaching staffs. </p><p>Wrapping up Mental Health Awareness Month, Brandon asks the usually positive Deion what was his lowest moment in life which leads to a surprising answer that leaves the guys speechless as Prime opens up about his own personal struggles and suicidal moments that led him down a different path. Prime recalls a tough night he had in Cincinnati, Ohio after going 3-4 one night and how he contemplated taking his own life that night and what ultimately was his saving grace. It doesn't matter what you have or who you have in life, it matters if you are at peace with yourself because even when you are at the top of the world, you can still be struggling. </p><p>One week out from Chad's professional boxing debut, the guys are checking on him to make sure he's prepared as Chef Nancie serves Ocho a hearty meal that the guys question if that's what he should be loading up on days before his fight. Chef said she wants Chad to feel himself and the conversation quickly turns into a friendly interrogation from the guys to Chef on why she is so dressed up and where she's headed. </p><p>I Am Athlete podcast is a candid, unscripted weekly discussion between former </p><p><b>NFL</b> greats: <b>Brandon Marshall</b>, <b>Chad Johnson</b>, <b>Fred Taylor</b> and<b> Channing Crowder</b>.  These gridiron giants pull no punches and have no filter while expressing themselves on the importance of the issues and topics they cover.  Each week the podcast is growing in popularity and its subscribers due to the panelists frankness in sharing their thoughts and views on relevant topics covered each week.<br /><br /><b>A new episode premieres every Monday at 12pm Eastern.

      <itunes:subtitle>In the season finale of I Am Athlete, the legendary Deion Sanders joins Brandon, Chad, Channing and Fred for an entertaining and powerful discussion as Prime brings his unique energy and puts his personal stamp on various topics throughout the episode. Prime Time, a mentor to Chad, starts the show off demonstrating what it would have been like covering the wide receiver back in the day which leads into inside football talk as the guys reminisce about some of the best players over time. Brandon tells a funny story about playing in front of Prime and then lures him into the ongoing X and Z debate in which Deion delivers the final answer on who is who between Chad and Brandon. Channing starts poking Deion on his latest endeavour of becoming the new Head Football Coach at Jackson State University and why he would take on such a challenge while Brandon questions Deion walking away from millions being on tv and other opportunities to choose this. Deion describes the coaching decision as easy and the journey as is his calling as he wants to be a conduit of change for these young men while bringing the same exposure and respect to HBCU programs as other top college programs. Respecting his efforts, Fred agrees that there is strong talent in these schools but Channing says no way would he as a young talented player choose a HBCU program over a power five school which sparks some heated discussion between the guys. With both of Deion&apos;s sons playing for him at Jackson State, Fred asks if there is favoritism and if it&apos;s hard coaching your own kids at that level...Deion responds, &quot;No&quot; which leads to a funny conversation about ranking his own children not just on the field but in family hierarchy too. One important aspect the men discuss is about being role models and the roles people actually play and also the importance of Deion&apos;s coaching staff working day time shifts to be home with their family in time for dinner and to raise their families- an aspect foreign to many professional and college coaching staffs. Wrapping up Mental Health Awareness Month, Brandon asks the usually positive Deion what was his lowest moment in life which leads to a surprising answer that leaves the guys speechless as Prime opens up about his own personal struggles and suicidal moments that led him down a different path. Prime recalls a tough night he had in Cincinnati, Ohio after going 3-4 one night and how he contemplated taking his own life that night and what ultimately was his saving grace. It doesn&apos;t matter what you have or who you have in life, it matters if you are at peace with yourself because even when you are at the top of the world, you can still be struggling. One week out from Chad&apos;s professional boxing debut, the guys are checking on him to make sure he&apos;s prepared as Chef Nancie serves Ocho a hearty meal that the guys question if that&apos;s what he should be loading up on days before his fight. Chef said she wants Chad to feel himself and the conversation quickly turns into a friendly interrogation from the guys to Chef on why she is so dressed up and where she&apos;s headed. I Am Athlete podcast is a candid, unscripted weekly discussion between former NFL greats: Brandon Marshall, Chad Johnson, Fred Taylor and Channing Crowder.  These gridiron giants pull no punches and have no filter while expressing themselves on the importance of the issues and topics they cover.  Each week the podcast is growing in popularity and its subscribers due to the panelists frankness in sharing their thoughts and views on relevant topics covered each week.A new episode premieres every Monday at 12pm Eastern.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Soccer Stars Toni Pressley and Ali Riley are back with a new episode of their cooking series- Girls Gone Veg and this is one you don't want to miss!<br /><br />Joining the ladies this week, is one of their male counterparts, Orlando City's defensive midfielder, Uri Rosell. The Spanish footballer is not only a rockstar on the field, but proves to be one in the kitchen too! Sharing a passion for food, Uri is excited to learn from Toni and Ali as cooking is something the soccer stud explored during quarantine. <br /><br />Being athletes who rely on endurance, fueling up on carbs is sometimes the best approach to keeping their energy at a premium.

Dancing around the stove, Toni and Ali create a playful environment which continues as the ladies gather around the table to enjoy their finished product. As the trio sit to enjoy the meal,  Ali comments on how much she loves noods while Toni breaks out into laughter because it catches Uri off guard not realizing they are referring to the pasta!  The nood conversation continues as the ladies share some funny 'nood' innuendos.<br /><br />Girls Gone Veg is a limited eight part series releasing a new episode every Friday at Noon eastern on the I Am Athlete Channel. </p>

Holding back tears, the memories get the best of her as she realizes everything it took for her to achieve success and not only become the best in the world, but pave the way for other young women and athletes originating from her home country of Brazil. Turning the tears into laughter, the three share some funny moments and of course a little kitchen competition to kick off the cooking challenge. Although, It proves hard to have a friendly soccer juggle when you are up against the GOAT, who only knows how to finish in first, even if it&apos;s as silly as juggling cherry tomatoes!Girls Gone Veg is a limited eight part series releasing a new episode every Friday at Noon eastern on the I Am Athlete Channel. </itunes:subtitle>

      <title>I AM NASCAR (S1E2)| Kyle Busch: I Am An A$$hole too</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's bad boys for life and two-time NASCAR Cup Series winner Kyle Busch says being hated is all part of the price of winning. </p><p>Starting the conversation off, Channing says 'rowdy" means asshole and asks Kyle if he's an asshole as the group erupts in laughter while he owns up to the title. Chad loves that Kyle embraces being the villain of NASCAR relating back to his days on the football field. Chad gets Kyle to give details of the few fights he's had and digs into who his past and present rivals are, starting with Dale Earnhardt Jr and Joey Logano.  Opening up about driver feuds and not making friends on the track, Kyle tells the guys about the fights he's had and the enemies he's made along his journey to the top. </p><p>Winning and being at your best sometimes drives you to uphold a certain persona which is when Brandon busts Kyle on fighting with his own brother for over a year and says no one seems exempt from the competitive on track stigma.  Kyle's success on the track has resulted in his share off the track too. Brandon gets into the balance of work life and family and what it takes to maintain businesses at all levels as well as Kyle's most important role as a dad to his son Brexton who is into go kart racing at the age of 5. </p><p>Fred dives into the intricacies of the sport and who's more in control of the success, the crew chief or the driver. Kyle explains how it's a balance between the two and how there are levels to competing and when you have an 'A driver' and an 'A crew chief' the possibilities are endless. Brandon and Channing don't shy away from Kyle being one of the sport's A drivers but also ask the tough question of his recent slump only winning a couple races out of almost 70 which is very uncharacteristic of the two-time Cup Series winner. Kyle quickly responds, "I'm not sucking," so we are going to figure it out or I will know when it's time. </p><p>Brandon closes the show with May being Mental Health Awareness month and asks Kyle about how he and his wife handle the heartaches of infertility and the emotional rollercoaster it creates. Making light of the situation best he can, Kyle explains the process from his own experience and sheds light to other couples who may be going through similar ups and downs. </p><p>I AM NASCAR is a limited series and special edition of the I Am Athlete podcast with episodes slated to air every Monday in May and monthly throughout the race season.

      <title>I AM NASCAR (S1E1)| Driving Fast With Dale Jr.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Speed on the football field is one thing, but speed behind the wheel is another...Brandon, Chad, Fred and Channing get the experience of a lifetime riding as a passenger with Dale Jr Earnhardt at Charlotte MotorSpeedway to launch our collaboration with Nascar. <br /><br />Sparking interest from the Bubba Wallace I Am Athlete episode, which infamously featured the moment where Channing coined the challenge that, “drivers aren’t athletes”,prompting Dale Jr to reach out to give Channing, Brandon, Chad and Fred a firsthand experience inside a race car.  Not intending to change Channing's mind, but rather offer a perspective that could provide more understanding into a driver's world. This episode starts off the I Am Nascar series, a special edition of I Am Athlete podcast with multiple episodes rolling out in the month of May and throughout the season. <br /><br />Sitting down and smoking cigars on pit road, the guys reflect on their experience and curiosity about the history of racing and Dale's journey. The conversation gets deep talking about legacy, loss and life lessons learned along the way. Dale opens up about the day he lost his father  and describes those final moments in detail and how he had to 'shake hands with Daytona' before racing there again. <br /><br />Chad, more knowledgeable about the sport than other guys, talks the ins and outs of driving, the mentality of a driver and finding that balance of living life and still being successful. Like anything in life, racing is a business and Brandon gets into the landscape of owning teams, females in the sport and the finances behind driving professionally.  <br /><br />Switching gears, Channing asks Dale about the lifestyle and ladies that come along with being a driver and why he waited so long to settle down and have a family. Dale describes the wide open mentality and driving for Budweiser back in the day elevated that rockstar life which he says he has no regrets. <br /><br />Talking about various emotions and energy into the preparation of the sport, Fred opens up about how he cried shedding actual tears before some of his biggest games number wise and can't explain why he did it but just did which then led to a further football discussion about Dale sharing his research into concussions and the fears that lie ahead with potential CTE. <br /><br />As a spoof to our I AM Woman resident Chef Lowe, comedian Lou Young makes an appearance, catching Dale off guard and surprising the guys with a tailgate style meal that leaves them laughing at his delivery and timing of the meal. <br /><br />Today's show kicks off the first of three more this month, with a new episode streaming every Monday at Noon eastern on the I Am Athlete Youtube Channel. Special thanks to Charlotte MotorSpeedway, Hendrick Motorsports and JR Motorsports for helping to make this experience happen!

Chad, more knowledgeable about the sport than other guys, talks the ins and outs of driving, the mentality of a driver and finding that balance of living life and still being successful. Like anything in life, racing is a business and Brandon gets into the landscape of owning teams, females in the sport and the finances behind driving professionally.  Switching gears, Channing asks Dale about the lifestyle and ladies that come along with being a driver and why he waited so long to settle down and have a family. Dale describes the wide open mentality and driving for Budweiser back in the day elevated that rockstar life which he says he has no regrets.

      <itunes:subtitle>Speed on the football field is one thing, but speed behind the wheel is another...Brandon, Chad, Fred and Channing get the experience of a lifetime riding as a passenger with Dale Jr Earnhardt at Charlotte MotorSpeedway to launch our collaboration with Nascar. Sparking interest from the Bubba Wallace I Am Athlete episode, which infamously featured the moment where Channing coined the challenge that, “drivers aren’t athletes”,prompting Dale Jr to reach out to give Channing, Brandon, Chad and Fred a firsthand experience inside a race car.  Not intending to change Channing&apos;s mind, but rather offer a perspective that could provide more understanding into a driver&apos;s world. This episode starts off the I Am Nascar series, a special edition of I Am Athlete podcast with multiple episodes rolling out in the month of May and throughout the season. Sitting down and smoking cigars on pit road, the guys reflect on their experience and curiosity about the history of racing and Dale&apos;s journey. The conversation gets deep talking about legacy, loss and life lessons learned along the way. Dale opens up about the day he lost his father  and describes those final moments in detail and how he had to &apos;shake hands with Daytona&apos; before racing there again.

Believing in the 'Eat What You Kill" philosophy, Channing talks about how compensation is a direct result of broadcast deals and fan engagement. If a sport or event is bringing in high dollars then that's what gets paid out, if it isn't, where else would the money come from to close the monetary gap? </p><p>Being an avid soccer fan and player, Chad disagrees and believes the ladies' sport is highly competitive and entertaining to watch and wants to know what it will take to level the playing field between women and men's soccer.  Leaving Brandon, Fred and Channing stunned, Toni and Ali disclose that most women playing in the league make below minimum wage with salaries of $22,000 for 25 games including the offseason. </p><p>As girl dads, Channing asks Toni and Ali what's the motivation to pour resources into his daughter playing sports and give her the best odds to make it knowing that even at the highest level of success, it doesn't reflect monetary success or accolades. The ladies respond that it has to be about the passion and happiness of the game in hopes that their current generation is paving the way for today's youth to have better circumstances in the future. </p><p>Michi Marshall stops by the set to explain the importance of May being national Mental Health Awareness month and ways to get involved and support those who may be struggling with mental illness. </p><p>Chad, coming off his big announcement that he will be fighting on the undercard of the Floyd Mayweather vs Logan Paul bout on June 6th, continues to be questioned about his decision to enter the ring.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE (S2E34) | NFL Draft: What Pick You Are Doesn&apos;t Mean Sh!t</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s NFL draft week and we have wide receiver standouts Jarvis Landry and Stefon Diggs joining the show to talk everything from growing up as the men of the household to personal draft day experiences to being in the league now.<br /><br />Fred starts the conversation off by asking the guys to share  advice to the young guys going through the draft process this week. Diggs is quick to answer sayings it’s nice to be a first round pick but when the smoke clears, it doesn’t really matter when your name is called, it matters what you do when you are in the league.  <br /><br />Both star wide receivers share their draft experiences which aren’t as joyous as most people think they would be. Diggs recounts how many teams passed him up which gave him a chip on his shoulder that since has motivated him everyday.  Similarly, Landry felt a little slighted too but more embarrassed that he was ready to hear his name called on the first day and felt he did everything right to have that happen. Fred and Brandon run off a list of guys drafted before Jarvis and Diggs many of the names who aren't even in the league anymore, which further proves the point, it doesn't matter how you get there, it matters how you stay there. <br /><br />Going back to earlier years, Diggs opens up and shares the emotional and powerful journey of losing his father at a young age and how he stepped into that father role for his younger siblings.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE (S2E33) | Parents: Don&apos;t Be Losers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this week's episode, the I Am Athlete crew takes time to vent about frustrating life moments while discussing when it makes sense to speak freely and to who to trust with these conversations. Women tend to share more freely and open up to their girl friends while Brandon and Channing agree that it's more unlikely for men to sit around and vent to one another, especially when it hits close to home because you need to protect family and the intricacies of personal relationships. Chad says he rarely allows things to annoy him to a point of needing to vent but Fred says it's good to get things out that are on the mind.  <br /><br />Fred feels a certain way about people who would root against his success and not want him to elevate his situation which prompts Brandon to ask if any of them developed survivor's remorse for making it in the league leaving behind people at home. Fred says absolutely not and Chad agrees saying the people at home who rooted against him are the same ones who motivated him to reach his highest level.</p><p>The venting continues as Channing shares his thoughts about parents who try to live vicariously through their children playing sports which leads Fred to comment on how wrong it is for parents to pressure kids into sports thinking they will be part of the 1% who make it big. Using his own personal encounters as an example, Channing doesn't hold back, referring to those parents as losers who count on their children's success in sports for a retirement plan. The guys all laugh at Channing's tactics to rile up the opposing team's parents while at his kids' little league games and that true satisfaction and joy for him is watching his son and daughter smile when they play well. Reminiscing about playing peewee football, Chad reflects on his grandma always making it about fun vs pressure which is why as a parent he supports his children 100% but wants the focus to be on having a good time and nothing more. </p><p>Chef Lowe is filling in for Chef Nancie while she is in NY and offers up his parenting perspective when it comes to youth sports and his own son. And in typical fashion, the conversation takes a left turn when Fred asks Chad if he is more famous as Ocho or Chad Johnson. Chad replies he is more recognized as Ocho worldwide which Fred says makes sense since Ocho is derivative of the spanish language and the group bursts into laughter. The topic of Europe leads to a characteristically amusing and free-flowing discussion about languages spoken abroad, geography and Ochocinco’s amazement at the Roman Colosseum that wraps up another IAA episode.</p><p>I Am Athlete podcast is candid, unscripted weekly discussion between former <b>NFL</b> greats: <b>Brandon Marshall</b>, <b>Chad Johnson</b>, <b>Fred Taylor</b> and<b> Channing Crowder</b>.  These gridiron giants pull no punches and have no filter while expressing themselves on the importance of the issues and topics they cover.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE (S2E32) | You Hurt My Feelings</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>After a viral family feud, the I Am Athlete crew reunites to hash out what went on last week and where everyone stands after a few days to reflect.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE (S2E31) | EveryFamily has its Feud: This Is Ours</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Every family has its feuds and in this episode, we have ours...The discussion heats up as Brandon, Chad, Channing and Fred discuss contracts and the differences between NBA and NFL.

Brandon disagrees and says not all NBA players have guaranteed money and that the NFL is institutionalized. </p><p>Former NFL Wide Receiver and Houston great, Andre Johnson, joined the guys to talk about the Houston Texans organization and the future of Deshaun Watson. The normally reserved veteran, voiced his opinion in early 2021 about how players, specifically Watson, were being treated by the organization and that a change needs to be made. Generating buzz about his public stance, the guys leaned into Johnson's leadership role and how much he is respected to speak to the current state of the NFL and the Houston Texans. </p><p>Johnson was pulled into the heated debate but sat observing the back and forth as Brandon offered a quick apology beforehand sensing the conversation was about to take a left turn. Becoming extremely agitated with the difference of opinions, Brandon loses his cool with Chad and Channing which leads to a very intense moment between the guys. After minutes of arguing, Fred interjects to bring the guys back down and simmer the conversation. </p><p>Chef joins the show during the heated debate and is an icebreaker in the tension as she serves the guys lamb chops to Chad who has never had them before! And of course no episode is complete without Chad and Brandon asking who is the X and who is the Y, which spurs another round of excitement before the show closes!</p><p><em>Additional Note:</em></p><p>Andre Johnson was asked to be a guest on this week’s episode of I Am Athlete to talk about football and inner workings of the NFL. The episode was filmed prior to many of the off field allegations against Deshaun Watson becoming public. We understand the severity of the claims and take them seriously and will allow the legal system to play out.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE (S2E30) | Mindset Of A Pro Athlete</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Walls vs boundaries...when is it time to be tough and when is time to ask for help? In life we put up walls and that sometimes hurts while we establish boundaries to protect, but distinguishing the difference between the two can be stressful.<br /><br />Coming off an impactful episode last week with Dwyane Wade, the guys return to do a mental check in and discuss the pressures of everyday life with a personal but powerful conversation.<br /><br />Brandon Fred Chad and Channing dig deep into each others lives...asking who are those in your circle that are going to tell you what you need to hear not always what you want to hear.  Leading with the story about Isaiah Wilson, the 2020 NFL first round pick who just was cut from another team and the guys wonder are we doing enough in the league and life to provide resources and encourage guys to reach out for help before it’s too late. Chad says making mistakes and being immature can’t always be blamed on mental<br />health that we are responsible for our own choices.<br /><br />Brandon compares aspects of life from a book he read about a rubber ball symbolizing business because it can always bounce back but on the personal side of life it’s more like a glass ball, if it’s dropped enough it gets scratched until it eventually shatters. Give time to what’s most important and that can’t be repaired or redone.<br /><br />Chad shares his vacation experience with everyone and taking time to do things he didn’t expect he would enjoy while Channing and Fred say finding the balance between family and business is tough but for them it’s always going to be family first.<br /><br />Chef is joined by her eldest daughter who is going to law school but has a passion for being in the kitchen as well. She talks about her admiration for her mom and how she has watched her blossom in the past year which has been a special experience.<br /><br />I Am Athlete podcast is candid, unscripted weekly discussion between former <b>NFL</b> greats: <b>Brandon Marshall</b>, <b>Chad Johnson</b>, <b>Fred Taylor</b> and<b> Channing Crowder</b>.  These gridiron giants pull no punches and have no filter while expressing themselves on the importance of the issues and topics they cover.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>As the season wraps for I Am Woman, the ladies really dive deep into parenting and marital life, especially during COVID times. Agreeing that the past year has brought a lot of change in many areas, the women are split on if they are ready for old life to resume or they enjoy the new normal at home.

The ladies find it funny that Aja is well versed and ready to chat about sexual related topics while Michi and Ashley seem more reserved. </p><p>Kijafa and Terricka are curious about the right time to tell their children about sex and opening the lines of communication about such encounters. Michi and Aja think the kids should be a little older while Ashley says that kids learn things from other kids so it's better for it to be explained at an early age by parents. Michi opens up about a personal experience she had as a child that could have negatively impacted her life but instead she spiraled it into strength and growth while Kijafa says she has instilled in her children to fight for their lives if they are ever in an uncomfortable situation. <br /><br />Finding ways to get back to regular activities and somewhat of normalcy, Michi asks if the women plan on getting the vaccine and they are all split on the decision of whether to get it or not. Terricka and Ashley say having their children home all day everyday is a lot to handle and they can't wait for school and activities to resume. Aja says it's really hard to raise children in this era and the days of kids making mistakes without them being publically exploited are far and few in between. <br /><br />Chef Lowe surprises the ladies with homemade waffles topped with cereal and milk as they ask him what age he finds it appropriate to talk to his son about sex. He also talks about the financial gains people are having with Fans Only Pages and asks if any of the ladies would ever explore that option.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE (S2E29) | Dwyane Wade The GOAT Of Parenting</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In a new episode,  Dwyane Wade sits down with the I Am Athlete crew and opens up about everything from basketball, to life to loving your children unconditionally. </p><p>D Wade may be one of the greatest NBA players of all time, but he is also championing the way as a parent. In a longer bonus edition of I Am Athlete, the guys sit down for a deep and personal conversation with D Wade about basketball, being a father and opening up his world to inspire change. </p><p>Recently, the Wade family shared that Zaya, his middle child, identified as transgender and D explains to the guys what that process was like and how loving your children unconditionally is the parent's job. Coming from sports' locker rooms where gay slangs have been used for years, D had to look himself in the mirror and realize what he needed to do to become better to help his daughter thrive in her life choices.  "I'm not Ryan Clark, filling in for Chad this week, tells Wade that he admires him because he did something that many fathers couldn't do, which even made Ryan check himself as a parent. Brandon references a letter D wrote to his oldest son Zaire before he left for college leading into a discussion about the relationship between a father and son following in one's footsteps vs. having a child that goes the opposite direction. </p><p>Fred tells Wade that there are no layups on this show and he's going to take some shots at getting hard answers to the group's questions, starting with who is his favorite teammate of all time and getting his thoughts about longtime teammate and close friend Lebron James being considered the GOAT over Michael Jordan. Wade talks about how growing up in Chicago, it was Jordan who gave him inspiration that he could play in the NBA and that MJ will forever be his GOAT.  Channing chimes in with the burning question asking what the real reason is that D left Miami for 19 months when he was regarded as the heartbeat of the team and the city. D admits his pride and ego were hurt as he breaks down the business side of the sport and doing what was best for him and his family at the time. </p><p>Chef Nancie is joined on set by Wade's Chef, Richard Ingraham, who actually gave Nancie her start in the personal Chef world years ago as he praises her talents and selfless persona. Brandon puts D Wade in the hot seat asking him who is the better cook, Chef Nancie or Chef Ingraham as he laughs and says the term cook doesn't describe either as they are more than someone who prepares food, they are irreplaceable parts of the puzzle. Sharing life advice for staying at the top of his game and helping young people grow into careers, Chef Ingraham credits his success to living by simple these words, "Make your shoes so big they can't be filled". </p><p>I Am Athlete is filmed at the Botaniko Weston in South Florida.

      <itunes:subtitle>In a new episode,  Dwyane Wade sits down with the I Am Athlete crew and opens up about everything from basketball, to life to loving your children unconditionally. D Wade may be one of the greatest NBA players of all time, but he is also championing the way as a parent. In a longer bonus edition of I Am Athlete, the guys sit down for a deep and personal conversation with D Wade about basketball, being a father and opening up his world to inspire change. Recently, the Wade family shared that Zaya, his middle child, identified as transgender and D explains to the guys what that process was like and how loving your children unconditionally is the parent&apos;s job.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE (S2E28) | Tarzan Swings By With A Snake</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's a wild conversation when Mike Holston aka The Real Tarzan swings by the I Am Athlete set and the guys talk about Orca Whales, Black Mambas and how studying animals translates into understanding human behaviors. Chad, a known animal lover, reiterates his passion for orcas and lifelong desire to swim with the killer whale as he shows off his orca tattoo on his legs. Holston says everyone has an "Inner Tarzan" in them and commends Chad for using his strength to fuel his play on the football field.  </p><p>Holston recounts his journey and how his love started when he was 3 years old and led him into making a successful career out of his passion. Brandon is in awe of Holston's story and the fact that a black man was able to carve out a unique niche and become king of the jungle. Channing, holding Sasha the snake for the beginning of the conversation, respects what Holston has done to show young kids, especially minorities, that no dream is unreachable, even if it seems out of the ordinary. </p><p>Fred and Chad learn of Brandon's snake phobia as they see him squirming as the snake hisses curling around Channing in the chair. The guys have an intervention with Brandon and coach him up to face his fear which leads to a tense 30 seconds on set. </p><p>Chad who says he would have either been a veterinarian or zoologist if never making it as a NFL wide receiver, poses the question to the others asking what they would have done for work if they didn't make it as professional athletes which prompts Brandon to talk about a pivotal story from his college years. Doing what you love hopefully turns into a monetary career but following your dreams is also very daunting to start when so much is put into it with little financial gain. Brandon opens up to the guys about his challenge to follow in the footsteps of his father selling drugs because it was fast money or to stay the course of his dreams even if it meant living without to get through. </p><p>Of Course no episode can be complete without the ongoing debate of Ocho vs Science as Brandon and Chad battle over their divided thoughts and lure Holston into picking sides and choosing between which one of the receivers he would want as his X.  The on set competition continues as Fred and Channing talk about lining up against each other and doing something for love or for money. Chef Nancie joins the conversation offering up her take that having a passion for what you do is more important than chasing the money, if you do something you love long enough, the money will follow. Missing the last conversation about manscaping, Chad takes advantage of the opportunity to ask Channing about how he keeps his "man areas" manicured while Holston says part of living in the wild is being all natural. </p><p>I Am Athlete is filmed at the Botaniko Weston in Weston, Florida.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It doesn't need to be February to recognize and honor black excellence and in this special edition of I Am Black, we are not only recognizing black success but black female success. Brandon Marshall and Fred Taylor sit down with Ese Ighedosa, President House Of Athlete and Bri Thompson, founder of Spiked Spin, for a deep conversation about their journeys and what it means to insult the standard. </p><p>Sharing her words to live by, Bri explains how insulting the standard is more than just a catchy phrase, it's about being confident, passionate and a risk taker. This mantra guided her journey into the fitness industry and defined her mission as an entrepreneur. Starting Spiked Spin during a global pandemic and a time of heightened social unrest didn't intimidate Bri but motivated her to keep going and keep impacting lives. When asked by Brandon what it's like taking on industry giants like Soul Cycle and Peloton, Bri smirked and replied I don't think about it because I see myself as the giant in the industry. </p><p>Ese talks about her time working in the NFL and pointing out that as players Brandon and Fred never had to worry about feeling like an imposter in the league while for her, feeling invisible in meetings and her daily role was the norm.

Understanding the ladies' point of a different path, Fred respects that their community needs to do a better job of lifting each other up. Brandon praised Ese's success of being resilient and leaving the comfortable for the unknown. </p><p>Bringing back Chef Shawn Williams from our episodes in Black History Month, Shawn expresses his admiration for the ladies and their grit to follow their dreams.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE- NASCAR EDITION (S2E26) | Bubba Wallace The Tiger Woods Of Racing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Switching gears, I Am Athlete takes a left turn and joins Nascar in telling the story of the Best Season Ever starting off the I Am Nascar series sitting down with Bubba Wallace. <br /><br />The discussion tracks over various topics including the highly-publicized incident where a noose was found in Bubba's garage, NASCAR’s confederate flag controversy, what it's like racing for Michael Jordan and the danger of the sport itself.  <br /><br />But before it all gets going, Brandon asks the burning question of how does a black man fall in love with Nascar while Chad falls in love with Bubba as they bond over McDonalds being their goto.  Channing lets Bubba know right away that he doesn't view him or any race car driver as an athlete and places Nascar drivers in the same category as golfers and kickers- the non athletes of professional sports! Bubba fires back that Channing could never do what he does on any level and would look like a scared cat behind the wheel. <br /><br />Fred expresses his admiration for the craft and the pressure of driving 175mph for hours with no breaks and perfect concentration while the group poses the question asking if the thought of dying comes into play as he gets behind the wheel every Sunday.<br /><br />Bubba relates racing to football in the sense that you never know when it could be your last drive, so you give it all you have and never live in fear. After busting Bubba's chops about left turns, not being able to use the bathroom during races and the lifestyle of drivers, Channing changes his tone sharing his utmost respect for Bubba as the person who will forever be associated with changing the sport of Nascar through cultural impact and being a role model for children all over the world. Bubba is the Tiger Woods of racing because of forever changing the scope of the sport and history.  <br /><br />Chef Nancie, a fan of Nascar most of her life, is excited to have Bubba on the episode and surprises him with his favorite meal based on doing her research. Of course this leads to the Ocho vs Science debate and what we put in our body vs what we don't. <br /><br />Buckle up and prepare to go fast as this discussion will lead you on a journey into a world you'll love to learn more about.  <br /><br />I Am Athlete podcast is a candid, unscripted weekly discussion between former <b>NFL</b> greats: <b>Brandon Marshall</b>, <b>Chad Johnson</b>, <b>Fred Taylor</b> and<b> Channing Crowder</b>.  These gridiron giants pull no punches and have no filter while expressing themselves on the importance of the issues and topics they cover. Each week the podcast is growing in popularity and its subscribers due to the panelists frankness in sharing their thoughts and views on relevant topics covered each week.<br /><br /><b>A new episode premieres every Monday at 12pm Eastern.</b><br /><br />I AM ATHLETE is a thought provoking and in-depth podcast that offers multiple perspectives<br />on subjects ranging from sports to controversial topics to fashion to lifestyle covering all cultural conversations and building a platform to educate but encourage viewers to engage.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Switching gears, I Am Athlete takes a left turn and joins Nascar in telling the story of the Best Season Ever starting off the I Am Nascar series sitting down with Bubba Wallace. The discussion tracks over various topics including the highly-publicized incident where a noose was found in Bubba&apos;s garage, NASCAR’s confederate flag controversy, what it&apos;s like racing for Michael Jordan and the danger of the sport itself.  But before it all gets going, Brandon asks the burning question of how does a black man fall in love with Nascar while Chad falls in love with Bubba as they bond over McDonalds being their goto.  Channing lets Bubba know right away that he doesn&apos;t view him or any race car driver as an athlete and places Nascar drivers in the same category as golfers and kickers- the non athletes of professional sports! Bubba fires back that Channing could never do what he does on any level and would look like a scared cat behind the wheel. Fred expresses his admiration for the craft and the pressure of driving 175mph for hours with no breaks and perfect concentration while the group poses the question asking if the thought of dying comes into play as he gets behind the wheel every Sunday.Bubba relates racing to football in the sense that you never know when it could be your last drive, so you give it all you have and never live in fear. After busting Bubba&apos;s chops about left turns, not being able to use the bathroom during races and the lifestyle of drivers, Channing changes his tone sharing his utmost respect for Bubba as the person who will forever be associated with changing the sport of Nascar through cultural impact and being a role model for children all over the world. Bubba is the Tiger Woods of racing because of forever changing the scope of the sport and history.  Chef Nancie, a fan of Nascar most of her life, is excited to have Bubba on the episode and surprises him with his favorite meal based on doing her research. Of course this leads to the Ocho vs Science debate and what we put in our body vs what we don&apos;t. Buckle up and prepare to go fast as this discussion will lead you on a journey into a world you&apos;ll love to learn more about.  I Am Athlete podcast is a candid, unscripted weekly discussion between former NFL greats: Brandon Marshall, Chad Johnson, Fred Taylor and Channing Crowder.  These gridiron giants pull no punches and have no filter while expressing themselves on the importance of the issues and topics they cover.

      <title>I AM Woman (S1E4)- Should A Woman Pay For A First Date?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this week's episode of I Am Woman, Alexis Stoudemire joins Michi, Sharelle and Ashley to talk about the importance of healthy relationships with partners, family and with ourselves. <br /><br />After a public but amicable divorce from longtime partner former NBA star Amare Stoudemire, Alexis stresses the importance of maintaining a friendship to be able to Co-Parent in the best manner possible. The relationships we have with others is the example we set for the younger generation especially within the household but finding time for yourself and your friends is important to the balance. Ashley tells a story of how she tries to lead  by example in all aspects of relationships not just personal ones but with business, reminding her kids always that being able to support black owned businesses is helping sustain culture and growth. <br /><br />Michi opens up about how Brandon courted her from their college days, carrying her books and showing from day one how to respect and treat a woman. That is what she enjoys sharing with her children and teaching them that this is how it's supposed to be. Sharelle, gushing about her love with Chad Johnson, is more open to new age dating of where it's ok to be the one courted as well as the one who is actually courting. She shares her opinion that if someone is not in a committed relationship, it's ok to date more than one person at a time until you find the one who gives you all that you need and want. <br /><br />The ladies are given a question from Chef Lowe, when he asks if any of them would ever pay for a first date to some strong reactions from the group. I Am Woman is a six part limited series part of the I Am Athlete platform. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On this week's episode of I Am Woman, Alexis Stoudemire joins Michi, Sharelle and Ashley to talk about the importance of healthy relationships with partners, family and with ourselves. <br /><br />After a public but amicable divorce from longtime partner former NBA star Amare Stoudemire, Alexis stresses the importance of maintaining a friendship to be able to Co-Parent in the best manner possible. The relationships we have with others is the example we set for the younger generation especially within the household but finding time for yourself and your friends is important to the balance. Ashley tells a story of how she tries to lead  by example in all aspects of relationships not just personal ones but with business, reminding her kids always that being able to support black owned businesses is helping sustain culture and growth. <br /><br />Michi opens up about how Brandon courted her from their college days, carrying her books and showing from day one how to respect and treat a woman. That is what she enjoys sharing with her children and teaching them that this is how it's supposed to be. Sharelle, gushing about her love with Chad Johnson, is more open to new age dating of where it's ok to be the one courted as well as the one who is actually courting. She shares her opinion that if someone is not in a committed relationship, it's ok to date more than one person at a time until you find the one who gives you all that you need and want. <br /><br />The ladies are given a question from Chef Lowe, when he asks if any of them would ever pay for a first date to some strong reactions from the group.

Cam explains how he found the process of missing the offseason instrumental to getting in sync with his team and a lesson in why the little things are big things in the end. Brandon doesn't shy away from him talking about his up and down play during this past season while calling him out for it on air a few times.

      <title>I AM ATHLETE (S2E23) | I AM Black: What Should I Do With My Money?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In a special edition of I Am Athlete, We are celebrating Black History Month with our I Am Black Series, highlighting the everyday success of black men and women. In this episode, the guys sit down with former NFL All Pro Adewale Ogunleye who transitioned from football into becoming UBS's Head of Global Sports and Entertainment, the #1 Wealth Management Entity in the world. </p><p>Brandon, Fred and Channing come ready to take notes and ask questions about mistakes they have made and finding a different way to look at finances and long term investments. Wale said during his playing days, he realized that the failure of financial advisors to speak athletes' language was leaving many athletes and young people vulnerable to bad advice. After his playing days were finished, he invested in a future to help athletes and entertainers find a better way. </p><p>Wale tells Brandon and Fred that, "Money in families show flow from the top down, but when athletes make it, the problem is, it goes from them upward, which is where things get out of sorts," while Channing agrees it starts with how people are raised and the communities they are from. </p><p>In celebration of other black Chefs and entrepreneurs, Chef Nancie invites Shawn Williams, the owner of strictly wings and Magic Soul Food, who shares his story on how he started from the ground up spurring his love for cooking into owning 13 different restaurants. Shawn is very candid about his mission to prove people wrong when so many doubted that he wouldn't be able to succeed. <br /><br />I Am Athlete podcast is candid, unscripted weekly discussion between former <b>NFL</b> greats: <b>Brandon Marshall</b>, <b>Chad Johnson</b>, <b>Fred Taylor</b> and<b> Channing Crowder</b>.  These gridiron giants pull no punches and have no filter while expressing themselves on the importance of the issues and topics they cover.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Beside every good man is a strong woman...Welcome to the I Am Woman Podcast!<br />Getting to know the woman beside the man! <br /><br />In a spin off from her husbands’s show Michi Marshall leads a discussion about the balance between working, marriage and motherhood, getting personal and candid about the obstacles they face balancing it all. Sitting down with Aja Crowder, Sharelle Rosado and Ashley Wheeler, the ladies open up their lives and share their journey in this new limited series. <br /><br />On this first episode, we hear how the women found love and commitment with their significant others and how they’ve made it work through the ups and downs of their husband’s NFL careers. But before they were wives and mothers, we learn about them as driven women on a mission. Sharelle and Ashley talk about their time serving in the Army and their experiences as minority women in a man’s world while Aja tackles finding independence in real-estate and Michi opens up about her passion for mental health and her initial aspirations in design, which ultimately led her to creating the House Of Athlete lifestyle apparel line. <br /><br />Adding a little spice to the episode, the ladies are treated to a visit from House Of Athlete’s own Chef Lowe who prepares them a delicious meal and also shares his admiration for strong women in leadership, especially in the era of our new Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

Sharelle and Ashley talk about their time serving in the Army and their experiences as minority women in a man’s world while Aja tackles finding independence in real-estate and Michi opens up about her passion for mental health and her initial aspirations in design, which ultimately led her to creating the House Of Athlete lifestyle apparel line. <br /><br />Adding a little spice to the episode, the ladies are treated to a visit from House Of Athlete’s own Chef Lowe who prepares them a delicious meal and also shares his admiration for strong women in leadership, especially in the era of our new Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

      <title>I AM ATHLETE (S2E21) | Road To The Super Bowl: A Year In Review</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On Episode 21, It's the  Super Bowl of the series for I Am Athlete, marking the end of season 2....but what's supposed to be the season 2 finale turns into a conversation on how to keep the series going and explore new topics. <br /><br />Picking up from last episode, Channing immediately starts talking about women's sports and says no matter how talented or respected female athletes are, they still won't get their fair share of stardom and money. Brandon and Chad disagree, saying now is the time (more than ever) to elevate women in sports.  <br /><br />The animated conversation shifts to reflecting back on the past 20 episodes of the season and how far the show has come. Some of the more hilarious and memorable moments come to the forefront, including Fred earning the “Mr. 55-50” moniker, “Ocho over science” and Channing's “here kitty kitty” story, before Crowder kicks off a talk about what it means for the podcast to discuss money in the way that they do.<br /><br />Referring to the guys as, "The old uncles on the front porch", Channing reflects on how the series has positively impacted so many lives and what people have taken away from each episode. Chad chimes in that the greatest teacher in life is experience while Fred opens up about how being vulnerable has shed light on a different side of athletes, letting the world know, "we are just like you at home".  Authenticity and vulnerability keeps everything relatable, says Chad. <br /><br />In the spirit of the finale, Brandon pops a bottle of Dom Perignon for a toast as Chef Nancie, Channing, Chad and Fred give their final thoughts. This episode is the second part of the Season 2 Series Finale...But stay tuned, as Brandon shares his vision to keep the conversation going and spreads the word for upcoming plans of the I Am Athlete platform expanding. </p>

      <title>I AM ATHLETE (S2E20) | Chad vs. Current NFL &amp; WNBA Stars</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On Episode 20, the Season 2 Finale begins! On Part 1, Brandon and Chad sit down with two of the NFL's top wide receivers, D.K. Metcalf and Justin Jefferson along with WNBA star Lexi Brown and the conversation covers everything from sports to finances to personal relationships...with the hard hitting question being, "Do you eat McDonalds"??<br /><br />Chad challenges the younger receivers- saying anything they can do, he can do better with a funny yet confident rebuttal from Metcalf and Jefferson that brings Chad to tears (and uncontrollable laughter). As Channing and Fred listen to the conversation from Brandon jumps in and asks each of the three young athletes what they spend their money on and to talk about their first big purchases. Immediately the pay scale between women sports vs mens is apparent as the guys listen to Lexi describe her experiences playing in the WNBA. <br /><br />Turning to a more serious tone, Brandon and Chad ask what it's been like playing during COVID and how they have handled it personally and professionally as well as the pressures and heartaches felt with sports and social injustice. As Lexi describes life in the bubble, Chad keeps it light letting Jefferson know COVID protocol saved his wallet from rookie dinners and first-year teammate hazing duties. <br /><br />And on the sly, but obvious to everyone, Chad plays matchmaker connecting the dots that both Lexi and Justin play for Minnesota teams and have compatible cell phone providers so he just wanted to point that out to each incase they were wondering. Changing the subject fast, the show wraps up with the athletes listing the top players in their respective sports. <br /><br />This episode is Part 1 of the Season 2 Series Finale...Part 2 with Brandon, Chad, Fred, Channing and Chef releases Monday, Feb 1st at Noon eastern. </p>

Brandon, Fred and Channing are joined by Coach Hue Jackson and Ese Ighedosa to discuss the hopefulness represented in the messaging from the inauguration.  Although it marks positive strides for our nation, disappointment looms that zero minority head coaches have been hired despite all the efforts for change.  The conversation is full of raw emotions as the panel tries to put into words why the NFL can't seem to get it right, highlighting that both championship match ups feature teams led by highly touted coordinators, who are successful minority men. Tune in to listen to first hand knowledge about  these times and inside perspective on the current state of the NFL and where it goes from here. <br /><br />I Am Athlete podcast is candid, unscripted weekly discussion between former <b>NFL</b> greats: <b>Brandon Marshall</b>, <b>Chad Johnson</b>, <b>Fred Taylor</b> and<b> Channing Crowder</b>.  These gridiron giants pull no punches and have no filter while expressing themselves on the importance of the issues and topics they cover. Each week the podcast is growing in popularity and its subscribers due to the panelists frankness in sharing their thoughts and views on relevant topics covered each week.<br /><br /><b>A new episode premieres every Monday at 12pm Eastern.</b><br /><br />I AM ATHLETE is a thought provoking and in-depth podcast that offers multiple perspectives<br />on subjects ranging from sports to controversial topics to fashion to lifestyle covering all cultural conversations and building a platform to educate but encourage viewers to engage.</p>

      <title>I AM ATHLETE (S2E19) | Michael Vick Talks CTE &amp; Adversity</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On Episode 19, Michael Vick joins the I Am Athlete crew and the guys talk about everything from CTE, to adversity to passing the torch when the game is no longer your game.  </p><p>Brandon opens up about watching a film his former teammate directed about CTE and asks the guys if they are willing to donate their brain to science...an eerie silence fills the room, as they all realize the hits and damage over the years. Posing the question, if the guys would let their young children play the sport, Channing and Brandon say no while Chad, Fred and Mike don't feel you should live life by what ifs and wouldn't stop their children. Channing shares what it was like watching his former friend and NFL teammate Junior Seau suffer the effects of CTE and the tragedy surrounding the illness. </p><p>Fred talks adversity over the years and turns to Vick who opens up about the challenges he's faced and assuming responsibility instead of putting the blame on others. Channing doesn't miss the chance to bust Fred for being squeaky clean and staying out of the headlines when he shares a story that's peanuts in comparison to what the rest of the guys went through. </p><p>Yet no episode seems complete without a Chad and Brandon battle, and this week it's about Cam Newton's future in the NFL. Chad insists Cam will stay in New England while Brandon says no team will take him as a starter which leads into Vick describing what it was like to pass the torch to the younger generation of quarterbacks and when he knew it was time to hang up his cleats. <br /><br />Chef Nancie shows her NFL innocence when she can't place Vick with any of the teams he played for and the crew, in disbelief, break out into laughter as she answers. But Vick remains impressed that Chef knows who his wife is and says that's all that matters. </p><p>I Am Athlete podcast is candid, unscripted weekly discussion between former <b>NFL</b> greats: <b>Brandon Marshall</b>, <b>Chad Johnson</b>, <b>Fred Taylor</b> and<b> Channing Crowder</b>.  These gridiron giants pull no punches and have no filter while expressing themselves on the importance of the issues and topics they cover.

Deestroying shares his internet perspective and experience of having to choose between his NFL dreams and being a Youtube personality.  <br /><br />Channing, who doesn't think highly of kickers as athletes, is in disbelief that Deestroying gave up being a NFL kicker to make videos on the internet while Fred, Brandon and Chad understand that he did what was best for him at the time. The discussion takes a turn to sacred time and leads to a hilarious trip down memory lane of Channing and Chad reminiscing about curiosity and seeing things they couldn't unsee!<br /><br />Bringing it back to sports, Fred and Brandon discuss longevity of NFL careers and how young players need to be more proactive taking care of their bodies and minds, Chad blatantly disagrees on certain aspects. He challenges what Brandon is saying and the conversation quickly turns personal and emotional as Chad visibly gets upset and doesn't back down from Brandon.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>On Episode 17, the guys are split on the Dwayne Haskins situation as Chad and Channing feel for the former first round pick after his release while Fred and Brandon say his actions were reckless giving the opportunity he had and the disregard he showed his head coach and organization. <br /><br />Violating COVID protocol is a serious matter and disrespectful to people suffering from the effects; as Brandon opens up about his own recent battle with the virus which led to an onset of mental health issues and panic attacks that found him wandering his street in the middle of the night with fear and sadness. <br /><br />As the guys discuss their aspirations and plans for 2021, Chad chimes in that he doesn’t believe in new year’s resolutions but rather if people do whatever they want everyday then they’ll be happy. Fred takes a more reflective approach and says it’s about creating the life you want to live and even those who look like they have it together (referring to himself) always have room to grow. Channing keeps it light sharing his plan to fix his teeth while Brandon, makes it personal- striving to be a better husband and a man of faith which leads into a deeper conversation about understanding the love language partners desire. <br /><br />Chef Nancie is joined by her youngest daughter this week who opens up about watching her mom’s journey and shares it’s never too late to become who you want to be. <br /><br />I Am Athlete podcast is candid, unscripted weekly discussion between former <b>NFL</b> greats: <b>Brandon Marshall</b>, <b>Chad Johnson</b>, <b>Fred Taylor</b> and<b> Channing Crowder</b>.  These gridiron giants pull no punches and have no filter while expressing themselves on the importance of the issues and topics they cover.
