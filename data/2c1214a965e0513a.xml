   <media:description>This is the first video in what I hope you will find to be a useful and interesting series on the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), a well known conjecture in pure math which is related to the distribution of prime numbers (among an enormous amount of other things that I plan to discuss).

Notes / Corrections:

At 2:10, the upper limit of the sum should be ‚åälog‚ÇÇ(x)‚åã, not just log‚ÇÇ(x)  (obviously it should be an integer!).

   <media:description>--- CORRECTIONS ---

At 5:30, I meant to say -œÄ to œÄ.

I would also like to point out that the integral around the complex unit circle described at 7:55 is of course a particularly &quot;nice&quot; one - I meant to demonstrate that an integral of the function (1/z) over ùôñùô£ùôÆ simply closed contour containing zero is equal to 2œÄi. However, I clearly did not show that was the case if you changed the radius of the circle or deformed it into another shape (without having it intersect itself). I encourage you to verify for yourself that the integral's value ùôôùô§ùôöùô® ùô£ùô§ùô© ùôòùôùùôñùô£ùôúùôö given the application of either one of these transformations and does in fact remain equal to 2œÄi. What I should have mentioned was that regions of the plane where a function is holomorphic correspond to conservative Polya vector fields, so the path of integration does not matter as long as the number of poles contained within our closed contour remains constant.

The variable √ü, which I mistook for the Greek letter Beta (Œ≤), is actually called ùòåùò¥ùòªùò¶ùòµùòµ and is used in German orthography.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This video is my (obviously horribly rushed) submission to 3blue1brown's &quot;Summer of Math Exposition&quot; contest.

The Polya vector fields were animated with Manim. Everything else was made in Adobe Premiere Pro.

I was planning to make a revision of this video, but I think that this more comprehensive overview of Polya vector fields makes up for what I don't discuss here:

   <media:description>This video goes over a few means of visualizing complex-valued functions/transformations, including domain coloring, modular surfaces and Riemann surfaces. The information provided isn't completely comprehensive and not at all rigorous, but hopefully will give you at least a little bit of insight and interest in the math for which these visuals are involved.

I should mention that the definition of a Riemann surface I gave at 15:09 is a na√Øve one - what I showed were examples of Riemann surfaces, however they don't have to necessarily be a plot of the imaginary/real component of some function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface). Also, as pointed out in the comments, the function in the blue box at 3:08 (arctan[Im(z)/Re(z)]) only works within quadrants 1 and 4. In general one would need a function like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2
