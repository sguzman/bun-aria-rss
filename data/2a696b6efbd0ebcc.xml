The U.S. House of Representatives Has Never Been Less Representative

When Congress first met in 1789, there were 59 Representatives in the House of Representatives, and on average, each of those 59 represented around 34,000 people.

In the following decades, American voters often got to choose multiple candidates to represent them in the House, in either at-large elections or in multi-member districts.

And then, there were two notable laws passed by Congress that made the House way less representative.

First, the Apportionment Act of 1842 basically said there had to be congressional districts, each with only one representative. Later the Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929 capped the number of representatives in the House to 435 members‚Ä¶.ALWAYS‚Ä¶NO MATTER HOW BIG THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES EVER GETS.

Today, each House member represents, on average, around 759,000 people.</media:description>

In mid-July 2022, Mr. Beat called every voting member of the U.S. House of Representatives, mostly pretending like he was a constituent of their district. He collected their responses and here are the results. For a more detailed look at responses, here is the spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPYWmmEy2P13xI0KptkkGW2rjeXXGPNrxAuW30IbpsE/edit?usp=sharing 
It's a working document, meaning he'll keep updating it if he gets more responses.

#uscongress #ushouse #politicalscience 

I‚Äôve always thought the House of Representatives was the part of the federal government MOST directly connected with ordinary people. After this experience, that‚Äôs not true at all.

I assumed I would get way more responses.

I do get why Representatives can‚Äôt make much time for constituents. The average Representative is supposed to represent 759,000 people. But as I said in my follow-up video to calling every Senator, I KNOW these Representatives make time for their campaign donors, and I KNOW they make time for lobbyists who bribe them. So I ask again‚Ä¶why can‚Äôt they make time for us?

This whole experience of calling every member of Congress has caused me to question everything about how our federal government is supposed to function. I used to naively believe that we truly lived in a constitutional republic, just like I used to teach my students in Government class. But these Representatives don‚Äôt seem to represent us much at all.

I've heard your so-called &quot;best&quot; arguments to keep the Electoral College for four years, and all of them are weak and pathetic. Sorry, the Electoral College still sucks. Get rid of it or reform it.

#electoralcollege #voting #votingrights 

As it turns out, and I can‚Äôt stress this enough, Electoral College defenders DO like democracy. They think it‚Äôs great. They like ordinary people like you and me having power and having a voice. THEY want to be heard. I‚Äôve heard your arguments to keep the Electoral College for four years now. But every single one of your arguments are so weak and predictable that they‚Äôre kind of boring at this point. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt understand how presidential elections were supposed to go. It's that how they were supposed to go sucks and needs to change. Again, no, this doesn‚Äôt mean I want a DIRECT democracy. I want a true REPRESENTATIVE democracy.</media:description>

Here are the three biggest things I just can‚Äôt get past that prevent Abraham Lincoln from being the top of my Best Presidents list:

#1 Lincoln abused the First Amendment. His administration arrested journalists and newspaper publishers who criticized his handling of the Civil War. 
#2 Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus. His administration threw many ordinary citizens in jail WITHOUT arrest warrants. The people detained often didn‚Äôt know why they were arrested or how they could challenge it.
#3 Lincoln made things worse for Native Americans. He signed laws that gave away millions of acres of tribal land. He approved mass executions of Indian warriors and multiple Indian massacres happened under his watch.

Mississippi arguably is the worst state when it comes to voting rights. Why?

Well, if you've been convicted in Mississippi of one of these 22 crimes, you may never get your right to vote back again, even after serving your prison sentence. Yep, even for bigamy, which just means getting married to someone when you‚Äôre still married to someone else.

Now, there are two ways someone who has been convicted of one of those 22 crimes can POSSIBLY get their right to vote back.

They can either receive a pardon directly from the governor OR, and this is kinda crazy, convince the Mississippi legislature to pass a law specifically granting them the right to vote again. And of course this only passes if 2/3 of both houses of the legislature approve of it.
And that is VERY unlikely to happen.

Today, around 93% of Mississippi residents who have committed one of those 22 crimes AND already served their time CANNOT vote.</media:description>

A mayor is the elected head of a city or town, and yeah, most mayors are humans, but there have been multiple towns here in the United States with both dog and cat mayors.

Here‚Äôs Mayor Max, who sadly recently died but served as the mayor of Idyllwild, California. Probably the most famous cat mayor was Stubbs, who served as the honorary mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska.

But did you know a cat also recently served as the mayor of Hell? Yeah, and the cat didn‚Äôt even live there.

Jinx, a cat from California who became a viral internet sensation due to her big eyes and funny mannerisms, became the mayor of Hell, Michigan earlier this year for three years. You can go to Hell if you want, by the way. It has a population of 72 souls and is located about 20 miles northwest of Ann Arbor. And yes, being in Michigan, it regularly freezes over.

Now, to be fair, ANYONE can become the mayor of Hell by filling out a form and paying a small fee. Becoming mayor for one hour is just $25.</media:description>
