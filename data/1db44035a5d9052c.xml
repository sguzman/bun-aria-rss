      <title>Tatum Theories, Finals Unicorns, NBA Draft Buzz, and Worst GM Jobs With Ryen Russillo</title>
      <description>The Ringer’s Bill Simmons is joined by Ryen Russillo as they discuss their NBA big board and who they have going in the top three (02:31). As people revisit Andre Iguodala winning the 2015 Finals MVP, Bill and Ryen debate if a losing player can win a Finals MVP (27:35). They also discuss Steph Curry’s nuclear shooting that lifted the Warriors to a Game 4 victory and if there is such a thing as a Finals unicorn (34:47). Next, they dive into Jayson Tatum’s Finals struggles (52:44). Is he really injured or is he simply showing his young age against an experienced veteran team? Draymond Green has been consistently bad in the Finals and Ryen presents a theory to why Green hasn’t been able to get it going (01:09:50). Lastly, they list which GM positions in the NBA are the worst and why (01:15:17).

      <title>Two Big NBA Deals Plus a Super Bowl Mega-Gambling Preview With Cousin Sal and Peter Schrager</title>
      <description>The Ringer’s Bill Simmons shares his thoughts on two significant NBA trades: the Kings trading Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield, and Tristan Thompson to the Pacers for Domantas Sabonis, Jeremy Lamb, Justin Holiday, and a 2027 second-round pick; and the Pelicans trading Josh Hart, Tomas Satoransky, Nickeil Walker-Alexander, Didi Louzada, and draft picks to the Trial Blazers for CJ McCollum, Larry Nance Jr., and Tony Snell (2:06). Then Bill is joined by Cousin Sal to discuss the Bengals' improbable postseason run before kicking around a TON of Super Bowl prop bets (15:54). Then Bill is joined by NFL Network's Peter Schrager to make the case for both the Bengals and Rams to win Super Bowl 56 and discuss likely narratives following a Super Bowl win for either team (58:44) before making the Million-Dollar Picks in a last-ditch effort to come away with a winning gambling season (1:37:42).
