            <description><![CDATA[<p>Glenn Ligon is a renowned artist who gives us new ways of seeing American history, literature, and society. How can we see him better through the lens of childhood? In this episode of <em>Your Hometown, </em>Glenn speaks with Kevin Burke about his experiences growing up in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 70s, including his hour-and-a-half commute each way to Walden, the private school he attended on the Upper West Side from the first grade on. His mother made going to Walden possible for Glenn and his brother, and it involved sacrifices and risks. A commute is one thing. Where it can lead, another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How would this change the landscape for Glenn and his family? Where would Glenn most feel at home, outside and inside, in his New York? Where would he feel safe, or watched, or like a stranger? And how does a city like New York, with its layer upon layer of construction, class, and culture, define not just the literal paths we take growing up, but the existential ones?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the story of an &ldquo;inquiring mind&rdquo; who happens to be a journalist. Sewell Chan is the new editor-in-chief of <em>The Texas Tribune.</em> But before his move to Austin, and before his previous roles at the <em>L.A. Times,</em> the <em>New York Times,</em> and the <em>Washington Post,</em> he was a kid growing up in an immigrant family in the outer boroughs of New York City, where his father drove a taxicab. Both his parents had seen a lot in their lives &ndash; but said little. Their New York was the New York of work, of their community, and of striving for a quiet, peaceful place to live, which ended up being in Queens. Yet when you meet Sewell, it's surprising that he came from such a quiet place, because he&rsquo;s so engaged with the world, with history, with how people live and how things work. In this episode, Kevin Burke talks with Sewell about his coming-of-age years in New York, the meaning of home, and what the windows and doors were from where his family lived out to the larger world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the story of an &ldquo;inquiring mind&rdquo; who happens to be a journalist. Sewell Chan is the new editor-in-chief of <em>The Texas Tribune.</em> But before his move to Austin, and before his previous roles at the <em>L.A. Times,</em> the <em>New York Times,</em> and the <em>Washington Post,</em> he was a kid growing up in an immigrant family in the outer boroughs of New York City, where his father drove a taxicab. Both his parents had seen a lot in their lives &ndash; but said little. Their New York was the New York of work, of their community, and of striving for a quiet, peaceful place to live, which ended up being in Queens. Yet when you meet Sewell, it's surprising that he came from such a quiet place, because he&rsquo;s so engaged with the world, with history, with how people live and how things work. In this episode, Kevin Burke talks with Sewell about his coming-of-age years in New York, the meaning of home, and what the windows and doors were from where his family lived out to the larger world.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Tiffany Cab&aacute;n captured national headlines when she came within a hair&rsquo;s breadth of winning the primary for district attorney in her hometown of Queens, New York, in 2019. It was an audacious move: a young, out-of-nowhere candidate running in her home borough against the establishment on a platform calling for major changes to the system. Snatching a moral victory from the jaws of electoral defeat, Tiffany kept speaking out. Two years later, she&rsquo;s just won a seat on the New York City Council, where she will have a voice in the debate about what kind of hometown New York wants to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this interview, host Kevin Burke talks with Tiffany about her coming-of-age story and what she experienced back there that made her someone who gets up and chooses to march on the front lines, has the skills to organize &ndash; and then has the fire in her soul to throw her whole being into fighting for what she believes in. This is a show about diving down to the first act in the life of a person &ndash; in this case, a person who sees something and is moved to do something about it. It&rsquo;s a search for the people in her life who saw her and did something, and how she learned to stand up for herself and for others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a larger sense, it&rsquo;s also about grace&mdash;the kind of mercy and compassionate understanding we find ourselves asking for and being asked to give in our lives&mdash;and whether that kind of grace, born of experience, can become the foundation for how we relate to each other.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>David Johansen is one of the all-time front&nbsp;men in music and an artist who keeps changing the game &ndash; not by degrees but by solar systems. In the 1980s, he had everyone feeling &ldquo;Hot, Hot, Hot&rdquo; as Buster Poindexter. Then he showed up as the taxi-driving Ghost of Christmas Past in the Bill Murray film <em>Scrooged.</em> Before all this, he was the glammed-up lead singer of The New York Dolls, the mythic rock band of the downtown NYC scene of the 1970s. Hard rock, punk rock, glam rock, heavy metal &ndash; the Dolls sit atop a lot of family trees.

            <itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[David Johansen is one of the all-time front men in music and an artist who keeps changing the game – not by degrees but by solar systems. In the 1980s, he had everyone feeling “Hot, Hot, Hot” as Buster Poindexter. Then he showed up as the taxi-driving Ghost of Christmas Past in the Bill Murray film Scrooged. Before all this, he was the glammed-up lead singer of The New York Dolls, the mythic rock band of the downtown NYC scene of the 1970s. Hard rock, punk rock, glam rock, heavy metal – the Dolls sit atop a lot of family trees. To this day, whatever room he walks into, from loft spaces to the swanky Café Carlyle, David Johansen owns it.

                        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Part two of David Johansen’s Your Hometown episode is the portrait of an artist in the process of becoming. If Staten Island was the setting of David’s coming of age, Manhattan would him into his next act. Hear David talk with host Kevin Burke about living in the East Village, the early days of the New York Dolls, the birth of Buster Poindexter, and performing at the Café Carlyle. David’s hometown journey is an invitation to dive into what it means to be an artist and to find what in their origins stories is knowable and what remains enigmatic – even to them – as they continue looking around the corner, following their instincts and their muses.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Emmy-winning writer and actress&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;Manzano,&nbsp;who played &ldquo;Maria&rdquo; on <em>Sesame Street</em> for more than 40 years, talks to host&nbsp;Kevin Burke&nbsp;about growing up in the South Bronx and how she draws on the &ldquo;love and chaos&rdquo; of her childhood to teach children&mdash;something she&rsquo;s still doing through her new animated series for PBS Kids, <em>Alma&rsquo;s Way.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Filmed in Manhattan and Queens, <em>Sesame Street</em> wasn&rsquo;t that far from Sonia&rsquo;s own hometown in New York City. <em>Sesame Street</em> is a fictional place that evokes city life from the stoop to the subway and apartments above stores. But Sonia grew up in the very real place of the South Bronx&mdash;most vividly on Third Avenue near Crotona Park. How different was Sonia&rsquo;s New York from the one she helped to create as Maria? On our TVs, Sonia gave us something we needed: a feeling of love and safety, empathy and imagination. Where did she find these things when she was a kid?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a two-part episode. In the first part, Sonia takes us from the world of <em>Sesame Street</em>&mdash;actually, her audition&mdash;back to her beginnings in the South Bronx. And in part two, she explains how she got from the Bronx to <em>Sesame Street</em> and lived a second childhood as an adult with experiences to share. So, &ldquo;come and play&rdquo; and &ldquo;sweep the clouds away&rdquo; &ndash; by listening to one of the truest teachers you&rsquo;ll find in New York or any hometown.</p>

            <itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Emmy-winning writer and actress Sonia Manzano, who played “Maria” on Sesame Street for more than 40 years, talks to host Kevin Burke about growing up in the South Bronx and how she draws on the “love and chaos” of her childhood to teach children—something she’s still doing through her new animated series for PBS Kids, Alma’s Way. 
 
Filmed in Manhattan and Queens, Sesame Street wasn’t that far from Sonia’s own hometown in New York City. Sesame Street is a fictional place that evokes city life from the stoop to the subway and apartments above stores. But Sonia grew up in the very real place of the South Bronx—most vividly on Third Avenue near Crotona Park. How different was Sonia’s New York from the one she helped to create as Maria? On our TVs, Sonia gave us something we needed: a feeling of love and safety, empathy and imagination. Where did she find these things when she was a kid?
 
This is a two-part episode. In the first part, Sonia takes us from the world of Sesame Street—actually, her audition—back to her beginnings in the South Bronx. And in part two, she explains how she got from the Bronx to Sesame Street and lived a second childhood as an adult with experiences to share. So, “come and play” and “sweep the clouds away” – by listening to one of the truest teachers you’ll find in New York or any hometown.

For more than 40 years, she was our neighbor, Maria, on <em>Sesame Street,</em> and she continues to connect her experiences and imagination through her new show for PBS Kids,<em> Alma&rsquo;s Way. </em>In Part Two of her <em>Your Hometown</em> episode, she talks with host Kevin Burke about how she made her way from her coming of age in the South Bronx to <em>Sesame Street</em> and how the real and fictional maps of those neighborhoods &ndash; one real, one imaginary &ndash; overlapped inside of her and in the TV worlds she created for us. As a magical storyteller, Sonia knows just where to go in her memories for that powerful combination of laughter amid pathos &ndash; the funny in the sad, the lessons in the every-day.</p>

“You will hardly know who I am or what I mean, But I shall be good health to you nevertheless, And filter and fibre your blood.
 
“Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged, Missing me one place search another, I stop somewhere waiting for you.”

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Suzanne Vega is that rare singer-songwriter whose work becomes part of the soundtrack of their hometown -- in her case, New York City. In this episode, Suzanne illuminates her childhood in East Harlem in the 1970s and how her experiences of the city, inside and out, flow through her work, even as she embraces the freedom to write from different perspectives. Suzanne's latest album is "An Evening of New York Songs and Stories," and as she discusses such songs as "Luka," "Gypsy," "Tom's Diner," and "Zephyr &amp; I," we meet an artist fully alive to the truths of her coming of age and to the souls that linger in an urban landscape layered by time and memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, when "Luka," a song about child abuse from a young boy's point of view, was first released in the 1980s, Suzanne shied away from questions about whether she was writing from experience or imagination. Not only was it a matter of artistic principle, but as she reveals, she also was afraid of what her stepfather, the novelist Ed Vega, might think. All these years later, Suzanne talks as never before about her personal connections to "Luka" and how its truth spoke to other people's truths.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Sherrilyn Ifill walks into court with history behind her as president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal and Educational Defense Fund. It&rsquo;s the legal arm of the civil rights movement, and Sherrilyn is in its vanguard. Her hometown is Jamaica, Queens, a neighborhood in New York City where she grew up in the 1960s and '70s. That&rsquo;s what Kevin Burke explores with her in this conversation, starting with the first question Sherrilyn asks whenever she takes on a new legal case: &ldquo;Tell me about the history of this place.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because she knows every town has one: the layers of time, buried and built over, that reveal why things are the way they are, from the bulldozing of Black neighborhoods to make way for highways to brutal acts of violence like lynchings, erased from the public square and, over time, memory. Sherrilyn wants us to see these scars of history all around us and how they impact the struggle for equal justice in America. She&rsquo;s compared this process of discovery to swallowing the red pill in the sci-fi action film, <em>The Matrix. </em>Once you see the past in the present, you can&rsquo;t unsee it. What is the connection between Sherrilyn&rsquo;s civil rights work and her powerful personal story and all she experienced in her New York?</p>

That&rsquo;s what Kevin Burke explores with her in this conversation, starting with the first question Sherrilyn asks whenever she takes on a new legal case: &ldquo;Tell me about the history of this place.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because she knows every town has one: the layers of time, buried and built over, that reveal why things are the way they are, from the bulldozing of Black neighborhoods to make way for highways to brutal acts of violence like lynchings, erased from the public square and, over time, memory. Sherrilyn wants us to see these scars of history all around us and how they impact the struggle for equal justice in America. She&rsquo;s compared this process of discovery to swallowing the red pill in the sci-fi action film, <em>The Matrix. </em>Once you see the past in the present, you can&rsquo;t unsee it. What is the connection between Sherrilyn&rsquo;s civil rights work and her powerful personal story and all she experienced in her New York?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest is the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose activism has made him a fixture in the press for decades in his hometown of New York City. Lately, though, we often see him as the eulogist at funeral after funeral of those taken too soon through violence. He does it with enormous grace and power, including after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020. And there&rsquo;s a reason for that. As Rev. Sharpton explains to Kevin Burke in this rare interview, there&rsquo;s a traumatic incident that happened to him a long time ago, when he was 9 years old, that gives him the ability to speak to children who are in pain, because there is a pain deep inside of him that permanently shaped the arc of his formation as a preacher and future civil rights leader. It&rsquo;s a story he doesn&rsquo;t tell often, because it&rsquo;s so surprising and unexpected, but in this episode, you&rsquo;ll hear him share it in the most personal way. In listening, you&rsquo;ll also gain an understanding that may forever alter the way you see this icon of our times.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Maria Bartiromo anchors three different shows on the Fox Business Network and Fox News Channel and was the first TV reporter to broadcast live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the most well-known scientists on the planet. In addition to authoring numerous books, he hosts the wildly popular podcast, <em>StarTalk, </em>and has helped revive the epic TV series <em>Cosmos </em>that originated with Carl Sagan, whom he met when he was in high school. Neil is also the director of the world-renowned Hayden Planetarium, part of the Rose Center for Earth and Space that he helped launch at the American Museum of Natural History in his hometown of New York City. In this episode of <em>Your Hometown, </em>we turn a giant lens on the galaxy of Neil&rsquo;s childhood to explore the origins of his mission to make science fun and intelligible to the public. What inspired him as a kid growing up in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in an apartment complex called, of all things, the Skyview? What were the forces that propelled him, and what were the barriers he had to push through to achieve his dreams?</p>

                        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the most well-known scientists on the planet. In addition to authoring numerous books, he hosts the wildly popular podcast, StarTalk, and has helped revive the epic TV series Cosmos that originated with Carl Sagan, whom he met when he was in high school. Neil is also the director of the world-renowned Hayden Planetarium, part of the Rose Center for Earth and Space that he helped launch at the American Museum of Natural History in his hometown of New York City. In this episode of Your Hometown, we turn a giant lens on the galaxy of Neil’s childhood to explore the origins of his mission to make science fun and intelligible to the public. What inspired him as a kid growing up in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in an apartment complex called, of all things, the Skyview? What were the forces that propelled him, and what were the barriers he had to push through to achieve his dreams?

If you think of the biggest celebrities on the style pages today, you&rsquo;re likely to find a photo of them wearing her designs.&nbsp; She describes the line &ndash; which shares her name, Danielle Guizio &ndash; as &ldquo;celebrating the modern-day woman who aims to deviate from the traditional and push boundaries in all aspects of life.&rdquo; She has even revived the corset, which Ariana Grande wore in black satin on the set of her music video for &ldquo;7 Rings.&rdquo; Because of her age, one might assume Danielle came to her success in a straight line. But as we hear in her interview with host Kevin Burke, Danielle&rsquo;s coming of age was more jagged and uncertain, filled with experiences that brought her face-to-face with some scary and ugly sides of life.&nbsp; Out of all this, she placed her big bet on designing clothes that make young women like her, as she says, feel confident and strong.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Lynn Nottage is the first woman ever to win two Pulitzer Prizes for Drama, and she&rsquo;s one of the most important voices writing for the stage and screen today, with works that include <em>Infinite Apparel, Crumbs from the Table of Joy, Ruined, Sweat, </em>and <em>MJ: The Musical, </em>an upcoming show on the life of Michael Jackson. She often writes about characters in private, intimate spaces, where and how real people really talk. It&rsquo;s a process that began in her hometown of New York City, where she was a girl growing up in the Boerum Hill section of pre-gentrified Brooklyn. On the surface, she says, it was the kind of neighborhood people passed through to get to other neighborhoods in 1970s. But to Lynn, it was <em>the</em> setting for <em>her story</em>, starting on her block and in the brownstone where her parents, Wally and Ruby Nottage, raised her and her brother and hosted family, friends, artists, and activists. There was lots of noise in the house, especially in the kitchen. Lynn still lives in that house today, a wife, mother, professor, and playwright surrounded by the memories and materials of her ancestors.</p>

                        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Lynn Nottage is the first woman ever to win two Pulitzer Prizes for Drama, and she’s one of the most important voices writing for the stage and screen today, with works that include Infinite Apparel, Crumbs from the Table of Joy, Ruined, Sweat, and MJ: The Musical, an upcoming show on the life of Michael Jackson. She often writes about characters in private, intimate spaces, where and how real people really talk. It’s a process that began in her hometown of New York City, where she was a girl growing up in the Boerum Hill section of pre-gentrified Brooklyn. On the surface, she says, it was the kind of neighborhood people passed through to get to other neighborhoods in 1970s. But to Lynn, it was the setting for her story, starting on her block and in the brownstone where her parents, Wally and Ruby Nottage, raised her and her brother and hosted family, friends, artists, and activists. There was lots of noise in the house, especially in the kitchen. Lynn still lives in that house today, a wife, mother, professor, and playwright surrounded by the memories and materials of her ancestors.

Poem
Walt Whitman, “Song of Myself,” Part 52, Leaves of Grass (1855)
 
“I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love, If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.
 
“You will hardly know who I am or what I mean, But I shall be good health to you nevertheless, And filter and fibre your blood.
 
“Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged, Missing me one place search another, I stop somewhere waiting for you.”

            <description><![CDATA[In the first of a two-part interview, Kevin Burke speaks with Darryl McDaniels, the legendary hip-hop artist from Hollis, Queens, where he and his two friends formed one of the truly pioneering groups in American music: Run-DMC. Darryl was the “DMC” in that equation, and together with Joseph “Run” Simmons and Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell, he put Hollis on the map for an entire generation. Before then, Hollis was the neighborhood where they were kids growing up in homes and on streets where the gaps between blocks sometimes felt like the borders between different kingdoms.
