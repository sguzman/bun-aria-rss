    <title>Chronic Pain and the Brain with Dr. Jeff Axelbank</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been experiencing chronic pain in my arm very recently which I attributed to overuse from playing tennis.  This conversation got me really thinking about what this injury could mean on a deeper level.  In this episode my expert guest and I explore: </p><ul><li>Can negative thoughts such as “unspeakable anger&quot; manifest as pain in our bodies?</li><li>Why is it that two people can show the same exact damage from an injury on an MRI but feel the pain in two very different ways?</li><li>What are some steps we can take to help our chronic pain go away?   </li><li>Can working through our past and present anger prevent chronic pain from emerging?</li></ul><p>My guest for this episode, Dr. Jeff Axelbank, is a psychologist and expert on chronic pain.  Dr. Axelbank is a recipient of the New Jersey Psychological Association (NJPA) Psychologist of the Year Award and the Rutgers University Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology (GSAPP) Peterson Prize for outstanding contributions to professional psychology.    Learn more about his work and practice at <a href='http://www.jeffreyaxelbankpsyd.com'>www.jeffreyaxelbankpsyd.com</a>.   Dr. Axelbank practices the Sarno approach to addressing chronic pain, of which more information can be found at <a href='http://www.tmswiki.org'>www.tmswiki.org</a>. </p><p>An additional “fun fact’ about chronic pain that I learned while preparing this podcast but didn’t have a chance to mention was the relationship between norepinephrine and pain.  Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter we produce in the brain that regulates our mood.  Certain  antidepressant medications  work by accessing  more norepinephrine. Norepinephrine travels from the brain  and through the body and <em>inhibits</em> pain in areas where it’s not useful for us to have pain, such as the stomach, joints and back.  When the body is constantly shooting messages of pain to the brain this is a stressor.  If, as a result of stress, we produce less norepinephrine to be distributed to the body, we will feel more pain in our back, joints and stomach.  This explains why antidepressant drugs like SNRIs that attempt to access more norepinephrine can be helpful for syndromes which cause joint pain and chronic pain, such as in Fibromyalgia.  </p><p>This episode is dedicated to Ginnie’s House, a non profit organization which provides100% free therapy for abused children. Learn more at <a href='http://GinniesHouse.org'>GinniesHouse.org</a>.  </p><p>If you have found value in listening to this or previous episodes, please leave Psychology America with Dr. Alexandra a rating, it truly makes a difference!  </p><p>How to leave a rating on iTunes</p><p>1) Launch Apple’s purple Podcast app in your phone<br/>2) <em>Even if you already subscribe to / have Psychology America and it is open</em>, tap “Search”<br/>3) Enter “Psychology America with Dr. Alexandra” <br/>4) Tap on the photo of the podcast<br/>5) Scroll all the way down<br/>6) Press the star rating you choose and/or tap the “write a review.”  For the highest rating tap the last star on the right first.  </p><p>Your review is appreciated!</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dralexandra">Support the show</a><p>This show was created with love on my volunteer time.

Norepinephrine travels from the brain  and through the body and <em>inhibits</em> pain in areas where it’s not useful for us to have pain, such as the stomach, joints and back.  When the body is constantly shooting messages of pain to the brain this is a stressor.  If, as a result of stress, we produce less norepinephrine to be distributed to the body, we will feel more pain in our back, joints and stomach.  This explains why antidepressant drugs like SNRIs that attempt to access more norepinephrine can be helpful for syndromes which cause joint pain and chronic pain, such as in Fibromyalgia.  </p><p>This episode is dedicated to Ginnie’s House, a non profit organization which provides100% free therapy for abused children.

    <title>Imposter Syndrome: with Lauren Todd</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>The esteemed author and poet Maya Angelou once said: “I have written eleven books, but each time I think, uh oh, they’re going to find out now. I’ve run a game on everybody , and they’re going to find me out.” Imposter Syndrome is when you feel like a phony, as if you are fooling others, and are afraid of being somehow exposed as someone who doesn’t really know what they are doing or talking about. Individuals with imposter syndrome have trouble attributing their success to their own achievement and are likely to procrastinate out of anxiety or overwork. Learn more about traits of those with Imposter Syndrome through my conversation with guest Lauren Todd. Lauren Todd, MS, is trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with a humanistic flair.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The esteemed author and poet Maya Angelou once said: “I have written eleven books, but each time I think, uh oh, they’re going to find out now. I’ve run a game on everybody , and they’re going to find me out.” Imposter Syndrome is when you feel like a phony, as if you are fooling others, and are afraid of being somehow exposed as someone who doesn’t really know what they are doing or talking about. Individuals with imposter syndrome have trouble attributing their success to their own achievement and are likely to procrastinate out of anxiety or overwork. Learn more about traits of those with Imposter Syndrome through my conversation with guest Lauren Todd. Lauren Todd, MS, is trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with a humanistic flair. She has worked with individuals across the life span at New York Presbyterian Hospital, McLean Hospital, and Integrated Care for the Underserved of Northeastern New Jersey. Lauren is in her fifth year of PhD studies of psychology at Fairleigh Dickinson University and her primary areas of interest are eating disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and life transitions, particularly among children and adolescents.

    <title>Forgiveness: a Rabbi, a Pastor and a Muslim</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I enjoyed this wonderful conversation as we explored the following profound and often perplexing questions: Why forgive? How does psychology define forgiveness and how do Judaism, Christianity and Islam see forgiveness? Does forgiving mean we are pardoning bad behavior? Do you need the offender to participate if you want to forgive? What steps can we take to forgive and how do we do it? Guests for this episode bring the perspectives of Judaism, Islam and Christianity to the topic. Rabbi Mendel Dubov serves as faculty at the Rabbinical College of America in Morristown, NJ, USA and as Director of Chabad in Sussex County, NJ. Saifulla Chaudahry serves as Propagation Secretary for Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of North Jersey. Pastor Michael Bos, Ph.D. serves as the Senior Minister of Marble Collegiate Church of New York City and is the President of the Collegiate Churches of New York. Dr. Bos established the first interfaith religious diplomacy center on the Arabian Peninsula, and received the U.S. Ambassador’s Award for Community Service. Psychology studies have found that when people forgive it decreases anxiety, depression and obsessive thinking about the offender. Multiple studies have also found that forgiveness improves mood, psychological health and the quality of one’s relationships overall. To read &amp; explore further about forgiveness , may I suggest starting with a search of psychology studies by Robert Enright and Richard Fitzgibbons. I hope you will enjoy and learn from this very special episode! If you have enjoyed Psychology America with Dr. Alexandra, there are a few ways that you can show your support: 1) visit iTunes and leave us a 5-Star rating, 2) order a book from PsychologyAmerica.com where there is a selection of books I’ve personally chosen (your order will go seamlessly through to Amazon.com) or 3) press subscribe to continue to receive new episodes. Would you like to teach your child nine and under about how to have an optimistic outlook even when things go wrong? Consider purchasing my book entitled: “There’s Always Hope: a Story About Overcoming.” It can be found on The PsychologyAmerica.com website or at Amazon.com. The beautiful illustrations were painted by Philadelphia resident, Briana Giasullo, and the book also imparts empathy for the disabled. </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dralexandra">Support the show</a><p>This show was created with love on my volunteer time.

    <title>Become More Emotionally Intelligent: A Conversation with Silja Litvin </title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Enjoy our conversation as we span a range of interesting topics within psychology, including: Can we increase our Emotional Intelligence (EQ) through an app? What is “Digital Cocaine?” What is happening with artificial intelligence and facial recognition, and what are the implications? Can we learn from micro expressions on the human face? How can we use technology to better ourselves psychologically? What can we learn from rejection? How can we effectively give others space when they need it? How can we manage “expectancy effect” or what other peoples’ expectations are of us? Why is accessing emotions important for making good decisions? How do stress responses cause long term physical problems? What is Integrated Psychology and how can psychological care help with medical problems? In this 10th Episode Of Psychology America I interview Silja Litvin, founder and CEO of Psych Apps and creator of eQuoo, an app designed to use games to increase emotional intelligence in adults. (To find this app search http://bit.ly/eQuooiPhone http://bit.ly/eQuooAndroid). This interview took place between myself in New Jersey, USA and Silja Litvin in London and we did it through a Skype call.

    <title>The Honeymoon Phase of Love: with Justine Bates-Krakoff, MS </title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>The honeymoon phase of love is one of the greatest human experiences. Learn from this episode: What is the honeymoon phase? What is happening in our brains? How long does the honeymoon phase last? How can learning about the honeymoon phase apply to smart dating? How can knowledge about the honeymoon phase inform us about marital affairs? How can the above inform us about long distance relationships? Can long term relationships keep the honeymoon phase going and how? (The answer is: yes they can!) My guest for this episode is Justine Bates-Krakoff, MS, an expert on brain-behavior relationships, including work in: a longitudinal study examining genetic, cognitive, and interpersonal vulnerability to depression, a group intervention based on The Penn Resiliency Program (PRP), an investigation on PTSD and resilience trajectories in at-risk populations following traumatic events, and internship at New York Presbyterian Hospital on an affective disorders acute inpatient unit serving adults with primary diagnoses of major depressive, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder. Justine Bates-Krakoff is currently attending Fairleigh Dickinson University, working toward a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology under the mentorship of Dr. Robert McGrath, in his positive psychology laboratory. If you haven’t had a chance please consider purchasing my new book entitled &quot;There’s Always Hope:  A Story About Overcoming,” which can be found via an Amazon Link on PsychologyAmerica.com. I wrote it with love for children nine and under. The beautiful illustrations were done by Briana Giasullo, my stepsister!

    <title>Seven Precepts for Single Parents</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Precepts 1 and 4 are especially for single parents but the rest apply to all parents. I created this list based on three things: what research has found in psychology, what I have learned from experience with my patients over fifteen years of private practice, and my own experience as a single mother of four children. Some precepts have to do with what we “do” and others have to do with what we “don’t do.” May these precepts lead to greater nurturing, love and peace in households of all types. ******************************* Do you want to teach your child about how to make the best of it even when they’re disappointed? Consider purchasing my recently published book entitled “There’s Always Hope: A Story About Overcoming” on Amazon.com or Sparta Books. I wrote it with love for children nine and under or to serve as a symbolic gift for an adult in your life who is in need of hope.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I hope you will enjoy listening to this live event, recorded at my book signing and podcast launch April 26th, 2018 in Sparta, New Jersey at Interplay Couture. After some brief introductions you will hear my talk. I was asked to speak on the topic: “There is Hope: Life Balance and Self Care” but you’re going to hear why I renamed the talk to “Commitment for Self-Care and Self Care for Commitment.” I will discuss five strategies I used to manage my energy in my quest to launch my book and podcast, as well as some of the inner obstacles I faced along the way. The following are the books and apps I referenced in the talk: The Sugar Addict’s Total Recovery Program by K. DesMaisons Stress Free for Good: 10 Scientifically Proven Life Skills for Health and Happiness by Luskin and Pelletier The Essential Rumi Translated by Barks, C. Apps: Insight Timer (I like the bells for meditation and prayer) CBT-i Coach (to learn about sleep hygiene). If you haven’t yet had a chance please consider purchasing my recently published book entitled “There’s Always Hope: A Story About Overcoming.” I wrote it with love for children nine and under or to serve as a symbolic gift for an adult in your life who is in need of hope. Thank you to Sparta Books and Interplay Couture of Sparta, NJ for hosting the book and podcast launch and for donating profits to Ginnie’s House Children’s Advocacy Center of Newton, NJ. I am grateful that you have supported their mission to treat and prevent child abuse.

    <title>Facing Our Fears: An Interview with Dr. Wolf Shipon, Psychologist</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>For this episode I interview Dr. R. Wolf Shipon, psychologist and author of “One Minute Healing.” We discuss gratitude, how psychology has blended with acupuncture, the techniques he uses to treat patients with the fear of public speaking and other phobias and how our past doesn’t have to predict our future. Wolf is one of the most positive and delightful people I know and I hope you’ll enjoy his company as much as I did. Learn more about Wolf’s practice in Mountain Lakes, NJ at inner-wellth.com. <br/><br/>I’m also delighted to share that I’ve just published my first children’s book, entitled “There’s Always Hope,” which teaches about the joy of life even if things don’t go exactly as planned (you may find it on Amazon.com). Sydney’s story will touch the hearts of both children and adults as they read about how she overcomes an obstacle she didn’t expect. “There’s Always Hope” is beautifully illustrated by Briana Giasullo. I wrote “There’s Always Hope” with love for children ages nine and under or to serve as a symbolic gift for any adult who needs encouragement. <br/><br/>Please leave a rating of this episode on iTunes!  <br/><br/>How to leave a rating on iTunes:</p><p>1) Launch Apple’s purple Podcast app in your phone<br/>2) <em>Even if you already subscribe to / have Psychology America and it is open</em>, tap “Search”<br/>3) Enter “Psychology America with Dr. Alexandra” <br/>4) Tap on the photo of the podcast<br/>5) Scroll all the way down<br/>6) Press the star rating you choose and/or tap the “write a review.”  For the highest rating tap the last star on the right first.  </p><p>Your review is appreciated!</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dralexandra">Support the show</a><p>This show was created with love on my volunteer time.

    <title>Sex Therapy, Sexual Consent and Grief and Loss:  A Conversation with Dr. Deb Bernstein</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode I share a conversation with Dr. Deb Bernstein, a licensed psychologist who has been in clinical practice in Warwick, New York for 24 years. Dr. Deb as a renaissance woman — she is also a potter and a gourmet cook with 12,000 followers on her food blog on Instagram (Dr.Debs.pots). Whether it is with her patients, through her pottery, as a gourmet cook, or as a mother, Dr. Deb sees her life work as creating and witnessing transformation. We begin with exchanging ideas on a sex therapy case in which the woman felt no desire and thought that she would be perfectly happy if she didn’t have sex for the rest of her life. We then move on to talk about the hot topic of sexual consent, including how we give or don’t give clear signals of yes or no to going further. Lastly, Dr. Deb shares some stories and ideas about how to deal with the pain of losing a loved one. This episode is sponsored by PonderRosa studios of Lafayette New Jersey.
