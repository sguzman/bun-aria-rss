   <media:description>Don’t miss this mind bending hour with the co-founder of Immuse.xyz (http://IMMUSE.xyz) - CEO Chris Nunes (https://tinyurl.com/4p5w8kc5), head of business development Scott Clark (https://tinyurl.com/yfznp529) &amp; creative director BC Biermann (https://tinyurl.com/3zp2jjke).

Chris, Scott and BC introduce the idea of remixing music in lived spaces. This is a new form of discovery and entertainment that has potential to push the boundaries of spatial music and the relationship between creator and fan. I hope you enjoy these amazing AR demos that have the potential to materialize as NFTs. Will this change how we see live shows, recycle, remix and play with sound and space? Maybe?... get ready to be red pilled!

   <media:description>Hey web3 frenz!

I'm beyond excited for this week's special guest! We have the great and powerful Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI), founder &amp; CEO of Real Vision (http://realvision.com), Global Macro Investor (www.globalmacroinvestor.com/), Exponential AgeTM Asset Management and ScienceMagic.Studios (www.sciencemagicstudios.xyz/) joining us for an hour of all things macro, finance and web3! With all the craziness in the world, why not bring in the master chief to tell us what's going on :)

Raoul has held several senior roles in the financial markets over the last 32 years; from running equity/equity derivative sales to hedge funds at Goldman Sachs to founding and managing a Global Macro hedge fund for GLG Partners (one of the largest hedge fund firms in the world).

Raoul's Career

In 2005 he began publishing the Global Macro Investor (GMI), a world-renowned institutional investment strategy publication read by the world’s biggest hedge funds, asset managers and family offices, which he still publishes to this day. In 2014 he also co-Founded Real Vision, the preeminent financial media platform and community, which extensively covers both traditional asset markets and digital asset markets. He is working on turning Real Vision into a Web 3 community and FinTech platform.
