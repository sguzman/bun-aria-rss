      <description><![CDATA[<p>The very last in our installment of live podcasts that I did at the almighty Outbreak Fest in June of 2022 in front of a live audience. These two chats were awesome and of course, with great people involved in independent music. The first one is with Mat Kerekes from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0znuUIjvP0LXEslfaq0Nor?si=KDmyqv6lQmSJh8accOTniQ">Citizen</a> in which we discuss video games, working out and UK audiences. Then, I chat with Isa Holliday from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3nOrhUtscermNwmfBQRZZv?si=n6_py60JR16AS5RYpBx9FQ">Slow Crush</a> as they were wrapping up a whirlwind world tour that was so ambitious I admired it from afar. We got into her background, why they love guitar pedals and a lot more. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>"Like Hoobastank...but doesn't suck" are some immortal words a friend of mine said about <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5v61OSg53KaQxGMpErkBNp?si=FNREjEecR964z38jGopT8Q">Anberlin</a> and I will never forget that. I was pleased as punch to tell Stephen that over our internet connection conversation (to be clear, I like Hoobastank). We get in deep with the feeling of being an outcast, the difference between "shows" and "concerts" and the business side of music. It's a wide ranging discussion and think you will find some value in here. Enjoy! </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite skaters of all time, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiflO_VoaT6AhX-LUQIHRfRAAwQFnoECA4QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fgeoffrowley%2F%3Fhl%3Den&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Hl-LBQ4FNon8X9_PLo5v7">Geoff Rowley</a>, is on the show this week. To say I am thrilled is an understatement. His parts in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czoZ9EBahXQ">legendary skate videos</a> like 411 and others not only got me stoked on his talent but the music he chose was always a bit different and always hit the punk/hardcore/metal side of things real hard. I knew his affinity for the music runs deep, but how deep I didn't know until now. We discuss his feelings around being a video game character, Discord Records and so much more. Enjoy the listen! </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite skaters of all time, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiflO_VoaT6AhX-LUQIHRfRAAwQFnoECA4QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fgeoffrowley%2F%3Fhl%3Den&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Hl-LBQ4FNon8X9_PLo5v7">Geoff Rowley</a>, is on the show this week. To say I am thrilled is an understatement. His parts in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czoZ9EBahXQ">legendary skate videos</a> like 411 and others not only got me stoked on his talent but the music he chose was always a bit different and always hit the punk/hardcore/metal side of things real hard. I knew his affinity for the music runs deep, but how deep I didn't know until now. We discuss his feelings around being a video game character, Discord Records and so much more. Enjoy the listen! </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>HAPPY 10 YEARS TO THE PODCAST! </p>
<p>All hyperbole aside, this podcast has changed my life for the better and thanks for coming along this journey and love letter to independent music. We make it VERY special by having a white whale guest hanging out this week in the form of Chris Higdon from the almighty (and recently reunited) <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6KkOfCQtoMpjS2qYgDxmHI?si=zGwM5QF6Tm2ms--Bypxpbw">Elliott</a>! I chased him down for the past 3 years and only recently started popping up in podcasts, so I HAD TO HAVE HIM. We talk about his past bands (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1RTTUGO3z47d108g51n6Gq?si=VBDqzbjoRUGtVaYG72a-pQ">Falling Forward</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3t3ePoJAa4VrTxoQ1tCuW4?si=L-2Mw-nCSSGgDgZTSRPzQA">Frontiers</a>), dressing up at shows and being low profile. It was everything I wanted and more. Hope you dig! </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>LIVE FROM OUTBREAK FEST 2022! </p>
<p>I am so excited to be releasing all of these great discussions to you that I had at the festival and this one in particular was PRETTY, PRETTY GOOD (insert Larry David voice here). First up is a return guest, Kat Moss from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6hW33nVHPElaXuG2hQ0QOp?si=-ivhilKRTdWhEdfg9vAIGw">Scowl</a> and right after that we have Anaiah &amp; Dez from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/38tO9pZm2G0JjANgRFvC1a?si=QR5V_olIQcG51HZKcwYNZw">Zulu</a> on. Both are wide ranging discussions about representation in hardcore, the observations of playing to vastly different audiences and a lot more. Enjoy! </p>

<p>We have two great chats with some UK peeps on this weeks podcast.

He sang for a band called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/21Q67CZjEzKlMscGhAPZbd?si=pG39dDiLTg6MVQLcaczIjw">Count Me Out</a>, currently sings for a band called Cloak/Dagger as well as the host of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1bn5yMHusgJqOToiNYsYg7?si=72d5e41c7ab4484c">Where It Went Podcast</a> (a deep dive into the Revelation Records catalog).

They just dropped a new heater called "Earth Is A Black Hole" and I had to have someone in the band on the show.

Many of you probably never checked the band out when they were active and playing shows but, now is your chance to get familiar. Jaime Mason was the vocalist of the dark hardcore/punk/metal band from the Northeast (specifically the Martha's Vineyard hardcore scene...which is a hilarious thing to type) and has just recently re-released their awesome EP "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1at9Ncdbdoed2T4KemoT5x?si=YQXLr8ILR6G8HgL0FcUk3A">Somnambulists</a>" on the re-launched Iodine Recordings.

The band is very much a "undiscovered gem" and frankly, they weren't that prolific or long lasting but always stuck in my head. Jeff played drums in the band and we get to nerd out about the band and their place within the metal core world and playing 17 minute sets.

It was a great catch up discussion and enjoy the hang time.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This chat has been a long time in the making as I first fell in love with Pallbearer back in 2012 when they dropped their STAGGERING debut LP, "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4vcqtRCeKGALWvOg910jJi?si=9DOt94HtSACtPZRwohGrgQ">Sorrow and Extinction</a>" and then followed all of their subsequent releases. I had to bring Joseph on the show because not only do I love the band, but think that more people need to pay attention to what they are doing. Joseph and I speak about his experience being raised in an alternative religion, the Little Rock scene and ambition amongst many other things.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I know it may seem like I said this a lot, but this episode is a huge one for me. Brian McTernan is the vocalist from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7MlVSrN1UclvhmDbHlCOf9?si=7d-N9x8vRny-caaZ_Ygfvw">Battery</a>, guitarist from Ashes and more recently, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3kxM2aJZV05zhPIrQS5qyz?si=MM7zOjUtQJ21USxa1OZyaw">Be Well</a> and his art has definitely impacted me in a deep way. He's also an incredibly prolific producer as well helping bands like Texas Is The Reason, Bane, Thrice and many more create some of their most important records. We go LONG with so many things like depression, touring Europe and being the "it" producer and the pressure that comes with it. This conversation went so incredibly well and I am proud to share it with you.

Please welcome Riley Gale to the show this week, who is the vocalist for the almighty Power Trip.

      <description><![CDATA[I had a great experience recording my first "live" podcast at the NAMM Conference back in January of 2020 with my good friend Andy Othling from Lowercase Noises at the Gator Cases booth. We get in deep with his struggles and bond over anxiety, depression and how that has affected the creation of his music and more. This conversation made me feel less alone and I hope it has the same affect on you. Thanks for listening!

We really pick apart so many topics that don't typically get covered in this show, so I really hope you enjoy it. They have a new EP out on Wiretap Records in March of 2020.

Check out Great American Ghost and their new track, "Prison Of Hate" on Spotify. Their new LP is out now!

      <description><![CDATA[We have a double header of modern metalcore for you today! First up, we have Ethan from Great American Ghost discussing keeping his band together and balancing real life/tour life.

Then, I have Travis Tabron who used to sing for the band Varials. We recorded this before he left the band and in this chat, you can hear a little bit of his thought process behind him leaving the band (without me even knowing it!). We also discuss the Philly hardcore scene and why recording vocals is a really terrible experience. Enjoy!

      <description><![CDATA[We have on the show this week, Shane Durgee who was the vocalist for the pre-Earth Crisis band called Framework. Often overlooked in the lore of Syracuse hardcore, I wanted to have Shane on to discuss what the early days of that scene was like. The episode also serves as a compendium to a previous episode that we did a few weeks ago with Scott Crouse from Earth Crisis about each of their full lengths. Shane and I get in depth with some fun EC stories and more.

      <description><![CDATA[We have a two for the price of one podcast today! For the "main" part of the podcast, I have my old friend George Pettit on the show today. He's the vocalist for the now active Alexisonfire. We hopped on the phone one day (some dodgy cell service up in Canada) and discussed his life as a firefighter, being a reluctant frontman and the importance of obsession. Before that discussion, I have Dan Thomson from Sparrows on. They are a great hardcore band that deserves your attention. Enjoy the supersized episode! <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Please to present to you this rad discussion with Issac Hale from Knocked Loose and Inclination. Both of his bands are really, really good but Inclination specifically knocked my socks off since the release of their demo a few years ago and I had to have Issac on the show on the release of their new EP on Pure Noise Records. We discuss straight edge, context for hardcore and how important his parents were in building the local scene. Enjoy!

      <description><![CDATA[Episode 320 - STRAP IN, this episode is quite a journey. I have Lauren Kashan, the vocalist from hardcore band Sharptooth, on the show today. What starts off as a conversation getting to know her, takes a very dark turn and she discusses her substance abuse issues and her admission into a “rehab clinic” that essential, acts like a cult. It’s an incredibly powerful story and one that I was really appreciative for her sharing here. You must listen to this week, no joke it’s one of my favorite chats I have done to date.

He sang on the incredible FSF record, “How To Start A Fire” and was able to convince him to come on the show. The reason I say convince is that Jason hasn’t had the best experiences with press, but fortunately this was a walk in the park. We discuss his upbringing in Minneapolis, his time in Further Seems Forever and public vs private life. I really dug this chat so, DIG IN!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Episode 311 - Film and music. The two have been passions of mine and the guest this week for quite some time and I was excited to talk about it with the director, Michael Grodner. He most recently finished his first feature length film called The Icarus Line Must Die which is an incredible piece of work combining the LA punk scene and a film noir look at life in a band. He also directed many music videos that you have probably seen from bands like Planes Mistaken For Stars, Brazil and more. It’s a fascinating discussion of creating art in 2018 and beyond.

Our guest this week is a repeat but one of my favorite vocalists of all time, Chris Colohan. He sings in the band Sect and owns the incredible company, Vegan Magic. He previously sang for the bands Cursed, Left For Dead, Burning Love, Countdown to Oblivion and more. He’s basically the realest of the real dudes you can ever meet. It had been a few years since our last chat, so I decided to celebrate and have him on the show. We get deep on what it’s like to run a business, the Southern Ontario hardcore scene and principles. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY! Step your wardrobe up by getting AMAZING clothes, underwear and more with Mack Weldon. Real talk, the best in the game.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Episode 223 - This is the most unique podcast I have done to date. Patrick Kindlon is the vocalist for Self Defense Family and Drug Church. He’s a man of many talents and was one of my most requested guests on social media and finally, we have him on. We have a wide ranging discussion about internet culture, context and racist music. No stone is unturned in this chat and we hardly address any of the questions I prepared for him, but the conversation was incredible nonetheless. Consider being a Bone Marrow donor, like me.

Well I love both of these things and was excited to speak to Lee Overtree, who is the creative director behind Story Pirates in New York City. His program takes stories written by kids and turns them into stage shows/radio plays. Lee also has a history within independent music and was influenced heavily by the DIY emo/punk scene. It’s what I like to call one of my favorite “secret punk” episodes in which a person who isn’t necessarily doing anything that you’d immediately define as punk, but under the surface is completely punk.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Episode 215 - Foundation was one of my favorite hardcore bands in recent years, so I was very much looking forward to speaking to Thomas Pearson, the vocalist of said band. We hopped on Skype one afternoon and had a great discussion about the Atlanta hardcore scene, the process of being a teacher and frankly, why independent music is the best. While I am sad the band is no longer, they left a great legacy in their recorded music. Listen and enjoy!

Needless to say, the guy is prolific and we dive DEEP into his life in and around music from his days as a 12 year old in NYC, how he collaborates with such a wide range of musicians and keeping your eyes open for opportunities.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Foxing are a great band. Their new record Dealer made my top 10 list for 2015 so it only made sense to me that I get to know them a bit better. Josh Coll plays bass in the band (and contributes a portion of the lyrics as well) and we spoke one afternoon over Skype. It was a delightful discussion about coping with attention being paid to your band, the military and the Midwest.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a definite left turn for the show, but something I needed to do. My grandfather, Roy Payne passed away last week. I've been entrenched in emotion, cleaning out his house and processing the loss. I had an interview I conducted with him back in 2011 about his 95 years on this planet and regardless of the lack of personal connection you may have with him, his story is universal. People of "the greatest generation" have stories that will blow your minds and I didn't want this to be something only my family shared. Please enjoy and as a "bonus" you can hear my son and I be goofy at the end of the podcast.

Of Mice And Men may not be your cup of tea musically but no one can deny the work that it takes to arrive in a band like this. Tino (as his friends refer to him as) and I unwrap his journey from the early touring days signed to Ferret Music, taking an unconventional role in the band and showing "fans" that you are indeed a nerd just like everyone else.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today on the show we have Branden Steineckert, who is the drummer for legendary punk band Rancid and founding member of The Used.

I really appreciate Branden being as open and honest as he was. Special thanks to a previous guest of the show, Jay Weinberg, for initially bringing this up and my friend Jeff Bradley for helping this along. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:title>Best of 2014 with Jeremy Bolm (Touche Amore) and Joey Cahill (6131 Records)</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The end of another year marks another massive conversation between myself and two close friends of mine.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The guest has been a long time coming but we finally have the incredible Koji a solo artist from Pennsylvania, on the show this week. He's an incredibly thoughtful guy that gave me a lot of time for us to discuss being an outsider, self-examination and continually keeping active. Not only does he create compelling music, but he is very passionate about creating communities around activism and ideas outside of music. He's a very valuable member of our independent music community and I hope you enjoy this conversation.

He's a great dude with a very dry sense of humor so we got along swimmingly when we first met. In this episode we discussed how it feels and what it's like to change the name of your band, step-parents and social media frustrations.
