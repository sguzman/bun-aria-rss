      <title>'The Great British Bake Off' Season 13, Episode 1: "Cake Week"| Everything Is Cake</title>
      <description>Amelia and Kate get together to celebrate the triumphant return of not only 'The Great British Bake Off,' but also a new season of 'Everything Is Cake'! They start their conversation by discussing the brand-new contestants and their backstories, particularly Mark, Syabira, Sandro, Dawn, and the mysterious "Mr. Frogington" (2:35). Next they go over this week's challenges, giving special kudos to Sandro and Abdul's mini sandwich plant bakes for the technical challenge and then salivating over the red velvet cake that won Syabira the signature portion (10:27). They then shift their focus to the showstoppers and ponder what type of cake they would make into a 3D version of their childhood home (21:39). After the break they hand out their weekly awards for soggiest bottom, most British moment, the best Brit fit, and much more (28:21).
Hosts: Kate Halliwell and Amelia Wedemeyer
Associate Producer: Sasha Ashall
Production Assistance: Chris Sutton

      <title>Jordan Wiseley and Johnny Bananas on Their Humanitarian Efforts in Ukraine | Death, Taxes, and Bananas</title>
      <description>Johnny recounts his experiences traveling through Poland and Ukraine and the humanitarian work he did there in collaboration with the organization Humanosh. He speaks with the people who reached out to him to come over and help, Jen Rubio and Scott Mitchell, about how they got involved and what they’ve seen of the crisis at the border. He also speaks with Polish doctor Kate Pikulska, who has worked on several humanitarian efforts with Humanosh, in Lviv. Then he welcomes Jordan Wiseley to the podcast to talk about how his impulsive trip to Poland to help out turned into becoming the UN-recognized humanitarian organization Foreign United Peoples NGO.
Here’s where you can donate to Humanosh to help them deliver life-saving shelter and supplies to refugees.

      <title>‘The Challenge: Spies, Lies, and Allies’ Episode 9 With Derrick K. | Death, Taxes, and Bananas</title>
      <description>This week Johnny welcomes his two-time co-winner Derrick Kosinski to the show to talk about the conflicts and blunders in Episode 9. First, they dig into the implosion of the veteran alliance with Cory taking the heat from other vets for rallying the rookies together, as well as the many, many strategic mistakes Cory made in protecting his new alliance (0:35). They get into the best daily challenge so far this season, in which the contestants had to retrieve balls from a mud pit and, shockingly, there were no bombs to diffuse (32:30). Then they discuss all the conversations that happened in the house after the daily challenge (38:35), the ugly fight between Ashley and Cory in nominations and the history behind that conflict (46:04), the tricky elimination challenge (54:30), and the surprise twist at the end (1:00:40).

      <title>‘The Great British Bake Off’ Season 9, Episode 1: “Cake Week” | Everything Is Cake</title>
      <description>Welcome to the tent, bakers! The Ringer’s Kate Halliwell and Amelia Wedemeyer will be here on ‘The Ringer Reality TV Podcast’ every Friday to recap the new season of ‘The Great British Bake Off.’ In this episode, covering “Cake Week,” we first talk about how we got into the show and why we love it so much (0:30). Then we get to the nitty-gritty, digging into a dastardly signature challenge, in which the bakers had to make mini Swiss rolls (14:25), a confusing technical challenge based on Prue’s recipe for malt loaf (20:00), and a gravity-defying showstopper challenge (23:05). Finally, we hand out our awards for the soggiest bottom, the most absurdly British moment, the best Brit fit, and much more (32:55).
