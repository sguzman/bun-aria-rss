      <title>Guess Who's Ruined the Economy | Daily Best of November 4 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Democrats go into full panic mode as the midterms draw nearer. They make claims that Republicans kill you like Raid kills cockroaches, they will murder your children, ruin the economy and destroy democracy. Guess which party actually has a track record of ruining the economy, pressuring big tech to squash legitimate news stories, and killing (unborn) children. Come on, guess! In other news, TV Producer Adler has bad news for Bubba regarding their trip to see NASA's Artemis rocket launch. And, Producer Speedy has the worst impressions we've ever heard, and we can't get enough.
Sponsor: Allegiance Gold - We recommend you diversify with Gold &amp; Silver. Allegiance Gold can help you protect your IRA or 401K with physical gold and silver, or, if you prefer, have it delivered securely, right to your front door. Their approach is different; they focus on educating and developing a long-term strategy that's right for YOU. That’s why Allegiance Gold has some of the highest ratings in the industry. 5-stars with Trust Link, Triple A rated with the Business Consumer Alliance and an A+ from the Better Business Bureau. Go to https://ProtectWithRickBubba.com and get their best offer yet, up to $2,500 of free silver, on a qualifying purchase, when you tell them RICK AND BUBBA sent you. Or give them a call 844-790-9191.

      <title>Lions, Riots &amp; Lies, Oh My! | Daily Best of November 3 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Lions escape from an Australian zoo while children are having a sleepover. Luckily, no one was hurt, except for the people listening to us attempt an Australian accent. Joe Biden's primetime speech fails to mention inflation, gas prices, crime or education, but is filled with plenty of gaslighting when it comes to which party supports rioting and which supports the rule of law. Bill Clinton, Joy Behar and actress Jenifer Lewis all join in on the gaslighting fun. Elon Musk gets into a Twitter scuffle with AOC. And, we look at footage of a gigantic Shoebill stork and we absolutely are terrified.

      <title>Men Need Hobbies / We Blow Leaves / Biden Blows Smoke | Daily Best of November 2 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Men need hobbies for better mental health and we try to help Greg find a hobby besides being a grump. What is the proper etiquette for blowing leaves? Is 8am too early to wake up the neighborhood with your blower? Speaking of blowing, Joe Biden blows smoke while stumping for democrats before the upcoming midterms. Israel looks like it may re-elect Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro hasn't conceded defeat in Sunday's pivotal election. And, "A Christmas Story Christmas" is coming out soon and we don't think it can touch the original classic.
Sponsor: Allegiance Gold - We recommend you diversify with Gold &amp; Silver. Allegiance Gold can help you protect your IRA or 401K with physical gold and silver, or, if you prefer, have it delivered securely, right to your front door. Their approach is different; they focus on educating and developing a long-term strategy that's right for YOU.

      <title>Halloween Recap, QR Codes in China &amp; Coach Harsin Fired | Daily Best of November 1 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>We recap our Halloween festivities and decide there's nothing cuter than a toddler dressed as Elvis. China's authoritarian government gets even spookier, as it forces the Chinese people to scan QR codes to access transportation, food, and even their homes. Auburn's head football coach, Bryan Harsin, is fired mid-season after going 3 for 5. And we suggest women's soccer should allow fighting between the players, kinda like hockey, to increase viewership.

      <title>Mixing Politics &amp; Entertainment | Daily Best of October 31 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Country star Luke Bryan comes under fire for having the audacity to bring Gov. Ron DeSantis onstage during a concert that raised awareness and a ton of cash for hurricane victims in Florida. Joe Biden votes with his granddaughter and makes us all incredibly uncomfortable. Paul Pelosi is attacked in his home, but the facts of the story are about as clear as mud. NASCAR driver Ross Chastain pulled off an unbelievable maneuver that's only been seen in video games. And Jerry Lee Lewis passes away at the age of 13 — correction, that was the age of his first wife.
Sponsor: Moink delivers grass-fed and grass-finished beef and lamb, pastured pork and chicken, and wild-caught Alaskan salmon, direct to your door - helping Family Farms become financially independent outside of big agriculture.

      <title>Twitter Execs Given The Boot | Daily Best of October 28 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Elon Musk fires multiple high-ranking employees at Twitter, but don't feel bad for them because they repeatedly silenced any voices that disagreed, plus they will receive huge payouts on their wayouts. Biden claims "the most common price of gas in America is $3.39, down from over $5 when [he] took office." Gas was actually $2.39 when he took office. Fetterman's campaign says it's "ableism" to point out his inability to communicate. And, we are so sorry, but nothing is going to happen to Hunter Biden and no one will be held accountable for burying that story.

      <title>Elon Enters Twitter HQ: Let That Sink In | Daily Best of October 27 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Elon Musk carries an actual sink into the headquarters of Twitter. Joe Biden says that airline fees for more legroom have a greater impact on people of color.

      <title>Vax Mandate Shot Down | Guests: Tommy Tuberville &amp; Dinesh D'Souza | Daily Best of October 26 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>A New York judge ruled that NYC workers who were fired for failing to comply with the city’s COVID vaccine mandate must be rehired and receive back pay. We recap the Pennsylvania Senate candidate debate, and John Fetterman doesn't come off great. Democrat Charlie Christ tries to label Ron DeSantis as a "lockdown guy." We'd like to remind everyone that DeSantis is famous for keeping Florida, and subsequently the country, free during the COVID lockdowns. Senator Tommy Tuberville calls us and weighs in on the total lack of leadership from the Biden administration. And Dinesh D'Souza joins the program to share wisdom on securing future elections.
Sponsor: Allegiance Gold - We recommend you diversify with Gold &amp; Silver. Allegiance Gold can help you protect your IRA or 401K with physical gold and silver, or, if you prefer, have it delivered securely, right to your front door. Their approach is different; they focus on educating and developing a long-term strategy that's right for YOU.

      <title>The Whole Show is Sick &amp; Doctors Don't Know What They Are Talking About | Daily Best of October 24 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>The entire show is sick. Bubba is out. Greg is out. Rick, Speedy, Helmsey, and Adler are limping along the best that they can. Which brings us to today's main point: Doctors don't know what they are talking about. One year ago, the director of the CDC, Rochelle Walensky, who has received five COVID jabs, told us vaccinated people can't get or transmit COVID. Today, she tests positive for COVID-19. In politics, Joe Biden sits down with MSNBC and struggles to stay awake and form coherent sentences. Biden also clarifies that he supports gender-affirming surgery for minors. And, Rick has a big win over the weekend when he successfully jumps off his wife's car with barely any help.

        <![CDATA[<p>The entire show is sick. Bubba is out. Greg is out. Rick, Speedy, Helmsey, and Adler are limping along the best that they can. Which brings us to today's main point: Doctors don't know what they are talking about. One year ago, the director of the CDC, Rochelle Walensky, who has received five COVID jabs, told us vaccinated people can't get or transmit COVID. Today, she tests positive for COVID-19.

      <title>Biden &amp; Fetterman: A Meeting of Minds | Daily Best of October 21 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Joe Biden joins Jon Fetterman on the campaign trail and together their brain power equals almost half a person. An Alabama Super Fan calls the show and is finally ready to mourn the loss to Tennessee. Owners of a California mansion are getting landscape work done and end up digging up a car and possible remains. TV Producer Adler wishes his dad a happy 65th birthday. And, Rick tries to talk Bubba out of buying a camper.

Stacey Abrams says the remedy for inflation is abortion. And, COVID lockdowns may have lead to one good thing: a baby boom.

      <title>Not Everything Is About Race &amp; Drag Shows Can't Be 'Family-Friendly' | Daily Best of October 14 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Reporters are stunned when Tampa Bay head coach Todd Bowles doesn't allow the press to make the matchup about race as he prepares to take on Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. A mom speaks some common sense at a town hall meeting as she states there's no such thing as a "family-friendly" drag show. Rural residents of Oregon are fed up with the entire western half of the state and look to join Idaho. Things get awkward on "The View" as Whoopi's former co-star finds out she won't be in "Sister Act 3." And, the Alabama-Tennessee game this weekend actually matters for the first time since before the iPhone came out.
Sponsor: Allegiance Gold - We recommend you diversify with Gold &amp; Silver. Allegiance Gold can help you protect your IRA or 401K with physical gold and silver, or, if you prefer, have it delivered securely, right to your front door. Their approach is different; they focus on educating and developing a long-term strategy that's right for YOU. That’s why Allegiance Gold has some of the highest ratings in the industry. 5-stars with Trust Link, Triple A rated with the Business Consumer Alliance and an A+ from the Better Business Bureau. Go to https://ProtectWithRickBubba.com and get their best offer yet, up to $2,500 of free silver, on a qualifying purchase, when you tell them RICK AND BUBBA sent you. Or give them a call 844-790-9191.

In politics, John Fetterman is not okay, and Joe Biden claims he climbed cliffs and that his son died in Iraq. Elon Musk starts selling burnt hair cologne. Davante Adams has charges pressed against him. And Producer Speedy screams into our new studio 3D sign for some reason.

      <title>Passive-Aggressive Emojis &amp; Vax Discrimination | Daily Best of October 12 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>We look back at the insane level of discrimination that was perpetuated across the globe against people who didn't want to get the COVID vaccine and the false information that was spread about the efficacy against infection and transmission. Gen Z declares some emojis like the "thumbs up" to be passive-aggressive. Jake Tapper interviews Joe Biden about Hunter, but doesn't ask any questions that could incriminate Joe. We flash back to 1992, when Rush Limbaugh calls out Al Gore for being alarmist about the fate of the globe. And, TV Producer Adler gets in a fight with a lady at the beach.

      <title>Tulsi Gabbard Leaves the Warmongering Cabal of Woke Elitists | Daily Best of October 11 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Tulsi Gabbard calls out the Democratic Party for what it truly is. Joe Biden is apparently unable to count to three. NYC Mayor Eric Adams says the influx of immigrants should be handled at the border by the federal government. The small town of Fruithurst, Alabama, makes national news for an unusual spike in cancer cases. Florida is overrun by pythons. Tiffany Cross tries to make a point about racism in the NFL and is wrong on all fronts. And, we encourage people to judge their neighbors by how gory their Halloween decorations are.
Sponsor: Allegiance Gold - We recommend you diversify with Gold &amp; Silver. Allegiance Gold can help you protect your IRA or 401K with physical gold and silver, or, if you prefer, have it delivered securely, right to your front door. Their approach is different; they focus on educating and developing a long-term strategy that's right for YOU. That’s why Allegiance Gold has some of the highest ratings in the industry. 5-stars with Trust Link, Triple A rated with the Business Consumer Alliance and an A+ from the Better Business Bureau. Go to https://ProtectWithRickBubba.com and get their best offer yet, up to $2,500 of free silver, on a qualifying purchase, when you tell them RICK AND BUBBA sent you. Or give them a call 844-790-9191.

      <title>The Overwhelming Evidence of God | Daily Best of October 10 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>On his trip to the edge of space on "Blue Origin," William Shatner is confronted with the emptiness of space and the beauty of Earth, but unfortunately he misses the point.

Tom Brady gets a monumental "roughing the passer" call in his favor. Speaking of football, concussion protocol has changed over the years, and Greg recounts all the times he got his "bell rung." (It was just concussions.) And lastly, Rick gives a telemarketer a taste of his own medicine.

      <title>'No One F#%!$ with a Biden' (Except Bikes &amp; Stairs) | Daily Best of October 6 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Joe Biden is caught on a hot mic dropping an F-bomb while speaking to a Florida mayor, and he sounds more like a member of the mob than the president of the United States. A small number of social justice warriors are trying to make sure the word "Dixie" is no longer in use. This upsets a few people, including a woman who calls our show, and her actual name is Dixie. Tom Brady and Gisele look like they are getting divorced. Velma from "Scooby-Doo" is a lesbian. And lastly, a caller asks us for advice on how a man should hug another man.

      <title>Equity Is Impossible &amp; God Doesn't Play Favorites | Daily Best of October 5 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>

In politics, Vice President Kamala Harris continues to push "equity" as the answer, while in reality, it's impossible and just poorly-veiled Communism. In sports, Aaron Judge breaks the American League home run record. And the movie "Bros" was complete flop and we can't imagine why?!?!

      <title>Talladega Rocks &amp; Tesla Bots | Daily Best of October 3 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Record numbers of fans turn out to Talladega for the big race. Some fans might just have been fleeing a hurricane, but at least they had a good time. Speaking of the hurricane, Gov. Ron DeSantis reminds potential looters that Florida is a Second Amendment state. Tesla reveals its prototype Tesla Bot, and it gives us an uneasy feeling. Greg recaps his not-so-great time in his 5K run for cancer. And speaking of, Bubba shares more good news regarding his recovery from liver cancer surgery.

      <title>Hurricane Ian Slams Florida | Daily Best of September 30 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>We look at the impact of Hurricane Ian after the storm decimated Ft. Myers and other areas. Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffers a major head and neck injury that left him unconscious and seemingly frozen with his hands in front of his face. Tua has been released from the hospital and is able to feel and move all his limbs, but it's not a good look for the NFL as they try to avoid further CTE controversy. Trevor Noah retires from his job as host of 'The Daily Show.' And lastly, we welcome our live audience back in the studio and they bring us custom leather belts. The belts were a tight squeeze, but we appreciate the gift.

      <title>We Can't Become What We Despise: A 'Health' Show | Daily Best of September 26 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>With Bubba going under the knife to remove a tumor from his liver, the rest of staff start thinking about their health. Then we remind ourselves that this show has always been about making terrible decisions on diet and exercise and we must not lose our way. In politics, Joe Biden says Elton John is to blame for $6 billion in taxpayer dollars being spent on HIV/AIDS. In sports, we recap all the football action from the weekend, Roger Federer retires, and Albert Pujols becomes one of only four players in MLB history to hit 700 or more homers.

      <title>Greg Tries Contacts Again | Guest: Ainsley Earhardt | Daily Best of September 22 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt joins us to discuss the value of children and her new book, "I'm So Glad You Were Born." Assistant Producer Greg tries to put in his contact lenses while we coach (heckle) him live on the air. Nikki Haley is accused by Sunny Hostin of "whitewashing" because she doesn't use her first name. And last but not least, we say thank you to everyone who said a prayer for Bubba during his successful liver surgery.

      <title>Greg Makes Contact | Daily Best of September 21 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Assistant Producer Greg decides to give contact lenses a try, which is going to be tough because touching his own eye doesn't seem to be an option. The FDA is six months late in warning people not to cook chicken in NyQuil. Joy Behar thinks Gavin Newsom and Stacey Abrams would make great candidates for the 2024 election. And last but not least, we say a prayer for Bubba as he goes under the knife for liver surgery.

      <title>Godspeed, Bubba! | Daily Best of September 20 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Bubba departs for surgery to remove a spot on his liver. We wish him well, then take odds on how long it will take for him to return to the show. A federal appeals court upheld a Texas law that bars large social media companies from banning or censoring users based on “viewpoint,” and we celebrate the setback for big tech and their attempts to control the narrative. We watch Post Malone and Tim McGraw take a spill during recent concert performances. David Beaman with NASA gives us an update on the historic, but delayed Artemis launch. A candidate for Utah state senate makes an attempt at a rap campaign video. And lastly, a guy wielding a hatchet and destroying a NYC McDonalds is arrested and then immediately released.

      <title>Martha's Vineyard Becomes a Border Town | Daily Best of September 16 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>It takes only 50 illegal immigrants being brought to Martha's Vineyard to bring the billionaire community to its knees. The elites want middle-class border towns to deal with mass illegal immigration, but can't handle it when it comes to their town. It's been over a decade since we've spoken to him, but we try to break down the controversy surrounding our old hunting buddy Brett Favre. An asteroid (or an alien) was captured entering the atmosphere over Scotland. And lastly, Adler's deck project is finished and we fiercely debate what type of workers should and should not receive tips.

      <title>Biden Gets Weird In Detroit | Guest: Steve Doocy | Daily Best of September 15 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Joe Biden brings plenty of cringe as he visits auto makers in Detroit. Fox News host Steve Doocy joins us to discuss politics and cooking. Rand Paul and Dr. Fauci duke it out again. Roger Federer announces his retirement. And a Chic-Fil-A employee stops a carjacking in the parking lot.

Sponsor: EdenPURE is a leading national developer and supplier of breakthrough healthy home appliances and goods designed to save consumers money on their monthly budgets, make life’s tasks easier and improve healthy living conditions. You can purify the air in your home and get healthy, clean, fresh smelling air, eliminate odors, kill mold &amp; mildew and bacteria &amp; viruses. The EdenPURE Thunderstorm Air Purifier, uses Oxi technology, that naturally sends out O3 molecules into the air which seek out odors and air pollutants in your home and destroys them! It does not mask or cover up bad oders and pollutants, it eliminates them. It’s called the Thunderstorm because it purifies the air in your home and provides you with pure fresh air just like after a thunderstorm. Save $200 on an Edenpure Thunderstorm 3-pack for a whole home protection. You’ll get 3 units for under $200. That’s fraction of the cost compared to the other air purifiers that can go for over $600. Put one in your basement, bedroom, family room, kitchen or anywhere you need clean, fresh air. Go to https://edenpuredeals.com and put in the discount code Rick&amp;Bubba3 to save $200.

In sports, Nick Saban let some language fly and it's heard on the air. The NFL pays tribute to 9/11 at the Jets vs. Ravens game. TV Producer Adler has a water line explode in his yard. And lastly, we explain why we don't trust any advice from Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.

      <title>Bubba Breakdances, Biden Just Breaks | Daily Best of August 15 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Bubba breaks it down on the dance floor at his 40th high school reunion. Biden just breaks as he struggles to speak time and time again.

      <title>AG Garland Approved FBI Raid While Hunter Biden Rides Air Force One | Daily Best of August 12 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Attorney General Merrick Garland says he personally approved the FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago. Meanwhile, Hunter Biden is all smiles as he boards Air Force One with his dad. Marshawn Lynch is dragged from his car after being pulled over for drunk driving and refusing to obey orders from police. Field of Dreams brings back Vin Scully. We debate whether we would rather be killed by a wood chipper, impaled by a beach umbrella, or eaten by a shark. And lastly, Rick's tiny dog takes on a huge deer and things don't go great for the dog.

      <title>The Weaponized Justice Department | Daily Best of August 10 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>After the FBI raid on Trump's estate, is it safe to say that the Biden administration is weaponizing the Justice Department against political opponents? Even CNN admits the case for raiding Mar-a-Lago is weak. In other news, we'd like to remind everyone that there's no crying OR HUGGING in baseball. Producer Speedy teaches his wife how to jump rope, and TV Producer Adler has to break up a dogfight.

      <title>Vin Scully, Broken Arms &amp; Broke Backs | Daily Best of August 3 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Vin Scully, best known for his 67 seasons calling games for the Los Angeles Dodgers, passes away at the age of 94. An 80-year-old store clerk in California shoots a would-be robber's arm to pieces, thanks to the Second Amendment. Bubba gets lost looking for his car in a parking deck. The Biden administration contradicts itself as Nancy Pelosi departs from Taiwan. And, upon hearing about an upcoming "Roadhouse" remake, we debate whether it would be worse to play Ned Beatty's character in "Deliverance" or to play Jake Gyllenhaal's in "Brokeback Mountain."

      <title>Lift Your Voice, Not Your Finger | Daily Best of July 29 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Democrat Rep. Linda Sanchez gives the GOP dugout the middle finger during the congressional baseball game. We debate who is the greatest rock and roll singer of all time, and it ain't Bob Dylan. Justice Samuel Alito hilariously mocks "foreign leaders" who condemned his opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, including Boris Johnson and Prince Harry. And lastly, the Biden administration and the President himself continue to deny that we are in a recession.

      <title>What Is A Recession? | Daily Best of July 28 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>The Biden administration could not define the word "woman," and now they can't define the word "recession." The numbers are in, and we are definitely in a recession. Dr. Fauci claims he did not want to "lock down anything," but his own words from 2020 show that he "recommended locking down the country." NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines talks about what it was like being forced to compete against and change in a locker room with transgender swimmer Lia Thomas. And lastly, Adler announces that he and his wife are expecting their second child in 2023, but is it a boy or girl?

      <title>Alarming: Biden's Vacant, Unblinking Eyes | Daily Best of July 26 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Videos released by the Biden White House show two very different and concerning versions of the President. In one video Biden's eyes look soulless and unblinking and we suspect the cause to be an improper dose of drugs designed to keep the President mentally sharp. Whatever it is, it creeps us out. There's no way he makes it to another term, and Democrats know it. In other news, Aaron Rodgers showed up to training camp looking exactly like Nicolas Cage from "Con Air." Kamala Harris lets us know her preferred pronouns. Producer Speedy is mad that we aren't watching "Shark Week." And lastly, someone sets off the fire alarm while we are live on the air!

      <title>That Was A Lie: The Vax Stops Infection | Daily Best of July 25 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>We replay the tape showing world leaders claiming that the vaccine would stop people from getting COVID, followed by those same world leaders announcing they had been infected. A wind turbine is struck by lightning and explodes, proving God does not support "the green movement." A sinkhole opens up at the bottom of a pool and takes all the water, floaties, and a man down with it. MLB pitcher Nolan Ryan was an absolute hoss. Is Elon Musk a lizard person? And lastly, would we get a footlong tattoo if it meant free Subway sandwiches for life?

      <description>The White House announced that vaxxed and boosted Biden tests positive for COVID-19, after having to clarify that Biden does not in fact have cancer. ESPN gave an ESPY to an athlete who renounced her U.S. citizenship to complete for China at the Olympics last year.

      <title>Biden Shakes Hands with Nobody, Again | Daily Best of July 15 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Joe Biden inexplicably shakes hands with an invisible person yet again. Ivanna Trump has passed away after what appears to be a cardiac event. The story about the 10-year-old girl caught up in the abortion debate gets even muddier as the girl's mother defends the alleged rapist. And lastly, Rick admits that he is too old to go to movies that start after 9pm.

      <title>Inflation Reaches 9.1% | Daily Best of July 14 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>The inflation numbers are so bleak that even CNN has to admit it. We clarify the widely reported story about the 10-year-old rape victim who traveled across state lines for an abortion, and our point still stands. Biden's trip to Israel is off to a disastrous start. And lastly, Speedy asks some not-so-intelligent questions about space, then gets Botox live on the air.

      <title>Democrats Continue Abortion Lies | Daily Best of July 13 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, AOC, and many other Democrats continue to tell flat-out lies about abortion alternatives and the medical options for women with ectopic pregnancies. Meanwhile, Senator Josh Hawley is told he is bringing violence to transgender people by simply disagreeing with the notion that men can get pregnant. Rick attends the World Games men's lacrosse championship and comes away impressed with everything except the parking situation. And lastly, we decide that we like chips and dips in large amounts and mariachi bands in small amounts.

Sri Lankan protestors storm the presidential palace and swim in the palatial pool. The World Games are in full swing here in Birmingham, Alabama. NASA prepares to unveil brand new images from space.

      <title>We're Back! 4th of July Vacation Recap | Daily Best of July 6 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Freedom, fun, and fireworks don't always mix. We take a look at a couple backyard fireworks shows that didn't go as planned, and we give you the recap of our time off. In politics, the Biden administration is having a hard time ignoring inflation and Hunter Biden's laptop, but that doesn't stop officials from trying. And sadly, a horrific mass shooting at a Highland Park, Illinois, parade leaves seven dead and a community in mourning.

      <itunes:summary>Senator Tommy Tuberville joins us on the 50th anniversary of Title IX to discuss the success of the program that saw the participation rate of female student athletes rise from 3% to 50%.

In other news, The World Games 2022 are just days away as Birmingham finalizes preparations as it hosts the huge international event. John Daly weighs in on Bill Clinton's golf game. And, country music superstar Randy Owen calls the show before he's had his morning coffee.

      <title>Trump's Bicycle Pledge &amp; Ashley Biden's Diary | Daily Best of June 21 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Donald Trump pledges never to ride a bicycle after the world watched President Biden's latest tumble. Ashley Biden's diary is so gross we feel like we need a shower. D.B. Cooper is in the news, so we count down some of the most notorious unsolved crimes. And, a Tesla Cybertruck takes on a Ford F-150, and Italian motorists take on climate activists blocking the road.

      <title>Juneteenth &amp; Maverick Monday | Daily Best of June 20 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>We celebrate freedom and the fact that the United States no longer practices slavery, but allows for the people to work to achieve their maximum potential. Juneteenth should not be about trying to vilify the U.S. for once having slaves. Instead, celebrate because we are a free country. In other news, it's Maverick Monday. We gave you fair warning and enough time to see "Top Gun: Maverick," and now it's time for the reviews (spoiler alert!). Also, President Biden fell off a bicycle.
Sponsor: Birch Gold - Inflation is already running hot…right at the highs of the last couple decades. And now the Dems are pushing through ANOTHER MASSIVE SPENDING PLAN! 3.5 trillion dollars! So here’s the deal… if you think money grows on trees, like our government does, then just keep living in ignorance. If you’re freaked out about the impact this additional spending is going to have on already high inflation, then protect your savings…NOW! Diversify your savings into physical Gold and Silver with Birch Gold Group. Birch Gold Group is the company that we recommend for precious metals. They have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, countless 5-star reviews and THOUSANDS of satisfied customers. And they can help YOU protect your hard-earned savings. Thanks to a little-known section of IRS Tax Code, you can legally move your I-R-A or 401(k) into precious metals – with no tax implications or penalties.

      <title>Close to Home: St. Stephen's Church Shooting | Daily Best of June 17 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>A shooting at St. Stephen's Church, which is about 10 minutes from our studio, has left two dead and a gunman in custody. The initial reports say the gunman previously attended the church and opened fire at a "Boomer's Potluck" event hosted by the church. In other news, Trump accurately predicted every catastrophe should Biden be elected. Father's Day is this weekend, so we run down our favorite Father's Day gifts. Why are thousands of cattle dropping dead in Kansas? And speaking of dropping dead, Biden attempts to offer condolences and it doesn't go great.

      <title>Biden Messes Up LGBTQIA+ and We Don't Blame Him | Daily Best of June 16 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Biden fumbles his attempt to say LGBTQIA+ and we don't blame him. We try to break down what each letter means, but end up more confused. Meanwhile, mainstream media continues to slowly back away from the Biden dumpster fire. Bubba is back from his root canal and Speedy updates us on the scorchingly hot golf tournament he attended after Bubba "had to miss it." A robot stunt show goes badly at Disney. Also, we debate which "Rocky" movie is the best.

We work with only the best agents in every market.

      <title>The Economy Is Rotten Like Bubba's Tooth | Daily Best of June 15 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>The health of the economy is not good. The health of Bubba's tooth is also not good. Both appear to be rotting from the inside, experts say. While Bubba has to leave for a root canal, we look at the true rate of inflation and the repeated mistakes of the Biden administration. In other news, actor David Koechner is busted for drunk driving. And lastly, we would really love it if drag queens would stop performing for kids to the applause of their parents.

      <title>Karine Doth Protest Too Much | Daily Best of June 14 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tries to dismiss and laugh off Don Lemon when she is asked about Biden's failing mental and physical health. The lady doth protest too much, wethinks. In other news, Yellowstone is facing major closures as roads and cabins are washed away in floods. An elephant stomps a woman to death, then crashes her funeral to stomp some more. Amber Heard breaks her silence since losing her recent defamation trial. And, Jack Del Rio is fined by the NFL for calling January 6 a "dust-up."

      <title>Jan. 6 Hearings: Prime-Time Hogwash | Daily Best of June 10 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>The Jan. 6 hearings air on prime time and are a needless, selectively edited recap of unfortunate events in an effort to distract from the current problems facing the country. The propaganda and bias won't work though, as Americans are fed up. In other news, Britney Spears got married. A Texas zoo captures an odd creature on its security camera. Two factory workers fall into a giant vat of chocolate. And Bubba updates us on his weight loss journey. He's almost started.

      <title>Biden Mumbles on Kimmel &amp; Stumbles on Stairs | Daily Best of June 9 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Joe Biden appears on Jimmy Kimmel and mumbles and makes no sense, even with Kimmel propping him up. Biden then stumbles on the stairs up to Air Force One. An assassination attempt on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh shows the latest instance of violence stirred up by the unaccountable Left. Joy Behar is so wrong on so many levels when she says that gun laws will change once black people own guns. And we debate if the new "Top Gun" is better than the 1986 classic. 
Sponsor: Birch Gold - Inflation is already running hot…right at the highs of the last couple decades. And now the Dems are pushing through ANOTHER MASSIVE SPENDING PLAN! 3.5 trillion dollars! So here’s the deal… if you think money grows on trees, like our government does, then just keep living in ignorance. If you’re freaked out about the impact this additional spending is going to have on already high inflation, then protect your savings…NOW! Diversify your savings into physical Gold and Silver with Birch Gold Group. Birch Gold Group is the company that we recommend for precious metals. They have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, countless 5-star reviews and THOUSANDS of satisfied customers. And they can help YOU protect your hard-earned savings. Thanks to a little-known section of IRS Tax Code, you can legally move your I-R-A or 401(k) into precious metals – with no tax implications or penalties. To get started on protecting your savings with gold in a TAX SHLETERED account, request a free info kit from Birch Gold by texting the word "RICKBUBBA" to 9-8-9-8-9-8.

      <title>Matthew McConaughey On Gun Responsibility | Daily Best of June 8 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Matthew McConaughey weighs in on the gun control debate by advocating for gun responsibility and not allowing the 2nd Amendment to be abused by deranged individuals. ESPN commentator Sarah Spain calls Tampa Bay Rays players bigoted for not wanting to wear rainbow logos. A huge orangutan grabs a man through the bars at an Indonesian zoo and the man barely escapes. Pro-abortion protestors crash a WNBA game causing delays for tens of fans in the audience. Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of "Chrisley Knows Best," are found guilty of bank fraud and tax evasion. And lastly, we give away over $5,000 to Mercy Deliverance Ministries &amp; Food Bank courtesy of Buffalo Wild Wings!

      <title>Not Helping Your Cause: Abortion Activists Strip In Church | Daily Best of June 7 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>While we don't think Joel Osteen is the most biblically-accurate preacher around, we know abortion activists aren't helping their cause when they stripped down and screamed cuss words in the middle of a church service. In other news, Jurassic World: how many times are y'all gonna let the dinosaurs escape? In sports, Aaron Donald gets a huge NFL contract extension and the Saudis are laying down huge stacks of cash to try to attract big-time golf talent. And lastly, let's play 21 Questions with Rick &amp; Bubba!

      <title>'The View' Calls for Abolishing Republicans | Daily Best of June 3 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>The geniuses at "The View" call for the abolishment of Republicans. Do they realize that's approximately half of the population? Jim Jordan calls out Democrats for their efforts to attain more power disguised as a desire to stop mass shootings. It's National Donut Day, and tailgaters outside the studio bring donuts for us by the dozen. And meteorologist James Spann tweets out a picture of an unfortunately shaped cloud.
Sponsor: RealEstateAgentsITrust.com - Buying or selling a home is already one of the most stressful things you can do – and it can be ten times worse if you’re not working with the right agent.  Generally speaking, our homes are our biggest investment – that’s a lot of responsibility, and you need an agent who can take that seriously. That’s why we recommend Real Estate Agents I Trust. We work with only the best agents in every market.  We do our homework, talking to every agent before inviting them to join our network – and here’s a big one: we only work with full-time professionals…no part-time or inexperienced agents.  Our team makes the introduction, and then follows you through the buying or selling process to make sure that you’re satisfied. The agents we work with have long track records, and are the best sellers in their field.  They’re a part of this audience; they share your values, and they’re almost anywhere you want to go! The process is simple: just go to https://RealEstateAgentsITrust.com today and provide us with some basic info. Our team will contact you to make an introduction to our preferred agent in your town.

      <title>The Verdict: Depp Cleared, Biden Foggy | Daily Best of June 2 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>The Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard verdict is in and Depp says the verdict finally cleared his name. The verdict on Joe Biden is in as well: Biden has no idea what he is doing. From inflation to gas prices to baby formula shortages, the incompetence is staggering. Speaking of incompetence, The View blames Christian Nationalists for all the problems in the country. And lastly, we all admit we are struggling with the public bathrooms at our new studio.

      <title>Speedy's Son's Wedding &amp; Canada's Gun Freeze | Daily Best of May 31 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Speedy's son Tyler got married this weekend and the whole gang made it out for the big day! The cops were called, the power went out and Adler's baby screamed, "Sucker!" In other news, Justin Trudeau announces legislation to 'freeze' handgun sales, imports and transfers across Canada, and Joe Biden suggests he wants to ban 'high caliber' weapons like 9mm handguns. If we look back in history, how did things go for the general population after the government became the only lawful owners of guns? (Not good.)

In other news, Justin Trudeau announces legislation to 'freeze' handgun sales, imports and transfers across Canada, and Joe Biden suggests he wants to ban 'high caliber' weapons like 9mm handguns. If we look back in history, how did things go for the general population after the government became the only lawful owners of guns? (Not good.)

      <title>Monkeypox Fear-Mongering | Daily Best of May 26 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>The incredibly low risks of Monkeypox do not match the hysteria seen across mainstream media. Why all the fear-mongering? Speaking of monkeys, we argue over who is the smartest animal. MSNBC can't stop saying Trump during their primary election coverage. Do they know he didn't run? Beto O'Rourke disgustingly grandstands and confronts Texas Gov. Greg Abbott during press conference. And lastly, a rat in NYC stumbles into the wrong park... a dog park.
Sponsor: RealEstateAgentsITrust.com - Buying or selling a home is already one of the most stressful things you can do – and it can be ten times worse if you’re not working with the right agent.  Generally speaking, our homes are our biggest investment – that’s a lot of responsibility, and you need an agent who can take that seriously. That’s why we recommend Real Estate Agents I Trust. We work with only the best agents in every market.  We do our homework, talking to every agent before inviting them to join our network – and here’s a big one: we only work with full-time professionals…no part-time or inexperienced agents.  Our team makes the introduction, and then follows you through the buying or selling process to make sure that you’re satisfied. The agents we work with have long track records, and are the best sellers in their field.  They’re a part of this audience; they share your values, and they’re almost anywhere you want to go! The process is simple: just go to https://RealEstateAgentsITrust.com today and provide us with some basic info. Our team will contact you to make an introduction to our preferred agent in your town.

      <title>Bad Takes in the Uvalde Aftermath | Daily Best of May 25 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>A horrific shooting once again rocks the nation as students and teachers lose their lives after a crazed 18-year-old enters a Uvalde, Texas school. Let the bad takes begin, starting with Joe Biden. In other news, the results are in for yesterday's primary elections. A stupid baseball umpire tackles a runner before calling him out. And, a stupid zookeeper loses a finger after poking a lion.

      <title>Dead Birds &amp; Monkeypox | Daily Best of May 23 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Monkeypox cases rise across the globe and we are wondering when the lockdowns and mandatory vaccines will start. Rick gives Speedy and his wife a tour of his farm house and they find a surprise waiting for them... It's not a good surprise. Ron DeSantis breaks down the Biden administrations intentional failures on every level of their energy policy. Bill Maher once again brings common sense questions like, why is the LGBTQ+ community doubling in size every generation? And lastly, the Pfizer CEO really creeps us out.

Sponsor: RealEstateAgentsITrust.com - Buying or selling a home is already one of the most stressful things you can do – and it can be ten times worse if you’re not working with the right agent.  Generally speaking, our homes are our biggest investment – that’s a lot of responsibility, and you need an agent who can take that seriously. That’s why we recommend Real Estate Agents I Trust. We work with only the best agents in every market.  We do our homework, talking to every agent before inviting them to join our network – and here’s a big one: we only work with full-time professionals…no part-time or inexperienced agents.  Our team makes the introduction, and then follows you through the buying or selling process to make sure that you’re satisfied.

      <title>Dinesh D'Souza Is Our Guest, so This Is Probably Blocked | Daily Best of May 20 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Election fraud is the most censored subject in America today. Dinesh D'Souza joins us to discuss the reaction to his latest project, "2000 Mules." Last time we had him on, we were flagged with warning labels all across our social media, so don't be surprised if the only place you can find this is BlazeTV. In other news, the college football world is reeling in the aftermath of Nick Saban speaking out against Jimbo Fisher and Texas A&amp;M. And lastly, why is the price of gas so high? Joe Biden's answer: Joe Biden.

      <title>Flashback to 25 Years Ago: Khaled Gains U.S. Citizenship | Daily Best of May 17 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>We are visited by an old friend of the show, Khaled, aka Killi Vanilli, who Rick &amp; Bubba helped gain U.S. citizenship over 25 years ago. Bill Gates reassures us that vaccine boosters will only be needed every 6 months... or less. A raccoon gets loose at an Arkansas baseball game. And lastly, we agree with Elon Musk when he says the teleprompter is controlling Joe Biden.
Sponsor: RealEstateAgentsITrust.com Buying or selling a home is already one of the most stressful things you can do – and it can be ten times worse if you’re not working with the right agent.  Generally speaking, our homes are our biggest investment – that’s a lot of responsibility, and you need an agent who can take that seriously. That’s why we recommend Real Estate Agents I Trust. We work with only the best agents in every market.  We do our homework, talking to every agent before inviting them to join our network – and here’s a big one: we only work with full-time professionals…no part-time or inexperienced agents.  Our team makes the introduction, and then follows you through the buying or selling process to make sure that you’re satisfied.

      <title>Alabama Fugitives Come to Bitter End | Daily Best of May 10 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Former corrections officer Vicky White, 56, and inmate Casey White, 38, were arrested in Indiana on Monday after national search for the fugitives. The corrections officer later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. In other news, protestors march on the homes of Supreme Court Justices and the evil of pro-abortion activists is clear as MSNBC hosts are caught laughing at abortion jokes. And lastly, if you like eating red meat, make sure you wear plenty of DEET.

      <title>The Left Pivots Roe Ruling | Daily Best of May 5 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren give us their incredibly bad takes on the so-called abortion ban and try to pivot the cause to secure more midterm votes. We continue to try to track the female prison guard that helped an Alabama killer escape. The newest class of Rock Hall of Fame inductees has been announced. Is Top Gun 2 finally going to be released? And if we had a mascot, what would it be?

      <title>Biden's Lie And Truth About Abortion | Daily Best of May 4 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Joe Biden lies when he says most religions do not have a stance on when life begins, then Biden tells the truth when he says abort a "child." We thought pro-abortion folks claim it's just part of a "birthing person's" body? Biden visits Alabama and incorrectly says we sent javelin missiles to Russia. Comedian Dave Chappelle gets tackled while on stage. And lastly, we love donuts and hate "May the Fourth" be with you.

      <title>Who Fact Checks The Disinformation Board? | Daily Best of April 29 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>The Biden Administration announced plans for a “Disinformation Governance Board” which will be headed by Nina Jankowicz, who claimed Hunter Biden's laptop was fake news and supported the Steele dossier as fact. In one of the worst examples yet, Joe Biden struggles to speak as he asks Congress for $33 billion to support Ukraine. Sean Hannity says he misses Rick &amp; Bubba. Speedy thinks he's going to be attacked by a man with nunchucks, and Rick almost lights a chipmunk on fire.

So here’s the deal… if you think money grows on trees, like our government does, then just keep living in ignorance.

      <title>Biden's Bulb Ban &amp; Conservative Follower Counts Climb | Daily Best of April 27 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Joe Biden's Energy Department bans incandescent lightbulbs forcing consumers to buy LED, which can cost 4 times as much. Conservatives on Twitter see their follower counts spike as Elon Musk is set to take the reigns of the social media platform. Why is this happening and who is behind it? And we gear up for the World Games coming to Birmingham by shooting arrows in the parking lot near a busy road... maybe not our best idea.

      <title>He Really Did It: Elon Musk Buys Twitter | Daily Best of April 26 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>It looks like Elon's bid to buy Twitter for $43 billion will actually go through. What does this mean for free speech on the platform and why is the Left fighting it? We can't help but watch CNN and MSNBC lose there minds over the social media platform going private. Speaking of privates, Hunter Biden's laptop continues to be a topic the White House simply won't comment on. Rick finds out his life insurance hasn't been valid for over 20 years. And comedian John Crist gets into a taxi with no driver.

Then they forge their name on the title document and refile it. Next, they take out loans using your home's equity and stick you with the payments. You likely won't know until you get a late payment or foreclosure notice from several banks. Identity theft programs, banks, and homeowner insurance policies DON'T protect you.

      <title>Teachers Get A Raise &amp; We're Taking Off Mondays | Daily Best of April 12 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Teachers across Alabama are set to get a big raise. Will it fix the teacher shortage and will it be sustainable? A proposed California bill would change the definition of a workweek from 40 hours to 32 hours. So are we taking off Friday or Monday? We recap the CMT Awards, or the CMAs, or maybe it's the ACMs... we can't tell the difference. And lastly, Greg tells a story about going to a carnival as a kid and seeing the world's smallest man.

      <description>Scottie Scheffler won the 2022 Masters and that leads us to debate and decide that golf is not a sport. In other news, more video surfaces and exposes the horror of Shanghai lockdowns as Chinese residents scream from their apartment balconies in mass numbers. Also, Dr. Fauci finally concedes that it's up to Americans to decide themselves how much 'risk they want to take' because Covid isn't going away. And lastly, Joe Biden can't think of a single word to describe America while Kamala Harris wishes everyone a "good morning" during the afternoon.

      <title>China Lockdowns Are Bleak &amp; Biden Can't Speak | Daily Best of April 8 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>China Lockdowns Are Bleak &amp; Biden Can't Speak | Daily Best of April 8 | Rick &amp; Bubba

China is locked down as drones fly above cities with recorded messages commanding citizens to "comply with COVID restrictions. Control your soul’s desire for freedom." China also has a social credit score system to control citizens, which leads us to look at the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) score that is driving the woke public relations campaigns from U.S. corporations trying to secure grants and government contracts. In other news, Tiger Woods has great day on the golf course. A pontoon boat gets crushed by a drawbridge in Florida. And lastly, Joe Biden awkwardly celebrates confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, then he screams absolute gibberish and receives thunderous applause from the Left.

      <title>Obama Visits The White House &amp; Everyone Ignores Joe | Daily Best of April 6 | Rick &amp; Bubba</title>
      <description>Barack Obama returned to the White House for the first time since 2017 and everyone ignores Joe Biden, the actual sitting President. And while Democrats celebrate Obamacare, we have to ask, why are drugs like insulin still so expensive if Obamacare was supposed to fix all that? Rep. Madison Cawthorn and North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson give us very clear definitions of the word "woman." And speaking of insulin, we eat "Twinkies" live on the air.

They help you discover those places, and then to help you take advantage of the opportunities they offer—opportunities to improve your quality of life…to lower your cost of living…to invest for profitable return—before the rest of the world catches on.

      <description>International Living (Panama) - Live Better…for Less…in an Overseas Paradise…Today! - The idea of living a happier, more fulfilling, more prosperous life overseas still strikes many people as a radical idea simply because they don’t have the whole story. They know from experience that there are a host of places around the world that are cheaper…healthier…safer…freer… than you ever thought possible. They help you discover those places, and then to help you take advantage of the opportunities they offer—opportunities to improve your quality of life…to lower your cost of living…to invest for profitable return—before the rest of the world catches on. How about Panama? A lot of American retirees and veterans are going down there because you can live in luxury on twenty four thousand dollars ($24,000) a year. You could pay zero percent income tax. Your healthcare could be as little as twenty six hundred ($2,600) a year. You can also own a luxury beachfront condo – on pristine white sand – for less a hundred and twenty thousand ($120,000). It’s the world’s #1 wealth protection haven. This past year has caused all of us to rethink our plans. People are retiring early. They’re moving. If that’s you, then we urge you to check out The American’s Guide to Living and Retiring in Panama from our friends over at International Living. It’s 100% free for our audience. Just head over to https://BuyPanamaNow.com/RICKBUBBA and get your copy today. Sign up NOW to claim your FREE series on investing in Panama’s Pacific Riviera.

International Living (Panama) - Live Better…for Less…in an Overseas Paradise…Today! - The idea of living a happier, more fulfilling, more prosperous life overseas still strikes many people as a radical idea simply because they don’t have the whole story. They know from experience that there are a host of places around the world that are cheaper…healthier…safer…freer… than you ever thought possible. They help you discover those places, and then to help you take advantage of the opportunities they offer—opportunities to improve your quality of life…to lower your cost of living…to invest for profitable return—before the rest of the world catches on. How about Panama? A lot of American retirees and veterans are going down there because you can live in luxury on twenty four thousand dollars ($24,000) a year. You could pay zero percent income tax. Your healthcare could be as little as twenty six hundred ($2,600) a year. You can also own a luxury beachfront condo – on pristine white sand – for less a hundred and twenty thousand ($120,000). It’s the world’s #1 wealth protection haven. This past year has caused all of us to rethink our plans. People are retiring early. They’re moving. If that’s you, then we urge you to check out The American’s Guide to Living and Retiring in Panama from our friends over at International Living. It’s 100% free for our audience. Just head over to https://BuyPanamaNow.com/RICKBUBBA and get your copy today. Sign up NOW to claim your FREE series on investing in Panama’s Pacific Riviera.

      <description>Sponsor: International Living (Panama) - Live Better…for Less…in an Overseas Paradise…Today!The idea of living a happier, more fulfilling, more prosperous life overseas still strikes many people as a radical idea simply because they don’t have the whole story. They know from experience that there are a host of places around the world that are cheaper…healthier…safer…freer… than you ever thought possible. They help you discover those places, and then to help you take advantage of the opportunities they offer—opportunities to improve your quality of life…to lower your cost of living…to invest for profitable return—before the rest of the world catches on. How about Panama?  A lot of American retirees and veterans are going down there because you can live in luxury on twenty four thousand dollars ($24,000) a year. You could pay zero percent income tax. Your healthcare could be as little as twenty six hundred ($2,600) a year. You can also own a luxury beachfront condo – on pristine white sand – for less a hundred and twenty thousand ($120,000). It’s the world’s #1 wealth protection haven. This past year has caused all of us to rethink our plans.  People are retiring early.  They’re moving.  If that’s you, then we urge you to check out The American’s Guide to Living and Retiring in Panama from our friends over at International Living.  It’s 100% free for our audience.  Just head over to https://BuyPanamaNow.com/RICKBUBBA and get your copy today. Sign up NOW to claim your FREE series on investing in Panama’s Pacific Riviera.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Sponsor: International Living (Panama) - </strong>Live Better…for Less…in an Overseas Paradise…Today!The idea of living a happier, more fulfilling, more prosperous life overseas still strikes many people as a radical idea simply because they don’t have the whole story. They know from experience that there are a host of places around the world that are cheaper…healthier…safer…freer… than you ever thought possible. They help you discover those places, and then to help you take advantage of the opportunities they offer—opportunities to improve your quality of life…to lower your cost of living…to invest for profitable return—before the rest of the world catches on. How about Panama? <strong> </strong>A lot of American retirees and veterans are going down there because you can live in luxury on twenty four thousand dollars ($24,000) a year. You could pay zero percent income tax. Your healthcare could be as little as twenty six hundred ($2,600) a year. You can also own a luxury beachfront condo – on pristine white sand – for less a hundred and twenty thousand ($120,000). It’s the world’s #1 wealth protection haven. This past year has caused all of us to rethink our plans.  People are retiring early.  They’re moving.  If that’s you, then we urge you to check out <em>The American’s Guide to Living and Retiring in Pana</em>ma from our friends over at International Living.  It’s 100% free for our audience.  Just head over to <a href="https://buypanamanow.com/RICKBUBBA">https://BuyPanamaNow.com/RICKBUBBA</a> and get your copy today. Sign up NOW to claim your FREE series on investing in Panama’s Pacific Riviera.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>Sponsor: International Living (Panama) - Live Better…for Less…in an Overseas Paradise…Today! The idea of living a happier, more fulfilling, more prosperous life overseas still strikes many people as a radical idea simply because they don’t have the whole story. They know from experience that there are a host of places around the world that are cheaper…healthier…safer…freer…than you ever thought possible. They help you discover those places, and then to help you take advantage of the opportunities they offer—opportunities to improve your quality of life…to lower your cost of living…to invest for profitable return—before the rest of the world catches on. How about Panama?  A lot of American retirees and veterans are going down there because you can live in luxury on twenty four thousand dollars ($24,000) a year. You could pay zero percent income tax. Your healthcare could be as little as twenty six hundred ($2,600) a year. You can also own a luxury beachfront condo – on pristine white sand – for less a hundred and twenty thousand ($120,000). It’s the world’s #1 wealth protection haven. This past year has caused all of us to rethink our plans.  People are retiring early.  They’re moving.  If that’s you, then we urge you to check out The American’s Guide to Living and Retiring in Panama from our friends over at International Living.  It’s 100% free for our audience.  Just head over to https://BuyPanamaNow.com/RICKBUBBA and get your copy today. Sign up NOW to claim your FREE series on investing in Panama’s Pacific Riviera.

They help you discover those places, and then to help you take advantage of the opportunities they offer—opportunities to improve your quality of life…to lower your cost of living…to invest for profitable return—before the rest of the world catches on. <strong>How about </strong>Panama? <strong> </strong>A lot of American retirees and veterans are going down there because you can live in luxury on twenty four thousand dollars ($24,000) a year. You could pay zero percent income tax. Your healthcare could be as little as twenty six hundred ($2,600) a year. You can also own a luxury beachfront condo – on pristine white sand – for less a hundred and twenty thousand ($120,000). It’s the world’s #1 wealth protection haven. This past year has caused all of us to rethink our plans.  People are retiring early.  They’re moving.  If that’s you, then we urge you to check out <em>The American’s Guide to Living and Retiring in Pana</em>ma from our friends over at International Living.  It’s 100% free for our audience.  Just head over to <a href="https://buypanamanow.com/RICKBUBBA">https://BuyPanamaNow.com/RICKBUBBA</a> and get your copy today. Sign up NOW to claim your FREE series on investing in Panama’s Pacific Riviera.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>Sponsor: International Living (Panama) - Live Better…for Less…in an Overseas Paradise…Today! - The idea of living a happier, more fulfilling, more prosperous life overseas still strikes many people as a radical idea simply because they don’t have the whole story. They know from experience that there are a host of places around the world that are cheaper…healthier…safer…freer… than you ever thought possible. They help you discover those places, and then to help you take advantage of the opportunities they offer—opportunities to improve your quality of life…to lower your cost of living…to invest for profitable return—before the rest of the world catches on. How about Panama?  A lot of American retirees and veterans are going down there because you can live in luxury on twenty four thousand dollars ($24,000) a year. You could pay zero percent income tax. Your healthcare could be as little as twenty six hundred ($2,600) a year. You can also own a luxury beachfront condo – on pristine white sand – for less a hundred and twenty thousand ($120,000). It’s the world’s #1 wealth protection haven. This past year has caused all of us to rethink our plans.  People are retiring early.  They’re moving.  If that’s you, then we urge you to check out The American’s Guide to Living and Retiring in Panama from our friends over at International Living.  It’s 100% free for our audience.  Just head over to https://BuyPanamaNow.com/RICKBUBBA and get your copy today. Sign up NOW to claim your FREE series on investing in Panama’s Pacific Riviera.
