   <media:description>Though the giant bodies in outer space that we would eventually call galaxies were first noticed by French astronomer Charles Messier in the 17th Century, Edwin Hubble, in 1923, was the first to realize what they actually were. It turned out that there were countless galaxies in our universe, made up of billions upon billions of stars and trillions of planets. It did not take humans long at all to do what we do best, imagine. If there were trillions of planets throughout the vastness of space. Could there be another world like ours, with sentient beings like us? From that point onward we began to see aliens everywhere.

It has been said that the oldest fear is the fear of the unknown. The fear of the unknown stands at the root of some of our greatest horror stories. Infamous but brilliant writer HP Lovecraft has influenced the entire horror genre, his work speaks because it reflects his genuine fear of the unknown and of the other. The fear of the other is at the root of our fear of aliens. Aliens are scary because we don’t know them, we cannot predict their behavior, they could be cruel, they could see us as bugs beneath them, they could enslave us, steal our world's resources, and then discard us. They could in essence do to us what we do to each other, or perhaps even worse. Infinite terrors await within the unknown. We peer into the darkness of space and yet we do not know what might be peering back or what it might be capable of.

   <media:description>Safehold by David Weber is a series of science fiction books dealing with themes such as, the use of religion or ideology to manipulate the masses, the inherent conflict between dogma, and innovation and progress, and the corrupting effect that power has on those who possess it. This series begins in the 24th century, at a time where human kind has colonized multiple star systems. In this era humanity is very technologically advanced and it seems the universe is theirs to uncover. That is until they discover that a nearby civilization has been devastated and by some other alien race. Humanity understood that this was a hostile race of beings, they knew this conflict would come for them eventually so they prepared well for it. 10 years later the attack comes. Humanity assumed that their technology and fighting force could fend off the invading aliens, but they were wrong.

This video has some spoilers for the series.

   <media:description>In Rick Remender’s Low, almost all of the future humans have migrated underwater and now all live in dome cities, due to the fact that the surface had become too hot for normal human habitation. This is due to the fact that the story is set billions of years in our future and the sun has expanded to a red giant. The protagonist of our story, Stel Caine, lives in the Dome City of Salus, with her husband and children. Using robotic probes she desperately searches for a new planet that can support human life. The Dome Cities themselves are crumbling. The filtration systems which keep them oxygenated are becoming continuously less efficient. The citizens of all the known cities know that they do not have long before none of the cities can support life.

   <media:description>Just a heads up, this video will have spoilers for all three of Cixin Liu’s Remembrance of Earth’s past book and also for the spinoff novel Redemption of Time by Baoshu. This series details the story of mankind after they discover that there is a race of alien beings 4 lightyears away from our solar system that seek to destroy humanity and inhabit the earth. It will take about 400 years for the aliens to reach earth but in the meantime the cripple technological progress on earth so that humans could not advance enough to match them. Humanity was nearly fully destroyed in its struggle against this technologically superior alien race. The great war between humanity and the Trisolarans drives the main narrative of the series and yet we never see the appearance of the Trisolarans described in the original trilogy, it’s not until the spinoff that we finally get a glimpse of what they actually look like. However we do receive information in the first book about their biology and their life cycle.

   <media:description>The technical term for modern humans is Homo Sapiens Sapiens, we are the current iteration of a genus going back two million years. There were however, obviously many species of humans who did not go on. Who for whatever reason could not adapt to their environments well enough to carry on their DNA. Examples include, Homo Neanderthalensis, Homo Erectus, and Homo Floresiensis. In the novel, Blindsight, Peter Watts, merely adds an additional species to that list, they evolved in a different way, the wrong way.

This particular species of human lacked the ability to synthesize the protein, protocadherin - Y, which other species of humans produced naturally. Their brains and bodies were different as well, they were smarter, stronger, and faster than other humans. And in the earlier eras of humanity, when myth and legend were still being formed they preyed upon us in the night. Ancient humanity was only able to drive them to extinction when they discovered that the creatures had an aversion to right angles. This trait had developed naturally through some fluke of genetics. It was seemingly neutral at first as right angles do not form very often in nature. But once this fact was revealed to humanity, they drove them back into the darkness, seemingly forever. Until many eons later science brought them back.

   <media:description>Scientists believe that at some point during human history, the population had been reduced to just  ̶1̶0̶0̶0̶ 10,000 reproductive adults. In the year 70,000 BC humans almost entirely vanished from the face of the planet itself. According to scientists, near extinction has occurred at least three times over the course of humanity's 100,000 year history. The dilution of mankind to so few humans magnifies the impact of all human actions. In Cixin Liu's Remembrance of Earth’s Past Trilogy humanity is tested many times, but there is no single greater near extinction event than the Singer’s dimension strike.

We’ve discussed the crisis era, the deterrence era, the post deterrence era, In this video will discuss the broadcast era, the era directly following the crew of gravity and blue space’s decision to activate the universal broadcast system, freeing the human race from Trisolaran suppression, while inadvertently revealing the location of the Earth to the inhabitants of the Dark Forest. And The Bunker Era which followed the Return of Tianming, whose brain had been sent off into the vacuum of space centuries earlier.

Obviously this video will have spoilers! My favorite thing about the Dune series is how it points out the dramatic shifts that take place in the collected human unconscious over millennia. Like the evolution of how &quot;The Worm&quot; is viewed. In the first book the worm represents an unstoppable force of nature. The worm is Arrakis, Arrakis is the worm. It is the living and physical embodiment of the desert itself. In Freman culture the worm is God because he keeps the desert for his people. Shai Hulud guards the entrance into their &quot;secret realm&quot;. The worm is exalted in Fremen society, enormous, deadly, rageful yet protective, and graceful.  All of this changes after book 4, “God Emperor of Dune.
Paul Atreides' son, Leto II, took the image of the worm and twisted it.
