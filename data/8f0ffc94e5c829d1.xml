Marvel has been going absolutely bananas this year with their slate of Phase Four content being released on Disney+. It seems like every single week in 2022 there has been a new episode of some kind of Marvle property. The latest one to hit the tiny screen is She-Hulk starring Tatiana Maslany.

She-Hulk definitely raises some questions. Like what is this show trying to be? Why is Jennifer so amazing at being a Hulk right away? Does that fourth-wall breaking stuff feel kinda weird to anyone else in the grand scheme of the MCU? Can She-Hulk solve all problems moving forward by complaining to Marvel?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the She-Hulk: Attorney at Law!

Dwayne Johnson has been trying to get his Black Adam made for nearly fifteen years. Now, in 2022, it’s finally come to life. And one thing is for sure, it’s a movie that came out, and now the hierarchy of power in the DC Universe has been affected in some way probably.

Black Adam definitely raises some questions. Like why are Atom Smasher and Cyclone even in this movie? What was up with that Eternium stuff that make Black Adam weak? Why was that kid always skateboarding? Is Black Adam a bad guy just because he keeps saying he is? Why can’t Doctor Fate stop removing his helmet all the time?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the Black Adam!

After decades, the Halloween saga is coming to an end. Again. In a different way, and like in a different timeline? Don’t worry about it too much– the point is, Michael Myers is BACK. Kind of. Actually he’s not really in this movie, but he’s definitely on the posters and in the trailers. So that’s pretty cool!

Halloween Ends definitely raises some questions. Like why, in this movie marketed as the epic final showdown between Michael Myers and Laurie Strode, are we spending 90% of our time with a new dude named Corey? Why did Michael go from being an unstoppable force of evil in the last movie to being a weak old man living in the sewer? Why is Laurie living so calmly and casually now that Michael Myers has killed her daughter and is roaming free somewhere? 

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the Halloween Ends!

After a decade of movies, the Harry Potter film series came to an end in 2011 with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2. The whole series was a massive worldwide phenomenon and the final movie alone grossed over 1.3 billion at the box office!

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 definitely raises some questions though. Like why is Harry getting strategic visions of Voldemort and not the other way around? Why doesn’t Voldemort send his super important snake away from the massive battle taking place? Why didn’t any of the really helpful magical things introduced in previous movies come into play? Why did Harry name his kid Albus Severus?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2!

There has been an absolute media frenzy surrounding the release of Olivia Wilde’s Don’t Worry Darling. Did Harry Styles spit on Chris Pine? Was Shia Laboeuf fired? Did Olivia Wilde and Florence Pugh get in a shouting match on set? Are Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde even still talking? Did Nick Kroll just kiss Harry Styles?! In the midst of all the chaos, it’s been easy to forget that there’s an actual movie surrounding the drama!

Don’t Worry Darling definitely raises some questions. Like what is going on, and will we get any answers for any of it? How does this simulation thing even work? How is Jack’s simulation life any better than his previous life? How does this simulation not have any safeguards against escape? What was the point of the electroshock therapy if it doesn’t even hold for five minutes? Did three cars just crash into each other in an open desert?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the Don’t Worry Darling!

If you hadn’t noticed, Disney has been on an absolute rampage of re-making their animated classics in “live-action” over the past few years. From Aladdin to The Lion King to Beauty and the Beast to Dumbo, they’re… y’know they’re doing it… for sure. Now, as they slowly run out of classics to remake, they’ve finally landed on one of their very first animated films ever… Pinocchio!

As you might imagine from a 2022 remake of a movie from 80 years ago, 2022’s Pinocchio does raise some questions. Like 

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the Pinocchio remake! Like what’s up with the iconic Blue Fairy showing up for one scene and then disappearing forever? Why is there an extended scene involving horse poop? Does Pinocchio learn anything at all, or is he already perfect from the beginning? And if he already fully gets the difference between right and wrong, what’s the point of Jiminy Cricket?

It’s the team-up crossover episode you never knew you wanted. Or maybe you didn’t want it at all. Anyway, you’re getting it. Screen Junkies and Epic Voice Guy team up with Ryan George and Screenwriter Guy and Producer guy to make a crazy collaboration of two of the most popular “let’s make fun of movies but in kind of a loving way” channels on YouTube.

Did we just create a cinematic universe? Maybe. Who's to say?

If Warner Bros got to stretch the Deathly Hallows into two pieces of content then so do we! Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is the beginning of the final adventure for Harry and the gang as they set off to destroy a bunch of a Horcruxes and do a WHOLE lot of camping.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 does raise some questions. Like why did all the good guys think that having a massive party at a house that was already destroyed by Death Eaters was a good idea? And where did Harry get that mirror shard? And how thick is this dude’s plot armor? How many wildly different functions do these magical do-hickeys have?

To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1! It’ll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

Netflix is great at grabbing big stars and putting them in movies. Are those movies good? Um… sometimes! Their latest star-studded film is “The Day Shift” – a vampire hunting movie starring Jamie Foxx, James Franco and Snoop Dogg. One thing is for sure… this is one of the movies of all time.

Day Shift does raise some questions. Like why are we spending so much time on worldbuilding stuff that never comes up again? Who is buying all these fangs and why? How many peepee poopoo jokes are in this thing? Is the bad guy trying to take over the housing market AND bring back the rule of vampires? How did Snoop survive?

To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Day Shift! It’ll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

After the success of The Mandalorian, Disney+ and Lucasfilm have been churning out new Star Wars content like crazy, with lots more on the way. So it makes sense that they wanted to make a show about a badass bounty hunter in Mandalorian armor, because, well, that seemed to work well the first time? Thus, everyone’s favorite bounty hunter from the original trilogy is back in The Book of Boba Fett.

The Book of Boba Fett does raise some questions though. Like did he or did he not come out of the Sarlac Pit with his armor? Why isn’t this crime lord committing any crimes? Why did that one dude do such a weird spin move in the middle of a battle? Did this just because season 2.5 of The Mandalorian?!

To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to The Book of Boba Fett! It’ll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
