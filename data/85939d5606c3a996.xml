      <title>Robot as Humanoid</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s hard enough to make a functional, reliable robot. Many people also want to make those robots in our image. That’s a tough needle to thread. Often, the most efficient design isn’t the most human-like one. But that isn’t stopping us from reaching for those humanoid robots. <br /><br />Professor Shigeki Sugano argues in favor of creating human-shaped robots.

Paul Ceruzzi describes the state-of-the-art technology available at Dahlgren that helped Dr. West model the world. Todd Humphreys explains how that model, and the GPS systems that use it, support our way of life in more ways than we realize.

      <itunes:subtitle>Aristotle and Eratosthenes are big names in geodesy. They got pretty close to measuring the size of the Earth. But the woman who got it done? She grew up a farmer, dreaming of something bigger. And her work changed how we see the world. 

Dr. Gladys West didn’t have much room for error in her quest for higher education. Marvin Jackson recounts the obstacles in her path—and the challenges she faced in her early career. Gavin Schrock traces how geodesy progressed before Dr. West, and how foundational her work was for the GPS systems that followed. Paul Ceruzzi describes the state-of-the-art technology available at Dahlgren that helped Dr. West model the world. Todd Humphreys explains how that model, and the GPS systems that use it, support our way of life in more ways than we realize.

      <title>Becoming a Coder</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Command line heroes are software engineers, developers, programmers, systems administrators—coders. That variety in coding careers is almost as varied as the paths coders take to land their jobs. </p><p><a href="https://saron.io/"> Saron Yitbarek</a> and <a href="https://www.clivethompson.net/">Clive Thompson</a> start the season by exploring some ways coders start their tech careers—some common, many unexpected. Many choose to start with a degree in computer science. But don’t underestimate the maturing bootcamp tracks, the mid-to-late-career switchers, and coders from outside the insulated tech hubs. You might be surprised who answers the call to code, where they come from—and how much they’ve already accomplished.</p><p> If you want to read up on some of our research on coding careers, you can check out all our bonus material over at <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-5/becoming-a-coder">redhat.com/commandlineheroes</a>.

      <title>Minicomputers: The Soul of an Old Machine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>They don’t fit in your pocket. But in their day, minicomputers were an order of magnitude smaller than the room-sized mainframes that preceded them. And they paved the way for the personal computers that could fit in a bag and, eventually, the phones in your pocket.</p><p>16-bit minicomputers changed the world of IT in the 1970s. They gave companies the opportunity for each engineer to have their own machines. But it wasn’t quite enough, not until the arrival of 32-bit versions.</p><p>Carl Alsing and Jim Guyer recount their work at Data General to create a revolutionary new 32-bit machine. But their now legendary work was done in secret. Codenamed “Eagle,” their machine was designed to compete with one being built by another team in their own company. These engineers recall the corporate politics and intrigue required to keep the project going—and how they turned restrictions into advantages. Neal Firth discusses life on an exciting-but-demanding project. One where the heroes worked together because they wanted to, without expectations of awards or fame. And all three discuss how this story was immortalized in the non-fiction engineering classic, The Soul of a New Machine by Tracy Kidder.</p><p> If you want to read up on some of our research on minicomputers, you can check out all our bonus material over at <a href="https://www.redhat.com/commandlineheroes">redhat.com/commandlineheroes</a>.

      <title>Heroes in a Bash Shell</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Shells make large-scale IT possible. They’re a necessary component to modern computing. But it might not have turned out that way without a lot of hard work from a developer at the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> named Brian Fox. Now, the Bash shell is shipped with almost every computer in the world.</p>
<p>In the ‘70s, Bell Labs wanted to automate sequences of repetitive, complex commands. <a href="https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/">Chet Ramey</a> describes how Bell developed several shells—but there could be only one officially supported shell for UNIX. Enter the Bourne shell. Though it was the best of that crop, the Bourne shell had its limits. And it was only available with a limited UNIX license. Brian J. Fox recounts his time at the Free Software Foundation where he needed to create a free—as in speech—version of the Bourne shell. It had to be compatible without using any elements of the original source code. That Bourne-Again Shell, aka Bash, is possibly the most widely used software in the planet. And <a href="https://twitter.com/heronthecli">Taz Brown</a> describes how it’s one of the most important tools a developer can learn to use.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Shells make large-scale IT possible. They’re a necessary component to modern computing. But it might not have turned out that way without a lot of hard work from a developer at the Free Software Foundation named Brian Fox. Now, the Bash shell is shipped with almost every computer in the world.

In the ‘70s, Bell Labs wanted to automate sequences of repetitive, complex commands. Chet Ramey describes how Bell developed several shells—but there could be only one officially supported shell for UNIX. Enter the Bourne shell. Though it was the best of that crop, the Bourne shell had its limits. And it was only available with a limited UNIX license. Brian J. Fox recounts his time at the Free Software Foundation where he needed to create a free—as in speech—version of the Bourne shell. It had to be compatible without using any elements of the original source code. That Bourne-Again Shell, aka Bash, is possibly the most widely used software in the planet. And Taz Brown describes how it’s one of the most important tools a developer can learn to use.</itunes:summary>

      <title>The Infrastructure Effect: COBOL and Go</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Languages used for IT infrastructure don’t have expiration dates. COBOL’s been around for 60 years—and isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. We maintain billions of lines of classic code for mainframes. But we’re also building new infrastructures for the cloud in languages like Go.</p>
<p>COBOL was a giant leap for computers to make industries more efficient. <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisshort?lang=en">Chris Short</a> describes how learning COBOL was seen as a safe long-term bet. Sixty years later, there are billions of lines of COBOL code that can’t easily be replaced—and few specialists who know the language. <a href="https://twitter.com/RitikaTrikha?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Ritika Trikha</a> explains that something must change: Either more people must learn COBOL, or the industries that rely on it have to update their codebase. Both choices are difficult. But the future isn’t being written in COBOL. Today’s IT infrastructure is built in the cloud—and a lot of it is written in Go. <a href="https://twitter.com/carmatrocity?lang=en">Carmen Hernández Andoh</a> shares how Go’s designers wanted a language more suited for the cloud. And <a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower?lang=en">Kelsey Hightower</a> points out that languages are typically hyper-focused for one task. But they’re increasingly open and flexible.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Becoming a programmer used to require a Ph.D. and having access to some serious hardware. Then, in 1965, a couple of engineers had a radical idea: make it easier for people to get started.

Beginner languages, like BASIC, burst the doors to coding wide open. Tom Cormen and Denise Dumas recall how BASIC changed everything. Avi Flombaum and Saron share tips on picking a first language in this new era of software development. And we hear from Femi Owolade-Coombes and Robyn Bergeron about how the next generation of coders are getting their start with video games.

Beginner languages give everyone an opportunity to get their foot in the door. And that helps the industry as a whole.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>A benevolent dictator for life steps down and changes the course of the Python language forever. Guido van Rossum’s “Transfer of Power” memo brings attention to the way programming languages evolve.</p>
<p>In this episode, <a href="https://twitter.com/emilyemorehouse?lang=en">Emily Morehouse</a> makes the connection between Python’s technical extensibility and its inclusive community. <a href="https://twitter.com/mkennedy?lang=en">Michael Kennedy</a> explains how Python is both easy to learn and powerful enough to build YouTube and Instagram. And <a href="https://twitter.com/pythondj">Diane Mueller</a> highlights how the Python community took the lead on so many inclusive practices that are spreading in tech—including the rise of community-led decision-making.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a benevolent dictator can get a language started. But Python shows it’s communities that make languages thrive.</p>

      <title>At Your Serverless: Development Empowerment with Control</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>What does serverless really mean? Of course there are still servers—the basics of the internet aren’t changing. But what can developers accomplish when someone else handles the servers?</p>
<p>Serverless computing makes it easy for beginners to deploy applications and makes work more efficient for the pros. Andrea Passwater shares how convenient it can be to abstract away (or remove from view) the infrastructure components of development. But as with any convenience, going serverless has tradeoffs. Rodric Rabbah explains that going serverless can mean giving up control of your deployment and restricts your ability to respond to problems—which is why he helped create Apache OpenWhisk, an open source serverless environment framework. And Himanshu Pant considers when to use serverless services.</p>
<p>Serverless computing should be about developer empowerment. But we have to stay curious about the big picture—even as we simplify our toolbox.</p>

      <itunes:summary>What does serverless really mean? Of course there are still servers—the basics of the internet aren’t changing. But what can developers accomplish when someone else handles the servers?

Serverless computing makes it easy for beginners to deploy applications and makes work more efficient for the pros. Andrea Passwater shares how convenient it can be to abstract away (or remove from view) the infrastructure components of development. But as with any convenience, going serverless has tradeoffs. Rodric Rabbah explains that going serverless can mean giving up control of your deployment and restricts your ability to respond to problems—which is why he helped create Apache OpenWhisk, an open source serverless environment framework. And Himanshu Pant considers when to use serverless services.

Serverless computing should be about developer empowerment. But we have to stay curious about the big picture—even as we simplify our toolbox.</itunes:summary>

      <title>The Data Explosion: Processing, Storage, and the Cloud</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Big data is going to help solve big problems: how we grow food; how we deliver supplies to those in need; how we cure disease. But first, we need to figure out how to handle it.</p>
<p>Modern life is filled with connected gadgets. We now produce more data in a day than we did over thousands of years. Kenneth Cukier explains how data has changed, and how it’s beginning to change us. Dr. Ellen Grant tells us how Boston Children’s Hospital is using open source software to transform mountains of data into individualized treatments. And Sage Weil shares how Ceph’s scalable and resilient cloud storage helps us manage the data flood.</p>
<p>Gathering information is key to understanding the world around us. Big data is helping us expand our never-ending mission of discovery.</p>

      <title>The One About DevSecOps: Evolving Security and Reliability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Bad security and reliability practices can lead to outages that affect millions. It’s time for security to join the DevOps movement. And in a DevSecOps world, we can get creative about improving security.</p>
<p>Discovering one vulnerability per month used to be the norm. Now, software development moves quickly thanks to agile processes and DevOps teams. Vincent Danen tells us how that’s led to a drastic increase in what’s considered a vulnerability. Jesse Robbins, the former master of disaster at Amazon, explains how companies prepare for catastrophic breakdowns and breaches. And Josh Bressers, head of product security at Elastic, looks to the future of security in tech.</p>
<p>We can’t treat security teams like grumpy boogeymen. Hear how DevSecOps teams bring heroes together for better security.</p>
<p>These changes mean different things for everyone involved, and we’d love to hear your take. Drop us a line at <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes">redhat.com/commandlineheroes</a>, we're listening...</p>

      <title>Fail Better: Embracing Failure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Failure is the heartbeat of discovery. We stumble a lot trying new things. The trick is to give up on failing fast. Instead, fail better.</p>
<p>This episode looks at how tech embraces failure. Approaching failure with curiosity and openness is part of our process. <a href="https://twitter.com/jennski?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Jennifer Petoff</a> shares how Google has built a culture of learning and improvement from failure.

And <a href="https://twitter.com/mrry550?lang=en">Jen Krieger</a> explains how agile frameworks help us plan for failure.</p>
<p>Failure doesn’t have to be the end. It can be a step to something greater.</p>

      <title>Hello, World: Programming Languages for the Polyglot Developer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Every new programming language is created to do something previously impossible. Today, there are quite a few to choose from. But which ones do you really need to know?</p>
<p>This episode dives into the history of programming languages. We recognize the genius of “Amazing Grace,” also known as Rear Admiral Grace Hopper. It’s thanks to her that developers don’t need a PhD in mathematics to write their programs in machine code. We’re joined by Carol Willing of <a href="https://twitter.com/projectjupyter">Project Jupyter</a>, former Director of the Python Software Foundation, and <a href="https://twitter.com/pomeranian99?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Clive Thompson</a>, a contributor to The New York Times Magazine and Wired who’s writing a book about how programmers think.</p>
<p>Reminder: this season we’re building our very own, open source Command Line Heroes game. And you are invited to contribute—in whatever way makes sense for you. Visit <a href="https://github.com/CommandLineHeroes/hero-engine">Command Line Heroes: The Game</a> over on GitHub for more info.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Every new programming language is created to do something previously impossible. Today, there are quite a few to choose from. But which ones do you really need to know? This episode dives into the history of programming languages. We recognize the genius of “Amazing Grace,” also known as Rear Admiral Grace Hopper. It’s thanks to her that developers don’t need a PhD in mathematics to write their programs in machine code. We’re joined by Carol Willing of Project Jupyter, former Director of the Python Software Foundation, and Clive Thompson, a contributor to The New York Times Magazine and Wired who’s writing a book about how programmers think.</itunes:summary>

      <title>Press Start: How Gaming Shapes Development</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Before the terms 'open source' and 'internet' were even coined—there were gamers. They created proto-open source communities, sharing and building upon each other’s work. For many programmers, gaming led them to their careers.</p>
<p>In this episode, we explore the creative free-for-all of early game development over ARPANET. Game development brings together a massive mix of creative and programming talent. But while creating video games started as an open process, a lot has changed. Hear how you can get involved in building our very own Command Line Heroes game—and in the spirit of games, hunt around for this episode’s Easter egg.</p>

Containers are one of the most important evolutions in the open-source movement and in this episode, featured guests Kelsey Hightower, Google developer advocate, and Laura Frank, Docker Captain and Director of Engineering at Code Ship, along with others, explain how this new technology is the building blocks of the future.</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>DevOps_Tear Down That Wall</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>As the race to deliver applications ramps up, the wall between development and operations comes crashing down. When it does, those on both sides learn to work together like never before.</p>
<p>But what is DevOps, really? Developer guests, including Microsoft’s <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman">Scott Hanselman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/copyconstruct">Cindy Sridharan</a> (better known as @copyconstruct) think about DevOps as a practice from their side of the wall, while members from various operations teams explain what they’ve been working to defend. Differences remain but with DevOps, teams are working better than ever. And this episode explores why that matters for the command line heroes of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Read Cindy Sridharan's attempt to demystify <a href="https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/what-is-devops-5b0181fdb953">DevOps</a>.</p>
