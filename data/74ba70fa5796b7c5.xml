			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Do you find it spooky to explore new boundaries? Former political organizer & Bonobo Network founder William Winters really connects with Jamie when they speak on a panel called “Liberate your ass: sexual freedom is key in fighting the right” and their brain boners for each other are mutual. Then late one night, Jamie texts; she’s in town but sleeping on a friend’s couch, so feverish with lust, William & Jamie cast caution to the wind while they search for horizontal space to hook up before her flight home. Lessons & Takeaways: she’s an exhibitionist, and 3 feet isn’t as far as you think it is! #RulesOfEngagement #Sketchy #Consent #SexClub</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">Song: ‘Demons’ (Hayley Kiyoko)</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">About the Storyteller:</p> <p class="p3">An activist, educator, and intimacy coach, William Winters is the founder and co-organizer of the Bonobo Network, an Oakland-based organization that builds community, connection, and capacity in the sex-positive and non-monogamous worlds.  William has long been an advocate for polyamory in the media, appearing in San Francisco Magazine, KQED's Forum, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the New York Times. He has facilitated conversations about polyamory and sex-positive culture in settings including university campuses, political conferences, living rooms, Burning Man, and beyond.</p> <p class="p4"> </p> <p class="p3">A campaign strategist by profession, a culture nerd by avocation, and a philosopher by major, William lives with his wife and their stupid cat in Oakland, CA.</p> <p class="p4"> </p> <p class="p1">Episode links:</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">SAN FRANCISCO: ‘This Feels Dangerous’ is happening on Friday, October 28th.

Cuddle Party facilitator & emotional fermentation starter Scoby has been situationally monogamous for most of COVID, and now she’s ready to get back out there.

Cuddle Party facilitator & emotional fermentation starter Scoby has been situationally monogamous for most of COVID, and now she’s ready to get back out there. But at her first sex-positive retreat, but she’s feeling a lot of shame about her lack of arousal - until a meditative cockstroking workshop in the rain changes everything. And this week, come meet Dixie in person this Friday October 14th at Doghouse Leathers (715 E Pike Street, Seattle WA). Let’s hang out from 6-9 PM PST at Doghouse Leathers (our Bang-O sponsor for this show!) #SwimmingInSkin #Boundaries #Consent #Desire</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">Song: ‘Them’ (Flavia)</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">About the Storyteller:</p> <p class="p3">Cuddle Party facilitator & emotional fermentation starter Scoby dove into the worlds of kink and polyamory after attending a Bawdy show in 2014. She now hosts communication and consent workshops, also known as Cuddle Parties, as a certified facilitator. While she can make kombucha (like her namesake the Symbiotic Colony Of Bacteria and Yeast), she’s more of an emotional fermentation process starter and also offers intimacy coaching. She can sing you any song from Crazy Ex Girlfriend.</p> <p class="p1">Episode links:</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">LIVE SHOWS:</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">SEATTLE: ‘Feels like the First Time’ is this Saturday, October 15th!

Yes, graphic artist Elizabeth Barlow’s desire for rough sex and BDSM might be ‘deflecting,’ but who would know better than the hot new relationship therapist she’s hooking up with off of a dating site? Bonus story: Have you ever been invited to join in on group sex with your crush, when all you really wanted was an innocent first date? Burning Man aficionado Soren Berg hopes to summon up the courage to ask out his theme camp neighbor Textbook just as he’s beckoned to her anonymous love-in. A newbie to this, he find her tied up and blindfolded, and he only has 90 minutes to learn the rules. With just minutes left, there’s still one wish left on the white board.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Is there anything more difficult than not being able to touch, taste or kiss your long-distance partner? Kinkster & Podcaster Dick Wound first suggests mailing each each their dirty socks and tshirts, but when he learns of his new love’s food fetish, they substitute kissing with SweetTarts on Skype, move to in-person and before you know it, she’s lying in a Dexter-style kill room, covered in ice cold pumpkin guts.

The podcast was established to document his journey into the kink community, but little time passed before Dick began receiving feedback from listeners and it quickly became evident that many needed guidance to begin their journey. The platform Dick has created brings together both newbies and long time kinksters, and enables them to share their stories and experiences with a worldwide audience. This has led to guest appearances on other podcasts including RISK!, This is Actually Happening, The Dildorks and dozens of others. Dick also operates and produces a second podcast, Being There, where the extraordinary aspects of everyday people’s lives are explored in a free form interview/story-telling format. Dick’s personal journey is an interesting one, and he is available to speak on the subjects of kink and BDSM with an open mind and devious sense of humor.</strong></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1"><strong>You can learn more about Dick Wound at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></strong></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href= "https://www.offthecuffs.org/"><strong>https://www.offthecuffs.org/</strong></a></span></p> <p class="p1"><strong>&</strong></p> <p class="p1"><strong>Patreon.com/OCPKink</strong></p> <p class="p4"> </p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Episode links:</strong></span></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Saying goodbye to Quake, the World’s Best Dog</strong></span><strong>: If you wanna help with Quake’s final Veterinary and End of Life expenses, the GoFundMe is at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></strong></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1"><strong>https://bit.ly/QuakeTheSaint</strong></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1"><strong>And Thank you for loving my Best Boi <3</strong></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1"><span class= "s1"><strong>Uberlube</strong></span><strong>: Uberlube is a luxurious, high-grade silicone lubricant made from clean, body-friendly ingredients; it’s just silicone with a little Vitamin E.

Plus, Dixie struggles with the hardest goodbye she’ll ever face. #ASMR #Sloppy #Squishy #Slippery #Scene</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p3">Song: ‘Bon Appetit’ (Katy Perry & Migos)</p> <p class="p1"><em>About the Storyteller:</em></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">Dick Wound explores darker and more unusual kinks and fetishes on his podcast, Off the Cuffs, including fantasies of his own death, being dominated by robots, and seductive alien encounters. The podcast was established to document his journey into the kink community, but little time passed before Dick began receiving feedback from listeners and it quickly became evident that many needed guidance to begin their journey. The platform Dick has created brings together both newbies and long time kinksters, and enables them to share their stories and experiences with a worldwide audience. This has led to guest appearances on other podcasts including RISK!, This is Actually Happening, The Dildorks and dozens of others. Dick also operates and produces a second podcast, Being There, where the extraordinary aspects of everyday people’s lives are explored in a free form interview/story-telling format. Dick’s personal journey is an interesting one, and he is available to speak on the subjects of kink and BDSM with an open mind and devious sense of humor.</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">You can learn more about Dick Wound at </p> <p class="p1"><a href= "https://www.offthecuffs.org/">https://www.offthecuffs.org/</a></p> <p class="p1">&</p> <p class="p1">Patreon.com/OCPKink</p> <p class="p4"> </p> <p class="p1">Episode links:</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">Saying goodbye to Quake, the World’s Best Dog: If you wanna help with Quake’s final Veterinary and End of Life expenses, the GoFundMe is at </p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">https://bit.ly/QuakeTheSaint</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">And Thank you for loving my Best Boi &lt;3</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">Uberlube: Uberlube is a luxurious, high-grade silicone lubricant made from clean, body-friendly ingredients; it’s just silicone with a little Vitamin E.

As an antidote to the bad news, we share this origin story from Author, Psychotherapist, Kinkster, Sex Radical and Ethical Slut, Dossie Easton.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Feeling defeated by last week’s overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court? As an antidote to the bad news, we share this origin story from Author, Psychotherapist, Kinkster, Sex Radical and Ethical Slut, Dossie Easton. This story was told at Dossie’s Story Toast in 2019, where we celebrated both her 75th birthday and the 50th Anniversary of *this*, Dossie’s life-changing trip to a new sexually empowered version of feminism. Gather your strength and be inspired by Dossie’s true tale as we prepare to challenge what’s next. #WorkToDo #TooIntelligent #TooOutspoken #TooStrong #TheRiddleOfTheUniverse</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p3">Song: ‘Unstoppable’ (Sia)</p> <p class="p1"><em>About the Storyteller:</em></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p4">Dossie Easton, a long time player on the San Francisco S/M scene, is co-author with Janet Hardy of The Ethical Slut, The Bottoming and Topping Books, and Radical Ecstasy:  SM Journeys to Transcendence.  </p> <p class="p5"> </p> <p class="p4">Dossie is a psychotherapist working with individuals, couples and more in her private practice in San Francisco, with a particular interest in how S/M journeys into Shadow can bring old wounds into the healing light of consciousness and and give them a shot of life force in the form of good hot sex. </p> <p class="p5"> </p> <p class="p4">An active sex radical since 1961, Dossie was a member of the first Board of Directors of the Society of Janus in San Francisco in 1974, and active with SFSI from 1973 to 1985. Currently she makes her home in the mountains north of San Francisco, travels to teach at conferences all over the world, and wanders through the mountains around her home declaiming filthy poetry to the vultures.

Storyteller and writer Matthew Beld has spent the Pandemic isolating and reflecting on who they really are, so a first time road trip celebration with new sluts feels daunting.

As this proud slut embraces a more expansive non-binary identity, Matthew learns that the right people can help you find joy and connection - and that you don’t really have to know yet.

As this proud slut embraces a more expansive non-binary identity, Matthew learns that the right people can help you find joy and connection - and that you don’t really have to know yet.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Have you ever received oral sex from a beautiful French woman at 200 miles an hour? Teenage Brendan Taylor had always believed that those Penthouse forum stories were complete fabrications; he’s focusing on his studies, not girls. And for a lanky, inexperienced country boy first trip’s to France, this young nerd is most excited about the train ride from Paris to Marseille on the TGV bullet train. Electric! High Speed! Yet when a sophisticated Parisian woman takes an interest, he begins to feel a different kind of electricity. Those French lessons don’t seem quite so important now, because Brendan’s discovered the universal language. #SinkOrSwim #Croissant #Bonjour #Unzipped</strong></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p3"><strong>Song: ‘Finally Woken’ (Jem)</strong></p> <p class="p1"><strong><em>About the Storyteller:</em></strong></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p4"><strong>Brendan Taylor was born and raised in a small town in the Midwest in the 70s.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Have you ever received oral sex from a beautiful French woman at 200 miles an hour? Teenage Brendan Taylor had always believed that those Penthouse forum stories were complete fabrications; he’s focusing on his studies, not girls. And for a lanky, inexperienced country boy first trip’s to France, this young nerd is most excited about the train ride from Paris to Marseille on the TGV bullet train. Electric! High Speed! Yet when a sophisticated Parisian woman takes an interest, he begins to feel a different kind of electricity. Those French lessons don’t seem quite so important now, because Brendan’s discovered the universal language. #SinkOrSwim #Croissant #Bonjour #Unzipped</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p3">Song: ‘Finally Woken’ (Jem)</p> <p class="p1"><em>About the Storyteller:</em></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p4">Brendan Taylor was born and raised in a small town in the Midwest in the 70s. He enjoys many shades of off-white from eggshell to ecru, and likes just a *touch* of vanilla. He gets migraines like a lawyer bills hours, curses like a barefoot sailor in a Lego factory, and is full of surprises and stories. He chased a woman to San Francisco 26 years ago and it seems to be working out so far.</p> <p class="p5"> </p> <p class="p1">Episode links:</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">OUR LIVE SHOW and LIVESTREAM: Our next Bawdy happens right after the Pride Parade on Sunday June 26th.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Have you ever received oral sex from a beautiful French woman at 200 miles an hour? Teenage Brendan Taylor had always believed that those Penthouse forum stories were complete fabrications; he’s focusing on his studies, not girls. And for a lanky, inexperienced country boy first trip’s to France, this young nerd is most excited about the train ride from Paris to Marseille on the TGV bullet train. Electric! High Speed! Yet when a sophisticated Parisian woman takes an interest, he begins to feel a different kind of electricity. Those French lessons don’t seem quite so important now, because Brendan’s discovered the universal language. #SinkOrSwim #Croissant #Bonjour #Unzipped</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p3">Song: ‘Finally Woken’ (Jem)</p> <p class="p1"><em>About the Storyteller:</em></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p4">Brendan Taylor was born and raised in a small town in the Midwest in the 70s. He enjoys many shades of off-white from eggshell to ecru, and likes just a *touch* of vanilla. He gets migraines like a lawyer bills hours, curses like a barefoot sailor in a Lego factory, and is full of surprises and stories. He chased a woman to San Francisco 26 years ago and it seems to be working out so far.</p> <p class="p5"> </p> <p class="p1">Episode links:</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">OUR LIVE SHOW and LIVESTREAM: Our next Bawdy happens right after the Pride Parade on Sunday June 26th.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Have you ever used an under-inflated rubber doll to jumpstart your reunion-slash-sex party?

Reid hatches a plan to host a writer’s retreat in a Northern California yurt with many of his sex-positive friends, and after travel and quarantining and rapid tests, nobody remembers how to connect anymore. What better way to get your strap-on gangbang going than to put that board game blow-up doll to good use?

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Would you be nervous about meeting someone if you’d already had sex with the person, yet you’d never actually seen them? After boffing someone at a pitch dark sex party, Dixie De La Tour gets a call from this mystery man, asking her for a date - and it makes her so nervous. Is she expected to have sex with him, since it’s already happened? And what if her date doesn’t like how she looks, since they haven’t actually laid eyes on each other? Big Thanks to the Risk! Podcast for inviting Dix to perform this story on their first livestream at the start of the Pandemic, and to Jefferson Bergey for this week’s original Birthday song.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Would you be nervous about meeting someone if you’d already had sex with the person, yet you’d never actually seen them? After boffing someone at a pitch dark sex party, Dixie De La Tour gets a call from this mystery man, asking her for a date - and it makes her so nervous. Is she expected to have sex with him, since it’s already happened? And what if her date doesn’t like how she looks, since they haven’t actually laid eyes on each other? Big Thanks to the Risk! Podcast for inviting Dix to perform this story on their first livestream at the start of the Pandemic, and to Jefferson Bergey for this week’s original Birthday song. Remember: ‘You stop Reading, I stop Eating’! #HappyBirthday #RepentYourSins #Insecure #MatzohBallSoup</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p3">Song: ‘Jack in the Box’ (Jefferson Bergey)</p> <p class="p1"><em>About the Storyteller:</em></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p4">Dixie De La Tour is a storytelling coach, sexual folklorist, professional storyteller, podcaster, teacher, impresario, community builder and most of all, a facilitator of new experiences. She is also the Founder, Curator & Host of the Award-winning storytelling series, Bawdy Storytelling (“The Moth for Pervs” - LA Weekly, “The Original Sex and Storytelling series” - Playgirl) that’s been lauded for its transformational, relatable, empowering performances. Dixie has been a featured storyteller for the National Storytelling Conference, and in addition to story and public speaking coaching for her own Bawdy series, she coaches for events such as TEDx, Women in Technology, and regularly offers ‘How to Be Fascinating: Dixie’s Secret System for Brilliant Storytelling’ (her unique personal and professional storytelling system).</p> <p class="p5"> </p> <p class="p4">Ultimately, this story-loving southerner is passionate about storytelling’s ability to keep people safe, reduce social anxiety and connect us with strangers. Dixie has also been Sainted by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence (“Saint Kiss & Make You Tell”) for her work to reduce stigma and eliminate shame, and in her free time, she enjoys being a Muppet.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Do you ever wonder if maybe your Mom was right? As a 15 year old ‘sexually ignorant Midwest teenager’, Ryan Vermouth’s weeping mother confronts him. She knows he’s gay… he doesn’t think so, yet he fears she might know him better than he knows himself. So when Ryan attends his college’s annual drag ball with Bisexual/Bicoastal Jenny-cum-Johnny, he learns some empowering adult lessons about lube, bondage tape, and how clarifying it can be to transform your childhood traumas into joy, connection, and new, nourishing kinks. #TwoGoodHands #Bullied #LightlyGenderBent #YouDontHaveToKnow</strong></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p3"><strong>Song: ‘Sex is Good, but have you Tried’ (Donna Missal)</strong></p> <p class="p1"><strong><em>About the Storyteller:</em></strong></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p4"><strong>Ryan Vermouth has always been intensely curious about people, which is why he became a social scientist, an actor, and kind of a slut.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Do you ever wonder if maybe your Mom was right? As a 15 year old ‘sexually ignorant Midwest teenager’, Ryan Vermouth’s weeping mother confronts him. She knows he’s gay… he doesn’t think so, yet he fears she might know him better than he knows himself. So when Ryan attends his college’s annual drag ball with Bisexual/Bicoastal Jenny-cum-Johnny, he learns some empowering adult lessons about lube, bondage tape, and how clarifying it can be to transform your childhood traumas into joy, connection, and new, nourishing kinks. #TwoGoodHands #Bullied #LightlyGenderBent #YouDontHaveToKnow</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p3">Song: ‘Sex is Good, but have you Tried’ (Donna Missal)</p> <p class="p1"><em>About the Storyteller:</em></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p4">Ryan Vermouth has always been intensely curious about people, which is why he became a social scientist, an actor, and kind of a slut. Six months and two variants ago, he was scheduled to perform at the August show until it was canceled—but he couldn't be more excited that the delay has given him a chance to be a part of Bawdy’s anniversary show (and also to further workshop his story in therapy).</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">Episode links:</p> <p class="p1">May is Share-a-Story month: Wanna send me a story, in written form or in your own voice? Send your written words or voice memo recording to <a href= "mailto:BawdyStorytelling@gmail.com">BawdyStorytelling@gmail.com</a> and I might just put you on the podcast!

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Can you give someone a Blowjob and still be a Feminist?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span> Nationally recognized playwright, actor and comedian Marga Gomez is a Lesbian icon whose girlfriend wHortensia has moved away for grad school - but after 7 years of monogamous love, laughter, great sex and 2 expensive Uniqlo coats, Marga is unexpectedly ghosted. Preparing to go onstage in Boston on her birthday 6 months later, Marga gets a text from Hortensia that reads ‘hope you’re doing something fun’. I’ll show you FUN… feeling as though the world has stopped loving her, Marga experiences kindness from a stranger and wonders “after all those dreams, is it finally time for the blowjob experience?” & more importantly, do your skills translate to men if you’re (notoriously) really good at oral? #Monogamous #Queer #Ethnic #Age #Geography #StillComing</strong></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1"><strong><em>About the storyteller:</em></strong></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p3"><strong>Marga Gomez (she, her, they, hey) is the creator of the channel “Latina Stream Queens” on YouTube.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span> She is also a nationally recognized playwright, actor and comedian born in New York’s Harlem, raised in Washington Heights and based in San Francisco.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Can you give someone a Blowjob and still be a Feminist?  Nationally recognized playwright, actor and comedian Marga Gomez is a Lesbian icon whose girlfriend wHortensia has moved away for grad school - but after 7 years of monogamous love, laughter, great sex and 2 expensive Uniqlo coats, Marga is unexpectedly ghosted. Preparing to go onstage in Boston on her birthday 6 months later, Marga gets a text from Hortensia that reads ‘hope you’re doing something fun’. I’ll show you FUN… feeling as though the world has stopped loving her, Marga experiences kindness from a stranger and wonders “after all those dreams, is it finally time for the blowjob experience?” & more importantly, do your skills translate to men if you’re (notoriously) really good at oral? #Monogamous #Queer #Ethnic #Age #Geography #StillComing</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1"><em>About the storyteller:</em></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p3">Marga Gomez (she, her, they, hey) is the creator of the channel “Latina Stream Queens” on YouTube.  She is also a nationally recognized playwright, actor and comedian born in New York’s Harlem, raised in Washington Heights and based in San Francisco. Her parents were entertainers in the Latino community, and Robin Williams once called her "Amazing ... A lesbian Lenny Bruce." She is the winner of a GLAAD Media Award and one of the first openly LGBT comedians in the USA. Her television credits include HBO, LOGO, PBS and Netflix’ Sense8.</p> <p class="p3">She is also the writer/performer of thirteen solo plays which have been produced Off-Broadway and internationally. Her acting credits also include “The Vagina Monologues” with Rita Moreno and Vicki Lawrence. During the pandemic she pivoted to livestreaming comedy and adapting her solo theater virtually and became featured in many online theater festivals.</p> <p class="p4"> </p> <p class="p3"><a href= "http://youtube.com/latinastreamqueens?fbclid=IwAR2uRXKN7OutPEbJBOedQCzYCvs_VCVtTzsU_ABKTgQ9aizPB1_OQKAKqrI"> youtube.com/latinastreamqueens</a></p> <p class="p3"><a href= "http://instagram.com/themargagomez?fbclid=IwAR2XVZ_XJoFTAVrn-woDhyFvXdR8K7BX-u6Vt8zlW7WV8o1uv8aBba9_ohU"> instagram.com/themargagomez</a></p> <p class="p3"><a href= "http://twitter.com/margagomez?fbclid=IwAR3TWkdlG56uSmadP8OzaEQyiKx0HMhMr5t0LMctXUGNNhVA2s918yOdMAE"> twitter.com/margagomez</a></p> <p class="p3"><a href= "http://www.margagomez.com/?fbclid=IwAR3bwhbSOao30GzoA9uj1sCfN3HSE6ryvGVaWAWnN75QlZbCdGOVygqXrpY"> www.margagomez.com</a></p> <p class="p4"> </p> <p class="p5">Song: ‘Put it in your Mouth’ (Akinyele)</p> <p class="p1">Episode links:</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p6">Uberlube: Uberlube is a luxurious, high-grade silicone lubricant made from clean, body-friendly ingredients; it’s just silicone with a little Vitamin E.

Cinematographer Ian Dodd questioned whether he would ever be ‘man enough’ sexually, but that changed when he and his badass wife Margot opened up their 30 year marriage. Diving deep into polyamory & kink, they planned a Joshua Tree Forgy (c’mon, you know what that is) with lovers. But when Ian’s date cancels, he finds inspiration in a 1970’s TV commercial and conspires to make Margot’s secret fantasy come true. #DoublePenetration #WoundsAndScars #WaxPlay #Flogger #Rope #Submissive #Erotica #BodiceRipper</strong></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1"><strong>About the storyteller:</strong></p> <p class="p3"><strong>Ian Dodd lived in Los Angeles where he worked telling other people’s stories visually, as a cinematographer. He had always wanted to learn to share his own stories, so after attending a number of Bawdy live shows, he signed up for Dixie’s storytelling workshop retreat in the spring of 2019.  Ian won Best of Bawdy 2020 - where listeners vote for their favorite tellers - and told this story onstage in San Francisco at our last pre-Pandemic show.<span class= "Apple-converted-space"> </span></strong></p> <p class="p3"><strong>He is now retired and lives in Joshua Tree with his wife, Margot.</strong></p> <p class="p4"> </p> <p class="p5"><strong>Song: ‘Margot’ (custom song written by Jefferson Bergey)</strong></p> <p class="p5"><strong>Links for Jefferson Bergey:<br /> Website: http://jeffersonbergey.com/<br /> Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jeffersonbergey/</strong></p> <p class="p5"><strong>Jefferson Bergey’s ‘Risqué show happens every Monday evening from 7 - 8:30 PM PST on YouTube, Facebook & Instagram, and it features many of the songs he’s written for Bawdy.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">‘Double Dommed’ (Ian Dodd)</p> <p class="p1"> Hosted by Sexual Folklorist Dixie De La Tour</p> <p class="p1">Opening Music: 8 Miles Wide by Storm Large</p> <p class="p1"> Episode Description: </p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">Would you be disappointed if the Sense8 orgy you’d planned turned into a ‘Story of O’ weekend instead? Cinematographer Ian Dodd questioned whether he would ever be ‘man enough’ sexually, but that changed when he and his badass wife Margot opened up their 30 year marriage. Diving deep into polyamory & kink, they planned a Joshua Tree Forgy (c’mon, you know what that is) with lovers. But when Ian’s date cancels, he finds inspiration in a 1970’s TV commercial and conspires to make Margot’s secret fantasy come true. #DoublePenetration #WoundsAndScars #WaxPlay #Flogger #Rope #Submissive #Erotica #BodiceRipper</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">About the storyteller:</p> <p class="p3">Ian Dodd lived in Los Angeles where he worked telling other people’s stories visually, as a cinematographer. He had always wanted to learn to share his own stories, so after attending a number of Bawdy live shows, he signed up for Dixie’s storytelling workshop retreat in the spring of 2019.  Ian won Best of Bawdy 2020 - where listeners vote for their favorite tellers - and told this story onstage in San Francisco at our last pre-Pandemic show. </p> <p class="p3">He is now retired and lives in Joshua Tree with his wife, Margot.</p> <p class="p4"> </p> <p class="p5">Song: ‘Margot’ (custom song written by Jefferson Bergey)</p> <p class="p5">Links for Jefferson Bergey: Website: http://jeffersonbergey.com/ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jeffersonbergey/</p> <p class="p5">Jefferson Bergey’s ‘Risqué show happens every Monday evening from 7 - 8:30 PM PST on YouTube, Facebook & Instagram, and it features many of the songs he’s written for Bawdy.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What do Marilyn Monroe and Reinvention have in common? For our last episode of 2021, Trans Role Model Billie Bertan tells us how she came to love herself. How can a child who knew only knew hunger and homelessness become the poster child for rebirth? In this epic true tale, Billie encounters Marilyn, cinematic superstar Ondine, the iconic Andy Warhol, and finds her people among the illegal homosexuals of Central Park’s Vaseline Flats. But Billie was just getting started: she hitchhiked to San Francisco to Transition at 50, she’s now 38 years sober, she recently gave up smoking after 66 years, and this year - at the age of 80 - she lectured at Stanford.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p> <p>Aunt Billie wants you know: Anything is possible, and Pleasure is your Birthright! #Trans #RememberWhoYouAre #CharmingPinkBow</p> <p> </p> <p>Song: ‘Body and Mind‘ (Girl in Red)</p> <p>Episode links:</p> <p> </p> <p>Uberlube: Uberlube is a luxurious, high-grade silicone lubricant made from clean, body-friendly ingredients; it’s just silicone with a little Vitamin E.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Are you afraid to ask for what you want? When award-winning storyteller Jannelle Codianni ends her 10-year marriage, she realizes that the fear, abuse and rejection mean that now she’s sexually broken. Unable to voice her own desires and not ready for love or commitment, she hires a ‘spotter’ in the form of Marty, one of the only sexological bodyworkers in puritan New England.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Can you feel the cold, wet squeak? When Girly Juice blogger, Dildorks podcaster, and kink author Kate Sloan sparks the attention of the gorgeous Matthew on Twitter, she can barely make eye contact with them. Soon this gorgeous suitor inundates our favorite bisexual submissive with gifts, long distance flights, spot-on role-play & ego-bolstering rope scenes - yet somehow, Matthew’s exquisite spankings leave her self-conscious and paranoid, rather than euphoric. This Secret Sex Spy seems a bit too ideally perverted and weird for her; what if it’s a trick? Or worse yet, what if it’s not? #Espionage #GoodGirl #Suspicious#OutOfMyLeague</p> <p> </p> <p>Song: ‘Spy in the House of Love’ (Was/Not Was)</p> <p> </p> <p>Episode Links</p> <p>Live Shows are Back!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you feel the cold, wet squeak? When Girly Juice blogger, Dildorks podcaster, and kink author Kate Sloan sparks the attention of the gorgeous Matthew on Twitter, she can barely make eye contact with them. Soon this gorgeous suitor inundates our favorite bisexual submissive with gifts, long distance flights, spot-on role-play & ego-bolstering rope scenes - yet somehow, Matthew’s exquisite spankings leave her self-conscious and paranoid, rather than euphoric. This Secret Sex Spy seems a bit too ideally perverted and weird for her; what if it’s a trick? Or worse yet, what if it’s not? #Espionage #GoodGirl #Suspicious#OutOfMyLeague</p> <p> </p> <p>Song: ‘Spy in the House of Love’ (Was/Not Was)</p> <p> </p> <p>Episode Links</p> <p>Live Shows are Back! This month, we’re Nerding out with ‘Science Friction’ featuring Meg Elison, Sejay, Alotta Boutté Reid Mihalko and music by Rachel Lark. We only have this gorgeous Federal Building Courtyard for two more dates, and our last show sold out so get your tickets now for Bawdy Storytelling on Saturday July 17th, 2021 ..this live show is happening in San Francisco… not in San Francisco?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Kids these days have it so easy. We live in a world where, with your phone and a ring light, you can start your burgeoning porn empire. Back in my day, I had to walk uphill 3 miles in the snow to take a picture of my cooch. Seattle based comedian Jimmy Sorrentino knows what I'm talking about. In this episode, a 71-year old Jimmy (just kidding) lugs state of the art camera equipment and a willing punk rock goth pixie dream girl to the middle of a cornfield to create some pictures to remember.
