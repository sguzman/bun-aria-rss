    <description>Portland-based anti-fascist Sean Kealiher was killed in 2019, months before the uprising that would bring Portland international attention. Nearly two years later, his homicide remains unsolved. His mother, Laura, believes she hasn't received justice because of police hatred for her son and his politics. Dying For A Fight, the second installment in Somethin’ Else’s Fault Line series, goes in search of answers: What happened the night Sean was killed? Why have no arrests been made? Who are the Americans living at the political extremes? And how did things escalate from Portland to the Capitol? This show is a co-production with Oregon Public Broadcasting.

Listen now to new episodes of The Fault Line: Dying for a Fight every Monday wherever you get your podcasts!

Season 1 of The Fault Line: Bush, Blair and Iraq, is also available to view on this platform. On September 11th 2001, as he faced incalculable losses after the terrorist attacks that day, President George W Bush made a call to his greatest international ally: British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 18 months later, Bush and Blair led a coalition into a war that went horribly wrong. David Dimbleby, one of the BBC’s best known news hosts and reporters, takes us back to those crucial 18 months. Talking to prime ministers, politicians, spies and weapons inspectors he asks how and why we came to invade Iraq. And as we experience an era of lies and mistrust - did the events of 17 years ago set the stage for the world we live in now?

As many as 1 in 10 adult Americans attended a protest. They got a taste of the world Sean Kealiher had been inhabiting for years before he was killed. 

And in Portland, the culture war over race and politics would turn deadly.

      <title>Portrait of a Young Anarchist: An Interview with Ani Raven</title>
      <description>Ani Raven is a longtime activist and community radio host in Portland. 

She was also one of Sean Kealiher’s mentors when he joined the Occupy movement at 15 years old. 



In 2011, Raven met Sean at the camps that Occupy protesters had set up in Portland city parks. 



In this episode, released on the two-year anniversary of Sean’s killing, Raven discusses how she watched Sean grow as a young activist, and start to lead people in the street.

      <title>Dying For A Fight | 5. It’s Personal</title>
      <description>After Sean Kealiher was killed, his mother Laura was subjected to brutal harassment from conservative trolls at her home and online—and it was Sean’s antifascist friends who provided her security, not the Portland police. 



Meanwhile, we ask the former head of police detectives in Portland why there has been no progress in solving Sean’s homicide.

      <title>Dying For A Fight | 4. This Isn't a Game</title>
      <description>When Sean Kealiher and his friend Micah Fletcher began confronting racists in their community, neither one could have predicted the consequences. 



In 2017, Micah would nearly lose his life when he was attacked on a Portland train as he defended two teenage girls from a racist tirade. 

Now, he reflects on how he was lauded as a hero while his friend Sean was treated as a thug for doing the same things.

      <title>Dying For A Fight | 3. It’s a Conspiracy</title>
      <description>Oregon’s long history of racism was what brought Sean Kealiher and so many protesters like him to the streets. 



The fights between anti-racist skinheads and neo-Nazis in the 80s and 90s set the stage for Portland to found America’s first official Antifa chapter.  



And Laura Kealiher says the way police are intertwined with those past fights makes her skeptical they will ever solve Sean’s homicide.

      <title>Dying For A Fight | 2. A Fight Brews</title>
      <description>Portland, Oregon, had been a hotbed for political clashes between the far left and the far right for years before 2020. 



Sean Kealiher was among the people who regularly took to the streets to fight — sometimes physically — with people who opposed Black Lives Matter and other social justice movements. 



We look at who was in the streets leading up to one of the most significant years in American protests.

      <title>Dying For A Fight | 1. The Death of Sean Kealiher</title>
      <description>Sean Kealiher was killed on Oct 12, 2019, near a popular bar for Portland’s antifascist scene. 



An SUV ran him over and crashed outside the Democratic Party of Oregon office. Gunshots rang out through the night, and whoever was driving fled the scene, leaving the vehicle behind. 

Now, almost two years later, his mother Laura Kealiher is demanding police answer why his killing remains unsolved.

      <title>Introducing The Fault Line: Dying for a Fight </title>
      <description>Portland-based anti-fascist Sean Kealiher was killed in 2019, months before the uprising that would bring Portland international attention. 



Nearly two years later, his homicide remains unsolved. His mother, Laura, believes she hasn't received justice because of police hatred for her son and his politics. 



Dying For A Fight, the second installment in Somethin’ Else’s Fault Line series, goes in search of answers: What happened the night Sean was killed? Why have no arrests been made? Who are the Americans living at the political extremes? And how did things escalate from Portland to the Capitol? 



A Somethin' Else production. This show is a co-production with Oregon Public Broadcasting.

      <description>Tony Blair finally has to come face to face with his party and his country. To sell his war to parliament and to the public. Little does he know that in a few short months the weapons' inspectors, searching through the rubble in Iraq, will find something that will haunt him for the rest of his life and career. And it will leave us, the people, asking - can we ever trust our politicians again?

      <title>Blair, Bush &amp; Iraq | 6. With You Whatever</title>
      <link>https://www.somethinelse.com/</link>
      <description>Tony Blair writes to George Bush “I’m with you whatever”. But now he needs to do two things: persuade the UK that war against Saddam is necessary, and the Americans that they need to seek international support for military action. The result is a decision by Bush to try and win round the United Nations, and an intelligence dossier that will haunt Blair forever.

      <link>https://www.somethinelse.com/</link>
      <description>How did WMD become central to the case for war in Iraq? We go back to 1991 - just after the first Gulf War - to find out why the argument for invading Iraq focussed on Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. We look at how the Iraqis tried to hide these weapons and meet the two men who did the most to try and find them.

      <description>How did Bush and Blair get so close? We go back to the late 90s and hear how British Ambassador in Washington Christopher Meyer carried out Blair’s instruction to ‘get up the arse of the White House and stay there’. Meyer tries to find out what Bush’s position is on foreign policy and gets to know the influential group of conservatives advising him. They’re known as the neocons.

      <title>Introducing... The Fault Line: Bush, Blair and Iraq</title>
      <link>https://www.somethinelse.com/</link>
      <description>On September 11th 2001, as he faced incalculable losses after the terrorist attacks that day, President George W Bush made a call to his greatest international ally: British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 18 months later, Bush and Blair led a coalition into a war that went horribly wrong. David Dimbleby, one of the BBC’s best known news hosts and reporters, takes us back to those crucial 18 months. Talking to prime ministers, politicians, spies and weapons inspectors he asks how and why we came to invade Iraq. And as we experience an era of lies and mistrust - did the events of 17 years ago set the stage for the world we live in now? Coming September 29th......
