			<description><![CDATA[<p>I don't know about you, but I have been a lifelong fan of Star Wars. So I always love the Fourth of May. And I may or may not have been at a few Comic Cons in my lifetime. And if you know anything about the cosplay community, they are some of the most dynamic and fun people you'll ever meet. But even more so are the 501st Legion. And if you don't know who they are, you really should look them up. The incredible charitable work that they do is one of the reasons that my next guest, who is a lifelong friend of mine, Justin Weiss, chose to join his local fiber first, which is the Empire City Garrison where he dresses up like a stormtrooper. In fact, you might hear a little bit of a muffled audio in the beginning because he is in full costume as a stormtrooper which kind of shows that yes, it's charitable work, but it might be a little bit beyond that too. </p>]]></description>

This week's guest, Chellsie Memmel, is an American gymnast and is the third U.S. woman to achieve world all-around gold. She has earned a total of six world medals and helped the U.S. team win the Olympic silver medal by pulling off the performance, despite a broken bone in her ankle. After retiring in her early 20s, she got married, had two beautiful children, and was working. But eight years after her retirement, she decided to train for the U.S. Olympic trials at 32 years of age, in a world where being in your 20s will put you in the category of Geriatrics. Taking that leap at 32 took a strength of character that is powerfully beautiful. </span>]]></description>

However, today's episode is different. We have over 40 episodes published. I am so grateful to each of you who have listened to and supported our show. As we approach a brand new year, it would be a good time to step back and reflect on some of my favorite moments on this show this last year, all through the lens of a new year and a new you.
