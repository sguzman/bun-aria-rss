			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this week’s episode of The Literary Life Podcast, Angelina Stanford is joined as always by Thomas Banks and Cindy Rollins for the opening of their series on Bram Stoker’s <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3UdOSPH">Dracula</a>.</em> Today our hosts focus on the background and historical context for this piece of literature, as well as going over the highlights of the first two chapters. They talk about the question of the role of the monster in literature in modernity versus its historical interpretation. Understanding the form of the Gothic novel and the time period in which this book was written are important aspects of approaching <em>Dracula</em>.</p> <p>Keep listening next week for more about how to read this book. We will be covering chapters 3-7.</p> <p>Get the latest news from <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/">House of Humane Letters</a> by signing up for their e-newsletter today!</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere modernity cannot kill.</p> <cite>Bram Stoker</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>That children should have the peace of God as a necessary condition of growth is a practical question. If we believe it is their right, not to be acquired by merit nor lost by demerit, we shall take less upon ourselves and understand that it is not we who pasture the young souls. The managing mother who interferes with every hour and every occupation of her child’s life, all because it is her duty, would tend to disappear. She would see with some amusement why it is that the rather lazy, self-indulgent mother, is often blessed with very good children. She, too, will let her children be, not because she is lazy, but being dutiful, she sees that, give children opportunity and elbow room, and they are likely to become natural persons, neither cranks nor prigs.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this week’s episode of The Literary Life Podcast, our hosts wrap up their series on <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3cI6L92">Hard Times</a></em> by Charles Dickens. Angelina opens the conversation about the book by highlighting Dickens’ masterful ability to tie up all the loose ends in his stories. They cover not only the major plot points here at the end of the book, but talk about the craft of Dickens and continue to teach us how to read this type of story. We see each character’s full arc and the positive changes that come when people choose repentance versus the fate of those who remain stubbornly on the road to destruction.</p> <p>Join us next time for a special conversation with Jason Baxter, author of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3CKyqQY">The Medieval Mind of C.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today on The Literary Life Podcast, our hosts continue their series on Charles Dickens’ <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3cI6L92">Hard Times</a>.</em> Angelina, Cindy and Thomas open the conversation with their commonplace quotes, which all lead into the discussion of <em>Hard Times.</em> They start out highlighting once again the fairytale and allegory aspects of this story, including the setting of Coketown. Together they talk about the two sides of Sissy Jupe’s education, along with the situations and portrayals of the other key characters in this section. A large part of the discussions centers around the ideas of input and output versus sowing and reaping.</p> <p>Purchase the recordings of our 2022 Back to School Conference at <a href= "https://morningtimeformoms.com/events/1758-2/">MorningTimeforMoms.com</a>.

We must remember that ignorance is not innocence, and also that ignorance is the parent of insatiable curiosity.</p> <cite>Charlotte Mason</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Early in 1851, Dickens suggested in Household Words that a second exhibition be held of “England’s sins and negligences.” When he finally went to the Crystal Palace, he described it as “terrible duffery.” He wrote in July 1851, “I find I am used up by the exhibition. I don’t say there is nothing in it. There is too much. I have only been twice. So many things bewildered me. I have a natural horror of sights, and the fusion of so many sights in one has not decreased it. I’m not sure that I have seen anything but the fountain and perhaps the Amazon. It is a dreadful thing to be obliged to be false, but when anyone says, ‘Have you seen…?’ I say, ‘Yes’, because if I don’t he’ll explain it, and I can’t bear that.</p> <cite>Julia Baird, quoting Charles Dickens</cite></blockquote> <h3>from “Ode On a Distant Prospect of Clapham Academy”</h3> <p><em>by Thomas Hood</em></p> <p>Ah me! those old familiar bounds! <br /> That classic house, those classic grounds <br /> My pensive thought recalls! <br /> What tender urchins now confine, <br /> What little captives now repine, <br /> Within yon irksome walls? </p> <p>Ay, that’s the very house! I know <br /> Its ugly windows, ten a-row! <br /> Its chimneys in the rear! <br /> And there’s the iron rod so high, <br /> That drew the thunder from the sky <br /> And turn’d our table-beer!</p> <p>There I was birch’d! there I was bred! <br /> There like a little Adam fed <br /> From Learning’s woeful tree! <br /> The weary tasks I used to con!— <br /> The hopeless leaves I wept upon!— <br /> Most fruitless leaves to me!—</p> <p>The summon’d class!—the awful bow!— <br /> I wonder who is master now <br /> And wholesome anguish sheds! <br /> How many ushers now employs, <br /> How many maids to see the boys <br /> Have nothing in their heads!</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3RAsQWo">Formation of Character</a></em> by Charlotte Mason</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3DnuiqC">The Ink Black Heart</a></em> (Cormoran Strike Book 6) by Robert Galbraith</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3UcqUVV">Victoria: The Queen</a></em> by Julia Baird</p> <h3>Support The Literary Life:</h3> <p>Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/theliterarylife/overview">Patreon,</a> and get some amazing bonus content!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today on The Literary Life Podcast, our hosts continue their series on Charles Dickens’ <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3cI6L92">Hard Times</a>.</em> Angelina, Cindy and Thomas open the conversation with their commonplace quotes, which all lead into the discussion of <em>Hard Times.</em> They start out highlighting once again the fairytale and allegory aspects of this story, including the setting of Coketown. Together they talk about the two sides of Sissy Jupe’s education, along with the situations and portrayals of the other key characters in this section. A large part of the discussions centers around the ideas of input and output versus sowing and reaping.</p> <p>Purchase the recordings of our 2022 Back to School Conference at <a href= "https://morningtimeformoms.com/events/1758-2/">MorningTimeforMoms.com</a>.

We must remember that ignorance is not innocence, and also that ignorance is the parent of insatiable curiosity.</p> Charlotte Mason  <p>Early in 1851, Dickens suggested in Household Words that a second exhibition be held of “England’s sins and negligences.” When he finally went to the Crystal Palace, he described it as “terrible duffery.” He wrote in July 1851, “I find I am used up by the exhibition. I don’t say there is nothing in it. There is too much. I have only been twice. So many things bewildered me. I have a natural horror of sights, and the fusion of so many sights in one has not decreased it. I’m not sure that I have seen anything but the fountain and perhaps the Amazon. It is a dreadful thing to be obliged to be false, but when anyone says, ‘Have you seen…?’ I say, ‘Yes’, because if I don’t he’ll explain it, and I can’t bear that.</p> Julia Baird, quoting Charles Dickens from “Ode On a Distant Prospect of Clapham Academy” <p><em>by Thomas Hood</em></p> <p>Ah me! those old familiar bounds!  That classic house, those classic grounds  My pensive thought recalls!  What tender urchins now confine,  What little captives now repine,  Within yon irksome walls? </p> <p>Ay, that’s the very house! I know  Its ugly windows, ten a-row!  Its chimneys in the rear!  And there’s the iron rod so high,  That drew the thunder from the sky  And turn’d our table-beer!</p> <p>There I was birch’d! there I was bred!  There like a little Adam fed  From Learning’s woeful tree!  The weary tasks I used to con!—  The hopeless leaves I wept upon!—  Most fruitless leaves to me!—</p> <p>The summon’d class!—the awful bow!—  I wonder who is master now  And wholesome anguish sheds!  How many ushers now employs,  How many maids to see the boys  Have nothing in their heads!</p> Book List: <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3RAsQWo">Formation of Character</a></em> by Charlotte Mason</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3DnuiqC">The Ink Black Heart</a></em> (Cormoran Strike Book 6) by Robert Galbraith</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3UcqUVV">Victoria: The Queen</a></em> by Julia Baird</p> Support The Literary Life: <p>Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/theliterarylife/overview">Patreon,</a> and get some amazing bonus content!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today on The Literary Life Podcast we bring you another fun episode in our “In Search of the Austen Adaptation” series. Hosts Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks are joined by resident film aficionado, Atlee Northmore to discuss film adaptations on <a href="https://amzn.to/3cXQ6OM"><em>Sense and Sensibility</em>.</a> The conversation opens by revisiting the question of what makes a good adaptation of a book when translating it for the screen. They talk about the challenges of showing modern audiences the characters and situations as Jane Austen meant them to be understood. Atlee gives a brief overview of the lesser known film adaptations, as well as a more in depth discussion of the 1995 and 2008 versions.

From Prospero's enchanted cell, As the mighty verses tell, To the throne of Naples he Lit you o'er the trackless sea, Flitting on, your prow before, Like a living meteor. When you die, the silent Moon In her interlunar swoon Is not sadder in her cell Than deserted Ariel.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast with Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks, we have a very special episode for you. Our hosts are joined by guests Dan Bunting and Anthony Dodgers, both of whom are pastors, for a discussion on why pastors should read fiction books. Dan is also host of the the <a href= "https://www.readingthepsalms.com/">Reading the Psalms podcast</a>. Angelina starts off the conversation by asking why these men would prioritize taking literature classes. Anthony shares about his own literary life journey and how rediscovering literature has helped him personally. Dan talks about the book club that he and a couple of his pastor friends have and what kinds of books they read together. They discuss many other deep topics and crucial questions that we hope will be encouraging and thought-provoking to everyone who listens to and shares this episode.</p> <p>Join us for the 2022 Back to School Conference, “Education: Myths and Legends” happening live online this August 1st-6th. Our special guest speakers will be Lynn Bruce and Caitlin Beauchamp, along with our hosts Cindy Rollins, Angelina Stanford and Thomas Banks.

It might be rather fun if we were. It would be pleasant to see some future Prime Minister trying to kill a large and lively milk-white bull in Westminster Hall. But we shan’t. What lurks behind such idle prophecies, if they are anything but careless language, is the false idea that the historical process allows mere reversal; that Europe can come out of Christianity “by the same door as in she went”, and find herself back where she was. It is not what happens. A post-Christian man is not a Pagan; you might as well think that a married woman recovers her virginity by divorce. The post-Christian is cut off from the Christian past, and therefore doubly from the Pagan past.</p> <cite>C. S.

I hardly hear the tuneful babble,      Not knowing nor much caring whether The text is praise or exhortation, Prayer or thanksgiving, or damnation.   Outside it blows wetter and wetter,      The tossing trees never stay still. I shift my elbows to catch better      The full round sweep of heathered hill. The tortured copse bends to and fro In silence like a shadow-show.   The parson’s voice runs like a river      Over smooth rocks, I like this church: The pews are staid, they never shiver,      They never bend or sway or lurch. ‘Prayer,’ says the kind voice, ‘is a chain That draws down Grace from Heaven again.’   I add the hymns up, over and over,      Until there’s not the least mistake.  Seven-seventy-one. (Look! there’s a plover!      It’s gone!) Who’s that Saint by the lake? The red light from his mantle passes Across the broad memorial brasses.   It’s pleasant here for dreams and thinking,      Lolling and letting reason nod, With ugly serious people linking      Sad prayers to a forgiving God . . . . But a dumb blast sets the trees swaying With furious zeal like madmen praying. <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3RK96A2"><em>Put Out More Flags</em></a> by Evelyn Waugh</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3RK96A2">Asterix Comics</a></em> by René Goscinny</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3ofsFm7">Tin Tin</a></em> by Herge</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3IS7vnG">Sigrid Undset</a></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3Pl9004">Giants in the Earth</a></em> by Ole Rolvaag</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3BcujfY">Roald Dahl</a></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3cvPUWI">A Wrinkle in Time</a></em> by Madeleine L’Engle</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3IVntO8">John Donne</a></p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3of2vA2">George Herbert</a></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3ctqbOl">The Complete Stories</a></em> by Flannery O’Connor</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3v4jXel">The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</a></em> by John le Carré</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3zkinYn">Graham Greene</a></p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3OgF7Nj">Alfred Lord Tennyson</a></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3ctqbOl">The New Oxford Book of Christian Verse</a></em> edited by Donald Davie</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3aQ7ZOC">Waiting on the Word</a></em> by Malcolm Guite</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3cp0rmq">Word in the Wilderness</a></em> by Malcolm Guite</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3Or0sDE">Neil Gaiman</a></p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3OnZp7k">Bill Bryson</a></p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3PLZbs5">Ursula Le Guin</a></p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3cteLuj">Terry Pratchett</a></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3v2gzkq">Reflections on the Psalms</a></em> by C.

The half-baked Rousseau-ism in which most of us have been brought up has given us a subconscious notion that the free act is the untrained act. But of course, freedom has nothing to do with the lack of training. We are not free to move until we have learned ot walk. We are not free to express ourselves musically until we have learned music. We are not capable of free thought unless we can think. Similarly, free speech cannot have anything to do with the mumbling and grousing of the ego. Free speech is cultivated and precise speech, which means that there are far too many people who are neither capable of it nor would know if they had lost it. A group of individuals who retain the power and desire of genuine communication is a society. An aggregate of egos is a mob.</p> <cite>Northrop Frye</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>He had had a choice, after all. The army had been keen to keep him, even with half his leg missing. Friends of friends had offered everything from management roles in the close protection industry to business partnerships, but the itch to detect, solve, and reimpose order on the moral universe could not be extinguished in him. He doubted it ever would be.</p> <cite>Robert Galbraith</cite></blockquote> <h3>The Composer</h3> <p><em>by W. H.

The half-baked Rousseau-ism in which most of us have been brought up has given us a subconscious notion that the free act is the untrained act. But of course, freedom has nothing to do with the lack of training. We are not free to move until we have learned ot walk. We are not free to express ourselves musically until we have learned music. We are not capable of free thought unless we can think. Similarly, free speech cannot have anything to do with the mumbling and grousing of the ego. Free speech is cultivated and precise speech, which means that there are far too many people who are neither capable of it nor would know if they had lost it. A group of individuals who retain the power and desire of genuine communication is a society. An aggregate of egos is a mob.</p> Northrop Frye  <p>He had had a choice, after all. The army had been keen to keep him, even with half his leg missing. Friends of friends had offered everything from management roles in the close protection industry to business partnerships, but the itch to detect, solve, and reimpose order on the moral universe could not be extinguished in him. He doubted it ever would be.</p> Robert Galbraith The Composer <p><em>by W. H.

He didn’t, and I was naive to expect him to. Generally, what is more important than getting watertight answers is learning to ask the right questions.</p> Madeleine L’Engle  <p>Stories are able to help us to become more whole, to become named; and naming is one of the impulses behind all art, to give a name to the cosmos we see, despite all the chaos.</p> Madeleine L’Engle  <p>I am inclined to think that her work is in danger of being overlaid by too many interpreters and the simplicity of her message needs preserving.</p> Essex Cholmondeley from Ode: Intimations of Immortality <p><em>by William Wordsworth</em></p>  Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;           We will grieve not, rather find           Strength in what remains behind;           In the primal sympathy           Which having been must ever be;           In the soothing thoughts that spring           Out of human suffering;           In the faith that looks through death, In years that bring the philosophic mind.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Literary Life podcast this week, our hosts are joined in their discussion of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3vaBl1x">The Wind in the Willows</a></em> by Kelly Cumbee. Angelina, Cindy, Thomas and Kelly talk about chapters 7-8, focusing special attention on a section of this book that presents a potential problem for some readers. Angelina opens with background on the Enlightenment and Romanticism, the concept of “the Numinous,” and the popularity of the Pan character in Edwardian times. Thomas gives us a classical picture of who Pan was in mythology. Kelly then speaks to the Medieval understanding of the figure of Pan and the pastoral tradition along with their connections with Christ. They also address concerns over neo-paganism in relation to this book.

The worst is better than none, and the best cannot be expected to go quite true.</p> <cite>Samuel Johnson</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>“Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love letter, and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is the nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere ‘modernity’ cannot kill.”</p> <cite>Bram Stoker</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>This malady of unbelief, again, is common to serious minds, educated to examine all things before they <em>know</em> the things they criticise by the slow, sure process of assimilating ideas. If we would but receive it, we are not capable of examining that which we do not <em>know</em>; and knowledge is the result of a slow, involuntary process, impossible to a mind in the critical attitude. Let us who teach spend time in the endeavour to lay proper and abundant nutriment before the young, rather than in leading them to criticise and examine every morsel of knowledge that comes their way. Who could live if every mouthful of bodily food were held up on a fork for critical examination before it be eaten?</p> <cite>Charlotte Mason</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Suppose you were told that there was a tiger in the next room: you would know that you were in danger and would probably feel fear. But if you were told “There is a ghost in the next room,” and believed it, you would feel, indeed, what is often called fear, but of a different kind. It would not be based on the knowledge of danger, for no one is primarily afraid of what a ghost may do to him, but of the mere fact that it is a ghost. It is “uncanny” rather than dangerous, and the special kind of fear it excites may be called Dread. With the Uncanny one has reached the fringes of the Numinous. Now suppose that you were told simply “There is a might spirit in the room” and believed it. Your feelings would then be even less like the mere fear of danger: but the disturbance would be profound. You would feel wonder and a certain shrinking–described as awe, and the object which excites it is the Numinous.</p> <cite>C. S.

After expanding on their commonplace quotes, Angelina, Cindy, Thomas and Atlee start the film talk with the “dreadful” 1935 RKO version. Then they move on to dig in to how <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3vTDEVP">En</a></em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3vTDEVP"><em>chanted April</em></a> was and brought to the big screen in 1991 and why it worked so well as an adaptation of the novel.</p> <p>Our next book will be <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3vaBl1x">The Wind in the Willows</a></em> by Kenneth Graham, starting May 17th, so be sure to join us for that as well!</p> <p>Cindy’s 2022 Morning Time for Moms Summer Discipleship group is now open for registration.

Only the arts and sciences can do that; and of these, only literature gives us the whole sweep and range of human imagination as it sees itself. It seems to be very difficult for many people to understand the reality and intensity of literary experience.</p> <cite>Northrop Frye</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Education is always an individual endeavor. In terms of a future renewal, much of it will depend on a commitment to individualism, something that has been much maligned in recent years. We hear so much trendy, tedious talk about how bad individualism is and how we need to think in terms of “the group.” The problem is that the group usually offers conformity, not genuine community.</p> <cite>Morris Berman</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>And yet, we are still being taught that fairy tales and myths are to be discarded as soon as we are old enough to understand “reality.” I received a disturbed and angry letter from a young mother who told me that a friend of hers with young children gave them only instructive books. She wasn’t going to allow their minds to be polluted with fairy tales. They were going to be taught the “real world.” This attitude is a victory for the powers of this world. A friend of mine, a fine storyteller, remarked to me, “Jesus was not a theologian. He was a God Who told stories.” Yes, God Who told stories.</p> <cite>Madeleine L’Engle</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>The general fate of sects is to obtain a high reputation for sanctity while they are oppressed, and to lose it as soon as they become powerful.</p> <cite>Thomas Macaulay</cite></blockquote> <h3>To Italy</h3> <p><em>by Percy Shelley</em></p> <pre class="wp-block-verse"> As the sunrise to the night, As the north wind to the clouds, As the earthquake's fiery flight, Ruining mountain solitudes, Everlasting Italy, Be those hopes and fears on thee.</pre> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3uiLFTs">The Enchanted April</a></em> by Elizabeth von Arnim</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3vxsAyR">The Educated Imagination</a></em> by Northrop Frye</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3vXBkgt">The Twilight of American Culture</a></em> by Morris Berman</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3F4x6b0">Jayber Crow</a></em> by Wendell Berry</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3ksyZVJ">Walking on Water</a></em> by Madeleine L’Engle</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3LAFPV0">A Wrinkle in Time</a></em> by Madeleine L’Engle</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3F4tFBb">The History of England</a></em> by Thomas Macaulay</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3MLIviz">Tea with the Dames</a> documentary</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3KsrecQ">Brideshead Revisited</a></em> by Evelyn Waugh</p> <h3>Support The Literary Life:</h3> <p>Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/theliterarylife/overview">Patreon,</a> and get some amazing bonus content!

Angelina and Thomas begin the conversation sharing some thoughts on modern literature and why we don’t hear of modern authors like Elizabeth von Arnim among “the academy.” Cindy tells us what stood out to her most in the second half of the book and the surprising turns von Arnim takes in the storyline.

They have no means of knowing what will reach a child; whether the evil which blows his way may not incline him to good, or whether the too-insistent good may not predispose him to evil. Perhaps the forces of life as they come should be allowed to play upon the child, who is not, be it remembered, a product of educational care, but a <em>person</em> whose spiritual nurture is accomplished by that wind which bloweth whither it listeth.</p> <cite>Charlotte Mason, <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3vB0EJf">Formation of Character</a></em></cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Chaste and ardent eros for the Beautiful is the first task of human life, and falling in love with Beauty is the beginning of every adventure that matters.</p> <cite>Timothy Patitsas</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>To be sure, there are limits and patterns governing the transposition of beauty into truth, such that it can never be mapped fully in the reductive way some would insist.

Beauty creates its own structure, a form that may not be perfectly linear and symmetrical, but which is still harmonious and beneficial, and in its odd way, perfectly accurate. Through the surprising order of the beautiful, reason participates in and discloses living mystery as mystery.

The summer night waneth, the morning light slips,  Faint and grey 'twixt the leaves of the aspen, <br />betwixt the cloud-bars  That are patiently waiting there for the dawn:  Patient and colourless, though Heaven's gold  Waits to float through them along with the sun.  Far out in the meadows, above the young corn,  The heavy elms wait, and restless and cold  The uneasy wind rises; the roses are dun;  Through the long twilight they pray for the dawn,  Round the lone house in the midst of the corn,  Speak but one word to me over the corn,  Over the tender, bow'd locks of the corn.</pre> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3uiLFTs">The Enchanted April</a></em> by Elizabeth von Arnim</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/36FUEq9">The Ethics of Beauty</a></em> by Timothy Patitsas</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3EOb8sY">Katherine Mansfield</a></p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3K9InrH">Barbara Pym</a></p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3Kh2pRe"><em>The Narnian</em></a> by Alan Jacobs</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3k6wyYB"><em>Vera</em></a> by Elizabeth von Arnim</p> <h3>Support The Literary Life:</h3> <p>Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/theliterarylife/overview">Patreon,</a> and get some amazing bonus content!

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The Literary Life podcast with Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks. This week our hosts begin their discussion of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3uiLFTs">The Enchanted April</a></em> by Elizabeth von Arnim, covering chapters 1-11. Thomas gives some interesting biographical information about von Arnim, and Angelina shares some perspective on appreciating the art and the life of artist. Cindy highlights the fact that we see only caricatures of the women in England, and it isn’t until they get to Italy that we begin to see their real selves. Angelina also points out that all the women are on identity quests in this story. Angelina unpacks some of the metaphors in this book and the Dante-esque images, in addition to the key place beauty has in the story. <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Whoso maintains that I am humbled now</p> <p>(Who await the Awful Day) is still a liar;</p> <p>I hope to meet my Maker brow to brow</p> <p>And find my own is higher.</p> <cite>Frances Cornford, “Epitaph for a Book Reviewer”</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>“(The) sufferer is by definition a customer.”</p> <cite>Wendell Berry, from <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3rzId6y">The Art of the Commonplace</a></em></cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Beauty will save the world.</p> <cite>Fyodor Dostoyevsky</cite></blockquote> <h3>Sonnet 98</h3> <p><em>by William Shakespeare</em></p> <pre class="wp-block-verse"> From you have I been absent in the spring, When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim, Hath put a spirit of youth in everything, That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Literary Life podcast today, our hosts are bringing you another “Literary Life Of” interview episode. This week’s guest is Kay Pelham, a lifelong reader, veteran homeschooling mother, and accomplished pianist. After sharing their commonplace quotes, Angelina, Cindy and Kay dig into their conversation about the journey of Kay’s reading life. She shares a little about her family of story-tellers and readers, her personal reading versus school studies, and how her reading life changed as a young adult. Kay also talks about how she came to homeschool using Charlotte Mason’s philosophy. The discussion turns to Kay’s self-education journey as an older adult and she gives encouragement for anyone coming to this later in life. You can read Kay’s own thoughts on books and more at <a href="http://kaypelham.com">KayPelham.com</a>.</p> <p>Join us this spring for our next Literary Life Conference “The Battle Over Children’s Literature” featuring special guest speaker Vigen Guroian.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life, our hosts wrap up their series on <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3vE4Eu0">The Abolition of Man</a></em> by C. S. Lewis. Angelina kicks off today’s conversation about chapter 3 with more exploration and clarification of the concept of “the Tao.” Cindy talks about the importance of respect for the past and how much we have lost by letting go of that. Thomas highlights the fact that so many education theorists were men who never had reared children and the difference that a mother’s experience makes. One of the main themes of this discussion is the state of education and Lewis’ prescient insight into our current cultural climate. Lewis also goes beyond criticizing scientism by laying out his vision for good science.</p> <p>We will be back next week with a “Literary Life of…” interview with a surprise guest. After that we will take a short break for the conference, and return in April with a read along of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3uiLFTs">The Enchanted April</a></em> by Elizabeth von Arnim.</p> <p>Join us this spring for our next Literary Life Conference “The Battle Over Children’s Literature” featuring special guest speaker Vigen Guroian.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life, our hosts wrap up their series on <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3vE4Eu0">The Abolition of Man</a></em> by C. S. Lewis. Angelina kicks off today’s conversation about chapter 3 with more exploration and clarification of the concept of “the Tao.” Cindy talks about the importance of respect for the past and how much we have lost by letting go of that. Thomas highlights the fact that so many education theorists were men who never had reared children and the difference that a mother’s experience makes. One of the main themes of this discussion is the state of education and Lewis’ prescient insight into our current cultural climate. Lewis also goes beyond criticizing scientism by laying out his vision for good science.</p> <p>We will be back next week with a “Literary Life of…” interview with a surprise guest. After that we will take a short break for the conference, and return in April with a read along of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3uiLFTs">The Enchanted April</a></em> by Elizabeth von Arnim.</p> <p>Join us this spring for our next Literary Life Conference “The Battle Over Children’s Literature” featuring special guest speaker Vigen Guroian. The live online conference will take place April 7-9, 2022, and you can go to <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> for more information.</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>Only in destroying I find ease for my relentless thoughts.</p> Satan in <em>Paradise Lost</em>, by John Milton  <p>…the fact that the story does not turn on children, and does not foster that self-consciousness, the dawn of which in the child is, perhaps, the individual “Fall of Man.”</p> Charlotte Mason  <p>The physical sciences, good and innocent in themselves, had already begun to be warped, had been subtly maneuvered in a certain direction. Despair of objective truth had been increasingly insinuated into the scientists; indifference to it, and a concentration upon mere power, had been the result.</p> C. S. Lewis, in <em>That Hideous Strength</em> Who Has Seen the Wind? <p><em>by Christina Rossetti</em></p> Who has seen the wind? Neither I nor you: But when the leaves hang trembling, The wind is passing through.  Who has seen the wind? Neither you nor I: But when the trees bow down their heads, The wind is passing by.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Our hosts are back on The Literary Life podcast this week with another fun episode in our series “In Search of the Austen Adaptation.” In this episode, Angelina, Cindy, and Thomas are joined again by Atlee Northmore to discuss the several film versions of Jane Austen’s <em>Emma</em>. To start the conversation, Angelina highlights the challenges of adapting <em>Emma</em> to film. Atlee outlines the major film adaptations of <em>Emma</em>. Then they discuss the ups and downs of the various adaptations, as well as casting, personal favorites and production choices.</p> <p>Join us this spring for our next Literary Life Conference “The Battle Over Children’s Literature” featuring special guest speaker Vigen Guroian.

There is the direct experience of the world itself, while we’re reading a book or seeing a play, especially for the first time. This experience is uncritical, or rather pre-critical, so it’s not infallible. If our experience is limited, we can be roused to enthusiasm or carried away by something that we can later see to have been second-rate or even phony. Then there is the conscious, critical response we make after we’ve finished reading or left the theatre, where we compare what we’ve experienced with other things of the same kind, and form a judgment of value and proportion on it. This critical response, with practice, gradually makes our pre-critical responses more sensitive and accurate, or improves our taste, as we say. But behind our responses to our literary experience as a whole, as a total possession.</p> <cite>Northrup Frye</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Reason thus with life:</p> <p>If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</p> <p>That none but fools would keep.</p> <cite>William Shakespeare</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>A boat will not answer to the rudder unless it is in motion; the poet can work upon us only as long as we are kept on the move.</p> <cite>C. S. Lewis</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>The wit of Jane Austen has for partner the perfection of her taste. Her fool is a fool, her snob is a snob, because he departs from the model of sanity and sense which she had in mind, and conveys to us unmistakably even while she makes us laugh. Never did any novelist make more use of an impeccable sense of human values. It is against the disc of an unerring heart, an unfailing good taste, an almost stern morality, that she shows up those deviations from kindness, truth, sincerity which are among the most delightful things on English literature.</p> <cite>Virginia Woolf</cite></blockquote> <h3>Selection from “Epistle to a Lady, Of the Characters of Women”</h3> <p><em>by Alexander Pope</em></p> <pre class="wp-block-verse"> Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Literary Life podcast this week, we will wrap up our series on Shakespeare’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3FJo6Hn">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</a></em>. Our hosts, Angelina, Cindy and Thomas walk through the last two acts of the play, sharing their thoughts on the structure and ideas presented here. Angelina talks about why she thinks Shakespeare resolves the different conflicts the way he does. They discuss the importance of the play within the play, the fairy tale atmosphere, and the unreality of time and space. Cindy and Angelina both bring up plot points that feel slightly problematic to them. Angelina highlights the theme of harmonizing discord and bringing order from disorder.</p> <p>On February 8th, Angelina will be offering a webinar on Jonathan Swift: Enemy of the Enlightenment. Check it out at <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/webinars/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a>.</p> <p>Join us this spring for our next Literary Life Conference “The Battle Over Children’s Literature” featuring special guest speaker Vigen Guroian. The live online conference will take place April 7-9, 2022, and you can go to <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> for more information.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Revolutionaries always hang their best friends.</p> <cite>Christopher Hollis</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>It is easy to forget that the man who writes a good love sonnet needs not only be enamored of a woman, but also to be enamored of the sonnet.</p> <cite>C. S. Lewis</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>For the end of imagination is harmony. A right imagination, being the reflex of the creation, will fall in with the divine order of things as the highest form of its own operation; “will tune its instrument here at the door” to the divine harmonies within; will be content alone with growth towards the divine idea, which includes all that is beautiful in the imperfect imagination of men; will know that every deviation from that growth is downward; and will therefore send the man forth from its loftiest representations to do the commonest duty of the most wearisome calling in a hearty and hopeful spirit. This is the work of the right imagination; and towards this work every imagination, in proportion to the rightness that is in it, will tend. The reveries even of the wise man will make him stronger for his work; his dreaming as well as his thinking will render him sorry for past failure, and hopeful of future success.</p> <cite>George MacDonald</cite></blockquote> <h3>Earth’s Secret</h3> <p><em>by George Meredith</em></p> <pre class="wp-block-verse">Not solitarily in fields we find Earth's secret open, though one page is there; Her plainest, such as children spell, and share With bird and beast; raised letters for the blind. Not where the troubled passions toss the mind, In turbid cities, can the key be bare. It hangs for those who hither thither fare, Close interthreading nature with our kind. They, hearing History speak, of what men were, And have become, are wise.  The gain is great In vision and solidity; it lives.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to The Literary Life podcast and our series on Shakespeare’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3FJo6Hn">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</a>.</em> After kicking off the episode with their commonplace quotes, Angelina, Cindy and Thomas start digging into the play itself. Thomas brings up the importance of the timing of this story being midsummer. Angelina gives a little background into the names and characters in this play as well as some of the major ideas we can be looking for in the story.</p> <p>In February Angelina will be offering a webinar on Jonathan Swift: Enemy of the Enlightenment. Check it out at <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/webinars/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a>.</p> <p>Join us this spring for our next Literary Life Conference “The Battle Over Children’s Literature” featuring special guest speaker Vigen Guroian. The live online conference will take place April 7-9, 2022, and you can go to <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> for more information.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Cousin Swift, you will never be a poet.</p> <cite>John Dryden, in a letter to Jonathan Swift</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>It would be difficult indeed to define wherein lay the peculiar truth of the phrase “merrie England”, though some conception of it is quite necessary to the comprehension of <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>. In some cases at least, it may be said to lie in this, that the English of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, unlike the England of today, could conceive of the idea of a merry supernaturalism.</p> <cite>G. K. Chesterton</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>And yet, there are people who say that Shakespeare always means, “just what he says.” He thinks that to find over and under meanings in Shakespeare’s plays is to take unwarranted liberties with them, is like a man who holds the word “spring” must refer only to a particular period of the year, and could not possibly mean birth, or youth or hope. He is a man who has never associated anything with anything else. He is a man without metaphors, and such a man is no man at all, let alone a poet.</p> <cite>Harold Goddard</cite></blockquote> <h3>Advice to Lovers</h3> <p><em>by Robert Graves</em></p> <pre class="wp-block-verse">I knew an old man at a Fair Who made it his twice-yearly task To clamber on a cider cask And cry to all the yokels there:--  "Lovers to-day and for all time Preserve the meaning of my rhyme: Love is not kindly nor yet grim But does to you as you to him.  "Whistle, and Love will come to you, Hiss, and he fades without a word, Do wrong, and he great wrong will do, Speak, he retells what he has heard.  "Then all you lovers have good heed Vex not young Love in word or deed: Love never leaves an unpaid debt, He will not pardon nor forget."  The old man's voice was sweet yet loud And this shows what a man was he, He'd scatter apples to the crowd And give great draughts of cider, free.</pre> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><a href= "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/623/623-h/623-h.htm">“Battle of the Books”</a> by Jonathan Swift</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3Apsvhn">Gulliver’s Travels</a></em> by Jonathan Swift</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3GVUxn7">Orthodoxy</a></em> by G.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to The Literary Life podcast and our series on Shakespeare’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3FJo6Hn">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</a>.</em> After kicking off the episode with their commonplace quotes, Angelina, Cindy and Thomas start digging into the play itself. Thomas brings up the importance of the timing of this story being midsummer. Angelina gives a little background into the names and characters in this play as well as some of the major ideas we can be looking for in the story.</p> <p>In February Angelina will be offering a webinar on Jonathan Swift: Enemy of the Enlightenment. Check it out at <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/webinars/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a>.</p> <p>Join us this spring for our next Literary Life Conference “The Battle Over Children’s Literature” featuring special guest speaker Vigen Guroian. The live online conference will take place April 7-9, 2022, and you can go to <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> for more information.</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>Cousin Swift, you will never be a poet.</p> John Dryden, in a letter to Jonathan Swift  <p>It would be difficult indeed to define wherein lay the peculiar truth of the phrase “merrie England”, though some conception of it is quite necessary to the comprehension of <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>. In some cases at least, it may be said to lie in this, that the English of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, unlike the England of today, could conceive of the idea of a merry supernaturalism.</p> G. K. Chesterton  <p>And yet, there are people who say that Shakespeare always means, “just what he says.” He thinks that to find over and under meanings in Shakespeare’s plays is to take unwarranted liberties with them, is like a man who holds the word “spring” must refer only to a particular period of the year, and could not possibly mean birth, or youth or hope. He is a man who has never associated anything with anything else. He is a man without metaphors, and such a man is no man at all, let alone a poet.</p> Harold Goddard Advice to Lovers <p><em>by Robert Graves</em></p> I knew an old man at a Fair Who made it his twice-yearly task To clamber on a cider cask And cry to all the yokels there:--  "Lovers to-day and for all time Preserve the meaning of my rhyme: Love is not kindly nor yet grim But does to you as you to him.  "Whistle, and Love will come to you, Hiss, and he fades without a word, Do wrong, and he great wrong will do, Speak, he retells what he has heard.  "Then all you lovers have good heed Vex not young Love in word or deed: Love never leaves an unpaid debt, He will not pardon nor forget."  The old man's voice was sweet yet loud And this shows what a man was he, He'd scatter apples to the crowd And give great draughts of cider, free.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast we have a fun episode for you to kick off a fun series of episodes that will come up from time to time, “In Search of the Austen Adaptation.” This week our hosts Angelina, Cindy and Thomas are joined by Atlee Northmore, and together they are debating which film version of Jane Austen’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3xu6P25">Pride and Prejudice</a></em> is the best. Atlee shares some of the history of the Pride and Prejudice adaptations that were made for TV and film. Angelina highlights different ideas of what makes a good film adaptation of a book. Cindy brings up the importance of the casting, and Angelina talks about why she still feels like no film has gotten Mr. Darcy right. She also talks about the difficulty of embodying the virtues that Jane Austen gives her characters. Our hosts critique each major movies from over the decades, sharing what they like and dislike about each one.</p> <p><a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Pride-and-Prejudice-Adaptations.pdf"> Click here</a> to download the PDF Atlee created for all the Pride and Prejudice film adaptations.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>If we cannot get the better of life, at any rate, we can be so free as to laugh at it.</p> <cite>Desmond MacCarthy</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Jane Austen is thus a mistress of much deeper emotion than appears upon the surface.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, we are excited to bring you a much anticipated interview with Dr. Carolyn Weber, author of the popular memoir, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2YGmoqu">Surprised by Oxford</a></em>.

To keep up with Carolyn, visit <a href= "https://www.carolynweber.com">carolynweber.com</a> or follow her on <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/CarolynWeber.author/photos/?ref=page_internal"> Facebook</a>. Angelina and Cindy kick off the conversation by asking Carolyn about her childhood and how she came to love reading. They talk about her experience in school education and whether that differed from her personal reading life. Carolyn talks about her love of teaching and her immersive literary education experience at Oxford. She also expands on the way that reading the Bible for the first time opened her eyes to so many more of the truths in the literature she had read.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Unexpectedly, it was Oxford that taught me it was okay to be both feminine and smart, that intelligence was, as a friend put it, a “woman’s best cosmetic.”</p> <cite>Carolyn Weber</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>I’m like an addict when it comes to books.

Critical, and with nothing else to do, I scan the Contents page, Relieved to find the names are mostly new; No one my age.  Like all strangers, they divide by sex: Landscape Near Parma Interests a man, so does The Double Vortex, So does Rilke and Buddha.  “I travel, you see”, “I think” and “I can read” These titles seem to say; But I Remember You, Love is my Creed, Poem for J.,  The ladies’ choice, discountenance my patter For several seconds; From somewhere in this (as in any) matter A moral beckons.  Should poets bicycle-pump the human heart Or squash it flat? Man’s love is of man’s life a thing apart; Girls aren’t like that.  We men have got love well weighed up; our stuff Can get by without it. Women don’t seem to think that’s good enough; They write about it.  And the awful way their poems lay them open Just doesn’t strike them. Women are really much nicer than men: No wonder we like them.

Angelina, Cindy and Thomas share their commonplace quotes, then dive into the book chat, beginning with some commentary on Fanny’s education in contrast to that of the Bertram sisters. They also talk about the concepts of restraint, temptation, and boundaries and how we see these ideas play out in the various characters.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to The Literary Life podcast with Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks. Today our hosts embark on a new series of discussions as we read through Jane Austen’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3l5CBy3">Mansfield Park</a></em> together. To view the schedule for the episodes in this series, see our <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/upcoming-events/">Upcoming Events page</a>.</p> <p>Our hosts open the conversation with their first experience with this book and some thoughts on why people may struggle with <em>Mansfield Park</em> more than any other Austen novel. Angelina highlights the similarities some people note between Austen and Shakespeare and how this book illustrates that point. Thomas responds to criticisms that Fanny is a “prig.” Cindy brings up the importance of place in this book thematically. Other ideas they discuss in this episode are moving from blindness to sight, the importance of triangles in this book, and appearances versus reality.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Many come to wish their tower a well…</p> <cite>W. H. Auden, from “The Quest”</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Sadly, we do not have a Christian culture today that easily discriminates between a person of spiritual depth and a person of raw talent. Like the wheat and the tares of Jesus’ parable, they can be difficult to distinguish. The result is that more than a few people can be fooled into thinking they are being influenced by a spiritual giant when, in fact, they are being manipulated by a dwarf.</p> <cite>Gordon MacDonald</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Would you think I was joking if I said that you can put a clock back, and that if the clock is wrong it is often a very sensible thing to do? But I would rather get away from that whole idea of clocks. We all want to progress. But progress mean getting nearer to the place where you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turning, then to go forward does not get you any nearer. If you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man… If you look at the present state of the big mistake. We are on the wrong road. And if that is so, we must go back. Going back is the quickest way on.</p> <cite>C. S. Lewis</cite></blockquote> <h3>Fairy-tale Logic</h3> <p><em>by A. E. Stallings</em></p> <p>Fairy tales are full of impossible tasks:<br /> Gather the chin hairs of a man-eating goat,<br /> Or cross a sulphuric lake in a leaky boat,<br /> Select the prince from a row of identical masks,<br /> Tiptoe up to a dragon where it basks<br /> And snatch its bone; count dust specks, mote by mote,<br /> Or learn the phone directory by rote.<br /> Always it’s impossible what someone asks—</p> <p>You have to fight magic with magic. You have to believe<br /> That you have something impossible up your sleeve,<br /> The language of snakes, perhaps, an invisible cloak,<br /> An army of ants at your beck, or a lethal joke,<br /> The will to do whatever must be done:<br /> Marry a monster. Hand over your firstborn son.</p> <p class="has-small-font-size"><em>As printed in <a href= "https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/53377/fairy-tale-logic"> Poetry Magazine</a>, March 2010</em></p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3ou3yNL"><em>Ordering Your Private World</em></a> by Gordon MacDonald</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2WClOZT">Voyage of the Dawn Treader</a></em> by C.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to The Literary Life podcast with Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks. Today our hosts embark on a new series of discussions as we read through Jane Austen’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3l5CBy3">Mansfield Park</a></em> together. To view the schedule for the episodes in this series, see our <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/upcoming-events/">Upcoming Events page</a>.</p> <p>Our hosts open the conversation with their first experience with this book and some thoughts on why people may struggle with <em>Mansfield Park</em> more than any other Austen novel. Angelina highlights the similarities some people note between Austen and Shakespeare and how this book illustrates that point. Thomas responds to criticisms that Fanny is a “prig.” Cindy brings up the importance of place in this book thematically. Other ideas they discuss in this episode are moving from blindness to sight, the importance of triangles in this book, and appearances versus reality.</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>Many come to wish their tower a well…</p> W. H. Auden, from “The Quest”  <p>Sadly, we do not have a Christian culture today that easily discriminates between a person of spiritual depth and a person of raw talent. Like the wheat and the tares of Jesus’ parable, they can be difficult to distinguish. The result is that more than a few people can be fooled into thinking they are being influenced by a spiritual giant when, in fact, they are being manipulated by a dwarf.</p> Gordon MacDonald  <p>Would you think I was joking if I said that you can put a clock back, and that if the clock is wrong it is often a very sensible thing to do? But I would rather get away from that whole idea of clocks. We all want to progress. But progress mean getting nearer to the place where you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turning, then to go forward does not get you any nearer. If you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man… If you look at the present state of the big mistake. We are on the wrong road. And if that is so, we must go back. Going back is the quickest way on.</p> C. S. Lewis Fairy-tale Logic <p><em>by A. E. Stallings</em></p> <p>Fairy tales are full of impossible tasks: Gather the chin hairs of a man-eating goat, Or cross a sulphuric lake in a leaky boat, Select the prince from a row of identical masks, Tiptoe up to a dragon where it basks And snatch its bone; count dust specks, mote by mote, Or learn the phone directory by rote. Always it’s impossible what someone asks—</p> <p>You have to fight magic with magic. You have to believe That you have something impossible up your sleeve, The language of snakes, perhaps, an invisible cloak, An army of ants at your beck, or a lethal joke, The will to do whatever must be done: Marry a monster. Hand over your firstborn son.</p> <p class="has-small-font-size"><em>As printed in <a href= "https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/53377/fairy-tale-logic"> Poetry Magazine</a>, March 2010</em></p> Book List: <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3ou3yNL"><em>Ordering Your Private World</em></a> by Gordon MacDonald</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2WClOZT">Voyage of the Dawn Treader</a></em> by C.

Angelina kicks of the book chat with a look at the format of the story and how it keeps us in suspense. Thomas brings up the idea of forbidden knowledge found in this book and the similarities between it and <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3927c8Q">Frankenstein</a></em>. Some other topics covered in this episode include the dangers of dehumanizing victims of crime, the nature of sin and addiction, the Renaissance idea of the well-ordered man, and the mythic qualities of this story.</p> <p>Be sure to check out Thomas’ class on The French Revolution and other fall webinars at <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/webinars/">House of Humane Letters</a>.

The rod produces an effect which terminates in itself. A child is afraid of being whipped, and gets his task, and there’s an end on’t; whereas, by exciting emulation and comparisons of superiority, you lay the foundation of lasting mischief; you make brothers and sisters hate each other.</p> <cite>Samuel Johnson, as quoted by James Boswell</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Do not talk about Shakespeare’s mistakes: they are probably your own</p> <cite>G. M. Young</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>The most influential books, and the truest in their influence, are works of fiction. They do not pin the reader to a dogma, which he must afterwards discover to be inexact; they do not teach him a lesson, which he must afterwards unlearn… They disengage us from ourselves, they constrain us to the acquaintance of others; and they show us the web of experience, not as we see it for ourselves, but with a singular change–that monstrous, consuming ego of ours being, for the nonce, struck out.</p> <cite>Robert Louis Stevenson</cite></blockquote> <h3>R L S</h3> <p><em>by A.

She and Thomas also discuss some of the differences between early and late Victorian writers. They also begin digging into the first section of the book.</p> <p>Join us again next week for the second part of this discussion. The fall schedule for the podcast will be posted soon on our <a href="https://www.theliterary.life/upcoming-events/">Upcoming Events</a> page for those who want to know what we will be reading and talking about on the podcast next!</p> <p>Don’t forget to check out our sister podcast, <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/the-well-read-poem/">The Well Read Poem</a>, as well as Cindy’s new podcast, <a href= "https://thenewmasonjar.com">The New Mason Jar</a>!</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>I would rather (said he) have the rod to be the general terrour to all, to make them learn, than tell a child, if you do thus, or thus, you will be more esteemed than your brothers or sisters. The rod produces an effect which terminates in itself. A child is afraid of being whipped, and gets his task, and there’s an end on’t; whereas, by exciting emulation and comparisons of superiority, you lay the foundation of lasting mischief; you make brothers and sisters hate each other.</p> Samuel Johnson, as quoted by James Boswell  <p>Do not talk about Shakespeare’s mistakes: they are probably your own</p> G. M. Young  <p>The most influential books, and the truest in their influence, are works of fiction. They do not pin the reader to a dogma, which he must afterwards discover to be inexact; they do not teach him a lesson, which he must afterwards unlearn… They disengage us from ourselves, they constrain us to the acquaintance of others; and they show us the web of experience, not as we see it for ourselves, but with a singular change–that monstrous, consuming ego of ours being, for the nonce, struck out.</p> Robert Louis Stevenson R L S <p><em>by A. E. Houseman</em></p> <p>Home is the sailor, home from sea: Her far-borne canvas furled The ship pours shining on the quay The plunder of the world.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to this week’s episode of The Literary Life Podcast! Today our hosts Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks tackle the tough questions so many people ask about reading stories dealing with magic. First off, Angelina affirms the need to discernment and the desire to steer clear of that which would be a stumbling block for our children. Cindy shares a little about her own concern when her children were very young. Then they set the groundwork by defining some terms and considering the kinds of questions we need to ask, beginning with Scripture and the church fathers. Be sure to listen to the end when Angelina, Cindy and Thomas suggest some criteria for evaluating magic elements in books before handing them to their students.</p> <p>Come back next week when we will explore Robert Louis Stevenson’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3jalxWK">The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a></em>.</p> <p>Don’t forget to check out our sister podcast, <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/the-well-read-poem/">The Well Read Poem</a>, as well as Cindy’s new podcast, <a href= "https://thenewmasonjar.com">The New Mason Jar</a>!</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>I am not conscious of having ever bought a book from a motive of ostentation.</p> <cite>Edward Gibbon</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>There is no language and no knowledge without symbol and metaphor.

Talking about college, Atlee tells about wanting to be a film maker and his experience studying writing screen plays. He shares how college and life circumstances temporarily dampened his love for story, but taking classes with Angelina and listening to the podcast has brought it all back.</p> <p>Also, if you are listening to this episode on the day it drops, you are not too late to sign up and join our 2021 Back to School online conference with special guest James Daniels!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to this week’s episode of The Literary Life and our discussion of Fred Uhlman’s novella “<a href= "https://archive.org/details/reunion000uhlm">Reunion</a>.” After they finished sharing their commonplace quotes, Cindy shares how she came across this novella and why she wanted to discuss it on the podcast. Thomas talks about the historical backdrop of the book as well as a little biographical info about the Uhlman. Angelina points out how much this story drove home the point of how assimilated the Jewish people were into European society and culture. They talk about the friendship between Hans and Konradin and their common taste in great literature. Other topics discussed were the unreality of what was happening in Germany, personal loyalty versus political loyalty, the dilemma of understanding pre-World War II Germany, and the power of a faithful life. Join us back here next week for an episode on The Literary Life of Atlee Northmore!</p> <p>We are excited to announce our third annual Literary Life Back to School Online Conference!

I never really like stories about children doing what children do–quarreling and cooking and camping. I like magic, the unreal, the more than real.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s episode of The Literary Life podcast is in celebration of our 100th episode! Our host held a LIVE Q&A session in the Patreon group, fielding questions from patrons and social media followers alike. Questions range from topics such as what has surprised them about their reading lives this year, to what writing projects they have going on behind the scenes, to literary landmarks and so much more! Thank you to all our listeners and supporters for making this journey possible and for just listening every week. We appreciate each and every one of you!</p> <p>Join us again next week for our discussion of Frank Uhlman’s short story “<a href= "https://archive.org/details/reunion000uhlm">Reunion</a>.”</p> <p>We are excited to announce our third annual Literary Life Back to School Online Conference! This year’s theme is Awakening: The Pursuit of True Education, and our featured guest speaker is James Daniels. The conference will take place on August 4-7, 2021, and you can learn more and register at <a href= "https://morningtimeformoms.com/product/back-to-school-2021-awakening/">morningtimeformoms.com</a>. </p> <p>Cindy also has some exciting announcements, including the debut of the new expanded edition of her book <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3k4Zwtc">Morning Time: A Liturgy of Love</a></em>, is now available! AND she is starting a new Charlotte Mason podcast called <a href="https://thenewmasonjar.com/">The New Mason Jar</a>, set to begin airing on August 5, 2021! </p> <h3>Listen to The Literary Life:</h3> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>If you’ve got something you want to say, just think first as to whether it’s really worthwhile, and you’re sure to find that it isn’t.</p> <cite>Hugh Walpole, “The Enemy in Ambush”</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>The vicar’s wife would not be quite that endless whimper of self-pity which she now is, if she did not in a sense “love” the family. The continued disappointment of her continued and ruthless demand for sympathy, for affection, for appreciation has helped to make her what she is. The greed to be loved is a fearful thing.

Half our troubles, both individual neuroses and collective manias like nationalism, seem to me to be caused largely by our poverty of symbols, so that not only do we fail to relate one experience to another but also we have to entrust our whole emotional life to the few symbols we do have.</p> <cite>W.H.

Forster chat, you can go listen to our hosts discuss “The Celestial Omnibus” in <a href="https://www.theliterary.life/017/">Episode 17</a>. Angelina points out how this story made her think of Dante. Thomas and Cindy share their personal reactions to reading “The Machine Stops.” They marvel at how prescient Forster was to imagine a world that comes so close to our current reality.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first episode in our series on Sophocles’ Greek drama <em><a href= "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54543">Antigone</a></em>. After sharing a little about their background with this play, Angelina, Cindy and Thomas talk about the overall structure and the conventions of Greek Drama and Greek Tragedy.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week, your Literary Life podcast hosts, Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks are happy to be joined by Kelly Cumbee to talk about Edmund Spenser. They begin the conversation with Kelly giving a little biographical information on Spenser. Kelly shares how she came to read <em>The Faerie Queene</em> with her own children and for her education, then fell in love with it herself. Angelina talks about Spenser's style of writing and his vision for creating a medieval feel in his work. Kelly gives us a brief synopsis of the general outline of <em>The Faerie Queene</em> and the virtues that are the focus of each book. Some other topics they discuss are the courtly love tradition, the harmony between the court and the country, the journey of the soul pictured in the quest stories, and the levels of reading that may be applied to <em>The Faerie Queene.</em></p> <p>Cindy is hosting a new summer discipleship course for moms this year, so head over to <a href= "https://morningtimeformoms.com/product/morning-time-for-moms-summer-discipleship-2021/"> morningtimeformoms.com</a> for more info and to sign up!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Literary Life podcast today, our hosts wrap up their series on Ray Bradbury’s <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3vEd0P7">Fahrenheit 451</a></em>. Angelina, Cindy and Thomas open the discussion with some commentary on the wickedness in the heart of every human and the cost of courage to stand against the crowd. They examine Beatty’s character and why he might have wanted to die. Angelina brings up the way in which Montag’s courage convicts Faber of his own cowardice. They also talk about the detrimental effects of pleasure-seeking being the driving goal of people’s existence. Other topics of discussion include the images of death and rebirth, the importance of remembrance, and having humility instead of hubris.</p> <p>Cindy is hosting a new summer discipleship course for moms this year, so head over to <a href= "https://morningtimeformoms.com/product/morning-time-for-moms-summer-discipleship-2021/"> morningtimeformoms.com</a> for more info and to sign up!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On The Literary Life podcast today, our hosts wrap up their series on Ray Bradbury’s <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3vEd0P7">Fahrenheit 451</a></em>. Angelina, Cindy and Thomas open the discussion with some commentary on the wickedness in the heart of every human and the cost of courage to stand against the crowd. They examine Beatty’s character and why he might have wanted to die. Angelina brings up the way in which Montag’s courage convicts Faber of his own cowardice. They also talk about the detrimental effects of pleasure-seeking being the driving goal of people’s existence. Other topics of discussion include the images of death and rebirth, the importance of remembrance, and having humility instead of hubris.</p> <p>Cindy is hosting a new summer discipleship course for moms this year, so head over to <a href= "https://morningtimeformoms.com/product/morning-time-for-moms-summer-discipleship-2021/"> morningtimeformoms.com</a> for more info and to sign up!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to another episode of The Literary Life podcast with Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks! This week our hosts open a new series on Ray Bradbury’s well-known novel <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3vEd0P7">Fahrenheit 451</a>.</em> They talk about the form of the dystopian novel and why it is such a popular form in the modern world. Angelina shares some background on the form, as well as some of the foremost authors and books in this genre. Then they dive into the text, starting with the images of the hearth and the salamander. Looking at the world Bradbury has created, they take note of some of the major ideas and discuss any similarities to our current culture seen in these first several chapters.</p> <p>Cindy is hosting a new summer discipleship course for moms this year, so head over to <a href= "https://morningtimeformoms.com/product/morning-time-for-moms-summer-discipleship-2021/"> morningtimeformoms.com</a> for more info and to sign up!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to another episode of The Literary Life podcast with Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks! This week our hosts open a new series on Ray Bradbury’s well-known novel <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3vEd0P7">Fahrenheit 451</a>.</em> They talk about the form of the dystopian novel and why it is such a popular form in the modern world. Angelina shares some background on the form, as well as some of the foremost authors and books in this genre. Then they dive into the text, starting with the images of the hearth and the salamander. Looking at the world Bradbury has created, they take note of some of the major ideas and discuss any similarities to our current culture seen in these first several chapters.</p> <p>Cindy is hosting a new summer discipleship course for moms this year, so head over to <a href= "https://morningtimeformoms.com/product/morning-time-for-moms-summer-discipleship-2021/"> morningtimeformoms.com</a> for more info and to sign up! Thomas and Angelina also have some great summer classes coming up, and you can check those out at <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/">houseofhumaneletters.com</a>.</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>If someone tells you what a story is about, they are probably right. If they tell you that that is all the story is about, they are very definitely wrong.</p> Neil Gaiman  <p>It will be a bad day for England when we have done with Shakspere; for that will imply, along with the loss of him, that we are no longer capable of understanding him.</p> George MacDonald  <p>Libraries raised me. I don’t believe in colleges and universities. I believe in libraries because most students don’t have any money. When I graduated from high school it was during the Depression, and we had no money. I couldn’t go to college, so I went to the library three days a week for ten years.</p> Ray Bradbury from “The Burning of the Leaves” <p><em>by Laurence Binyon</em></p> <p>Now is the time for the burning of the leaves. They go to the fire; the nostril pricks with smoke Wandering slowly into a weeping mist. Brittle and blotched, ragged and rotten sheaves! A flame seizes the smouldering ruin and bites On stubborn stalks that crackle as they resist.</p> <p>The last hollyhock’s fallen tower is dust; All the spices of June are a bitter reek, All the extravagant riches spent and mean. All burns! The reddest rose is a ghost; Sparks whirl up, to expire in the mist: the wild Fingers of fire are making corruption clean.</p> <p>Now is the time for stripping the spirit bare, Time for the burning of days ended and done, Idle solace of things that have gone before: Rootless hope and fruitless desire are there; Let them go to the fire, with never a look behind. The world that was ours is a world that is ours no more.</p> Book List: <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3ecZ6gU">A Dish or Orts</a></em> by George MacDonald</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3xTOQCe">Ocean at the End of the Lane</a></em> by Neil Gaiman</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3tf6g8L">Stardust</a></em> by Neil Gaiman</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3td5l8U">The Graveyard Book</a></em> by Neil Gaiman</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3tdhZo7">Neverwhere</a></em> by Neil Gaiman</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3xJoAdK">1984</a></em> by George Orwell</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/338Nsxi">Animal Farm</a></em> by George Orwell</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3xLCuf6">Brave New World</a></em> by Aldous Huxley</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3eTV1NK">That Hideous Strength</a></em> by C.

They also talk about the concept of the “holy fool.” Some ideas discussed in this episode include the characters’ responses to death, the mask of respectability, and the problem of discontent.</p> <p>Cindy is hosting a new summer discipleship course for moms this year, so head over to <a href= "https://morningtimeformoms.com/product/morning-time-for-moms-summer-discipleship-2021/"> morningtimeformoms.com</a> for more info and to sign up!

They would indeed only weaken that impact in direct proportion as soon as they set out to achieve it. They move by not seeking to move; almost, it seems, by seeking not to move. The fairy-story that succeeds is in fact not a work of fiction at all; . . . It is a transcription of a view of life into terms of highly simplified symbols; and when it succeeds in its literary purpose, it leaves us with a deep indefinable feeling of truth.</p> <cite>C. M.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On this week’s episode of The Literary Life Podcast, Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks delve into part one of a two-part discussion of Leo Tolstoy’s <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3aowFdK">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</a>.</em> Our hosts kick things off talking about their background with Russian literature, and Thomas gives some biographical information on Tolstoy. They also talk about the concept of the “holy fool.” Some ideas discussed in this episode include the characters’ responses to death, the mask of respectability, and the problem of discontent.</p> <p>Cindy is hosting a new summer discipleship course for moms this year, so head over to <a href= "https://morningtimeformoms.com/product/morning-time-for-moms-summer-discipleship-2021/"> morningtimeformoms.com</a> for more info and to sign up! Thomas and Angelina also have some great summer classes coming up, and you can check those out at <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/">houseofhumaneletters.com</a>.</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>Arrogance is a weed that ever grows in a dunghill.</p> Owen Feltham  <p>To enhance the wonder, see How arch his notices, how nice his sense Of the ridiculous; . . . . he can read The inside of the earth, and spell the stars; He knows the policies of foreign lands; Can string you names of districts, cities, towns, The whole world over, tight as beads of dew Upon a gossamer thread; he sifts, he weighs; All things are put to question; he must live Knowing that he grows wiser every day, Or else not live at all, and seeing too Each little drop of wisdom as it falls Into the dimpling cistern of his heart: For this unnatural growth the trainer blame, Pity the tree…  Meanwhile old grandame earth is grieved to find The playthings, which her love designed for him, Unthought of: in their woodland beds the flowers Weep, and the river sides are all forlorn. Oh! give us once again the wishing-cap Of Fortunatus, and the invisible coat Of Jack the Giant-killer, Robin Hood, And Sabra in the forest with St George! The child, whose love is here, at least, doth reap One precious gain, that he forgets himself.</p> William Wordsworth, from “Prelude”  <p>[Fairy stories] never seek to criticize or moralize, to protest or plead or persuade; and if they have an emotional impact on the reader, as the greatest of them to, that is not intrinsic to the stories. They would indeed only weaken that impact in direct proportion as soon as they set out to achieve it. They move by not seeking to move; almost, it seems, by seeking not to move. The fairy-story that succeeds is in fact not a work of fiction at all; . . . It is a transcription of a view of life into terms of highly simplified symbols; and when it succeeds in its literary purpose, it leaves us with a deep indefinable feeling of truth.</p> C. M. Woodhouse, on Animal Farm, The Times Literary Supplement, 1954 Growing Old <p><em>by Matthew Arnold</em></p> <p>What is it to grow old? Is it to lose the glory of the form, The luster of the eye? Is it for beauty to forego her wreath? —Yes, but not this alone.</p> <p>Is it to feel our strength— Not our bloom only, but our strength—decay? Is it to feel each limb Grow stiffer, every function less exact, Each nerve more loosely strung?</p> <p>Yes, this, and more; but not Ah, ’tis not what in youth we dreamed ’twould be! ’Tis not to have our life Mellowed and softened as with sunset glow, A golden day’s decline.</p> <p>’Tis not to see the world As from a height, with rapt prophetic eyes, And heart profoundly stirred; And weep, and feel the fullness of the past, The years that are no more.</p> <p>It is to spend long days And not once feel that we were ever young; It is to add, immured In the hot prison of the present, month To month with weary pain.</p> <p>It is to suffer this, And feel but half, and feebly, what we feel. Deep in our hidden heart Festers the dull remembrance of a change, But no emotion—none.</p> <p>It is—last stage of all— When we are frozen up within, and quite The phantom of ourselves, To hear the world applaud the hollow ghost Which blamed the living man.</p> Book List: <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3aowFdK">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</a></em> by Leo Tolstoy</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3gn5FyR">Resolves: Divine, Political, and Moral</a></em> by Owen Feltham</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2RMrs98">War and Peace</a></em> by Leo Tolstoy</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3sxIgNF"><em>Anna Karenina</em></a> by Leo Tolstoy</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3e8OvCk"><em>Crime and Punishment</em></a> by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3tBJOYn">Anton Chekhov</a></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3x5nwjU">Fathers and Sons</a></em> by Ivan Turgenev</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3tzqD1t">Papa Panov’s Special Day</a></em> by Mig Holder</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3aoBX8O">The Giagantic Turnip</a></em> by Aleksei Tolstoy</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2QGvZZX"><em>Koshka’s Tales: Stories from Russia</em></a> by James Mayhew</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/32ulhbS">The Idiot</a></em> by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2P2freC">Sense and Sensibility</a></em> by Jane Austen</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3tA3ZWv">Jane Austen at Home</a></em> by Lucy Worsley</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3v77X9o">How Much Land Does a Man Need and Other Stories</a></em> by Leo Tolstoy</p> Support The Literary Life: <p>Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/theliterarylife/overview">Patreon,</a> and get some amazing bonus content!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Literary Life podcast this week, hosts Cindy Rollins and Angelina Stanford interview their friend and veteran homeschool mother of 4, Adrienne Freas. Adrienne is now the Classical Education Advisor for the K-12 Curriculum and Professional Development Project at University of Dallas Classical Education Master’s Degree program at the University of Dallas, and she is active in consulting and advocating for Charlotte Mason’s educational philosophy. Adrienne was a featured speaker in the 2019 Back to School Conference, available for replay at <a href= "https://morningtimeformoms.com/product/back-to-school-conference-2019-vimeo-showcase-2/"> morningtimeformoms.com</a>.</p> <p>Adrienne describes her young life and how the fine arts were the highlight of her childhood and her early struggles to learn to read. She shares how high school literature teachers and reading the classics whet her appetite for even more great literature. She talks about the difference it makes to have a teacher who is enthusiastic and believes the students can step up to the challenge. Cindy, Angelina and Adrienne all share their love for Charlotte Mason and her philosophy of giving children a wide and generous curriculum.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Whenever we are called to teach, our proclamation of goodness should be so wrapped in beauty as to console.

I hurried home with the first volume and started reading and got to page 3 and hit a snag:<br /> Q was lecturing to young men educated at Eton and Harrow. He therefore assumed that his students—including me—had read <em>Paradise Lost</em> as a matter of course and would understand his analysis of the “Invocation to Light” in book 9. So I said, “Wait here,” and went down to the library and got <em>Paradise Lost</em> and took it home and started reading it and got to page 3 when I hit a snag:<br /> Milton assumed I’d read the Christian version of Isaiah and the New Testament and had learned all about Lucifer and the War in Heaven, and since I’d been reared in Judaism I hadn’t. So I said, “Wait here,” and borrowed a Christian Bible and read about Lucifer and so forth, and then went back to Milton and read <em>Paradise Lost</em>, and then finally got back to Q, page 3. On page 4 or 5, I discovered that the point of the sentence at the top of the page was in Latin and the long quotation at the bottom of the page was in Greek.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this week’s episode of The Literary Life Podcast, Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks are joined by James Banks to discuss the value of reading <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3fIllfS">Don Quixote</a></em> and how to approach the book. They talk about translations and how to choose a translation of this particular work. James shares how he first read Miguel de Cervantes’ classic work and gives a little contextual background on him as an author. He also argues that <em>Don Quixote</em> is a romance in the tradition of Spenser and is more of a satire of modernity than of chivalry.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, our hosts chat with Wes Callihan, founder of <a href="https://scholatutorials.org/">Schola Tutorials</a> and primary instructor in the <a href= "https://romanroadsmedia.com/old-western-culture">Old Western Culture series</a> by Roman Roads Media. Thomas starts off our interview today asking Wes what he remembers about stories and reading as a young person. Wes shares how he came to be a teacher and how his literary life developed as he became an adult. Angelina asks Wes about his approach to challenging literature when he started out reading the great books. He shares the joy of reading aloud, even to yourself, rather than silently whenever possible. Wes also talks about how learning languages enhanced his reading as well. Find the Youtube video of <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E8PGchwuGA">Wes’ personal library here</a>.</p> <p>Don’t forget to head over to <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> to find out all about the exciting line-up for our next Literary Life Online Conference, happening April 7-10, 2021 for which Wes Callihan will be our keynote speaker.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>I have called this work “meadow” on account of the delight, the fragrance and the benefit which it will afford those who come across it, for the virtuous life and the habitual piety do not merely consist of studying divinity, not only of thinking on an elevated plane about things as they are here and now. they must also include the description and writing of the way of life of others. So I have striven to complete this composition to inform your love, oh child, and as I have put together a copious and accurate collection, so I have emulated the most wise bee, gathering up the spiritually beneficial deeds of the fathers.</p> <cite>John Moschos</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>The fact that various persons have written angrily to say that the Judas I have depicted seems to them to be a person of the utmost nobility, actuated by extremely worthy motives, confirms my impression that this particular agent of hell is at present doing his master’s work with singular thoroughness and success. His exploits go unrecognized – which is just what the devil likes best.</p> <cite>Dorothy Sayers</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>People enter politics or the Civil Service out of a desire to exert power and influence events; this, I maintain, is an illness. It is only when one realizes that great administrators and leaders of men have all been at any rate slightly mad that one has a true understanding of history.</p> <cite>Auberon Waugh</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>In essence, Tolkien was trying to recover the vision of Eden, the childhood of the race, when beauty was still connected with truth. Through story–the right kind of story, including traditional legends and fairy-tales–the ability to see all things with a pure heart and in the light of heaven could be evoked. He wanted to prove that poetic knowledge, George MacDonald’s “wise imagination,” could be awoken even in a world apparently closed to its very possibility.</p> <cite>Stratford Caldecott</cite></blockquote> <h3>On Shakespeare. 1630</h3> <p><em>by John Milton</em></p> <p>What needs my Shakespeare for his honoured bones,<br /> The labor of an age in pilèd stones,<br /> Or that his hallowed relics should be hid   <br /> Under a stary-pointing pyramid?<br /> Dear son of Memory, great heir of fame, <br /> What need’st thou such weak witness of thy name?<br /> Thou in our wonder and astonishment <br /> Hast built thyself a live-long monument. <br /> For whilst to th’ shame of slow-endeavouring art,   <br /> Thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart   <br /> Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book <br /> Those Delphic lines with deep impression took,   <br /> Then thou, our fancy of itself bereaving,   <br /> Dost make us marble with too much conceiving; <br /> And so sepúlchred in such pomp dost lie,<br /> That kings for such a tomb would wish to die.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3qOftDL">The Spiritual Meadow</a></em> by John Moschos</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3rvePvU">The Man Born to Be King</a></em> by Dorothy Sayers</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/30H5gP2">Beauty in the Word</a></em> by Stratford Caldecott</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3lhRX0Y">The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin</a></em> by Beatrix Potter</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/38GnR21">My Side of the Mountain</a></em> by Jean Craighead George</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2OT7l7w">Papillon</a></em> by Henri Charriere</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3tjUaM4">Sailing Alone Around the World</a></em> by Joshua Slocum</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2OO0RqG">Two Years Before the Mast</a></em> by Richard Henry Dana</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2OzjaQu">Paul Thoreaux</a></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3eEPX1s">Sailing the Inside Passage</a></em> by Robb Keystone</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3rPgflm">The Travels of Sir John Mandeville</a></em> by John Mandeville</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3vv1TIO">The Discarded Image</a></em> by C.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, our hosts chat with Wes Callihan, founder of <a href="https://scholatutorials.org/">Schola Tutorials</a> and primary instructor in the <a href= "https://romanroadsmedia.com/old-western-culture">Old Western Culture series</a> by Roman Roads Media. Thomas starts off our interview today asking Wes what he remembers about stories and reading as a young person. Wes shares how he came to be a teacher and how his literary life developed as he became an adult. Angelina asks Wes about his approach to challenging literature when he started out reading the great books. He shares the joy of reading aloud, even to yourself, rather than silently whenever possible. Wes also talks about how learning languages enhanced his reading as well. Find the Youtube video of <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E8PGchwuGA">Wes’ personal library here</a>.</p> <p>Don’t forget to head over to <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> to find out all about the exciting line-up for our next Literary Life Online Conference, happening April 7-10, 2021 for which Wes Callihan will be our keynote speaker.</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>I have called this work “meadow” on account of the delight, the fragrance and the benefit which it will afford those who come across it, for the virtuous life and the habitual piety do not merely consist of studying divinity, not only of thinking on an elevated plane about things as they are here and now. they must also include the description and writing of the way of life of others. So I have striven to complete this composition to inform your love, oh child, and as I have put together a copious and accurate collection, so I have emulated the most wise bee, gathering up the spiritually beneficial deeds of the fathers.</p> John Moschos  <p>The fact that various persons have written angrily to say that the Judas I have depicted seems to them to be a person of the utmost nobility, actuated by extremely worthy motives, confirms my impression that this particular agent of hell is at present doing his master’s work with singular thoroughness and success. His exploits go unrecognized – which is just what the devil likes best.</p> Dorothy Sayers  <p>People enter politics or the Civil Service out of a desire to exert power and influence events; this, I maintain, is an illness. It is only when one realizes that great administrators and leaders of men have all been at any rate slightly mad that one has a true understanding of history.</p> Auberon Waugh  <p>In essence, Tolkien was trying to recover the vision of Eden, the childhood of the race, when beauty was still connected with truth. Through story–the right kind of story, including traditional legends and fairy-tales–the ability to see all things with a pure heart and in the light of heaven could be evoked. He wanted to prove that poetic knowledge, George MacDonald’s “wise imagination,” could be awoken even in a world apparently closed to its very possibility.</p> Stratford Caldecott On Shakespeare. 1630 <p><em>by John Milton</em></p> <p>What needs my Shakespeare for his honoured bones, The labor of an age in pilèd stones, Or that his hallowed relics should be hid    Under a stary-pointing pyramid? Dear son of Memory, great heir of fame,  What need’st thou such weak witness of thy name? Thou in our wonder and astonishment  Hast built thyself a live-long monument.  For whilst to th’ shame of slow-endeavouring art,    Thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart    Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book  Those Delphic lines with deep impression took,    Then thou, our fancy of itself bereaving,    Dost make us marble with too much conceiving;  And so sepúlchred in such pomp dost lie, That kings for such a tomb would wish to die.</p> Book List: <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3qOftDL">The Spiritual Meadow</a></em> by John Moschos</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3rvePvU">The Man Born to Be King</a></em> by Dorothy Sayers</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/30H5gP2">Beauty in the Word</a></em> by Stratford Caldecott</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3lhRX0Y">The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin</a></em> by Beatrix Potter</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/38GnR21">My Side of the Mountain</a></em> by Jean Craighead George</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2OT7l7w">Papillon</a></em> by Henri Charriere</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3tjUaM4">Sailing Alone Around the World</a></em> by Joshua Slocum</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2OO0RqG">Two Years Before the Mast</a></em> by Richard Henry Dana</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2OzjaQu">Paul Thoreaux</a></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3eEPX1s">Sailing the Inside Passage</a></em> by Robb Keystone</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3rPgflm">The Travels of Sir John Mandeville</a></em> by John Mandeville</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3vv1TIO">The Discarded Image</a></em> by C.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to this episode of The Literary Life Podcast, in which our hosts discuss George Eliot's book <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3bIwObF">Silas Marner</a>,</em> chapters 10-15. Thomas kicks off the discussion by highlighting the character of Dolly Winthrop. Angelina talks about Silas Marner opening himself to grace in these chapters. She also points out the way that Eliot uses Godfrey's character to point out our own potential lack of moral courage. Cindy points out the problem of addiction for Molly in causing her to neglect her own baby. Angelina also talks about the Rumpelstiltskin parallels and other fairy tale elements in the book thus far.</p> <p>Don’t forget to head over to <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> to find out all about the exciting line-up for our next Literary Life Online Conference, happening April 7-10, 2021 with special guest speaker Wes Callihan.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Idleness is a disease which must be combated; but I would not advise a rigid adherence to a particular plan of study. I myself have never persisted in any plan for two days together. A man ought to read just as inclination leads him; for what he reads as a task will do him little good. A young man should read five hours in a day, and so may acquire a great deal of knowledge.</p> <cite>Samuel Johnson</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Philosophy, like medicine, has a great number of drugs, and precious few genuine remedies.</p> <cite>Nicolas Chamfort</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>The feudal ownership of land did bring dignity, whereas the modern ownership of moveables is reducing us again to a nomadic horde.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to this episode of The Literary Life Podcast, in which our hosts discuss George Eliot's book <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3bIwObF">Silas Marner</a>,</em> chapters 10-15. Thomas kicks off the discussion by highlighting the character of Dolly Winthrop. Angelina talks about Silas Marner opening himself to grace in these chapters. She also points out the way that Eliot uses Godfrey's character to point out our own potential lack of moral courage. Cindy points out the problem of addiction for Molly in causing her to neglect her own baby. Angelina also talks about the Rumpelstiltskin parallels and other fairy tale elements in the book thus far.</p> <p>Don’t forget to head over to <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> to find out all about the exciting line-up for our next Literary Life Online Conference, happening April 7-10, 2021 with special guest speaker Wes Callihan.</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>Idleness is a disease which must be combated; but I would not advise a rigid adherence to a particular plan of study. I myself have never persisted in any plan for two days together. A man ought to read just as inclination leads him; for what he reads as a task will do him little good. A young man should read five hours in a day, and so may acquire a great deal of knowledge.</p> Samuel Johnson  <p>Philosophy, like medicine, has a great number of drugs, and precious few genuine remedies.</p> Nicolas Chamfort  <p>The feudal ownership of land did bring dignity, whereas the modern ownership of moveables is reducing us again to a nomadic horde. We are reverting to the civilization of luggage, and historians of the future will note how the middle classes accreted possessions without taking root in the earth, and may find in this the secret of their imaginative poverty.</p> E. M. Forster On My First Daughter <p><em>by Ben Johnson</em></p> <p>Here lies, to each her parents’ Ruth, Mary, the daughter of their youth; Yet all heaven’s gifts being heaven’s due, It makes the father less to rue. At six months’ end she parted hence With safety of her innocence; Whose soul heaven’s queen, whose name she bears, In comfort of her mother’s tears, Hath placed amongst her virgin-train: Where, while that severed doth remain, This grave partakes the fleshly birth; Which cover lightly, gentle earth!</p> Book List: <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Mt5MMR">The Year of Our Lord, 1943</a></em> by Alan Jacobs</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3uJl7KL">The Life of Samuel Johnson</a></em> by James Boswell</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3bEQMEo">Complete Maxims and Thoughts</a></em> by Nicolas Chamfort</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3pSr1Fy">Howard’s End</a></em> by E.

Angelina points out the ways in which Eliot uses some fairy tale and otherworldly elements to explore moral ideas.</p> <p>Don’t forget to check out Angelina and Thomas’ upcoming classes at <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> and <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/cindyrollins?fbclid=IwAR3acx7P6FGt1Us_buk7cIzIaK31FxMaNlK53pKfV5vr8SYphKVywNIAqZ8"> Cindy’s Discipleship for Moms on Patreon</a>.</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>A poem can be like two hands that lift you up and put you down in a new place. You look back with astonishment and find that because you have read a few lines on a printed page or listened for a couple of minutes to a voice speaking, you have arrived at somewhere quite different.</p> Elizabeth Goudge  <p>Wheresoe’er I turn my view, All is strange, yet nothing new; Endless labour all along, Endless labour to be wrong…</p> Samuel Johnson  <p>These fellow mortals, every one, must be accepted as they are. You can neither straighten their noses, nor brighten their wits, nor rectify their dispositions; and it is these people amongst whom your life is passed, that it is needful you should tolerate, pity and love.</p> George Eliot Adlestrop <p><em>by Edward Thomas</em></p> <p>Yes. I remember Adlestrop— The name, because one afternoon Of heat the express-train drew up there Unwontedly. It was late June.</p> <p>The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat. No one left and no one came On the bare platform. What I saw Was Adlestrop—only the name</p> <p>And willows, willow-herb, and grass, And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry, No whit less still and lonely fair Than the high cloudlets in the sky.</p> <p>And for that minute a blackbird sang Close by, and round him, mistier, Farther and farther, all the birds Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.</p> Book List: <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2OwvGQt">Towers in the Mist</a></em> by Elizabeth Goudge</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2ZcFRvR">The Dean’s Watch</a></em> by Elizabeth Goudge</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2OAQVkh">Adam Bede</a></em> by George Eliot</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2LTwFJK">The Mill on the Floss</a></em> by George Eliot</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/37eNWoa">Middlemarch</a></em> by George Eliot</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3b0CQUN">Romola</a></em> by George Eliot</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3b18ZeN">Imitation of Christ</a></em> by Thomas à Kempis</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2OA9NzU">Jane Eyre</a></em> by Charlotte Brontë</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2LOjfyB">Selected Essays, Poems and Other Writings</a></em> by George Eliot</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3qkPTGS">Silly Novels by Lady Novelists</a></em> by George Eliot</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Zb5P2C">Far From the Madding Crowd</a></em> by Thomas Hardy</p> Support The Literary Life: <p>Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/theliterarylife/overview">Patreon,</a> and get some amazing bonus content!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s book discussion on The Literary Life podcast centers around the book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3teDNkB">84, Charing Cross Road</a>.</em> Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks share their first experiences reading this book of letters between Helene Hanff and Frank Doel. Cindy talks about her deep identification with Helene the first time she read <em>84, Charing Cross Road</em> and how much she dreamed of going to England. Angelina and Thomas talk about the characteristics of Helene as a reader and as a person seeking self-education.</p> <p>Come back again next week for a special guest episode look at the literary life of Charlotte Mason! After that, we dig into George Eliot’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3anQDo6">Silas Marner</a></em>.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Our Japanese soldiers who came back from overseas were a pitiful sight. They looked thin, weak, and exhausted. And some of them were invalids, drained of color and borne on stretchers.<br /> <br /> But among the returning soldiers there was one company of cheerful men. They were always singing, even difficult pieces in several parts and they sang very well. When they disembarked at Yokosuka the people who came to greet them were astonished. Everyone asked if they had received extra rations, since they seemed so happy.<br /> <br /> These men had had no extra rations, but had practiced choral singing throughout the Burma campaign. Their captain, a young musician fresh from music school, had enthusiastically taught his soldiers how to sing. It was singing that kept up their morale through boredom or hardship and that bound them together in friendship and discipline during the long war years. Without it, they would never have come home in remarkable high spirits.</p> <cite>Michio Takeyama </cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Men are apt to prefer a prosperous error before an afflicted truth.</p> <cite>Jeremy Taylor</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Secondhand booksellers are the most friendly and most eccentric of all the characters I have known.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today’s book discussion on The Literary Life podcast centers around the book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3teDNkB">84, Charing Cross Road</a>.</em> Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks share their first experiences reading this book of letters between Helene Hanff and Frank Doel. Cindy talks about her deep identification with Helene the first time she read <em>84, Charing Cross Road</em> and how much she dreamed of going to England. Angelina and Thomas talk about the characteristics of Helene as a reader and as a person seeking self-education.</p> <p>Come back again next week for a special guest episode look at the literary life of Charlotte Mason! After that, we dig into George Eliot’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3anQDo6">Silas Marner</a></em>.</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>Our Japanese soldiers who came back from overseas were a pitiful sight. They looked thin, weak, and exhausted. And some of them were invalids, drained of color and borne on stretchers.  But among the returning soldiers there was one company of cheerful men. They were always singing, even difficult pieces in several parts and they sang very well. When they disembarked at Yokosuka the people who came to greet them were astonished. Everyone asked if they had received extra rations, since they seemed so happy.  These men had had no extra rations, but had practiced choral singing throughout the Burma campaign. Their captain, a young musician fresh from music school, had enthusiastically taught his soldiers how to sing. It was singing that kept up their morale through boredom or hardship and that bound them together in friendship and discipline during the long war years. Without it, they would never have come home in remarkable high spirits.</p> Michio Takeyama   <p>Men are apt to prefer a prosperous error before an afflicted truth.</p> Jeremy Taylor  <p>Secondhand booksellers are the most friendly and most eccentric of all the characters I have known. If I had not been a writer, theirs would have been the profession I would most happily have chosen.</p> Graham Greene Reading in Wartime <p><em>by Edwin Muir</em></p> <p>Boswell by my bed, Tolstoy on my table; Thought the world has bled For four and a half years, And wives’ and mothers’ tears Collected would be able To water a little field Untouched by anger and blood, A penitential yield Somewhere in the world; Though in each latitude Armies like forest fall, The iniquitous and the good Head over heels hurled, And confusion over all: Boswell’s turbulent friend And his deafening verbal strife, Ivan Ilych’s death Tell me more about life, The meaning and the end Of our familiar breath, Both being personal, Than all the carnage can, Retrieve the shape of man, Lost and anonymous, Tell me wherever I look That not one soul can die Of this or any clan Who is not one of us And has a personal tie Perhaps to someone now Searching an ancient book, Folk-tale or country song In many and many a tongue, To find the original face, The individual soul, The eye, the lip, the brow For ever gone from their place, And gather an image whole.</p> Book List: <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3teDNkB">84, Charing Cross Road</a></em> by Helene Hanff</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3rcoY09">The Harp of Burma</a></em> by Michio Takeyama </p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2NXqIft">Holy Living</a></em> by Jeremy Taylor</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3cwF3JS">The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street</a></em> by Helene Hanff</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3ahbt8o">The Narnian</a></em> by Alan Jacobs</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3alctZu">The Life of Samuel Johnson</a></em> by James Boswell</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3j4pMBq">P.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, our hosts explore the popular Agatha Christie mystery novel, <a href= "https://amzn.to/39EN901"><em>Death on the Nile</em></a>. This discussion will contain spoilers, so if you haven’t read or listened to the book yet, stop this episode! But before we get to the book chat, we want to announce that our brand new <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/the-well-read-poem/">The Well Read Poem</a> podcast is now live! Also, head over to <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> to check out the Winter Webinar Series and Kelly Cumbee’s class on <em><a href="https://amzn.to/39EN901">King Lear</a></em>.</p> <p>Angelina, Cindy and Thomas begin the book discussion with a comparison of the authors known as the “Queens of Crime.” They also talk about the form of detective novels and how Christie in particular plays with the form to keep readers on their toes. Thomas notes the similarities between <em>Death on the Nile</em> with Henry James’ novel <em>The Wings of the Dove.</em> In addition to covering the plot of the story, our hosts walk us through the ways in which Christie writes in order to keep us guessing.</p> <p>If you haven’t heard it before, please go and listen to <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/003/">Episode 3: The Importance of the Detective Novel</a>.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>The sacrifices of friendship were beautiful in her eyes as long as she was not asked to make them.</p> <cite>Saki (pen name of H. H. Munro)</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Pious worshipers, whether or mortal or immortal artists, do their deities little honor by treating their incarnations as something too sacred for rough handling.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, our hosts explore the popular Agatha Christie mystery novel, <a href= "https://amzn.to/39EN901"><em>Death on the Nile</em></a>. This discussion will contain spoilers, so if you haven’t read or listened to the book yet, stop this episode! But before we get to the book chat, we want to announce that our brand new <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/the-well-read-poem/">The Well Read Poem</a> podcast is now live! Also, head over to <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> to check out the Winter Webinar Series and Kelly Cumbee’s class on <em><a href="https://amzn.to/39EN901">King Lear</a></em>.</p> <p>Angelina, Cindy and Thomas begin the book discussion with a comparison of the authors known as the “Queens of Crime.” They also talk about the form of detective novels and how Christie in particular plays with the form to keep readers on their toes. Thomas notes the similarities between <em>Death on the Nile</em> with Henry James’ novel <em>The Wings of the Dove.</em> In addition to covering the plot of the story, our hosts walk us through the ways in which Christie writes in order to keep us guessing.</p> <p>If you haven’t heard it before, please go and listen to <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/003/">Episode 3: The Importance of the Detective Novel</a>.</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>The sacrifices of friendship were beautiful in her eyes as long as she was not asked to make them.</p> Saki (pen name of H. H. Munro)  <p>Pious worshipers, whether or mortal or immortal artists, do their deities little honor by treating their incarnations as something too sacred for rough handling.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, we are excited to delve into the literary life of the mysterious Mr. Banks! But before we get started, we do want to let you know that we have posted the reading schedule for January-March, and you can view it on our <a href="https://www.theliterary.life/upcoming-events/">Upcoming Events</a> page. Also, <a href="https://blueskydaisies.net/">Blue Sky Daisies Publishing</a> is running a fun contest for kids involving our new Commonplace Books, so you will want to head over to <a href="https://blueskydaisies.net/contest/">their website</a> and check that out! Finally, be looking out for The Well Read Poem podcast coming to a podcast app near you on January 18, 2021!</p> <p>Cindy begins the interview asking Thomas about his family background and the influence of his parents on his own reading life. He shares about many of the books he loved in childhood and how that shaped his tastes in literature. He also talks about how he approached school learning as opposed to his personal reading. Angelina asks Thomas to tell about how he fell in love with poetry and how he ended up going to college even though that was not his original goal. He also shares more about his reading as an adult, as well as his habit of commonplacing quotations.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>…but I was glad to sing again too; it had been a greater loss that I realized in that particular wintering which saw the waning of my voice.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, we are bringing you our year end review of our own reading lives. Angelina kicks off the conversation by asking Thomas and Cindy how they would describe their reading lives this year. They talk about their favorites and highlights in books this year, as well as a few books that fell flat for them in 2020. They share about some authors they had not read before that they enjoyed this year. Finally, they tell us how they did with their own 20 for 2020 Reading Challenge lists.</p> <p>Don’t forget to check out the upcoming reading challenge for next year, the <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/19-in-2021-reading-challenge/">Literary Life 19 Books for 2021</a> challenge! If you missed it, you will want to go back and listen to the previous episode full of ideas for each challenge category. Also, there is still time to order <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/the-literary-life-commonplace-books/"> Literary Life Commonplace Books</a> before the new year and begin recording your plans, progress, and favorite quotations!</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Our fathers find their graves in our short memories and sadly tell us how we may be buried in our survivors.</p> <cite>Thomas Browne</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>“But, my, my! We don’t learn easy!” he chuckled mournfully. “Not to learn how to live till we’re about ready to die, it certainly seems to me dang tough!”. . . “But, papa,” she said, to console him, “don’t you think maybe there isn’t such a thing as a ‘finish’, after all! You say perhaps we don’t learn to live till we die, but maybe that’s how it is <em>after</em> we die, too–just learning some more, the way we do here, and maybe through trouble again, even after that.”</p> <cite>Booth Tarkington</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Charlotte Mason says that books are one way that we grow, not for ourselves, but beyond ourselves. Where does she suggest we start? Here’s her list of suitable “Instructors of Conscience”:<br /> 1.Poetry, preferably spending time with one poet 2. Shakespeare’s plays 3. Novels, with characters who “become our mentors or our warnings” 4. Ever-delightful essayists 5. History, including ancient history 6. Philosophy, to allow reason to work upon knowledge 7. Theology, including the Bible 8. The things of nature 9. Science, so that “we no longer conduct ourselves in this world of wonders like a gaping rustic at a fair” (p. 101) 10. Art, approached “with the modest intention to pay a debt…” 11. Sociology and Self-Knowledge<br /> Our aim is not to become know-it-alls, but rather to gain a sense of the Ought in all this, why we owe it to God and to the world to become people who observe carefully and think clearly, “with gentle, large, and humble thoughts.” And the ultimate result is not graduation, but gratitude, to the One who created “the beauty, glory, and fitness above our heads and about our feet and surrounding us on every side!”</p> <cite>Anne White</cite></blockquote> <h3>Ring Out, Wild Bells</h3> <p><em>by Alfred Lord Tennyson</em></p> <p>Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,<br /> The flying cloud, the frosty light;<br /> The year is dying in the night;<br /> Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.<br /> <br /> Ring out the old, ring in the new,<br /> Ring, happy bells, across the snow:<br /> The year is going, let him go;<br /> Ring out the false, ring in the true.<br /> <br /> Ring out the grief that saps the mind,<br /> For those that here we see no more,<br /> Ring out the feud of rich and poor,<br /> Ring in redress to all mankind.<br /> <br /> Ring out a slowly dying cause,<br /> And ancient forms of party strife;<br /> Ring in the nobler modes of life,<br /> With sweeter manners, purer laws.<br /> <br /> Ring out the want, the care the sin,<br /> The faithless coldness of the times;<br /> Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,<br /> But ring the fuller minstrel in.<br /> <br /> Ring out false pride in place and blood,<br /> The civic slander and the spite;<br /> Ring in the love of truth and right,<br /> Ring in the common love of good.<br /> <br /> Ring out old shapes of foul disease,<br /> Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;<br /> Ring out the thousand wars of old,<br /> Ring in the thousand years of peace.<br /> <br /> Ring in the valiant man and free,<br /> The larger heart, the kindlier hand;<br /> Ring out the darkness of the land,<br /> Ring in the Christ that is to be.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p>(Amazon affiliate links)</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3p311ao">Urn Burial</a></em> by Thomas Browne</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3nGMm4k">Alice Adams</a></em> by Booth Tarkington</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/34l70iW">Honest, Simple Souls: An Advent Meditation with Charlotte Mason</a></em> by Anne White</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3anftWK">Black Wings Has My Angel</a></em> by Elliott Chaze</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3nGPI7q">Cover Her Face</a></em> by P.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, our series on George MacDonald’s <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3oMBNhp">Phantastes</a></em> continues. Today Angelina and Cindy discuss chapters 15-19. But before they get started, they announce the upcoming reading challenge for next year, the <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/19-in-2021-reading-challenge/">Literary Life 19 Books for 2021</a> challenge! Also, we are pleased to be bringing you <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/the-literary-life-commonplace-books/"> Literary Life Commonplace Books</a>, perfect for recording what you are reading, as well as all your favorite quotes.</p> <p>Angelina and Cindy open the book discussion with the idea of the “other world” structure in fantasy writing, as well as how influential MacDonald was on writers who came after him. They also go in depth with the concept of the Holy Spirit as the originator of creative thought in conjunction with MacDonald’s thoughts on the imagination. Angelina gets excited about the metaphorical descent into Hades in this section of the book. She and Cindy talk about the importance of the hope of redemption, the platonic ideal versus reality, and learning to let go instead of grasp at things. They also return to the idea of true education being noble unrest introduced in last week’s episode.</p> <p>Don’t forget to check out the Advent and Christmas resources our hosts have ready for your holiday season. As mentioned before, Cindy’s new edition of <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3lnyUBe">Hallelujah: Cultivating Advent Traditions with Handel’s Messiah</a></em> is available now, and it is not to late to start if you purchase the Kindle version. Check our <a href="https://cindyrollins.net/">CindyRollins.net</a> for more information. Also, Thomas and Angelina have a sale going on for an <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/product/advent-bundle/">Advent Bundle</a> of their popular webinars, Charles Dickens’ <em>A Christmas Carol</em> and The Poetry of Advent. Additionally, Kelly Cumbee will be teaching a webinar series called “<a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/product/seeking-the-discarded-image-nature/">Seeking the Discarded Image: Nature</a>.”</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Thomas Merton recognized at once when he wrote in his journal for July 18, 1964, “I began it this morning, studying it as a tract on monastic life, the myth of pilgrimage, the quest for the impossible island, the earthly paradise, the ultimate ideal,” for it is above all liturgical prayer and liturgical time that provide the structure of the journey as it unfolds around the two key anchor points: the Easter cycle, spent in the environs of the island of sheep, and the Christmas cycle with the monastic community of Alba.</p> <cite>Esther de Waal</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>I never could believe that a man who did not find God in other places, as well as in the Bible, ever found Him there at all.

O might I wander there,     Among the flowers, which in that heavenly air                         Bloom the year long!</p> <p>    Nay, barren are those mountains and spent the streams:     Our song is the voice of desire, that haunts our dreams,                         A throe of the heart, Whose pining visions dim, forbidden hopes profound,     No dying cadence nor long sigh can sound,                         For all our art.</p> <p>    Alone, aloud in the raptured ear of men     We pour our dark nocturnal secret; and then,                         As night is withdrawn From these sweet-springing meads and bursting boughs of May,     Dream, while the innumerable choir of day                         Welcome the dawn.</p> Book List:<em>W</em> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/37624yW">The Celtic Way of Prayer</a></em> by Esther De Waal</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/37ikgWb">At the Back of the North Wind</a></em> by George MacDonald</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/33rErjs">Annals of a Quiet Neighborhood</a></em> by George MacDonald</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2KQIGyF">A Dish of Orts</a></em> by George MacDonald</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/39rVYvI">The Mind of the Maker</a></em> by Dorothy L.

To fall is to choose an illusion, not a wrong reason.</p> Northrup Frye When I have Fears That I May Cease to Be <p><em>by John Keats</em></p> <p>When I have fears that I may cease to be     Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain,  Before high-pilèd books, in charactery,     Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain;  When I behold, upon the night’s starred face,     Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,  And think that I may never live to trace     Their shadows with the magic hand of chance;  And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,     That I shall never look upon thee more,  Never have relish in the faery power     Of unreflecting love—then on the shore  Of the wide world I stand alone, and think  Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.</p> Book List: <p>(Amazon affiliate links)</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3f2q0qL">Last Child in the Woods</a></em> by Richard Louv</p> <p><em>Notebooks on Renaissance Literature</em> by Northrup Frye</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2UzijPm">The Silver Chair</a></em> by C.

Cindy highlights the role of the grandmother in this and other MacDonald stories. In light of the <em>Faerie Queene</em> connections, Thomas wonders if there will be a true woman and a false woman in this story.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today on The Literary Life Podcast, Angelina Stanford and Cindy Rollins tackle the topic of fairy stories, discussing the what, why and how of reading them. Angelina shares the distinctive characteristics of fairy stories in contrast to other types of stories, such as myths. They deal with the question of whether fairy tales are “escapist”, the influence of the Grimm brothers scholarly work on interpreting fairy stories, and allowing the story to unveil its deeper truths without forcing meaning onto it.</p> <p>Angelina gives an illustration of how to see the gospel messages in fairy tales by talking us through the story of Sleeping Beauty. She refutes the ideas that fairy tales are about human romance or are misogynistic. She also highlights some of the Enlightenment and Puritan responses to fairy tales that still linger with us today. Cindy and Angelina also discuss some common concerns such as the magical, weird, or scary aspects of fairy tales. Angelina also makes a distinction between folk tales, literary fairy tales, and cautionary tales.</p> <p>Be sure to be back next week for the beginning of our series on George MacDonald’s <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3oMBNhp">Phantastes</a></em>.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>After a certain kind of sherry party, where there have been cataracts of culture but never on word or one glance that suggested a real enjoyment of any art, any person, or any natural object, my heart warms to the schoolboy on the bus who is reading Fantasy and Science Fiction rapt and oblivious of all the world beside. </p> <cite>C.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today on The Literary Life Podcast, our hosts Angelina and Cindy chat with Cindy’s longtime friend and, according to her, the “smartest woman on the internet,” Wendi Capehart. Wendi is an adventurous mom of many and has lived throughout Asia. Now she lives the life of an at home librarian caring for her disabled daughter and spending time with her 15 grandchildren. She also serves on the <a href= "https://amblesideonline.org/">AmblesideOnline</a> Advisory board.</p> <p>Angelina starts off the conversation asking Wendi about her reading life beginning with her childhood memories of reading. Wendi talks a little about how books helped her survive and heal from the trauma of living in an abusive situation. They also discuss what the difference was for Wendi in leisurely reading and reading for school. Wendi shares some of the reasons she began homeschooling her own children, as well, and how she kept reading voraciously even after she became a mother.</p> <p>Angelina and Wendi talk about the brain and changing your reading habits to digest and enjoy more challenging books. Wendi shares how she built a library while one a military budget and moving frequently. They talked about too many things to mention in this summary, but you can scroll down for the many book titles mentioned in this episode!</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>“We’re all fools,” said Clemens, “all the time.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life Podcast we have our final installment of the series on C. S. Lewis’ masterpiece <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/2FDBwf3">Til We Have Faces.</a></em> This week, our hosts finish up with Part 2, Chapters 1-4. Opening the conversation, Angelina shares some of her feelings on just having finished the book. She points out the importance of understanding the Cupid and Psyche myth. Cindy brings up the concept of a “sin-eater” in relation to Orual’s taking on of Psyche’s trials.</p> <p>They talk about the ways in which Orual begins to see more clearly and remember things differently at this point in the story. The theme of selfish love versus self-sacrificing love comes full circle as the book closes. Orual’s symbolic death and rebirth are key topics, and the allusions to Christ and the Gospel throughout this story are truly exciting.</p> <p>Join us next week for a special interview with Wendi Capehart on her literary life!</p> <h3>Listen to The Literary Life:</h3> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>I can’t say I learned nothing, at St. Charles Borromeo.

And since that contact cannot be avoided for long, and since it means either bliss or horror, the business of life is to learn to like it. That is the first and greatest commandment.</p> <cite>C. S.

Auden  <p>In the twinkling of an eye, in a time too small to be measured, and in any place, all that seems to divide us from God can flee away, vanish, leaving us naked before Him, like the first man, like the only man, as if nothing but He and I existed. And since that contact cannot be avoided for long, and since it means either bliss or horror, the business of life is to learn to like it. That is the first and greatest commandment.</p> C. S. Lewis from “Autumn Journal” <p><em>by Louis Macneice</em></p> <p>In a week I return to work, lecturing, coaching, As impresario of the Ancient Greeks Who wore the chiton and lived on fish and olives And talked philosophy or smut in cliques; Who believed in youth and did not gloze the unpleasant Consequences of age; What is life, one said, or what is pleasant Once you have turned the page Of love? The days grow worse, the dice are loaded Against the living man who pays in tears for breath; Never to be born was the best, call no man happy This side death. Conscious – long before Engels – of necessity And therein free They plotted out their life with truism and humour Between the jealous heaven and the callous sea. And Pindar sang the garland of wild olive And Alcibiades lived from hand to mouth Double-crossing Athens, Persia, Sparta, And many died in the city of plague, and many of drouth In Sicilian quarries, and many by the spear and arrow And many more who told their lies too late Caught in the eternal factions and reactions Of the city state. And free speech shivered on the pikes of Macedonia And later on the swords of Rome And Athens became a mere university city, And the goddess born of the foam Became the kept hetaera, heroine of Menander, And the philosopher narrowed his focus, confined His efforts to putting his own soul in order And keeping a quiet mind. And for a thousand years they went on talking, Making such apt remarks, A race no longer of heroes but of professors And crooked business men and secretaries and clerks Who turned out dapper little elegiac verses On the ironies of fate, the transience of all Affections, carefully shunning the over-statement But working the dying fall.</p> Book List: <p class="has-small-font-size"><em>(Amazon affiliate links are used in this content.)</em></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3jtwxfv">Hallelujah</a></em> by Cindy Rollins</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Hu9VgE">Giving Up the Ghost: A Memoire</a></em> by Hilary Mantel</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3dfat61">The Dyer’s Hand</a></em> by W.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to our series on C. S. Lewis’ mythical retelling <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3h7iBGH">Til We Have Faces</a></em> here on The Literary Life Podcast. Today Angelina, Cindy and Thomas discuss chapters 3-5. Angelina opens the book chat with an exploration of the tensions that are becoming evident in this first part of the book. Cindy talks about the character of the Fox and our changing perspective on him as the story develops. Thomas highlights the priest and the ways that we as moderns struggle with the religion presented here.</p> <p>Another topic expounded upon is the relationship between the sisters and the affects jealousy as the story progresses. Angelina also brings up the idea of terrifying holiness as presented in these chapters. Our hosts share their thoughts on the tension between the elevation of logic and reason and the devaluation of superstition and mystery.

The exceptions are few and remarkable. Instead of spreading the principles of order and justice throughout his society, Wolfe imposes them dogmatically and absolutely within the walls of his house–the brownstone on West Thrity-fifth Street–and he invites those who are troubled by an incomprehensible and threatening environment to enter the controlled economy of the house and to discover there the source of disorder in their own lives. The invitation is extended to readers as well as to clients.</p> <cite>J. Kenneth Van Dover</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>In our culture of betrayal, we are quick to impose our own views on layers of established systems. Thus, even a work of art is to be distrusted. Rather than trying to “under-stand” the work, we stand over it and dismiss it as unreadable.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to our series on C. S. Lewis’ mythical retelling <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3h7iBGH">Til We Have Faces</a></em> here on The Literary Life Podcast. Today Angelina, Cindy and Thomas discuss chapters 3-5. Angelina opens the book chat with an exploration of the tensions that are becoming evident in this first part of the book. Cindy talks about the character of the Fox and our changing perspective on him as the story develops. Thomas highlights the priest and the ways that we as moderns struggle with the religion presented here.</p> <p>Another topic expounded upon is the relationship between the sisters and the affects jealousy as the story progresses. Angelina also brings up the idea of terrifying holiness as presented in these chapters. Our hosts share their thoughts on the tension between the elevation of logic and reason and the devaluation of superstition and mystery. (Amazon affiliate links are used in this content.)</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>Riddle: I have eaten the Muses, yet I have profited nothing.</p> <p>Answer: A bookworm.</p> Symphosius  <p>He insists upon the point: under no circumstances will he leave his home or violate his routines in order to facilitate an investigation. The exceptions are few and remarkable. Instead of spreading the principles of order and justice throughout his society, Wolfe imposes them dogmatically and absolutely within the walls of his house–the brownstone on West Thrity-fifth Street–and he invites those who are troubled by an incomprehensible and threatening environment to enter the controlled economy of the house and to discover there the source of disorder in their own lives. The invitation is extended to readers as well as to clients.</p> J. Kenneth Van Dover  <p>In our culture of betrayal, we are quick to impose our own views on layers of established systems. Thus, even a work of art is to be distrusted. Rather than trying to “under-stand” the work, we stand over it and dismiss it as unreadable. Or worse yet, we impose a critical ideology upon it without first allowing the work to affect us.</p> Makoto Fujimura Selection from “Ode to Psyche” <p><em>by John Keats</em></p> <p>Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane          In some untrodden region of my mind, Where branched thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain,          Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind: Far, far around shall those dark-cluster’d trees          Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep; And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees,          The moss-lain Dryads shall be lull’d to sleep; And in the midst of this wide quietness A rosy sanctuary will I dress    With the wreath’d trellis of a working brain,          With buds, and bells, and stars without a name, With all the gardener Fancy e’er could feign,          Who breeding flowers, will never breed the same: And there shall be for thee all soft delight          That shadowy thought can win, A bright torch, and a casement ope at night,          To let the warm Love in!</p> Book List: <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3lT6mAl">Refractions</a></em> by Makoto Fujimura</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2QYTnPB">The Hundred Riddles of Symphosius</a></em> by Symphosius</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3bwAGvX">At Wolfe’s Door: The Nero Wolfe Novels of Rex Stout</a></em> by J.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this week’s episode of The Literary Life, our hosts Angelina, Thomas and Cindy have a special guest on the podcast. Gina Dalfonzo is an author whose work has been featured in First Things, The Atlantic, Christianity Today, The Weekly Standard, National Review, The Gospel Coalition, and more! Gina has written a new book called <em><a href="https://amzn.to/34vrsyI">Dorothy and Jack: The Transforming Friendship of Dorothy L. Sayers and C. S. Lewis</a></em> which is the topic of discussion on today’s episode. Angelina opens the conversation asking Gina to share how she came to write this book exploring the relationship between Lewis and Sayers. <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Affiliate links are used in this content.)</span></em></p> <p>Other topics explored in this episode are the following: the influence of Oxford in Dorothy Sayers’ life and work, how Dorothy and Jack finally met one another, Lewis’ personal distaste for detective novels, and his praise for Sayers’ other work. They also talk at length about how Sayers and Lewis support each other in pushing the boundaries of their literary careers.</p> <h3>Find Gina Dalfonzo:</h3> <p>Facebook: <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/ginadalfonzo.author" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer noopener">https://www.facebook.com/ginadalfonzo.author</a> Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/ginadalfonzo" target= "_blank" rel= "noreferrer noopener">https://twitter.com/ginadalfonzo</a><br /> Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gina.dalfonzo/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer noopener">https://www.instagram.com/gina.dalfonzo/</a> Dickensblog: <a href="https://dickensblog.typepad.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer noopener">https://dickensblog.typepad.com/</a></p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>For life in general, there is but one decree: youth is a blunder, manhood a struggle, old age a <em>regret</em>.</p> <cite>Benjamin Disraeli</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>There’s always surrender to humiliation and crucifixion, an emptying, before the glory.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today on The Literary Life Podcast, we begin our new series on C. S. Lewis’ masterpiece, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3h7iBGH">Til We Have Faces</a></em>. <em>(Affiliate links are used in this content.)</em> This week, Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks cover the first two chapters and share their observations as they reread this oftentimes challenging book. To help us gain a framework for this novel, Thomas summarizes the myth of Cupid and Psyche, the first telling of which is found in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/325Dw6I">The Golden Ass</a></em> by Apuleius. Angelina shares about some similarities in this myth with several familiar fairy tales. Cindy points out how Lewis changes some key pieces of the story to make it less mythical and more tethered to historical time and place.</p> <p>In opening the first chapter, Angelina tells her theory about this being a story about a character finding her identity as she looks back on her life. Our hosts talk about the strange nature of the paganism in Glome and also the interesting role of The Fox. They point out many of the classical Greek references that we need to pay attention to as we read this story.</p> <p>Tune in next week for a special interview episode with the author of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2PYYDlJ">Dorothy and Jack</a></em>, Gina Dalfonzo. Following that, we will be back with chapters 3-5 of <em>Till We Have Faces</em>.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>A good carpenter is known by his chips.</p> <cite>Jonathan Swift</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>All too often, the legends old men tell are closer to the truth than the facts young professors tell.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today on The Literary Life Podcast, we begin our new series on C. S. Lewis’ masterpiece, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3h7iBGH">Til We Have Faces</a></em>. <em>(Affiliate links are used in this content.)</em> This week, Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks cover the first two chapters and share their observations as they reread this oftentimes challenging book. To help us gain a framework for this novel, Thomas summarizes the myth of Cupid and Psyche, the first telling of which is found in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/325Dw6I">The Golden Ass</a></em> by Apuleius. Angelina shares about some similarities in this myth with several familiar fairy tales. Cindy points out how Lewis changes some key pieces of the story to make it less mythical and more tethered to historical time and place.</p> <p>In opening the first chapter, Angelina tells her theory about this being a story about a character finding her identity as she looks back on her life. Our hosts talk about the strange nature of the paganism in Glome and also the interesting role of The Fox. They point out many of the classical Greek references that we need to pay attention to as we read this story.</p> <p>Tune in next week for a special interview episode with the author of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2PYYDlJ">Dorothy and Jack</a></em>, Gina Dalfonzo. Following that, we will be back with chapters 3-5 of <em>Till We Have Faces</em>.</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>A good carpenter is known by his chips.</p> Jonathan Swift  <p>All too often, the legends old men tell are closer to the truth than the facts young professors tell. The wildest fairy tales of the ancients are far more realistic than the scientific phantasms imagined by moderns.</p> Hilaire Belloc  <p>Earth’s crammed with heaven, And every common bush afire with God, But only he who sees takes off his shoes…</p> Elizabeth Barrett Browning Song <p><em>by John Donne</em></p> <p>Go and catch a falling star,     Get with child a mandrake root, Tell me where all past years are,     Or who cleft the devil’s foot, Teach me to hear mermaids singing, Or to keep off envy’s stinging,             And find             What wind Serves to advance an honest mind.</p> <p>If thou be’st born to strange sights,     Things invisible to see, Ride ten thousand days and nights,     Till age snow white hairs on thee, Thou, when thou return’st, wilt tell me, All strange wonders that befell thee,             And swear,             No where Lives a woman true, and fair.</p> <p>If thou find’st one, let me know,     Such a pilgrimage were sweet; Yet do not, I would not go,     Though at next door we might meet; Though she were true, when you met her, And last, till you write your letter,             Yet she             Will be False, ere I come, to two, or three.</p> Support The Literary Life: <p>Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/theliterarylife/overview">Patreon,</a> and get some amazing bonus content!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today on The Literary Life Podcast, Angelina Stanford and Cindy Rollins are having a conversation about why everyone ought to read myths. Angelina begins by explaining what a myth is in terms of literary genre. She talks about the characteristics that run through myths, such as explanations of origins and natural phenomena, common characters, and a universe that hangs together. Cindy poses a question about why we have come to interpret the word myth to mean something untrue since the time of the Enlightenment.</p> <p>Angelina helps parents feel more confident about their children’s ability to know the difference between reality and fantasy. Cindy talks about how knowing mythology is a key to understanding other stories and literature. Unfolding a portion of church history, Angelina explains how early Christians wrestled with pagan stories and Old Testament stories at the same time. When we go looking only for morality tales in the Bible, Cindy points out, then we miss the main idea. Getting a bit more practical, Angelina gives some examples of the role of pre-Christian storytellers who pointed to the Truth.</p> <p>Be sure to be back next week for the beginning of our series on <em><a href="https://amzn.to/321JPIK">Til We Have Faces</a></em> by C. S. Lewis, in which we will be covering chapters 1 and 2. <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Amazon affiliate links are used in this content.)</span></em></p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>The imagination of man is made in the image of the imagination of God.

But Christians also need to be reminded–we may thank Corineus for reminding us–that what became fact was a myth, that it carries with it into the world of fact all the properties of a myth. God is more than a god, not less; Christ is more than Balder, not less. We must not be ashamed of the mythical radiance resting on our theology. We must not be nervous about “parallels” and “pagan Christs”: they ought to be there–it would be a stumbling block if they weren’t. We must not, in false spirituality, withhold our imaginative welcome. If God chooses to be mythopoeic–and is not the sky itself a myth–shall we refuse to be mythopathic? For this is the marriage of heaven and earth: perfect myth and perfect fact: claiming not only our love and our obedience, but also our wonder and delight, addressed to the savage, the child, and the poet in each one of us no less than to the moralist, the scholar, and the philosopher.</p> <cite>C.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this week’s episode of The Literary Life with Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins, and Thomas Banks continue their discussion of J. R. R. Tolkien’s short story “<a href= "http://www.ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__leaf_by_niggle__en.htm">Leaf by Niggle</a>“. If you missed the Back to School 2020 Conference when it was live, you can still purchase access to the recordings at <a href="http://cindyrollins.net">CindyRollins.net</a>. Angelina opens the book chat highlighting Tolkien’s mirroring of Dante’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3acbRF3">Divine Comedy</a></em> with Niggle’s journey, and our hosts move through a recap of the story. The questions we should be asking as we read are whether this story deals with the recovery of our vision and whether it ends with a eucatastrophe.</p> <p>Cindy brings out more of the autobiographical nature of this story for Tolkien. Angelina tosses around the idea that Parish and Niggle may be doubles and be a picture of Tolkien’s two selves. Thomas talks about what Niggle has to do in the “purgatory” section of the story. They also talk about the themes of art and the artist, sub-creation, and redemption. Come back next week to hear a discussion about why we ought to read myths.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>It is when a writer first begins to make enemies that he begins to matter.</p> <cite>Hilton Brown</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Kill that whence spring the crude fancies and wild day-dreams of the young, and you will never lead them beyond dull facts—dull because their relations to each other, and the one life that works in them all, must remain undiscovered. Whoever would have his children avoid this arid region will do well to allow no teacher to approach them—not even of mathematics—who has no imagination.</p> <cite>George MacDonald</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>There were people who cared for him and people didn’t, and those who didn’t hate him were out to get him. . .

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On this week’s episode of The Literary Life with Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins, and Thomas Banks continue their discussion of J. R. R. Tolkien’s short story “<a href= "http://www.ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__leaf_by_niggle__en.htm">Leaf by Niggle</a>“. If you missed the Back to School 2020 Conference when it was live, you can still purchase access to the recordings at <a href="http://cindyrollins.net">CindyRollins.net</a>. Angelina opens the book chat highlighting Tolkien’s mirroring of Dante’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3acbRF3">Divine Comedy</a></em> with Niggle’s journey, and our hosts move through a recap of the story. The questions we should be asking as we read are whether this story deals with the recovery of our vision and whether it ends with a eucatastrophe.</p> <p>Cindy brings out more of the autobiographical nature of this story for Tolkien. Angelina tosses around the idea that Parish and Niggle may be doubles and be a picture of Tolkien’s two selves. Thomas talks about what Niggle has to do in the “purgatory” section of the story. They also talk about the themes of art and the artist, sub-creation, and redemption. Come back next week to hear a discussion about why we ought to read myths.</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>It is when a writer first begins to make enemies that he begins to matter.</p> Hilton Brown  <p>Kill that whence spring the crude fancies and wild day-dreams of the young, and you will never lead them beyond dull facts—dull because their relations to each other, and the one life that works in them all, must remain undiscovered. Whoever would have his children avoid this arid region will do well to allow no teacher to approach them—not even of mathematics—who has no imagination.</p> George MacDonald  <p>There were people who cared for him and people didn’t, and those who didn’t hate him were out to get him. . . But they couldn’t touch him. . . because he was Tarzan, Mandrake, Flash Gordon. He was Bill Shakespeare. He was Cain, Ulysses, the Flying Dutchman; he was Lot in Sodom, Deidre of the Sorrows, Sweeney in the nightingales among trees.</p> Joseph Heller On the Death of Dr. Robert Levet <p><em>by Samuel Johnson</em></p> <p>Condemned to Hope’s delusive mine,     As on we toil from day to day, By sudden blasts, or slow decline,     Our social comforts drop away.</p> <p>Well tried through many a varying year,     See Levet to the grave descend; Officious, innocent, sincere,     Of every friendless name the friend.</p> <p>Yet still he fills Affection’s eye,     Obscurely wise, and coarsely kind; Nor, lettered Arrogance, deny     Thy praise to merit unrefined.</p> <p>When fainting Nature called for aid,     And hovering Death prepared the blow, His vigorous remedy displayed     The power of art without the show.</p> <p>In Misery’s darkest cavern known,     His useful care was ever nigh, Where hopeless Anguish poured his groan,     And lonely Want retired to die.</p> <p>No summons mocked by chill delay,     No petty gain disdained by pride, The modest wants of every day     The toil of every day supplied.</p> <p>His virtues walked their narrow round,     Nor made a pause, nor left a void; And sure the Eternal Master found     The single talent well employed.</p> <p>The busy day, the peaceful night,     Unfelt, uncounted, glided by; His frame was firm, his powers were bright,     Though now his eightieth year was nigh.</p> <p>Then with no throbbing fiery pain,     No cold gradations of decay, Death broke at once the vital chain,     And freed his soul the nearest way.</p> Book List: <p><em>(Amazon affiliate links are used in this content.)</em></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/30PhTsd">Rudyard Kipling</a></em> by Hilton Brown</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3gLp2zh">A Dish of Orts</a></em> by George MacDonald</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Cf1Aev">Catch-22</a></em> by Joseph Heller</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/30RsPE6">When Books Went to War</a></em> by Molly Guptill Manning</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2PIgwVK">The Moonstone</a></em> by Wilkie Collins</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/33ILkxT">The Great Divorce</a></em> by C.

She talks about this story as an exploration of the struggle of the ideals and demands of art against the demands of practical life and the question of whether or not art is useful. Cindy shares her ideas about the importance of the Inklings for Tolkien to get his work out into the world.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today on The Literary Life podcast, we will be discussing J. R. R. Tolkien’s essay “<a href= "http://www.heritagepodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/Tolkien-On-Fairy-Stories-subcreation.pdf">On Fairy Stories</a>“. Tune in again over the next two weeks as we continue the conversation with Tolkien’s short story “<a href= "http://www.ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__leaf_by_niggle__en.htm">Leaf by Niggle</a>“. Cindy, Angelina and Thomas are also excited to announce the second annual <a href= "https://cindyrollins.net/back-to-school-2020/">Back to School Online Conference</a>, happening August 3-8, 2020. Register today at <a href="https://cindyrollins.net/">CindyRollins.net</a> for access both live and later.</p> <p>Angelina sets the stage for this discussion by orienting us to the context for the essay by Tolkien as a critique of what is considered a fairy story. She points out the difference between cautionary tales like those by Charles Perrault and the German folk and fairy tales collected by the Grimm Brothers. Our hosts highlight Tolkien’s definition of true fairy stories, ones that take place in the “perilous realm” and involve a journey element. He critiques Andrew Lang as including many stories as fairy tale that are not truly fairy stories. They also discuss topics from the essay including sub-creation, magic and spells, suspension of disbelief, and children’s responses to fairy stories.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>One should forgive one’s enemies, but only after they are hanged.</p> <cite>Heinrich Heine</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>The German folk soul can again express itself. These flames do not only illuminate the final end of the old era. They also light up the new. Never before have the young men had so good a right to clean up the debris of the past. If the old men do not understand what is going on, let them grasp that we young men have gone and done it. The old goes up in flames.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today on The Literary Life podcast, we will be discussing J. R. R. Tolkien’s essay “<a href= "http://www.heritagepodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/Tolkien-On-Fairy-Stories-subcreation.pdf">On Fairy Stories</a>“. Tune in again over the next two weeks as we continue the conversation with Tolkien’s short story “<a href= "http://www.ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__leaf_by_niggle__en.htm">Leaf by Niggle</a>“. Cindy, Angelina and Thomas are also excited to announce the second annual <a href= "https://cindyrollins.net/back-to-school-2020/">Back to School Online Conference</a>, happening August 3-8, 2020. Register today at <a href="https://cindyrollins.net/">CindyRollins.net</a> for access both live and later.</p> <p>Angelina sets the stage for this discussion by orienting us to the context for the essay by Tolkien as a critique of what is considered a fairy story. She points out the difference between cautionary tales like those by Charles Perrault and the German folk and fairy tales collected by the Grimm Brothers. Our hosts highlight Tolkien’s definition of true fairy stories, ones that take place in the “perilous realm” and involve a journey element. He critiques Andrew Lang as including many stories as fairy tale that are not truly fairy stories. They also discuss topics from the essay including sub-creation, magic and spells, suspension of disbelief, and children’s responses to fairy stories.</p> Commonplace Quotes:  <p>One should forgive one’s enemies, but only after they are hanged.</p> Heinrich Heine  <p>The German folk soul can again express itself. These flames do not only illuminate the final end of the old era. They also light up the new. Never before have the young men had so good a right to clean up the debris of the past. If the old men do not understand what is going on, let them grasp that we young men have gone and done it. The old goes up in flames. The new shall be fashioned from the flame of our hearts.</p> Joseph Goebbles  <p>Human beings are not human doings.</p> Nigel Goodwin Into My Heart an Air That Kills <p><em>by A. E. Houseman</em></p> <p>Into my heart an air that kills From yon far country blows; What are those far remembered hills, What spires, what towns are those?</p> <p>That is the land of lost content, I see it shining plain, The happy highways where I went And cannot go again.</p> Book List: <p><em>(Amazon affiliate links)</em></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/30RsPE6">When Books Went to War</a></em> by Molly Guptill Manning</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2OZJ24E">Culture Care</a></em> by Makoto Fujimura</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3hEGHZu">Gulliver’s Travels</a></em> by Jonathan Swift</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/32Yn2zs">A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court</a></em> by Mark Twain</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/39sTBGS">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a></em> by L.

In telling the story of her reading life, Emily talks about her childhood and how she was not a reader as a young person. She shares how she finally started getting interested in reading through Janette Oke and Hardy Boys books. Then she tells about borrowing books from a local family’s home library and starting to fall in love with true classics.</p> <p>After getting married to an avid reader, Emily started going through her husband’s own library during her long hours at home alone. Even after she became of lover of reading, Emily still didn’t define herself as a real reader. Emily shares her journey to becoming a homeschooling parent, how she learned about Charlotte Mason and classical education, and her first time meeting Angelina and Cindy. They continue the conversation expanding on the feast of ideas, what it means to be a “reader,” and how we learn and enter into the literary world throughout our lives.</p> <p>Stay tuned next week when we will be discussing Tolkein’s essay “<a href= "http://www.heritagepodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/Tolkien-On-Fairy-Stories-subcreation.pdf">On Fairy Stories</a>“, followed by a conversation about his short story “<a href= "http://www.ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__leaf_by_niggle__en.htm">Leaf by Niggle</a>” for the next two weeks.</p> <h3>Listen to The Literary Life:</h3> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>But the object of my school is to show how many extraordinary things even a lazy and ordinary man may see, if he can spur himself to the single activity of seeing.</p> <cite>G.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life, our hosts talk about their favorite poems and poets. Cindy starts off by sharing the early influences on her developing a love of poetry. Thomas also shares about his mother reading poetry to him as a child and the poetry that made an impression on him as a child. Angelina talks about coming to poetry later in life and how she finally came to love it through learning about the metaphysical poets.</p> <p>Cindy and Thomas talk about the powerful effect of reading and reciting poetry in meter. Thomas also brings up the potential of hymn texts as beautiful, high-ranking poetry. From classic to modern, they share many poems and passages from their most beloved poetry, making this a soothing, lyrical episode. If you want to learn more, check out Thomas’ webinar <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/product/how-to-love-poetry-an-introduction-to-the-fundamentals-of-poetry/"> How to Love Poetry</a>.</p> <p>Next week our hosts will be checking in with their 20 for 2020 Reading Challenge progress, and we hope you will share your progress on Instagram and Facebook, too.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the second part of our discussion of Euripides’ <a href="https://amzn.to/2Yz6sSS"><em>The Trojan Women</em></a> here on The Literary Life podcast. This week Angelina, Cindy and Thomas really get into the meat of the play. If you missed last week’s <a href="http://theliterary.life/052/">introduction episode</a>, you will want to go back and listen to that first to set the stage, so to speak. Cindy and Angelina talk about how much emotion is evoked by Euripides’ portrayal of these women and their situation. Thomas brings in some of the surrounding myths that connect to the characters in this play, as well.</p> <p>Angelina and Cindy highlight the characteristics of Hecuba and Andromache amidst such trying circumstances. In discussing Helen’s role in the play, Cindy mentions a short story C. S. Lewis wrote about Helen of Troy called “After Ten Years.” It can be found in <a href="https://amzn.to/3dZ8l1V"><em>The Dark Tower: and Other Storie</em>s</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/30CZoXZ"><em>Of Other Worlds: Essays and Stories</em></a>. Our hosts share their emotional responses to the utter heartbreak of the mothers on top of the demise of Troy itself.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>(Amazon affiliate links are used in this content.)</em></span></p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>There are decades where nothing happens, and weeks where decades happen.</p> <cite>Vladimir Lenin</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>While affording some secrets of ‘the way of the will’ to young people, we should perhaps beware of presenting the ideas of ‘self-knowledge, self-reverence, and self-control.’ All adequate education must be outward bound, and the mind which is concentrated upon self-emolument, even though it be the emolument of all the virtues, misses the higher and the simpler secrets of life. Duty and service are the sufficient motives for the arduous training of the will that a child goes through with little consciousness.</p> <cite>Charlotte Mason</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Perhaps the surest measure of O’Connor’s sense of calling was her willingness to be misunderstood.</p> <cite>Jonathan Rogers</cite></blockquote> <h3>All the World’s a Stage</h3> <p><em>by William Shakespeare</em></p> <p>All the world’s a stage,<br /> And all the men and women merely players;<br /> They have their exits and their entrances;<br /> And one man in his time plays many parts,<br /> His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,<br /> Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;<br /> And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel<br /> And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br /> Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br /> Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br /> Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br /> Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,<br /> Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br /> Seeking the bubble reputation<br /> Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,<br /> In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,<br /> With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br /> Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br /> And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br /> Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,<br /> With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;<br /> His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide<br /> For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,<br /> Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br /> And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br /> That ends this strange eventful history,<br /> Is second childishness and mere oblivion;<br /> Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Yz6sSS">The Trojan Women</a></em> by Euripides</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3fqf6Kp">Towards a Philosophy of Education</a></em> by Charlotte Mason</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3cWqfkf">The Terrible Speed of Mercy</a></em> by Jonathan Rogers</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2XYnURV">As You Like It</a></em> by William Shakespeare</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3cVNdYR">Agamemnon</a></em> by Aeschylus</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3hlwnGt">Iphigenia in Aulis</a></em> by Euripedes</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2XZ34BD">The Illiad</a></em> by Home</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3fjck9F">The Aeneid</a></em> by Virgil</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2MWTBEQ">The Trojan Women</a> (film) starring Katharine Hepburn</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3dZ8l1V"><em>The Dark Tower: and Other Storie</em>s</a> by C.

Duty and service are the sufficient motives for the arduous training of the will that a child goes through with little consciousness.</p> Charlotte Mason  <p>Perhaps the surest measure of O’Connor’s sense of calling was her willingness to be misunderstood.</p> Jonathan Rogers All the World’s a Stage <p><em>by William Shakespeare</em></p> <p>All the world’s a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms; And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lin’d, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side; His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion; Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</p> Book List: <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Yz6sSS">The Trojan Women</a></em> by Euripides</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3fqf6Kp">Towards a Philosophy of Education</a></em> by Charlotte Mason</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3cWqfkf">The Terrible Speed of Mercy</a></em> by Jonathan Rogers</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2XYnURV">As You Like It</a></em> by William Shakespeare</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3cVNdYR">Agamemnon</a></em> by Aeschylus</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3hlwnGt">Iphigenia in Aulis</a></em> by Euripedes</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2XZ34BD">The Illiad</a></em> by Home</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3fjck9F">The Aeneid</a></em> by Virgil</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2MWTBEQ">The Trojan Women</a> (film) starring Katharine Hepburn</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3dZ8l1V"><em>The Dark Tower: and Other Storie</em>s</a> by C.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first episode in our series on Greek drama and <em>The Trojan Women</em> by Euripides. Classicist Thomas Banks will be leading the discussion with Angelina Stanford and Cindy Rollins asking questions and adding their own thoughts along the way. If you enjoy these podcasts, you can also check out the <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/classes/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> for the summer intensive on Classical Greek Drama.</p> <p>Thomas begins with some background on the development on Greek drama in history. He also explains the role of the chorus in typical Greek plays in contrast to how Euripides uses it in this play. He then gives us a little biographical information on Euripides and places him, along with the other Greek dramatists, in the context of history. He also talks about the questions of theodicy that come up in The Trojan Women and other of Euripides’ works. Thomas points out some resources to give readers background on Greek mythology and characters you will see in these plays. He continues with a brief overview of the Trojan War. Our host wrap up with some thoughts on the prologue of <em>The Trojan Women</em>.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>This the story of my life, that while I lived it weighed upon me and pressed against me and filled all my senses to overflowing and now is like a dream dreamed…..This is my story, my giving of thanks.</p> <cite>Wendell Berry</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Sophocles is wise, Euripedes is wiser, but Socrates is wisest of them all.</p> <cite>The Oracle of Delphi</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.</p> <cite>L.

Angelina Stanford opens this discussion talking about stories as a lens to see other perspectives, rather than our own. Thomas Banks gives some biographical information on Simone Weil. Cindy Rollins highlights the connections she made from this essay to Charlotte Mason and Stratford Caldecott, especially in regards to attention and remembrance.</p> <p>They talk about the problems of being counter-cultural in education, pride versus humility as an end of education, and training of the will. Cindy and Angelina emphasize the importance of the work of education over “making the grade.” Thomas reads a quote from Weil on keeping periods of focused work brief, and Cindy expounds on how this concept was also very important to Charlotte Mason. Angelina talks about her own conviction in reading Weil’s words about learning from those subjects which do not come easily for us.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life Podcast, Angelina, Cindy and Thomas wrap up their discussion of C. S. Lewis’ <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3fUwisr">The Great Divorce</a></em> with the final chapters 11-14. Before starting their talk about the book, Cindy shares about her upcoming Summer Discipleship Program, <a href= "https://cindyrollins.net/product/morning-time-for-moms-summer-2020/"> Morning Time for Moms</a>. Angelina and Thomas also have some exciting <a href="https://houseofhumaneletters.com/classes/">summer courses</a> coming up on Classical Greek Drama and Flannery O’Connor. Also, this Thursday, May 21, 2020, Thomas is giving a <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/product/george-orwell-his-life-and-work-webinar-by-thomas-bank-check-your-receipt-for-the-link/"> webinar on George Orwell</a>.</p> <p>Cindy and Angelina talk about the dangers of familial love becoming the end-all-be-all, as well as Lewis’ exploration of Dante’s idea of sin. They go in depth with this exploration of sin as a distortion of something that might naturally seem good and the way Lewis pairs people to demonstrate that in these chapters. Angelina talks about the medieval view of ordered man versus the disordered man and how that relates to the man with the horse. They wrap up with the importance of stories in depicting truth in a veiled way, instead of only theological argument and discourse, in helping us live out our faith in a properly ordered way.</p> <p>Until next time, check out our <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/upcoming-events/">Upcoming Events</a> page to view our summer schedule and see what we will be reading together next!</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>We chose from the library shelves any book of Tales for the Young, and took much pleasure in prophesying the events.

Why did cholera break out? To kill the child who went down a forbidden street. The names told us much: Tom, Sam, or Jack were predestined to evil, while a Frank could do nothing but good.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Literary Life podcast today, our hosts Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks discuss chapters 2-6 of C. S. Lewis’ <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3bQJAni">The Great Divorce</a>.</em> Angelina reminds us as we begin this exploration of Lewis’ narrative not to read too much theology into the details of this dreamlike world he creates. Cindy points out the similarities between these chapters and his descriptions at the end of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2YnACdw">The Last Battle</a></em>. Thomas highlights the passage on Napoleon from chapter 2, showing what Lewis envisioned hell to be like. Angelina, Cindy and Thomas talks about the description of the land near heaven, the various characters’ responses, as well as the weight of the actual environment and Lewis’ picture of those who people it. <span style= "font-size: 10pt;"><em>(Affiliate links are used in this content.)</em></span></p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>We long for paradise because we were created for paradise.

Or anything that is mine.”</p> <cite>Terry Pratchett</cite></blockquote> <h3>The Stricken Deer</h3> <p><em>by William Cowper</em></p> <p>I was a stricken deer, that left the herd<br /> Long since; with many an arrow deep infixt<br /> My panting side was charg’d, when I withdrew<br /> To seek a tranquil death in distant shades.<br /> There was I found by one who had himself<br /> Been hurt by th’ archers. In his side he bore,<br /> And in his hands and feet, the cruel scars.<br /> With gentle force soliciting the darts,<br /> He drew them forth, and heal’d, and bade me live.<br /> Since then, with few associates, in remote<br /> And silent woods I wander, far from those<br /> My former partners of the peopled scene;<br /> With few associates, and not wishing more.<br /> Here much I ruminate, as much I may,<br /> With other views of men and manners now<br /> Than once, and others of a life to come.<br /> I see that all are wand’rers, gone astray<br /> Each in his own delusions; they are lost<br /> In chace of fancied happiness, still wooed<br /> And never won. Dream after dream ensues,<br /> And still they dream that they shall still succeed,<br /> And still are disappointed; rings the world<br /> With the vain stir.

S. Lewis. Today you are going to get a crash-course in Medievalism through Lewis’ story, and we hope you will enjoy this book as much as our hosts do. Angelina kicks off the discussion even while sharing her commonplace quote, sharing some information about the epigraph and front matter. She gives us some historical context, both for where this books comes in Lewis’ own timeline, as well as some ideas of the journey of the soul and medieval dream literature.</p> <p>Thomas gives some background on Prudentius and his allegorical work <a href="https://amzn.to/352ZRmo"><em>The Psychomachia</em></a>. Angelina goes into some comparisons between <em>The Great Divorce</em> and Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Thomas talks about Nathanial Hawthorne’s short story <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/2xJ0TYR">The Celestial Railroad</a></em> as a satire of <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>. Also, if you haven’t read and listened to E. M. Forster’s <em>Celestial Omnibus</em>, see <a href="https://www.theliterary.life/017/">Episode 17</a>.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life podcast, our fearless hosts discuss Oscar Wilde’s unraveling of the tangle of plot points in Act 3 of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3craQbZ">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></em>. Cindy Rollins talks about her reaction to Act 3 and how it gets resolved. Thomas Banks observes how Wilde sets up the conflict with the possibility to become a tragedy like <em>Oedipus Rex</em> instead of a comedy. Angelina Stanford talks about the theme of the identity quest, tokens of identity and foundlings in literature. The conversation, as in previous episodes, centers around the way Wilde pokes fun at Victorian ideals and cliches.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Wear your learning like your watch, in a private pocket; and do not pull it out and strike it merely to show that you have one.</p> <cite>Lord Chesterfield</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>We must travel this path as lovers, amateurs, of the Word and of words because all things reveal themselves more truly to the eyes of love.</p> <cite>Stratford Caldecott</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Time’s glory is to calm contending kings,</p> <p>To unmask falsehood, and bring truth to light, To stamp the seal of time in aged things, To wake the morn and sentinel the night, To wrong the wronger till he render right; To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours, And smear with dust their glittering golden towers.</p> <cite>William Shakespeare</cite></blockquote> <h3>Easter Wings</h3> <p><em>by George Herbert</em></p> <p>Lord, who createdst man in wealth and store,<br />      Though foolishly he lost the same,<br />            Decaying more and more,<br />                  Till he became<br />                        Most poore:<br />                        With thee<br />                  O let me rise<br />            As larks, harmoniously,<br />      And sing this day thy victories:<br /> Then shall the fall further the flight in me.<br /> <br /> My tender age in sorrow did beginne<br />      And still with sicknesses and shame.<br />            Thou didst so punish sinne,<br />                  That I became<br />                        Most thinne.<br />                        With thee<br />                  Let me combine,<br />            And feel thy victorie:<br />         For, if I imp my wing on thine,<br /> Affliction shall advance the flight in me.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3cwpbUm">Beauty in the Word</a></em> by Stratford Caldecott</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3aqfohz">Oedipus Rex</a></em> by Sophocles</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3aqq9As">The White Company</a></em> by Arthur Conan Doyle</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VkESbu">Brigadier Gerard</a></em> by Arthur Conan Doyle</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3bqppww">Sir Nigel</a></em> by Arthur Conan Doyle</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/34Leb33">Howards End</a></em> by E.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life podcast, Cindy, Thomas and Angelina cover Act 2 of Oscar Wilde’s <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/2y4W2AU">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></em>. Angelina is excited to share her research on the connection between the work of Oscar Wilde and P. G. Wodehouse. Cindy brings up Booth Tarkington’s Penrod books as another example of witty, humorous literature. Thomas points out the importance of cultural lens for appreciating humor in art. They also talk about all the puns that Wilde gives his characters in this play.</p> <p>Angelina discusses the reformed rake motif in Victorian literature and how Wilde plays with this theme. Thomas gives a little background on the mentions of lending libraries and the three-volume novel. Cindy talks about the parallels between the Victorians’ high view of earnestness and our modern valuation of transparency. Angelina contrasts Oscar Wilde and his contemporary Thomas Hardy in the way that Wilde handles heavy topics with a light touch. They all agree that Wilde has an almost Shakespearean plot in complexity and manages to pull it all together at the end.</p> <h3>Listen to The Literary Life:</h3> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>About the lack of religious education: of course you must be grieved, but remember how much religious education has exactly the opposite effect to that which was intended, how many hard atheists come from pious homes.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, our hosts dive into Act 1 of Oscar Wilde’s satirical play <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/2wQVvCx">The Importance of Being Earnest</a>.</em> Angelina, Cindy and Thomas share their commonplace quotes, which leads into a conversation on education before they begin talking about the play. Thomas talks about the name of the play as well as the name “Ernest” in context of this time period. Angelina highlights her excitement of noticing the connection between Wilde’s humor and P. G. Wodehouse. Angelina talks about the changing roles of social classes in the late Victorian age and how that comes into this story. Our hosts go through this first act and discuss the social conventions at which Wilde is poking fun.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>We find that the mind is better fed by digesting a page than by devouring a volume.</p> <cite>Thomas Macaulay</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Education is an admirable thing.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's episode of The Literary Life, our hosts, Cindy Rollins, Thomas Banks and Angelina Stanford introduce us to Oscar Wilde and our next literary selection, his satirical play <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2WRsvFa">The Importance of Being Earnest</a>.</em> They begin with a discussion on the purpose of art and literature in depicting truth without preaching it at us, making so many connections along the way. Thomas gives us a biographical sketch of Oscar Wilde, both his life and work. Angelina expands on the emphasis on respectability in Victorian society. Cindy talks about her first experience with reading Oscar Wilde and the accessibility of his plays.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>For your face I have exchanged all faces.</p> <cite>Philip Larkin</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Just as conscience, or the moral sense, recognizes duty; just as the intellect deals with the truth; so is it the part of taste alone to form us of BEAUTY. And Poesy is the handmaiden but of Taste. Yet we would not be misunderstood. This handmaiden is not forbidden to moralize–in her own fashion. She is not forbidden to depict–but to reason and preach, of virtue. As, of this latter, conscience recognizes the obligation, so intellect teaches the expediency, while taste contents herself with displaying the beauty waging war with vice merely on the ground of its inconsistency with fitness, harmony, proportion–in a word with beauty.</p> <cite>Edgar Allan Poe</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>The diversity of Ruskin’s concerns was not simply the product of a restlessly questioning mind. He was convinced of the vital connections between things, as they bind and blend themselves together. The Intellectual separations that characterize the modern professionalization of knowledge seemed to him corrosive, a denial of what unites different levels of human experience—spiritual and aesthetic, political and scientific, historical and contemporary. His argument is always that knowledge connects. He wants readers to these connections, as clearly and comprehensively, as they can. This is an exercise in humility, since it confirms the imperfections and limitations of our vision, and the mystery of what lies beyond it. But the attempt to see clearly enables us to celebrate what is large than our own lives. His capacity for admiration makes him the most magnanimous of critics. It can also make him the angriest, the he witnesses the betrayal of human history and human potential. Ruskin’s intention is always to teach us to use our eyes, and these  remains the best reason or reading his work. He will show you how to look at the world afresh.</p> <cite>Dinah Birch</cite></blockquote> <h3>E Tenebris (Out of the Shadows)</h3> <p><em>by Oscar Wilde</em></p> <p>Come down, O Christ, and help me! reach thy hand,<br /> For I am drowning in a stormier sea<br /> Than Simon on thy lake of Galilee:<br /> The wine of life is spilt upon the sand,<br /> My heart is as some famine-murdered land,<br /> Whence all good things have perished utterly,<br /> And well I know my soul in Hell must lie<br /> If I this night before God’s throne should stand.<br /> ‘He sleeps perchance, or rideth to the chase,<br /> Like Baal, when his prophets howled that name<br /> From morn to noon on Carmel’s smitten height.’<br /> Nay, peace, I shall behold before the night,<br /> The feet of brass, the robe more white than flame,<br /> The wounded hands, the weary human face.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Amazon affiliate links are used in this content.</span></em></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/33LiuuR">Treasures of the Snow</a></em> by Patricia St. John</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2xcXfWw">Little Pilgrim’s Progress</a></em> by Helen Taylor</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2UthR5K">The Tell-Tale Heart</a></em> by Edgar Allan Poe</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3dFtPRC">Marius the Epicurean</a></em> by Walter Pater</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2UpkKVj">The Picture of Dorian Grey</a></em> by Oscar Wilde</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3aEwb0U">An Ideal Husband</a></em> by Oscar Wilde</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Up22NE">Esther Waters</a></em> by George Moore</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2JAI50h">Tess of the D’Urbervilles</a></em> by Thomas Hardy</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3asT9Ix">David Copperfield</a></em> by Charles Dickens</p> <h3>Support The Literary Life:</h3> <p>Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/theliterarylife/overview">Patreon,</a> and get some amazing bonus content!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In light of the recent changes to all our lives, The Literary Life crew is breaking from the previously announced schedule to discuss the importance of stories in times of crisis. But first, we want you to know about a special gift from Cindy Rollins. You can download a PDF copy of her <em><a href= "https://cindyrollins.net/product/the-handbook-of-morning-time/?fbclid=IwAR3z7M14EAYQnYfzYuL40Wl2lgKmnXu7ZH9OjuyoG8uT_dF7QUm3rtEiUnE"> Handbook of Morning Time</a></em> for free by visiting her shop <a href= "https://cindyrollins.net/product/the-handbook-of-morning-time/?fbclid=IwAR3z7M14EAYQnYfzYuL40Wl2lgKmnXu7ZH9OjuyoG8uT_dF7QUm3rtEiUnE"> here</a>. You can also purchase the replays of the Re-Enchanting the World online conference at <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/product/the-literary-life-online-conference/"> HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a>.</p> <p>Angelina talks about the impulse of humanity to turn to stories during time of upheaval and plague. Cindy points out the need we have for an ordered universe, and that this is one of the things good books provide.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to The Literary Life Podcast and our discussion of the Art of Writing! If you missed last week’s discussion, you can go back and catch up <a href= "http://theliterary.life/040/">here</a>. We start off today with Angelina Stanford asking Karen Glass about the principles of good writing. Karen talks a bit about William Zinsser and his ideas about writing and education. Our hosts give some practical encouragement to the average homeschool parent listening to this conversation. Cindy highlights the value of waiting to teach specific skills until students are old enough to process them.</p> <p>Angelina, Cindy and Karen talk about narration in the Charlotte Mason education, its benefits and its challenges. They emphasize the importance of guiding children to think well instead of just learning mechanical skills devoid of context. Angelina brings up the sensitive topic of assessing and grading writing. Karen leaves us with a challenge to narrate this podcast discussion in writing in order to apply what you've learned! </p> <h3>Loving In Truth</h3> <p><em>by Sir Philip Sydney</em></p> <p>Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,<br /> That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,<br /> Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,<br /> Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,—<br /> I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,<br /> Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,<br /> Oft turning others’ leaves, to see if thence would flow<br /> Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain.<br /> But words came halting forth, wanting Invention’s stay:<br /> Invention, Nature’s child, fled step-dame Study’s blows,<br /> And others’ feet still seemed but strangers in my way.<br /> Thus great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,<br /> Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite:<br /> “Fool,” said my Muse to me, “look in thy heart and write.”</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2TjNTk6">Writing to Learn</a></em> by William Zinsser</p> <h3>Support The Literary Life:</h3> <p>Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/theliterarylife/overview">Patreon,</a> and get some amazing bonus content!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, Angelina, Cindy and Thomas sit down with Karen Glass for a conversation centering on the topic of writing. They discuss the problem of trying to teach writing in a formulaic way. They also talk about the challenge of helping students learn to think well in order to write well.</p> <p>Karen highlights narration as a tool to teach thinking well in the form of oral composition. Cindy digs into the idea of imitation as an integral part of the learning process. Angelina and Karen both emphasize the importance of addressing skill and form on an individual basis, depending on what your student needs to improve.</p> <p>Tune in again next week for Part 2 of this great conversation!</p> <h3>Listen to The Literary Life:</h3> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>To write or even speak English is not a science, but an art. There are no reliable words. Whoever writes English is involved in a struggle that never lets up even for a sentence. He is struggling against vagueness, against obscurity, against the lure of the decorative adjective, against the encroachment of Latin and Greek, and, above all, against the worn-out phrases and dead metaphors with which the language is cluttered up.</p> <cite>George Orwell</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Rhetoric, or the art of writing, is not governed by arbitrary laws. Its rules are not statutes passed long ago by some assembly of critical scholars; they are merely common-sense principles derived from the observed practices of persons who have succeeded in writing well,–that is, from the method of good authors. Hence, when we study composition, we investigate these methods, in order to apply them in our own writing.</p> <cite>from “Manual of Composition and Rhetoric”</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>When a child is reading, he should not be teased with questions as to the meaning of what he has read, the signification of this word or that; what is annoying to older people is equally annoying to children.</p> <cite>Charlotte Mason</cite></blockquote> <h3>Follow Your Saint</h3> <p><em>by Thomas Campion</em></p> <p>Follow your saint, follow with accents sweet;<br /> Haste you, sad notes, fall at her flying feet.<br /> There, wrapp’d in cloud of sorrow, pity move,<br /> And tell the ravisher of my soul I perish for her love:<br /> But if she scorns my never-ceasing pain,<br /> Then burst with sighing in her sight and ne’er return again.</p> <p>All that I sung still to her praise did tend,<br /> Still she was first; still she my songs did end;<br /> Yet she my love and music both doth fly,<br /> The music that her echo is and beauty’s sympathy.<br /> Then let my notes pursue her scornful flight:<br /> It shall suffice that they were breath’d and died for her delight.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Amazon Affiliate links are used in this content.</em></span></p> <p><em><a href= "https://archive.org/details/manualofcomposit00gard/page/n3/mode/2up"> Manual of Composition and Rhetoric</a></em> edited by Gardiner, Kittredge and Arnold</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2TkQCKg">Home Education</a></em> by Charlotte Mason</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ihse68">Know and Tell</a></em> by Karen Glass</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VIEggM">On Writing Well</a></em> by William Zinsser</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2TjNTk6">Writing to Learn</a></em> by William Zinsser</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3cDpYnE">Range</a></em> by David Epstein</p> <h3>Support The Literary Life:</h3> <p>Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/theliterarylife/overview">Patreon,</a> and get some amazing bonus content!

Hence, when we study composition, we investigate these methods, in order to apply them in our own writing.</p> from “Manual of Composition and Rhetoric”  <p>When a child is reading, he should not be teased with questions as to the meaning of what he has read, the signification of this word or that; what is annoying to older people is equally annoying to children.</p> Charlotte Mason Follow Your Saint <p><em>by Thomas Campion</em></p> <p>Follow your saint, follow with accents sweet; Haste you, sad notes, fall at her flying feet. There, wrapp’d in cloud of sorrow, pity move, And tell the ravisher of my soul I perish for her love: But if she scorns my never-ceasing pain, Then burst with sighing in her sight and ne’er return again.</p> <p>All that I sung still to her praise did tend, Still she was first; still she my songs did end; Yet she my love and music both doth fly, The music that her echo is and beauty’s sympathy. Then let my notes pursue her scornful flight: It shall suffice that they were breath’d and died for her delight.</p> Book List: <p><em>Amazon Affiliate links are used in this content.</em></p> <p><em><a href= "https://archive.org/details/manualofcomposit00gard/page/n3/mode/2up"> Manual of Composition and Rhetoric</a></em> edited by Gardiner, Kittredge and Arnold</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2TkQCKg">Home Education</a></em> by Charlotte Mason</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ihse68">Know and Tell</a></em> by Karen Glass</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VIEggM">On Writing Well</a></em> by William Zinsser</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2TjNTk6">Writing to Learn</a></em> by William Zinsser</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3cDpYnE">Range</a></em> by David Epstein</p> Support The Literary Life: <p>Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/theliterarylife/overview">Patreon,</a> and get some amazing bonus content!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life, Angelina and Cindy interview Karen Glass. Karen is part of the Advisory of <a href= "http://www.amblesideonline.com">AmblesideOnline</a>. She has four children, ages 13 to 27, who have been homeschooled using Charlotte Mason’s methods from beginning to end. She has been studying and writing about Charlotte Mason and Classical Education for over twenty years, and has written <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/2vmsRYW">Consider This</a></em> to share the most important things she has discovered about the connection between them. We are giving away a copy of her newest book, <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/2TmkS6c">In Vital Harmony</a></em>, to 2 lucky listeners who share about this podcast episode on Facebook or Instagram using the hashtag #invitalharmony.</p> <p>After sharing their commonplace quotes, our hosts dive into this conversation with Karen about how she became a lover of books. She talks about her voracious reading as a child and teen. Karen also recounts how her mediocre education did not discourage her reading life but just gave her more time and reason to read. This leads into a meaty discussion among Karen, Cindy and Angelina about self-education, homeschooling and lifelong learning.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Let us consider an apple. If we approach it synthetically, we take it as we find it–in its state of wholeness and completeness–and we eat it. Once eaten, it is digested, absorbed, and becomes a part of us. If we approach it analytically, we take it apart–not in a natural way, which is merely a smaller portion (here is half an apple!), but rather, here is the fiber, here are the vitamins, here is a bit of water, and some sugar. Suppose we ingest each bit–a spoonful of fiber, a vitamin pill, a swallow of sugar-and-water. On paper, we have consumed the same thing in both cases–equal portions of nutrition–but there is a very, very large difference. Only one of those meals tasted good and created an appetite for more.</p> <cite>Karen Glass</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>However difficult it may be to characterize correctly the medieval class system, it is even more difficult to grasp medieval thinking, which was broadly metaphorical and analogical, rather than merely logical and rational.</p> <cite>Thomas Cahill</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>Remember that the uttermost penalty was reserved for him who could say to his brother “Thou fool!” because contempt was the most un-godlike quality which man could display. Beware above all things lest a little knowledge only reinforce conceit and lead you into a false world where self is enthroned, far away from the true world which is illuminated by the love of God, manifested in the Person of the Incarnate Word.</p> <cite>Mandell Creighton</cite></blockquote> <h3>A Poison Tree</h3> <p><em>by William Blake</em></p> <p>I was angry with my friend; <br /> I told my wrath, my wrath did end.<br /> I was angry with my foe: <br /> I told it not, my wrath did grow. <br /> <br /> And I waterd it in fears,<br /> Night & morning with my tears: <br /> And I sunned it with smiles,<br /> And with soft deceitful wiles. <br /> <br /> And it grew both day and night. <br /> Till it bore an apple bright. <br /> And my foe beheld it shine,<br /> And he knew that it was mine. <br /> <br /> And into my garden stole, <br /> When the night had veild the pole; <br /> In the morning glad I see; <br /> My foe outstretched beneath the tree.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Amazon Affiliate links are used in this content.</em></span></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3cbqtoM">Consider This</a></em> by Karen Glass</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/384oTlb">Mind to Mind</a></em> by Karen Glass</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3cdTnEs">Know and Tell</a></em> by Karen Glass</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2TmkS6c">In Vital Harmony</a></em> by Karen Glass</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3c7wQtf">Mysteries of the Middle Ages</a></em> by Thomas Cahill</p> <p><em><a href= "https://archive.org/details/thoughtsoneduca00creigoog/page/n9/mode/2up"> Thoughts on Education</a></em> by Mandell Creighton</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2vbCoSS">Bedtime for Frances</a></em> by Russel Hoban</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3ajPFaX">Petunia</a></em> by Roger Duvoisin</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3cfQkvQ"><em>Dorrie’s Magic</em></a> by Patricia Coombs</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2VoAyIL"><em>Watership Down</em></a> by Richard Adams</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VoASHt">The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</a></em> by J.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life, we wrap up our discussion of Shakespeare’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/38QzoKf">A Winter’s Tale</a></em> with a look at Act 5. Our hosts, Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks also announce our next book to read together, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2vW6w4u">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></em> by Oscar Wilde. Angelina notes that Act 5 is all about reconciliation and redemption. Thomas points out that Shakespeare had a challenge here in how to bring this play to a close with all those relationships resolved. Cindy brings up Paulina’s character and the significance of her name.</p> <p>Our hosts discuss the truth that though in an ultimate sense all will be made right, this play reminds us that in this life, there are some things that are not fully redeemed. They also talk about how Shakespeare plays with both the audience’s expectations and with the form in this act. Leontes’ imagination is also in need of redemption, and we see that happen here at the end of the play. Thomas makes the connection between the myth of Pygmalion, Euripedes’ <em>Alcestis</em> and <em>A Winter’s Tale</em>.</p> <p>The theme of resurrection is so prevalent in this final act, particularly in the case of Hermoine, but also in other characters and plot points. The winter is over, and spring has come to Sicily. The old order is not restored. A new order has been brought into being.</p> <h3>Upcoming Events:</h3> <p>We are excited to announce a new online conference coming on March 13-14, 2020. Our theme will be <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/">Re-enchanting the World: The Legacy of the Inklings</a>. Our keynote speaker is Inklings scholar, Joseph Pearce.

S. Lewis</em></p> <p>How soft it rains, how nourishingly soft and green<br /> Has grown the dark humility of this low house<br /> Where sunrise never enters, where I have not seen<br /> The moon by night nor heard the footfall of a mouse,<br /> Nor looked on any face but yours<br /> Nor changed my posture in my place of rest<br /> For fifteen years–oh how this quiet cures<br /> My pain and sucks the burning from my breast.</p> <p>It sucked out all the poison of my will and drew<br /> All hot rebellion from me, all desire to break<br /> The silence you commanded me. . . . Nothing to do,<br /> Nothing to fear or wish for, not a choice to make,<br /> Only to be; to hear no more Cock-crowing duty calling me to rise,<br /> But slowly thus to ripen laid in store<br /> In this dim nursery near your watching eyes.</p> <p>Pardon, great spirit, whose tall shape like a golden tower<br /> Stands over me or seems upon slow wings to move,<br /> Coloring with life my paleness, with returning power,<br /> By sober ministrations of severest love;<br /> Pardon, that when you brought me here,<br /> Still drowned in bitter passion, drugged with life,<br /> I did not know . . . pardon, I thought you were<br /> Paulina, old Antigonus’ young wife.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5085">Characters of Shakespeare’s Plays</a></em> by William Hazlitt</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/32lblAm">Brideshead Revisited</a></em> by Evelyn Waugh</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/32iOl54">Poems</a></em> by C.

S. Lewis</em></p> <p>How soft it rains, how nourishingly soft and green Has grown the dark humility of this low house Where sunrise never enters, where I have not seen The moon by night nor heard the footfall of a mouse, Nor looked on any face but yours Nor changed my posture in my place of rest For fifteen years–oh how this quiet cures My pain and sucks the burning from my breast.</p> <p>It sucked out all the poison of my will and drew All hot rebellion from me, all desire to break The silence you commanded me. . . . Nothing to do, Nothing to fear or wish for, not a choice to make, Only to be; to hear no more Cock-crowing duty calling me to rise, But slowly thus to ripen laid in store In this dim nursery near your watching eyes.</p> <p>Pardon, great spirit, whose tall shape like a golden tower Stands over me or seems upon slow wings to move, Coloring with life my paleness, with returning power, By sober ministrations of severest love; Pardon, that when you brought me here, Still drowned in bitter passion, drugged with life, I did not know . . . pardon, I thought you were Paulina, old Antigonus’ young wife.</p> Book List: <p><em><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5085">Characters of Shakespeare’s Plays</a></em> by William Hazlitt</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/32lblAm">Brideshead Revisited</a></em> by Evelyn Waugh</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/32iOl54">Poems</a></em> by C.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life, Angelina, Cindy and Thomas dive in to Act 4 of Shakespeare’s <em>A Winter’s Tale</em>. We are excited to announce a new online conference coming on March 13-14, 2020. Our theme will be <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/">Re-enchanting the World: The Legacy of the Inklings</a>. Our keynote speaker is Inklings scholar, Joseph Pearce. Go to Angelina and Thomas’ new website <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> for all the info and to register.</p> <p>This act is jam packed with action and important plot points, but Cindy points out the connection between the shepherd and his son and the tale that Mamillius was telling Hermoine in an earlier act. Angelina brings up the juxtaposition of winter and spring in this play. She also talks about how Shakespeare departs from Aristotle’s “rules” for unity of time and place in playwriting. This act is all about redeeming what was lost, and it is also full of disguises. Thomas explains the connection between Perdita and Flora.</p> <p>Our hosts discuss the wedding customs of Shakespeare’s day as well as the festivities we see in this play. Thomas gives us a little overview of the myth of Persephone and how <em>A Winter’s Tale</em> alludes to this myth. Angelina also highlights the importance of the kiss in the fairy tale. Cindy encourages us to read and re-read because there is such depth in Shakespeare that we can never get to the bottom of it all. We are also invited to look for the mirrors of the characters and action in this act to things that happen in the first three acts. Angelina also instructs us on the two classic fairy tale story patterns and how <em>A Winter’s Tale</em> follows both of those patterns.</p> <h3>The Winter’s Tale Show Schedule:</h3> <ul> <li>February 25: Act V</li> <li>March: Live Q&A for Patreon Fellows</li> </ul> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p><em>She Dwelt Among the Untrodden Ways</em></p> <p>She dwelt among the untrodden ways<br /> Beside the springs of Dove,<br /> A Maid whom there were none to praise<br /> And very few to love:<br /> <br /> A violet by a mossy stone<br /> Half hidden from the eye!<br /> —Fair as a star, when only one<br /> Is shining in the sky.<br /> <br /> She lived unknown, and few could know<br /> When Lucy ceased to be;<br /> But she is in her grave, and, oh,<br /> The difference to me!</p> <cite>William Wordsworth</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>In the 12th-century Church of San Clemente in Rome, the brilliant mosaic apse over the main altar presents us with a view of reality that is both Cosmic and Eucharistic.

But spiraling forth from the foot of the cross, where it is watered by the blood of Christ, a stupendous acanthus bush curls outward and upward, encircling nearly a hundred separate images. The spiraling branches of the acanthus embrace even two pagan Roman gods, Baby Jupiter, formerly king of the gods, and Baby Neptune, formerly king of the deep, who rides a slippery looking dolphin.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On The Literary Life podcast today, we join our hosts Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks to discuss Act 3 of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/38C3L6s">The Winter's Tale</a></em> by Williams Shakespeare. Before jumping into Shakespeare, though, our hosts are excited to announce a new online conference coming on March 13-14, 2020. Our theme will be <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/">Re-enchanting the World: The Legacy of the Inklings</a>. Our keynote speaker is Inklings scholar, Joseph Pearce. Go to Angelina and Thomas' new website <a href= "https://houseofhumaneletters.com/">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> for all the info and to register.</p> <p>After catching us up on the plot, Angelina asks Thomas to explain a little about the Oracles and Apollo and how they relate to this play. He also talks about the parallel between this play and the historical events surrounding Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Our hosts also bring out the importance of a legitimate heir to the throne in a monarchy. The idea of the consequence of an out of control imagination continue to be crucial in this act. They also talk about the sudden change in Leontes’ feelings and his repentance at the end of Act 3.</p> <p>Angelina points out that the structure of the play tells us that all this death and grief is not the climax of the story. Cindy brings up the Russian feel present in A Winter’s Tale. Thomas explores the characters of the shepherds and rustics in Shakespeare’s plays. They discuss the fairy elements as well as the gospel elements of the baby and the gold being found by the shepherds.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>“I think it was The Times Literary Supplement–and it had left me depressed. What struck me so forcibly, and not for the first time, was that a new book on any subject-history, philosophy, science, religion, or what have you–is always dealt with by a specialist in that subject. This may be fairest from the author’s point of view, but it conveys a disagreeable impression of watertight compartments…<br /> It wasn’t that people can think at once confidently and oppositely about almost anything that matters-though that, too, can sometimes be a sobering reflection.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life, our hosts Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks are back to discuss Act 2 of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/38C3L6s">The Winter’s Tale</a></em> by Williams Shakespeare. After sharing their commonplace quotes, they begin with a brief recap of the plot. They highlight the story begun by Mamillius upon the entrance of Leontes in Act 2, Scene 1. Angelina explores the concept of Leontes as a tragic hero. Our hosts also get into the ideas of constancy versus inconstancy, lunacy and the Renaissance view of women as changeable. Shakespeare, on the other hand, portrays a man as the one who is changeable and the woman as constant.</p> <p>As we continue through this act, our hosts highlight Leontes’ illness and how it infects Mamillius. They also talk about Paulina as a sort of foil for Leontes, as well as her strength of character in the face of the king’s unreasonable behavior. Cindy points out the unthinkable nature of Leontes’ desire to burn his own wife and child.</p> <h3>The Winter’s Tale Show Schedule:</h3> <ul> <li>February 11: Act III</li> <li>February 18: Act IV</li> <li>February 25: Act V</li> <li>March: Live Q&A for Patreon Fellows</li> </ul> <h3>Those Winter Sundays</h3> <p><em>by Robert Hayden</em></p> <p>Sundays too my father got up early<br /> and put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,<br /> then with cracked hands that ached<br /> from labor in the weekday weather made<br /> banked fires blaze.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our first episode on Shakespeare’s play <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/2R4FWOQ">A Winter’s Tale</a></em>. Hosts Angelina Stanford and Cindy Rollins start off with some ideas of how to approach a Shakespeare play, especially if you feel new or intimidated by Shakespeare. Angelina talks about the use of poetry and prose in these plays, as well as the different types of plays within Shakespeare’s body of work. She also discusses the history and development of drama from the time of the Greeks to the Renaissance.</p> <p>James Banks joins the podcasts again to lend his perspective to our study of Shakespeare. He recommends the Oxford, Norton and Riverside editions for reading Shakespeare. He also encourages people to see screen adaptations, audio versions and, of course, watching a live play when possible. James also talks a little about the challenge of the older English language and how to deal with that as you read and listen. Our hosts also take a look at the culture and history surrounding Shakespeare and his theatre company.</p> <h3>The Winter’s Tale Show Schedule:</h3> <ul> <li>January 28: Act I</li> <li>February 4: Act II</li> <li>February 11: Act III</li> <li>February 18: Act IV</li> <li>February 25: Act V</li> <li>March: Live Q&A for Patreon Fellows</li> </ul> <h3>In Memory of Yeats</h3> <p><em>by W.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our first episode on Shakespeare’s play <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/2R4FWOQ">A Winter’s Tale</a></em>. Hosts Angelina Stanford and Cindy Rollins start off with some ideas of how to approach a Shakespeare play, especially if you feel new or intimidated by Shakespeare. Angelina talks about the use of poetry and prose in these plays, as well as the different types of plays within Shakespeare’s body of work. She also discusses the history and development of drama from the time of the Greeks to the Renaissance.</p> <p>James Banks joins the podcasts again to lend his perspective to our study of Shakespeare. He recommends the Oxford, Norton and Riverside editions for reading Shakespeare. He also encourages people to see screen adaptations, audio versions and, of course, watching a live play when possible. James also talks a little about the challenge of the older English language and how to deal with that as you read and listen. Our hosts also take a look at the culture and history surrounding Shakespeare and his theatre company.</p> The Winter’s Tale Show Schedule: <ul> <li>January 28: Act I</li> <li>February 4: Act II</li> <li>February 11: Act III</li> <li>February 18: Act IV</li> <li>February 25: Act V</li> <li>March: Live Q&A for Patreon Fellows</li> </ul> In Memory of Yeats <p><em>by W.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life, Angelina and Cindy interview James Banks. James is a civil servant, veteran, teacher, former academic and writer living in Austin, Texas. Prior to moving to the Lone Star State, he studied Renaissance Literature and taught at the University of Rochester. But it was only after leaving the academy that he rediscovered his passion for Shakespeare, Spenser, Chaucer and all things literary. His essays and reviews have appeared in The Weekly Standard, the Literati Quarterly, the Intercollegiate Review and elsewhere, but he is best known for being the brother of Thomas Banks and brother-in-law of Angelina Stanford.</p> <p>James talks about his childhood relationships with books and stories, and the massive leap he took from not being able to read to being a reader. He tells about his desire to be a teacher and his undergraduate experience. He also elaborates on how he came to his love of Shakespeare and Renaissance literature. James tells why he ended up leaving academia and how he rediscovered his love of literature. He also gives some examples of how he reads so much and makes the most of his time.</p> <h3>The Cross of Snow</h3> <p><em>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</em></p> <p>In the long, sleepless watches of the night,<br />    A gentle face — the face of one long dead —<br />    Looks at me from the wall, where round its head<br />    The night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.<br /> Here in this room she died; and soul more white<br />    Never through martyrdom of fire was led<br />    To its repose; nor can in books be read<br />    The legend of a life more benedight.<br /> There is a mountain in the distant West<br />    That, sun-defying, in its deep ravines<br />    Displays a cross of snow upon its side.<br /> Such is the cross I wear upon my breast<br />    These eighteen years, through all the changing scenes<br />    And seasons, changeless since the day she died.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Amazon Affiliate Links)</span></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3a2ltkZ">Big Wonderful Thing</a></em> by Stephen Harrigan</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2tO9J57">John Buchan by His Wife and Friends</a></em> by Susan Tweedsmuir</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2smlvmY">The Snow Child</a></em> by Eowyn Ivey</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2R6ze9M">Good Things Out of Nazareth: Uncollected Letters of Flannery O’Connor and Friends</a></em></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3a602PY">The Shooting Party</a></em> by Anton Chekhov</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/39ZOa26">The Sword of Honour Trilogy</a></em> by Evelyn Waugh</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2RbjoL1">Cultural Amnesia</a></em> by Clive James</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3a4AaEr">Pat Conroy</a></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Nj7r4Y">The Winter’s Tale</a></em> by William Shakespeare</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/35SpwgM">The Meaning of Shakespeare, Vol. 2</a></em> by Harold Goddard</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2R9LaHJ">Crime and Punishment</a></em> by Fyodor Dostoevsky</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2FKTFUk">Treasure Island</a></em> by Robert Louis Stevenson</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3adbkCm">Kidnapped</a></em> by Robert Louis Stevenson</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Nj9V3i">The Black Arrow</a></em> by Robert Louis Stevenson</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2tWa0CV">Robinson Crusoe</a></em> by Daniel Defoe</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2R8JUVj">Silas Marner</a></em> by George Eliot</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2TiX6dc">The Count of Monte Cristo</a></em> by Alexandre Dumas</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/30bI36q">One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</a></em> by Alexander Solzhenitsyn</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2sZFf05">The Scarlet Letter</a></em> by Nathaniel Hawthorne</p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2sml6B0">The Last of the Mohicans</a></em> by James Fennimore Cooper</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2tUm6fS">Anne Bradstreet</a></p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2To9aJQ">Eudora Welty</a></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2RnwdSP">The Bronze Bow</a></em> by Elizabeth George Speare</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2TiP2Ja">P.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this last episode of 2019, our Literary Life podcast hosts chat all about their past year in books, as well as what they hope to read in the coming year.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life, Angelina and Cindy interview Caitlin Bruce Beauchamp. In addition to being a homeschool graduate and a lover of the humanities, Caitlin is a busy wife and a mother of young children. In their conversation, Angelina, Cindy and Caitlin dive into the deep end from the start, discussing the purpose of beauty. They talk about Caitlin’s early reading life and how she came to love books. She shares how she had to learn some humility in her reading life as an adult.</p> <p>Angelina asks Caitlin how she finds the time to keep up her reading life amidst the responsibilities of mothering. Cindy and Caitlin talk about the importance of feeding your mind with other people’s ideas instead of taking the road to self-pity. The ladies discuss the timing of reading certain books to children and the great joy of watching children blossom as they listen to the right kinds of stories.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life, Angelina and Cindy interview Caitlin Bruce Beauchamp. In addition to being a homeschool graduate and a lover of the humanities, Caitlin is a busy wife and a mother of young children. In their conversation, Angelina, Cindy and Caitlin dive into the deep end from the start, discussing the purpose of beauty. They talk about Caitlin’s early reading life and how she came to love books. She shares how she had to learn some humility in her reading life as an adult.</p> <p>Angelina asks Caitlin how she finds the time to keep up her reading life amidst the responsibilities of mothering. Cindy and Caitlin talk about the importance of feeding your mind with other people’s ideas instead of taking the road to self-pity. The ladies discuss the timing of reading certain books to children and the great joy of watching children blossom as they listen to the right kinds of stories. Caitlin shares some of the books she reads to get out of a slump, as well as some other favorites and current reads.</p> Listen to The Literary Life: In the Bleak Midwinter <p><em>by Christina Rossetti</em></p> <p>In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan, Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone; Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow, In the bleak midwinter, long ago.</p> <p>Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain; Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign. In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.</p> <p>Enough for Him, whom cherubim, worship night and day, Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay; Enough for Him, whom angels fall before, The ox and ass and camel which adore.</p> <p>Angels and archangels may have gathered there, Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air; But His mother only, in her maiden bliss, Worshiped the beloved with a kiss.</p> <p>What can I give Him, poor as I am? If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb; If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part; Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.</p> Book List: <p><em>(Affiliate links are used in this content.)</em></p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/35LPZgK">The Reading Life</a></em> by C.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the final episode in our series on Jane Austen’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/36Bu77y">Northanger Abbey</a></em>. On The Literary Life Podcast today, Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks go chapter by chapter through the end of the book. First we see that Catherine finally comes to the realization that people are a mixture of good and bad, not all angels or villains. Cindy and Angelina point out the ways that Catherine does not follow the typical behavior of a heroine in a sentimental novel but is actually more sensible.</p> <p>Our hosts discuss General Tilney’s character and the similarities he shares with the Thorpes. Thomas points out the parallel sleepless night scenes and that Catherine now doesn’t need imaginary fears because she has real dangers to worry about. Austen parodies several more themes of the sentimental novels in this section, culminating with Henry Tilney’s unromantic proposal and the rather ordinary way in which everything gets worked out. Our hosts chuckle over Austen’s way of poking fun at closing with a moral.</p> <p>Come back next week for a special Literary Life of…. episode on Christmas Eve.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week's episode of The Literary Life, our host are back to discuss chapters 18-24 of Jane Austen's <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/38gZMga">Northanger Abbey</a>.</em> Cindy, Angelina and Thomas start out sharing the things that struck them as they read this particular section of the book. Angelina highlight's Catherine's growing ability to judge between appearances and reality. We see the great contrast between Henry Tilney with John Thorpe throughout these chapters, and we learn how different the abbey is from Catherine's sentimental expectations.</p> <p>Another point that Angelina brings to the forefront is that Catherine is looking for hidden dangers, but she doesn’t see the real, ordinary dangers of people like the Thorpes. Cindy highlights the way Austen points to some problems with equating English-ness with Christianity and exceptionalism. Thomas underlines Henry Tilney’s own moment of naïveté about what evils actually do exist, even in his own family. Throughout this whole section, one main theme is the undeceiving of Catherine, and this is a big turning point for her.</p> <h3>Thanks to Our Sponsor:</h3> <p>Located in beautiful Franklin Tennessee, <a href= "https://newcollegefranklin.org/">New College Franklin</a> is a four year Christian Liberal Arts college dedicated to excellent academics and discipling relationships among students and faculty.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today on The Literary Life Podcast, our hosts Angelina Stanford and Cindy Rollins, along with Thomas Banks, are discussing chapters 4-10 of <em>Northanger Abbey</em>. They start out talking about Jane Austen’s light touch and her gentle satirical way of pointing out the pros and cons of the novel. Angelina and Thomas bring up some of the historical and social context for this setting in Regency period Bath. They contrast the proper social code with the way the Thorpes behave and with Catherine Morland’s naïvetè and innocence. Cindy laughs about the way in which Jane Austen pokes fun at the novel’s form while writing a novel herself.</p> <p>After the critics’ early disgust for the novel, Jane Austen elevated the form to the point that they finally had to recognize the novel as a worthy work of literature. Cindy also brings up the idea that Austen may have partly written this novel because she wanted to talk with others about all these books that she references. They chat about all the things that occurred in history that led up to the availability of the novel to the masses, and to women in particular.</p> <p>Angelina observes that Austen plays with the tropes within a realistic situation in contrast to the over-the-top situations presented in sensational novels of the period.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, our hosts are pleased to begin talking about Jane Austen's <em>Northanger Abbey.</em> For this introduction episode Cindy Rollins and Angelina Stanford are joined by Thomas Banks. Together they discuss the advent of the novel as a form, as well as some predecessors of Austen.</p> <p>Angelina points out Austen's satirical voice in poking fun at the sentimental novel in the first few chapters. She also encourages us to look for the real life dangers the main characters encounter in contrast to those sensations of the popular sentimental or Gothic novel. Furthermore, we ought to notice who is reading various genres of literature and what that says about those characters.</p> <p>Cindy and Angelina also talk about Jane Austen's writing and her economy of style and the lasting quality of her books. Along with criticism of sensationalism, Austen also adds a healthy dose of criticism of the education given young women in her day. We also learn that this is a novel of development as we watch Catherine Moorland learn her way around the world. </p> <h3>Thanks to Our Sponsors-</h3> <p>Located in beautiful Franklin Tennessee, <a href= "https://newcollegefranklin.org/">New College Franklin</a> is a four year Christian Liberal Arts college dedicated to excellent academics and discipling relationships among students and faculty.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, our hosts are pleased to begin talking about Jane Austen's <em>Northanger Abbey.</em> For this introduction episode Cindy Rollins and Angelina Stanford are joined by Thomas Banks. Together they discuss the advent of the novel as a form, as well as some predecessors of Austen.</p> <p>Angelina points out Austen's satirical voice in poking fun at the sentimental novel in the first few chapters. She also encourages us to look for the real life dangers the main characters encounter in contrast to those sensations of the popular sentimental or Gothic novel. Furthermore, we ought to notice who is reading various genres of literature and what that says about those characters.</p> <p>Cindy and Angelina also talk about Jane Austen's writing and her economy of style and the lasting quality of her books. Along with criticism of sensationalism, Austen also adds a healthy dose of criticism of the education given young women in her day. We also learn that this is a novel of development as we watch Catherine Moorland learn her way around the world. </p> Thanks to Our Sponsors- <p>Located in beautiful Franklin Tennessee, <a href= "https://newcollegefranklin.org/">New College Franklin</a> is a four year Christian Liberal Arts college dedicated to excellent academics and discipling relationships among students and faculty.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's episode of The Literary Life, Angelina and Cindy interview poet, author and mother, Sally Thomas. You can find Sally and some of her writing at <a href= "http://www.sally-thomas.com/">www.sally-thomas.com</a>. Sally talks about her early reading life beginning with her memories of her family members reading themselves and to her. Cindy and Angelina ask her about her early forays into storytelling and writing. They discuss how literature and story are for everyone, including scientists and mathematicians, not just those who already have a bent toward reading. Sally shares about the influential teachers she had who fed her love of the written word.</p> <p>Angelina asks about how Sally approaches the balance between the reading life and the writing life. They also discuss how the seasons of Sally's family life shifted her focus somewhat away from active writing but were still fruitful in other ways. Cindy asks what Sally likes to read as a diversion, and Angelina brings up the topic of how to deal with a reading slump. They wrap up their chat reveling in the reward of homeschooling and teaching their own children, and what a joy it is both to raise readers but to become better readers themselves.</p> <p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p> <h3>Upcoming Events:</h3> <p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Angelina Stanford and Thomas Banks will be presenting a 3-day webinar series on Charles Dickens' <em>A Christmas Carol</em> on November 12-14. <a href= "http://angelinastanford.com/webinars/">Register here</a> to get lifetime access to the sessions.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Angelina will also be in Austin, TX at Christ Church on November 25, 2019.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today's episode of The Literary Life, Angelina and Cindy are once again joined by Thomas Banks. They discuss the last two chapters and the epilogue of <em>An Experiment in Criticism.</em> The first topic of conversation is Lewis' comments on poetry, including the un-literary reading of poetry and the importance of the sound of poetry. Angelina highlights Lewis' take on reading "bad books," and Cindy points out his warning against de-bunking. Thomas gives us some history on the reference to F. R. Leavis and his literary criticism.</p> <p>Angelina dives into her favorite part of this section, all about what makes good literary criticism. She recaps Lewis' own list of the types of literary commentators and historians who have helped him in his own reading. Angelina and Thomas both mention some of their favorite resources, including George Lyman Kittredge, Northrup Frye, J. W. MacKail and Dorothy Sayers. Another important point is to look for resources that point back to the text, not outside of the text.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Cindy and Angelina clear up some confusion about marginalia and what types of notes can help or hinder us in our reading. Finally, in discussing the epilogue, our hosts reiterate the purpose of reading as widening our souls and freeing ourselves to experience another person's perspective.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Angelina and Cindy open today's discussion of C. S. Lewis' <em>An Experiment in Criticism</em> with a recap of the terms that Lewis defines in chapters 5-7, starting with myth. They talk about what it means to have an "extra-literary" experience and how to cultivate the proper attitude of a good reader. Next Cindy and Angelina dig into the definition and benefits of literary fantasy versus the dangers of morbid fantasy. They talk about our deep need for stories of "the other" and have experiences with people and places that are not the same as our own.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Another big topic of conversation is the idea of literature being escapist, particularly fantasy and fairy stories.

Cindy brings up Lewis' comments on the comic and what relation that has to the current popularity of the graphic novel.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p> <p>Angelina and Cindy open today's discussion of C. S. Lewis' <em>An Experiment in Criticism</em> with a recap of the terms that Lewis defines in chapters 5-7, starting with myth. They talk about what it means to have an "extra-literary" experience and how to cultivate the proper attitude of a good reader. Next Cindy and Angelina dig into the definition and benefits of literary fantasy versus the dangers of morbid fantasy. They talk about our deep need for stories of "the other" and have experiences with people and places that are not the same as our own.</p> <p> </p> <p>Another big topic of conversation is the idea of literature being escapist, particularly fantasy and fairy stories. Angelina and Cindy talk about several things related to this idea: belief and disbelief, fiction versus nonfiction, and the wonder of childhood. Cindy brings up Lewis' comments on the comic and what relation that has to the current popularity of the graphic novel. Angelina also explains why we shouldn't be looking to directly relate to a character in a novel in order to get something out of the book.</p>  A Moment <p> </p> <p><em>by Mary Elizabeth Coleridge</em></p> <p> </p> <p>The clouds had made a crimson crown Above the mountains high.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>In this episode of The Literary Life, Cindy and Angelina interview Greg Wilbur. A composer, music minister, and the president of New College Franklin, Greg has also been friends with both Cindy and Angelina for several years. After sharing their commonplace quotes, and all the meaty discussion that surrounded the topics in those quotes, Cindy asks Greg when he became aware that he was a reader. Greg talks about growing up in a reading family, as well as the influence of his high school English teacher.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>During his college years, Greg minored in English, and he tells about his favorite professor and the great works he had the privilege to study. Cindy, Angelina and Greg chat about building a library without letting reading and book-buying becoming too much of an obsession.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p> <p>In this episode of The Literary Life, Cindy and Angelina interview Greg Wilbur. A composer, music minister, and the president of New College Franklin, Greg has also been friends with both Cindy and Angelina for several years. After sharing their commonplace quotes, and all the meaty discussion that surrounded the topics in those quotes, Cindy asks Greg when he became aware that he was a reader. Greg talks about growing up in a reading family, as well as the influence of his high school English teacher.</p> <p> </p> <p>During his college years, Greg minored in English, and he tells about his favorite professor and the great works he had the privilege to study. Cindy, Angelina and Greg chat about building a library without letting reading and book-buying becoming too much of an obsession. Greg also talks about his strategies to keep reading widely and get himself out of a reading slump. Angelina and Greg agree on the value of reading for pleasure as well as work and keeping track of what type of books you are dipping into daily. Cindy also asks Greg the million dollar question--to name a few of his favorite authors.</p> <p>   </p> Arabia <p> </p> <p>by Walter de la Mare</p> <p> </p> <p>Far are the shades of Arabia, Where the Princes ride at noon, 'Mid the verdurous vales and thickets, Under the ghost of the moon; And so dark is that vaulted purple Flowers in the forest rise And toss into blossom 'gainst the phantom stars Pale in the noonday skies.</p> <p> </p> <p>Sweet is the music of Arabia In my heart, when out of dreams I still in the thin clear mirk of dawn Descry her gliding streams; Hear her strange lutes on the green banks Ring loud with the grief and delight Of the dim-silked, dark-haired Musicians In the brooding silence of night.</p> <p> </p> <p>They haunt me — her lutes and her forests; No beauty on earth I see But shadowed with that dream recalls Her loveliness to me: Still eyes look coldly upon me, Cold voices whisper and say — 'He is crazed with the spell of far Arabia, They have stolen his wits away.'</p> <p> </p> Book List: <p>(Amazon Affiliate Links)</p> <p> </p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2ZIZq1x">The Order of Things</a></em> by James Schall</p> <p> </p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2PTIDEj">The Educated Imagination</a></em> by Northrup Frye</p> <p> </p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2N4qstb">The Measure of My Days</a></em> by Florida Scott-Maxwell</p> <p> </p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2ZEWOS2">How to Eat Fried Worms</a></em> by Thomas Rockwell</p> <p> </p> <p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2ZUFgNe">The Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this week’s episode of The Literary Life, Angelina Stanford and Cindy Rollins are joined once more by Thomas Banks for their discussion of “The Celestial Omnibus” by E. M. Forster. Angelina and Cindy tell why they love this short story so much and how it encapsulates their own ideas about literature. Thomas gives us some biographical background on E. M. Forster.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>The topic of today's discussion on The Literary Life is George Orwell's essay "Why I Write." Angelina and Cindy kick off the conversation about how much they each identify with Orwell's description of his childhood. In his story of learning to write, we see many aspects of a good education, even his inclination to imitate other authors. An important point Angelina brings up is Orwell's own struggle against the calling he felt to write, in contrast to having an ambition to do so. Angelina brings up a related story about musician <a href= "https://amzn.to/31IKdd3">Gregory Alan Isakov</a>, and Cindy reiterates the idea of why we need leisure in order to find our vocation.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Cindy and Angelina also bring out some of the qualities Orwell possessed that make a good writer. Maturity as a human being and as a master of a craft are crucial to certain forms of writing, as Orwell points out about his own work. Other topics of conversation include truth-telling in writing, the motives for writing according to Orwell, and the growing process of writers.</p> <p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:html /-->  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p> <h3><a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/summer-of-the-short-story-links/">Summer of the Short Story:</a></h3> <p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Ep 17: "The Celestial Omnibus" by E.

Also, don't forget to register for the <a href= "https://cindyrollins.net/back-to-school-webinar-conference/">Back to School online conference</a> on August 26-29, 2019 with Cindy and Angelina, as well as Thomas Banks and Adrienne Freas! Before getting into the short story discussion, Cindy and Angelina chat about what a "commonplace book" is and how they each go about recording quotes and thoughts, including the <a href= "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quote-block/id1448632377">QuoteBlock app</a>.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>First off, Angelina gives us a little background on the author Guy de Maupassant and some information on French naturalism. Then she digs into her thoughts on how this story is a fairy tale in reverse and what that might mean in context. Cindy points out the perfection of de Maupassant's writing and his economy of style. They also bring up some of the formal elements of the story, particularly the key role the reversal takes in the plot. The main themes they find in "The Necklace" touch on common human struggles with ambition, discontentment, loss, suffering and gratitude.</p> <p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p> <h3><a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/summer-of-the-short-story-links/">Summer of the Short Story:</a></h3> <p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Ep 16: "Why I Write" by George Orwell</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Ep 17: "The Celestial Omnibus" by E.

Also, don't forget to register for the <a href= "https://cindyrollins.net/back-to-school-webinar-conference/">Back to School online conference</a> on August 26-29, 2019 with Cindy and Angelina, as well as Thomas Banks and Adrienne Freas! Before getting into the short story discussion, Cindy and Angelina chat about what a "commonplace book" is and how they each go about recording quotes and thoughts, including the <a href= "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quote-block/id1448632377">QuoteBlock app</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p>First off, Angelina gives us a little background on the author Guy de Maupassant and some information on French naturalism. Then she digs into her thoughts on how this story is a fairy tale in reverse and what that might mean in context. Cindy points out the perfection of de Maupassant's writing and his economy of style. They also bring up some of the formal elements of the story, particularly the key role the reversal takes in the plot. The main themes they find in "The Necklace" touch on common human struggles with ambition, discontentment, loss, suffering and gratitude.</p> <p></p> <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/summer-of-the-short-story-links/">Summer of the Short Story:</a> <p> </p> <p>Ep 16: "Why I Write" by George Orwell</p> <p> </p> <p>Ep 17: "The Celestial Omnibus" by E.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Literary Life, Cindy and Angelina discuss Katherine Mansfield’s short story “The Garden Party.” Before starting today’s episode, we want to encourage you to register for the <a href= "https://cindyrollins.net/back-to-school-webinar-conference/">Back to School online conference</a> coming up on August 26-29, 2019!</p> <p>After a great chat over their commonplace quotes, Angelina and Cindy dig into this week’s short story, “The Garden Party.” They start with how Cindy found this story and the connections she was making to <em><a href="https://amzn.to/30Yl9OT">Little Women</a></em>. Angelina gives a brief biographical sketch of Katherine Mansfield and highlights how Mansfield’s own illness and death give us insight into how she deals with death in this story. Angelina walks us through how she looks at the use of figurative language and images, such as the Garden of Eden. They also touch on “The Garden Party” having the same structure of moving toward a moment of epiphany that we saw in “Araby.”</p> <p>Cindy brings up the disconnect between the world of the women at home and the working people outside the home, as well as between the classes in this story. They talk about the importance of Laura’s new hat as a symbol of one type of person she can become. Another image that Angelina and Cindy take a look at is the descent from the garden into darkness. They discuss the parallels from the beginning of the story and the end of the story, as well as Laura’s movement from innocence to experience, from blindness to sight.</p> <h3><a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/summer-of-the-short-story-links/">Summer of the Short Story:</a></h3> <p>Ep 14: “Adventures of a Shilling” by Joseph Addison</p> <p>Ep 15: “The Necklace” by Guy de Maupassant</p> <p>Ep 16: “Why I Write” by George Orwell</p> <p>Ep 17: “The Celestial Omnibus” by E.

Near the snow, near the sun, in the highest fields, See how these names are fêted by the waving grass And by the streamers of white cloud And whispers of wind in the listening sky. The names of those who in their lives fought for life, Who wore at their hearts the fire’s centre. Born of the sun, they travelled a short while toward the sun And left the vivid air signed with their honour.</p> <p class="has-small-font-size">Copyright © 1955 by Stephen Spender.

She also gives several examples of the “penny dreadful.” Cindy and Angelina discuss why they agree with Chesterton that people need these simple, even formulaic stories. They remind us that childhood is a time for good books, not a time to worry about reading all the “Great Books.”</p> <p>Another topic that Cindy and Angelina chat about is the importance of developing imagination. They talk about the truth that fiction and story-telling are necessary parts of human culture. Cindy highlights the importance of the heroic adventure stories for boys. Angelina brings out the point that the elite critic is out of touch with the masses who long for stories of good winning over evil.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of The Literary Life, Cindy and Angelina interview their long time friend and fellow reader, Kelly Cumbee. Kelly is a wife and homeschooling mother of seven who has given herself a highly literary education. Together they discuss how Kelly started reading at a very young age and the kinds of books she loved as a child. Kelly talks about her love for Edmund Spenser and how she began reading Spenser with her children. Angelina asks about Kelly's background and how she makes connections throughout her conversations and her reading. Another topic of conversation is how Kelly made time for books throughout the different seasons of life and how she didn't really start reading "hard books" until later in life. They wrap up the conversation discussing what Kelly is currently reading and with more encouragement to read widely and make connections.</p> <h3><a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/summer-of-the-short-story-links/">Summer of the Short Story</a>:</h3> <p>Ep 11: "Araby" by James Joyce</p> <p>Ep 12: “A Defence of Penny Dreadfuls” by G.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of The Literary Life, Cindy and Angelina interview their long time friend and fellow reader, Kelly Cumbee. Kelly is a wife and homeschooling mother of seven who has given herself a highly literary education. Together they discuss how Kelly started reading at a very young age and the kinds of books she loved as a child. Kelly talks about her love for Edmund Spenser and how she began reading Spenser with her children. Angelina asks about Kelly's background and how she makes connections throughout her conversations and her reading. Another topic of conversation is how Kelly made time for books throughout the different seasons of life and how she didn't really start reading "hard books" until later in life. They wrap up the conversation discussing what Kelly is currently reading and with more encouragement to read widely and make connections.</p> <a href= "https://www.theliterary.life/summer-of-the-short-story-links/">Summer of the Short Story</a>: <p>Ep 11: "Araby" by James Joyce</p> <p>Ep 12: “A Defence of Penny Dreadfuls” by G.
