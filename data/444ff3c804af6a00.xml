There's a small error at 19:30, I say &quot;divide the total by 1/2&quot;, but of course meant to say &quot;multiply...&quot;

Curious why a sphere's surface area is exactly four times its shadow?

If you liked this topic you'll also enjoy Mathologer's videos on very interesting cube shadow facts:
Part 1: https://youtu.be/rAHcZGjKVvg
Part 2: https://youtu.be/cEhLNS5AHss

I first heard this puzzle in a problem-solving seminar at Stanford, but the general result about all convex solids was originally proved by Cauchy.

The Romeo-Juliet example is based on this essay by Steven Strogatz:

The book shown at the start is Vladimir Arnold's (excellent) textbook on ordinary differential equations.

The book by my friend Matt Cook about paradoxes mentioned at the end:
https://amzn.to/3aBrEzg

On the topic, I can't help also mentioning another paradox book I'm rather fond of by Bunch:
https://amzn.to/3mBDSKE

Another video on Bayes' theorem:
https://youtu.be/HZGCoVF3YvM

*As mentioned in the on-screen note at the end, while the terms &quot;Bayes Factor&quot; and &quot;Likelihood Ratio&quot; refer to the same ratio in this setting, where Bayes rule is used on the probability of an event with only two possible outcomes (you either have the disease or you don't), they do take on divergent meanings in more general contexts.  Namely, if you have a continuous parameter you are trying to estimate, the two terms reflect two alternate approaches you can use in comparing hypotheses.  In fact, some people take the phrase &quot;Bayes factor&quot; to _specifically_ refer to its use in this more continuous context.

If you want more details, Wikipedia actually has a really nice example discussing the difference:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor#Example

This post has some nice discussion of the distinction:
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/27345/likelihood-ratio-vs-bayes-factor

Timetable:

5:53 - The Bayes factor
11:00 - The snazzy Bayes rule
14:42 - Contrast with the usual formula

These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim&#13;
&#13;
If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.&#13;

If you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then &quot;add subtitles/cc&quot;.  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.&#13;
