To bolster the point Adam shares with Dr. Drew some video of the Mayor of New Orleans commenting on recent stats declaring New Orleans the murder capitol of America. After marveling at the lack of an answer that was provided by an elected Mayor of a major city they turn to the phones and speak to a caller with a question about Bill O&#39;Reilly and his habits when interacting with his guests. As the show wraps up they speak to one more caller with a question about the hysteria that seems to be surrounding this year&#39;s flu season.

They also discuss the current propensity that Americans have to break into groups and feeling a sense of pride simply by being a member of a group and how that is hampering people from accomplishment. They also discuss the idea of being &#39;fulfilled&#39; by your work and how that isn&#39;t what one should be striving for when it comes to employment and how we need to reframe the thinking.

They also examine the instinct that exists in many people to default to a 'what's in it for me' mentality and how damaging that is to the people with that attitude. They then turn to the phones and speak with a caller who is perplexed by a past failed relationship that still vexes him to this day and is looking for some insight. They also speak to a caller who has suffered from all three variants of Covid and was surprised that Omicron hit him hardest.
