<p>This week, we speak with financial historian Edward Chancellor. He is currently a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews and an occasional contributor to the Wall Street Journal and MoneyWeek. In 2008, he received the George Polk Award for financial reporting. Chancellor is the author of “<em><a class="gtrackexternal" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452281806/thebigpictu09-20">Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation</a></em>.” His new book “<em><a class="gtrackexternal" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B09NS1CZ7W/thebigpictu09-20">The Price of Time: The Real Story of Interest</a></em>” is a nominee for FT’s 2022 Business Book of the Year.</p>
<p>We discuss Chancellor&#8217;s history as an analyst interested in speculative bubbles, which led him to write a research paper on valuations and why the dotcom bubble looks a lot like other historical bubbles. That eventually was expanded into <em><a class="gtrackexternal" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452281806/thebigpictu09-20">Devil Take the Hindmost</a></em> published in 1999, a few quarters before the bubble popped.</p>
<p>Chancellor notes “Interest rates are the most important signal in a market-based economy and the universal price affecting all others.” Rates reflect the price of time, which is scarce and has value. They affect everything from bond yields to consumer spending to stock returns.</p>
<p>A list of his favorite books is here; A transcript of our conversation is <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2022/11/transcript-edward-chancellor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available here</a> Tuesday.</p>

<p>• <strong>Bitcoin mining in the crypto crash — the mining companies’ creative accounting</strong>: Bitcoin miners used to be ruthless economic agents, in it for the money. They knew how volatile crypto was, so they sold their coins as soon as they mined them to cover power bills and other business expenses. As some point, miners’ business model changed from selling bitcoin to holding bitcoin — and borrowing against it. (<a href="https://amycastor.com/2022/08/04/bitcoin-mining-in-the-crypto-crash-the-mining-companies-creative-accounting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Castor</a>)</p>

<p>• <strong>When Netflix and HBO Turned on Each Other, They Forged a New Era of Television</strong>: The defining rivalry of the streaming-TV era began with an insult and a sneak attack. An exclusive adaptation from It’s Not TV: The Spectacular Rise, Revolution, and Future of HBO.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since it is late on a Friday, I thought I might share some quick thoughts about the week.</p>
<p>I have been wondering, more than usual, about the disconnect between what we see in falling prices and the Federal Reserve’s anti-inflation actions. It is difficult to reconcile Fed rhetoric with the actual price of Goods.</p>
<p>One can reach only so many conclusions: Perhaps the Fed is right and everybody else is wrong. This suggests that rates need to be appreciably higher and stay that way for longer. Or, the Fed could be wrong and many others are right: Inflation has already peaked and reversed but higher rates are already causing real and unnecessary suffering; keep tightening but raise unemployment, slow consumer spending, and perhaps even cause a recession.</p>
<p>There is a real possibility that the Fed&#8217;s diagnosis is correct. However, this will only be known in the fullness of time, after inflation is tamed and the economy does not suffer too greatly from the cure.</p>
<p>That presents a far less interesting scenario for discussion purposes than its opposite: That the Fed is wrong and is undertaking a deeply misguided policy.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to become a scold on this issue (although I suspect it might be too late). So instead, consider a far more provocative framing. As a thought experiment, ponder the ways that the Federal Reserve could be wrong, either in its understanding of the current situation or in its response thereto.</p>
<p>I break it down into five broad categories:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. The Fed is wrong about inflation, magnitude and/or direction.<br />
2. The Fed is right about inflation but misunderstands the underlying causes.<br />
3. The Fed is right about inflation but lacks the appropriate tools to address the 2020 inflation cycle.<br />
4. We don’t know if the Fed is right about anything – Economics is at best a squishy and imperfect soft science.<br />
5. The Fed is indifferent about inflation, but is being aggressive in order to protect it&#8217;s institutional reputation.</p></blockquote>
<p>You could write a treatise on each of these, explaining how each occurred and what they mean for the economy and markets. The ramifications are significant.</p>
<p>Think of each idea as a leaping-off point for further discussion. What is already reflected in stock and bond prices? Does consensus usually develop early or late with these sorts of issues? If the FOMC is right, how long will it be before we know? Before inflation falls? Before rates drop? What tools are they missing? When does it become obvious they were right or wrong?</p>
<p>Regardless, it’s a worthwhile exercise to wargame Fed actions, and consider what they might mean to your portfolio and/or personal finances.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>My end-of-week morning <del>train</del> WFH reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>• <strong>The rise of the &#8216;chief remote officer&#8217;</strong> While many firms have pivoted to hybrid or remote work in an ad-hoc way, others are creating a new role to oversee their workplace transformation. (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20221027-the-rise-of-the-chief-remote-officer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC</a>)</p>
<p>• <strong>Everyone seems to hate daylight saving time. Do we even need it, and why is it so hard to get rid of?</strong> Shifting the clocks messes with people’s circadian rhythms — making everyone groggy, cranky and sometimes dangerously off their game. (<a href="https://www.grid.news/story/360-brief/2022/11/03/everyone-seems-to-hate-daylight-saving-time-do-we-even-need-it-and-why-is-it-so-hard-to-get-rid-of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grid</a>) <em>see also</em> <strong>Rejoice in the End of Daylight Saving Time</strong>: It’s the most wonderful day of the year! (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/11/daylight-saving-time-ending-25-hour-sunday/671984/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Atlantic</a>) <em>see also</em> <strong>When Does Daylight-Saving Time End in 2022? What to Know Before the Clocks Change</strong>: Some states are pushing to end clock changes because of growing evidence they hurt people’s health. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-does-daylight-saving-time-end-in-2022-what-to-know-before-the-clocks-change-11667509281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>)</p>
<p>• <strong>Revisiting the Case Against Value Investing</strong>: This fact that value works better around recessions in and of itself is not necessarily a problem for value. Where the potential problem comes in is in a situation where we have a permanent reduction in the number of recessions. It would be bad for value if it gets much of its outperformance during these periods &#8212; and we have had fewer recessions in recent decades. (<a href="https://blog.validea.com/revisiting-the-case-against-value-investing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Validea</a>)</p>
<p>• <strong>The First Biodegradable Water Bottle Is Coming, For Real This Time</strong>: With backers including James Murdoch and Diplo, Cove says its sustainable water bottle will retail at $2.99 a pop. (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-03/is-there-a-biodegradable-water-bottle-one-startup-says-yes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green</a>)</p>
<p>• <strong>The Difference Between Amateurs &amp; Professionals</strong>. &#8220;Amateurs attribute success to skill and failure to luck. Professionals recognize the role of skill and luck in every outcome. They focus on the controllable factors. They create an environment where luck is more likely to strike.&#8221; (<a href="https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-difference-between-amateurs-professionals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curiosity Chronicle</a>)</p>
<p>• <strong>‘He is poised to open the floodgates’: can Twitter survive Elon Musk – or even thrive? </strong>Since buying it, the billionaire has wasted no time shaking up the struggling social media firm, cutting staff and introducing fees. But can he make the platform matter again – or will it become a hellscape of hateful content and misinformation? (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/03/he-is-poised-to-open-the-floodgates-can-twitter-survive-elon-musk-or-even-thrive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guardian</a>)</p>
<p>• <strong>Will we ever… live in city-sized buildings?</strong> The cities of science fiction are frequently portrayed as all-encompassing and self-contained structures, but how feasible is it build a colossal city in a building? (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221028-will-we-ever-live-in-city-sized-buildings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC</a>)</p>
<p>• <strong>The US Midterms Will Decide If the 2024 Election Can Be Stolen</strong>: Republican candidates on the ballot around the country who deny Joe Biden Won in 2020 are pushing changes to election laws that would make it easier to dispute the results in the next presidential election (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-01/midterm-elections-2022-5-key-races-that-could-impact-election-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>)</p>
<p>• <strong>The Universe Is Not Locally Real, and the Physics Nobel Prize Winners Proved It</strong>: Elegant experiments with entangled light have laid bare a profound mystery at the heart of reality. (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-universe-is-not-locally-real-and-the-physics-nobel-prize-winners-proved-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scientific American</a>)</p>
<p>• <strong>The Too-Muchness of Bono</strong>: In Dublin with the irrepressible U2.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>BMW’s image as the &#8220;ultimate driving machine&#8221; was built atop the sportiness of its <a href="https://www.supercars.net/blog/1973-bmw-3-0-csi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-performance</a> coupe models.</p>
<p>The “sharknose” E9 was BMW’s elegant <a href="https://www.garageandsocial.com/car/1973-bmw-3-0-cs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flagship coupe</a> sold in the US from 1968-1975. The E9 used an electronic fuel injection system that was state-of-the-art technology back then (most cars were still using carburetors). 200 HP made the 3.0 CSi really fast (at least for those days). The 3.0 CSi came with a 4-speed manual (this one was swapped to a 5-speed during a later renovation).</p>
<p>That speed and power came at a cost. MSRP was $10,634, &#8212; that&#8217;s $71,086.85 in today&#8217;s dollars. It was fast but pricey for its time.</p>
<p>2741 were built in 1973, making these relatively rare and sought after by collectors. Depending on the condition, <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/bmw/e9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prices range</a> from $25,000 to $250,000. The lovely example below sold recently for $140,000.</p>

<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the FOMC increased the Fed Funds Rate another 75 bps yesterday, to 3.75-4.0%. Markets have given back much of October&#8217;s gains fairly quickly.</p>
<p>I have been turning this over slowly in my mind, trying to assess their thinking here. I am not sure what models they use, what data they think is most important, what impact their actions will have, and perhaps most importantly, exactly what they are hoping to accomplish.</p>
<p>I direct your attention to the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Vyo3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chart of CPI and Fed Funds Rate</a> above.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care what your personal theories on monetary policy might be, your thoughts on Milton Friedman, or who you plan on voting for next week. Instead, I challenge anyone to look at that chart and tell me this crew has the slightest idea WTF they are doing.</p>
<p>In March 2001, CPI ticked through the Fed&#8217;s 2% inflation target, and their reaction was . . . nothing. They remained on the emergency footing of zero. A few months later, CPI was over 4%; by June, it was over 5%, October, higher than 6%, and they finished 2021 with CPI over 7%. And still, crickets. It wasn&#8217;t until March 2022, 2 years after the pandemic panic, that the FOMC deemed it ok to start raising rates.</p>
<p>The conclusion which disturbs me is that the very same Fed that was way late in recognizing that inflation was spiking is now way late in recognizing that it has peaked and reversed. The results could include job losses, falling home values, slowing consumer spending, and perhaps even a painful recession.</p>

<blockquote><p>• <strong>The messy true story of the last time we beat inflation</strong>: The usual narrative about the “Volcker shock” leaves a lot out — and policymakers risk learning the wrong lessons.

<p>• <strong>There Has to Be a Better Way to Lose $800 Billion</strong>: Many companies change strategies because they lost money. Meta is losing money because it changed strategies. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/meta-facebook-metaverse-mark-zuckerberg-11667424987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>) <em>but see also</em> <strong>Ways to think about a metaverse</strong>: Your boss wants a metaverse strategy, but what would that be, and what does metaverse even mean? If we strip away the noise, what can we say about this, and what can we predict? (<a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2022/10/31/ways-to-think-about-a-metaverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benedict Evans</a>)</p>

(<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/esg-initiatives-investors-survey-11666975292" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>)</p>
<p>• <strong>Mortgage Rates Too High? (Blame the Fed, Wall Street and Your Neighbor)</strong> Lenders use several bits of data to set mortgage rates, including trading moves by investors. Without market volatility, the rate could be under 7 percent. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/business/mortgage-rates-fed-wall-street.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times</a>)</p>
<p>• <strong>Can the Fed fight inflation without triggering a meltdown?</strong> After the recent turmoil in Britain, anxiety about the stability of the financial system is rising alongside interest rates.

(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/upshot/abortion-pills-mail-overseas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times</a>)</p>
<p>• <strong>The right’s loudest voices have shaken off the burden of being responsible</strong>: In the Republican establishment of 2015, when Trump announced, there was still a lingering belief that elected officials shouldn’t simply peddle conspiracy theories or misrepresent reality. That belief had eroded in the post-tea-party era, certainly, but it lingered. Until Trump showed that abandoning it entirely offered a different set of rewards. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/01/kari-lake-fox-news-tucker-carlson-falsehoods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a>)</p>

<p>While the FOMC was doing its thing (more on that tomorrow), I stumbled across the fascinating chart above from PIIE. They note:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economic integration rebounded after the Second World War and continued to increase for the latter half of the 20th century. An embrace of economic liberalization saw the removal of trade barriers in large emerging markets and led to unprecedented levels of international economic cooperation, peaking in 2008 at 60.1 percent.</p>
<p>Since this era of peak globalization, economic integration has been in retreat, falling to 57.2 percent on the openness index in 2021. Since 2008, China and the United States have turned toward erecting mutual trade barriers that have disrupted supply chains and prompted the spread of trade barriers elsewhere. Under President Xi Jinping and President Joseph R. Biden Jr., China and the United States are seeking greater self-sufficiency in technologically-advanced sectors.</p></blockquote>

<p>• <strong>Why Today’s Inflation is Not a Repeat of the 1970s</strong>: I’m not a huge fan of the Federal Reserve’s current policy choices.

<p>Today and tomorrow the Federal Reserve will hold its 7th <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">Federal Open Market Committee</a> meeting of the year. It is given that we will see a 75-basis point increase Wednesday, but what gets said about the meeting on December 13-14 is even more important. The hopes are the Fed indicates a slower pace of rate increases, perhaps as low as 50 basis points in December.</p>
<p>Arguably, even that is too much.</p>
<p>The FOMC&#8217;s ability to impact consumers and inflation has proven mixed so far. Goods prices have been falling while Service prices have been stickier. Perhaps the reason is the 2020s form of inflation differs so radically from historical parallels. A unique combination of pandemic fiscal stimulus plus massive supply chain snarls has created a perfect storm. Hence, the current circumstances do not lend themselves to an easy fix.</p>
<p>But that does not mean the Fed’s actions won’t have long-term consequences for the economy. Consider the chart above: It shows the 40-year downtrend in 30-Year Fixed Rate mortgages to have been decisively broken. In January 2021, those mortgages were as low as 2.65%; today they are over 7%. So far, it has led to a <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2022/10/home-buyer-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collapse in home buyer traffic</a>. It is already crimping homebuyers dramatically.</p>
<p>But not all home buyers: About <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-31/caution-for-asian-stocks-before-central-bank-moves-markets-wrap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25% of homes purchased nationally</a> are bought for cash; it&#8217;s closer to 50% in places like Manhattan. And that was under normal, pre-pandemic circumstances. Today, it is closer to a <a href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2022/9/17/23357235/housing-market-cash-house-purchases-interest-rates">third nationwide</a>. As you might surmise, cash purchases tend to be the more expensive homes purchased by the wealthiest buyers; when more modest middle-class homes get purchased for all cash, it tends to be by large investors.</p>
<p>Which is par for the course for the Federal Reserve. The massive wealth gap expansion we saw in the post-GFC era was driven in large part by the Fed. Instead of running the banks through restructuring, they were kept alive through the policy of ZIRP. Making the cost of capital practically nothing had all sorts of ramifications, not the least of which was to make risk assets – stocks bonds real estate, etc. – worth appreciably more. ZIRP and QE made the wealthy wealthier.</p>
<p>As I have said before, <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2022/10/why-is-the-fed-always-late-to-the-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once the emergency ends</a>, so too should <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2022/07/why-recessions-matter-to-investors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rates at emergency levels</a>. That was evident in 2021 (perhaps even late 2020). The post-pandemic inflation would eventually work itself out as supplies come online and the fiscal stimulus wore off.</p>
<p>But that is not what we have happening today: The FOMC, having lowered rates to zero and kept them there too long, is now committing the opposite mistake of raising them too quickly and to levels that are too high.</p>
<p>And while we know the FOMC rates are below official CPI levels, we also know that CPI is like all models – an imperfect depiction of reality. It reports price increases with a very distinct lag and has trouble managing rapidly rising or falling home prices.</p>
<p>Regardless, the FOMC seems to believe that middle-class purchases of homes and automobiles are where they can best strangle inflation. This is needlessly damaging at best, and ineffective at worst.</p>
<p>Jerome Powell should know better&#8230;</p>
