      <itunes:summary>Light a candle, Richies - the end of the Brady-Bündch may be near. Following months of marital tension over Tom Brady’s decision to “un-retire” from football and then return to the NFL, it looks like supermodel Gisele Bündchen is ready to throw in the towel. The power couple has apparently faced splitsville at other times in their 14-year marriage, but this time it may be for real. Sources say that Tom and Gisele have both hired divorce lawyers. So after years of prioritizing football over family, and with time running out on his playing career, does Tom have a final Hail Mary move to try and save his marriage?

        <![CDATA[<p>Queen Elizabeth II has been laid to rest. In the wake of her death 10 days ago, the Royal Family has reunited for various ceremonies and services to pay their final respects, along with a mourning nation.

Over the weekend, King Charles was heckled in Wales, Harry and Meghan were uninvited from a pre-funeral event, and an ongoing feud between Prince William and Harry grabbed headlines. So now that the matriarch of the royals is gone, will this fragmented family fall apart, or somehow keep itself together?</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

We also talk to Alexandra Deane, the director of the documentary This is Paris. Who is the real Paris? Does Paris even know? And how do you film a documentary about someone who’s still finding herself?
