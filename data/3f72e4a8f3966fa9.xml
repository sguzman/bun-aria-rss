<p>NEW YORK: In a major development, New York City Council has passed a landmark legislation to improve equity, inclusion and diversity in the FDNY.</p>
<p>New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said: &#8220;By passing this package of bills today, we hope to move the FDNY forward to achieving a workforce fully reflective of the diversity of our city,&#8221;</p>
<p>The legislation package requires the FDNY to report on its recruitment and retention efforts of firefighters of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>The department would also have to survey firehouses and ensure they are equipped to serve a mixed gender workforce.</p>
<p>The council speaker says currently only 8% of firefighters are Black, 2% are Asian and only 1% are women.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.vosa.tv/archives/27359">NYC council passes a landmark legislation improve equity, inclusion and diversity in the FDNY</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.vosa.tv">VOSA</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>GUJRANWALA: Former Pakistani Prime Minister and Chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Imran Khan was shot and wounded in the leg, in an attack on his protest march in Gujranwala, in the country’s Punjab province.</strong></p>
<p>One of Khan’s supporters was killed in the shooting in Wazirabad, officials said. Several leaders of PTI were also injured.</p>

<p>Imran Khan was leading his party&#8217;s anti-government long march toward Islamabad from Lahore for the country&#8217;s &#8220;real independence&#8221;</p>
<p>Khan is actively mobilizing the masses since his government was ousted through a parliamentary no-confidence move a few months back. However, he has adopted a clear stance and alleged that his government was toppled through an international conspiracy, facilitated by local players. According to Khan, the incumbent PML-N-led coalition government of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) was installed under the same international conspiracy.</p>

<p>PTI senior leader Senator Faisal Javed, who was injured when a bullet grazed his face, said that a party worker was killed during the attack, while another was severely injured. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack on 70-year-old cricketer-turned-politician.</p>

<p>Police released a video confession of a man they arrested who they say had attempted to kill the former prime minister. It was unclear under what conditions the interview was carried out but in it the man is asked by police why he opened fire, and replies: &#8220;He was misguiding the people. I wanted to kill him. I tried to kill him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The head of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital has said Khan is in stable conditions and conscious. Speaking to reporters, Faisal Sultan said there were bullet fragments in the PTI leader’s leg and his tibia bone was chipped. “This is only the initial assessment, and we are taking him to the operation theatre for detailed evaluation,” he said. Sultan added that a four-member medical board had been formed to monitor and evaluate Khan’s health.</p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s President Arif Alvi called the attack on Imran Khan a &#8220;heinous assassination attempt&#8221;. &#8220;I thank Allah that he is safe but injured with few bullets in his leg &amp; hopefully non-critical,&#8221; he tweeted.</p>
<p>Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the attack and said: &#8220;I strongly condemn the firing at Imran Khan&#8217;s rally. An immediate report of the incident has been sought from the Interior Minister. We pray for the speedy recovery of Imran and other injured. The Federation will provide all possible support to the Punjab government in the security/investigation of the incident. Violence should have no place in national politics,&#8221;</p>
<p>Foreign Minister and Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari &#8220;strongly condemned&#8221; the attack on Imran Khan and prayed for his swift recovery.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the attack on Khan and his supporters was “completely unacceptable.” “I strongly condemn this violence. It has no place in politics, in any democracy, or in our society,” he said. “I’m wishing a speedy recovery to Imran and all who were injured today.”</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.vosa.tv/archives/27350">Assassination attempt on Imran Khan, the Ex-Pakistan PM shot and wounded at his anti-government long-march</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.vosa.tv">VOSA</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>New York: New York City Election is going to take place on Tuesday, November 8<sup>th</sup>. This election is dubbed as ‘critical’ and the ‘last’ chance to join millions of New Yorkers in making their voices heard and cast their ballots. The outcome of these elections will affect the future of New Yorkers, their economy, education, healthcare, and more.</strong></p>
<p>The polls will be open from 6:00 am to9:00 pm. People who can’t vote on Tuesday can also vote early in person! Early voting polls will be open through Sunday, November 6<sup>th</sup>, as per the NYC government. Your poll site may have changed, so it’s important to check your poll site location and its hours before you vote at <a href="http://nycvotes.org/">nycvotes.org</a>.</p>
<p>This year, voting is more important than ever. In every single race, your vote matters – from the Governor and Attorney General to your Congress people and state representatives. We’re deciding who will lead the state into the future, and what kind of future New Yorkers want for our state. Also, four ballot proposals are on the back of your ballot, so remember to flip yours over. All U.S. citizens aged 18 and older who have registered are eligible to vote. Millions of New Yorkers in going to the polls and getting the change they want to see done. Those who are not currently registered to vote can register for next year’s election on that website as well. All New Yorkers have the right to vote in their language. You may bring an interpreter to the voting booth—it can be a friend, a family member or a poll worker, but it can&#8217;t be your employer or union representative.</p>
<p>The Civic Engagement Commission has said that it will be providing interpretation services in select languages and poll sites on Saturday, November 5th, and Sunday, November 6<sup>th</sup>, and on Election Day, Tuesday, November 8th. Our democracy relies on individuals with different opinions coming together to find solutions. Voting is one crucial way we do this, and having discussions with each other is another. Recently, the Administration held a summit on criminal justice. It brought experienced defense lawyers, judges, district attorneys, advocates, and law enforcement officials together in search of solutions to a goal we all share: keeping New Yorkers safe and ensuring justice for all. There is a lot that this group disagrees on, and each individual groups will keep pursuing their individual goals.</p>
<p>But there is also much we agree on. Both public safety and justice are prerequisites to prosperity, and we need to do a better job on both. No one should be afraid of crime on the subway, and no one accused of committing a crime should have to wait for months to get a hearing. The discussion helped participants find common ground on important improvements to the system, and over the coming weeks and months, more conversations and turning are expected for actionable solutions that will make New York a safer city. Working toward a more perfect city and country is never easy. It takes all of us engaging in good faith conversation, expressing our views, and casting our ballots. See you at the polls on Tuesday.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.vosa.tv/archives/27344">The outcome of NYC polls to affect the future of New Yorkers</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.vosa.tv">VOSA</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>She said the domestic violence victims should raise their voice against the crime and they must not keep mum over this grim issue.</p>
<p>Representatives of the District Attorney&#8217;s Office of Brooklyn Borough and other officials informed the women participants about their rights and legal procedures.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/vlcsnap-2022-10-26-20h19m13s137.jpg?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-27245" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/vlcsnap-2022-10-26-20h19m13s137.jpg?resize=300%2C170&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="170" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/vlcsnap-2022-10-26-20h19m13s137.jpg?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/vlcsnap-2022-10-26-20h19m13s137.jpg?resize=768%2C435&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/vlcsnap-2022-10-26-20h19m13s137.jpg?resize=390%2C220&amp;ssl=1 390w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/vlcsnap-2022-10-26-20h19m13s137.jpg?w=848&amp;ssl=1 848w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> </a></p>
<p>They said that domestic violence does not only include physical torture, but also sexual harassment, speaking ill of women, and threatening is also a violation of the law.</p>
<p>In an address to the participants, the chairperson of Pakistani American Skilled Women Atia Shahnaz said that domestic violence is not largely considered a violation of right in the South Asian community.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/vlcsnap-2022-10-26-20h18m23s983.jpg?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-27246" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/vlcsnap-2022-10-26-20h18m23s983.jpg?resize=300%2C170&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="170" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/vlcsnap-2022-10-26-20h18m23s983.jpg?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/vlcsnap-2022-10-26-20h18m23s983.jpg?resize=768%2C435&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/vlcsnap-2022-10-26-20h18m23s983.jpg?resize=390%2C220&amp;ssl=1 390w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/vlcsnap-2022-10-26-20h18m23s983.jpg?w=848&amp;ssl=1 848w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
