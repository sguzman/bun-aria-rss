      <itunes:summary>Everyone in Slovakia should go to Modra at least once in their life, says American teacher, Grace, who has lived in Modra for seven months (and has been the only American there, apparently). The once royal town was the home of one of the most shining personalities of the history of Slovakia, Ludovit Stur, who is also responsible for how difficult the Slovak language is. Modra is just a short bus or car-ride away from the capital and is a destination for wine lovers and those partial to (or curious about) majolica.

      <itunes:summary>Slovakia's only investigative reporting TV show has been &quot;suspended&quot; by the management of the current leadership of the public-service broadcaster, RTVS, causing concerns among local and international media freedom watchdogs. 

The lack of workers on the Slovak labour market might result in companies leaving the country. While businesses generally refused such scenario, rumours have surfaced now that Samsung, running production plants in western-Slovak towns of Galanta and Sereď, might be contemplating its possible departure - unless the government makes the access of foreign workers to the Slovak labour market easier. 

Despite problems with labour force, Slovakia remains the world leader in automotive production. Last year, the country’s automotive plants produced more than one million cars, the highest rate per capita in the world.</itunes:summary>
