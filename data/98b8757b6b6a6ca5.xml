   <media:description>Original video on Rumble: https://rumble.com/v1ahvia-interview-with-christopher-rufo-what-are-his-core-beliefs-and-goals.html

Whether one agrees or disagrees with his work, there is no denying that the writer, documentarian, and activist Chris Rufo has had an extremely significant impact on our political discourse, debates and even our laws. Even large liberal outlets which seek to demonize him -- such as the New Yorker and New York Times -- acknowledge the immensely consequential nature of his work, especially on debates about what is taught in schools about race and LGBT issues. With this significance in mind, I spoke to Rufo about his core worldview and the goals of his political work. It was a spirited and in-depth discussions that focused on some of our differences and the questions many have about his aspirations.</media:description>

Original Rumble Video: https://rumble.com/v17tex8-watch-david-miranda-talks-to-stella-assange-about-julians-case.html

On Tuesday in Brazil, the country celebrated Press Freedom Day. Assange has become a national hero in Brazil, with politicians across the spectrum urging his freedom and condemning the ongoing US/UK attempt to imprison him for life under the Espionage Act. My husband David Miranda, a member of the Brazilian Congress, spoke to Assange's wife about the recent developments in the case, what people are the world can do to help Assange, and the toll it has taken on his health and his family.</media:description>

From her days as a professional liar for the Bush/Cheney White House and 2004 campaign, now as a beloved-by-liberals MSNBC host, Nicolle Wallace has for two decades been the Typhoid Mary of Disinformation. Nobody spreads official campaigns of deceit and lies more casually, frequently, aggressively or destructively than she.</media:description>

   <media:description>Original video on Rumble: https://rumble.com/v11n4sn-taylor-lorenzs-doxxing-of-libsoftiktok-reveals-who-corporate-journalists-se.html

Trump-era corporate journalism ceased viewing real power centers as adversaries (CIA/NSA/FBI/WallSt). The real enemy are citizens with the wrong politics. Rather than confront real power centers, the largest and richest media corporations - eg, the Bezos-owned WPost - allied with those factions and attack citizens. 

The 2018 CNN obscenity featured in this video is most illustrative: they confronted an old lady with a tiny pro-Trump FB page on her yard. We recall when CNN threatened to dox someone who made an anti-CNN meme and when the Daily Beast published dirt and the real name of someone who published a video making Nancy Pelosi look drunk.

This is the key lesson of the latest tawdry episode with the WashPost's Taylor Lorenz: ever since a Trump presidency became a possibility, the largest liberal media corporations - over and over - have used their vast resources to target and punish private citizens for the wrong politics.</media:description>

   <media:description>Original Rumble video is here: https://rumble.com/vz3x6n-nyt-and-wp-confirm-biden-archive-yet-the-media-refuse-to-retract-their-russ.html

We examine one of the worst media disinformation campaigns in modern U.S. political history. In the weeks before the 2020 election, most corporate outlets spread the CIA lie that the materials on the Hunter Biden laptop -- which raised questions about the activities of front-runner Joe Biden in Ukraine and China -- were &quot;Russian disinformation,&quot; meaning that the documents were fake and were forged by Russia. It was clear from the start that the archive was real and they were lying. But even now that the New York Times, the Washington Post and a Politico reporter have all authenticated the archive, these media outlets that spread that destructive lie refuse to retract it or acknowledge this proof.</media:description>

   <media:description>For those who believe in the whole thing about how the US fights for freedom and democracy or whatever, there was a time when CIA -- before it openly integrated into the newsrooms of media corporations like NBC and CNN -- was candid about its real mission. Listen for yourself as journalist John Pilger interviews former CIA Latin America chief Duane Clarridge about how easily and happily the CIA overthrew democratically elected governments whenever it wanted.</media:description>

   <media:description>[This video is in Portuguese]

Sergio Moro entrou na justiça para que eu deletasse um tweet em que chamo ele de corrupto. No vídeo acima, explico porque chamei - e continuarei chamando - Moro de corrupto.

Independente da sua opinião sobre o Moro ou sobre mim, você acha que o Brasil será um lugar melhor se jornalistas forem juridicamente impedidos de chamar candidatos à presidência de corruptos?

O tweet em questão: https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1498417387393232904
