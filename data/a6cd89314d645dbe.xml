			<description><![CDATA[<p>My guest for <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #93</strong> is <a href="https://skynelson.com"><strong>Sky Nelson-Isaacs</strong></a>. Sky is a physics educator, speaker, author, and musician who has dedicated his life to finding his own sense of purpose, bringing together the connection between synchronicity, physics, and real life using research and his original ideas.<br /> <br /> We had a great chat about:</p> <div>-His book Living in Flow: The Science of Synchronicity and How Your Choices Shape Your World;</div> <div>-The responsiveness of the Universe; </div> <div>-How he believes synchronicities give us the opportunity to heal;</div> <div>-The question: how is my life reflecting my choices and collectively, how are our lives reflecting our choices?</div> <div>-Connecting the dots looking backwards AND forward and how desire plays a part in that;</div> <div>-Authentic power;</div> <div>-Tools he’s created like the LORRAX process that helps us cultivate flow;</div> <div>-His upcoming book Leap to Wholeness;</div> <div>-Grief and connection;</div> <div>-His new album “Stand For Me” featuring 13-original songs; and</div> <div>-Much more!</div> <div> </div> <div><em>"When we live in ‘flow,' a state of activity in which we align with our purpose and values, balancing our personal good with the greater good, we make choices that invite synchronicity.”</em> says Nelson-Isaacs.<br /> <br /> <strong>About Sky Nelson-Isaacs:</strong> <div> </div> <div>Sky Nelson-Isaacs is a physics educator, speaker, author, and musician. He has a masters degree in physics from San Francisco State University, with a thesis in String Theory, and a BS in physics from UC Berkeley. Nelson-Isaacs has dedicated his life to finding his own sense of purpose, beginning as a student of the Yogic master Sri Swami Satchidananda when he was less than five years old. </div> <div> </div> <div>His writing on topics like flow comes from integrating this experience into his life. He brings together the connection between synchronicity, physics, and real life using research and original ideas. </div> <div> </div> <div>As an active researcher in quantum foundations, his research is supported through grant funding from a private foundation. An educator with nine years of classroom experience, with experience in industry as a software engineer, Nelson-Isaacs is also a multi-instrumentalist and professional performer of award-winning original musical compositions.</div> <div> </div> <div>To learn more about his work, visit: https://skynelson.com</div> <div> </div> <div><strong>About Living in Flow:</strong></div> <div> </div> <div>NEW BOOK LOOKS TO PHYSICS TO EXPLAIN SYNCHRONICTY AND SHOWS HOW OUR CHOICES MAY SHAPE OUR WORLD<br /> <br /> Synchronicity or meaningful coincidence has been something philosophers and scientists have wondered about for decades. Most of us have experienced it at least once. You are on a much anticipated road trip and your vehicle breaks down. As you’re waiting by the side of the road a mechanic who specializes in just that type of car drives up and lends a hand. <br /> <br /> Is this just chance? Can two events be related in a meaningful way without one causing the other? If so, what does this tell us about the cosmos? Can we live in such a way and make choices that encourage synchronicity? Is that something we should strive for? <br /> <br /> In LIVING IN FLOW: THE SCIENCE OF SYNCHRONICITY AND HOW YOUR CHOICES SHAPE YOUR WORLD (North Atlantic Books, March 2019, paperback) physicist Sky Nelson-Isaacs turns to quantum mechanics to seek answers. Adhering to what we know from science, while offering a provocative new hypothesis, Nelson-Isaacs proposes that the cosmos may be designed to bring us meaningful, synchronistic experiences in response to the choices we make.<br /> <br /> When we live in “flow,” a state of activity in which we align with our purpose and values, balancing our personal good with the greater good, we make choices that invite synchronicity. In addition to a layperson’s explanation of the possible physics behind synchronicity, Nelson-Isaacs shows how cultivating flow can empower us individually and help make our world a better place.<br /> <br /> ###</div> </div>]]></description>

We had a great chat about:</p> -His book Living in Flow: The Science of Synchronicity and How Your Choices Shape Your World; -The responsiveness of the Universe;  -How he believes synchronicities give us the opportunity to heal; -The question: how is my life reflecting my choices and collectively, how are our lives reflecting our choices? -Connecting the dots looking backwards AND forward and how desire plays a part in that; -Authentic power; -Tools he’s created like the LORRAX process that helps us cultivate flow; -His upcoming book Leap to Wholeness; -Grief and connection; -His new album “Stand For Me” featuring 13-original songs; and -Much more!   <em>"When we live in ‘flow,' a state of activity in which we align with our purpose and values, balancing our personal good with the greater good, we make choices that invite synchronicity.”</em> says Nelson-Isaacs.  About Sky Nelson-Isaacs:   Sky Nelson-Isaacs is a physics educator, speaker, author, and musician. He has a masters degree in physics from San Francisco State University, with a thesis in String Theory, and a BS in physics from UC Berkeley. Nelson-Isaacs has dedicated his life to finding his own sense of purpose, beginning as a student of the Yogic master Sri Swami Satchidananda when he was less than five years old.    His writing on topics like flow comes from integrating this experience into his life. He brings together the connection between synchronicity, physics, and real life using research and original ideas.    As an active researcher in quantum foundations, his research is supported through grant funding from a private foundation. An educator with nine years of classroom experience, with experience in industry as a software engineer, Nelson-Isaacs is also a multi-instrumentalist and professional performer of award-winning original musical compositions.   To learn more about his work, visit: https://skynelson.com   About Living in Flow:   NEW BOOK LOOKS TO PHYSICS TO EXPLAIN SYNCHRONICTY AND SHOWS HOW OUR CHOICES MAY SHAPE OUR WORLD  Synchronicity or meaningful coincidence has been something philosophers and scientists have wondered about for decades. Most of us have experienced it at least once. You are on a much anticipated road trip and your vehicle breaks down. As you’re waiting by the side of the road a mechanic who specializes in just that type of car drives up and lends a hand.   Is this just chance? Can two events be related in a meaningful way without one causing the other? If so, what does this tell us about the cosmos? Can we live in such a way and make choices that encourage synchronicity? Is that something we should strive for?   In LIVING IN FLOW: THE SCIENCE OF SYNCHRONICITY AND HOW YOUR CHOICES SHAPE YOUR WORLD (North Atlantic Books, March 2019, paperback) physicist Sky Nelson-Isaacs turns to quantum mechanics to seek answers. Adhering to what we know from science, while offering a provocative new hypothesis, Nelson-Isaacs proposes that the cosmos may be designed to bring us meaningful, synchronistic experiences in response to the choices we make.  When we live in “flow,” a state of activity in which we align with our purpose and values, balancing our personal good with the greater good, we make choices that invite synchronicity. In addition to a layperson’s explanation of the possible physics behind synchronicity, Nelson-Isaacs shows how cultivating flow can empower us individually and help make our world a better place.  ### ]]></content:encoded>

And I do this, using my unique service, The MacWilliam Method.”</em> says <strong>Briana</strong>.<br /> <br /> <strong>About Briana’s Work:</strong><br /> <br /> Are you looking for a soul-shaking, passionate partnership, but find yourself trapped in roller-coaster relationships with unhealthy partners that you hate to love?<br /> <br /> Perhaps you have acquired a lot of skills, tips, techniques or "red flags," to help you make better decisions in love, but no matter what you do, no amount of insight seems to help you break free from unhealthy patterns, or stop feeling attracted to the "wrong" kind of partner.  If this sounds familiar, you are in the right place.<br /> <br /> Hi, my name is <strong>Briana MacWilliam</strong>, and I am a licensed and board certified creative arts therapist, with more than 14 years in the field, working with individuals, just like you.</p> <div><strong>About Briana MacWilliam:</strong></div> <div> </div> <div><strong>Briana MacWilliam</strong> has over 14 years of clinical experience as a creative arts therapist, and is the Founder and Director of Briana MacWilliam Inc., which offers continuing education to mental health practitioners, through CreativeArtsTherapiesOnline.com. <br /> <br /> She has held two directorial positions in community-based and day-treatment settings, and was a research outcomes coordinator for four years, at the Amen Clinics, Inc.—a brain research and diagnostic facility.

She is also the Director for Continuing Education for Pratt Institute’s Creative Arts Therapies Department.<br /> <br /> <strong>More About Briana: </strong><br /> Hi, my name is <strong>Briana</strong>, and I love romance novels and campy science fiction shows (anyone else a die-hard Supernatural fan?). I also like being my own boss. Doing what I want to do, when I want to do it. And treating work like play. Through my education, professional experience, and personal life experiences, I have come to passionately serve insecurely attached adults, who want to experience soul-deep intimacy, in their romantic relationships.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why Attachment? </strong><br /> My passion for working with attachment wounds and personal development stems from a rocky childhood. As a child of divorce, I bounced back and forth between my parents, across state lines. We lived below the poverty line for much of my young life. In my parents, I had an example of hard work but constant struggle. I became a high achiever to compensate. It served me well professionally, until my struggles with relationships in adulthood tore down everything I had accomplished.<br /> <br /> <strong>I’ve Been There:</strong><br /> In adulthood, I experienced roller coaster relationships, and ultimately wound up a divorced, single mom.<br /> Then, after losing my job due to budget cuts, within a six-month time frame, one after another, both my parents and my brother were diagnosed with serious, chronic illnesses. And the new partner I had fallen madly in love with– the one all the raw parts of myself wanted so desperately to please and keep – couldn’t prioritize me. When he left, my heart broke anew. I felt my soul was split wide open.<br /> <br /> <strong>Finding Grace:</strong><br /> As I came face-to-face with my greatest fears. I knew I had to find the grace on the other side, or collapse into a victimized identity. I decided that meant stepping into my own authority, on a spiritual level. And this gave me the motivation to radically change the way I was living, loving, working, and perceiving the world.<br /> <br /> <strong>New Horizons:</strong><br /> I decided to dive straight down into my demons, while pursuing certification in Reiki (energy healing), building a private practice, and doing research for a book about attachment and grief. Ultimately, I found several other contributors willing to share their stories of grief, and we got it published!<br /> <br /> Writing the book emboldened me to shed my shame, and  talk about these things in a way I had never thought I would feel safe doing.This led to creating the curriculum for my online courses in personal development, and building an online community for support. Much to my delight, both caught fire, and I have never looked back!<br /> <br /> ###</div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Life on Purpose</strong> returns with Episode #89, the fourth chat in a series I’m calling <em>Seeing The Light In Uncertain Times</em>.<br /> <br /> My guest for this episode is creative alchemist <strong>Diana Rowan</strong>, the founder of the Bright Way Guild, a virtual learning environment dedicated to transforming and inspiring a global community of creatives. </p> <div> </div> <div>Taped in April 2020 as people around the world were dealing with the ramifications and massive uncertainty with the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, <strong>Diana</strong> joined me for an inspiring conversation on the importance of creativity in uncertain times.<br /> <br /> We also discussed her brand new book <strong>The Bright Way: Five Steps to Freeing the Creative Within</strong> <em>(just published by New World Library)</em>, in which she guides readers on every step, giving the tools needed to create a life full of happiness, inspiration, and purpose.<br /> <br /> <em>"When we become anxious or afraid, it’s usually because we feel a lack of connection — with ourselves and with our communities. The antidote to fear is creativity. As fear fades, love takes center stage, and we become ourselves once more."</em> <div><br /> About Diana:<br /> <br /> <strong>Diana Rowan</strong> is a creative alchemist and founder of the Bright Way Guild, a virtual learning environment dedicated to transforming and inspiring a global community of creatives. From her youngest years, the classical inquiry “What makes a good life?” has driven Diana, and sharing her hard-won dis- coveries with others is her mission. Having recovered from a soul-crushing case of stage fright and other challenges, Diana believes that by shining light on the darkness we fear, we can all become courageous purveyors of Bright Knowledge and live the good life.<br /> <br /> <strong>Diana</strong> was born in Dublin, Ireland, to college-student parents, setting the stage for a lifetime of lively learning and seeking. Soon thereafter, her father became a diplomat for the Irish government, taking his family all over the world in a cosmopolitan pilgrimage. Respect for arts and cultures has always been second nature in Diana’s family, along with a deep streak of mysticism, as embodied by her astrologer mother.<br /> <br /> This unusual combination of intellectual seeking, cultural bridging, mystical opening, and artistic engagement is the hallmark of Diana’s life, whether that be in composing music, teaching, writing, or choosing a wine.

My guest for this episode is creative alchemist Diana Rowan, the founder of the Bright Way Guild, a virtual learning environment dedicated to transforming and inspiring a global community of creatives. </p>   Taped in April 2020 as people around the world were dealing with the ramifications and massive uncertainty with the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Diana joined me for an inspiring conversation on the importance of creativity in uncertain times.  We also discussed her brand new book The Bright Way: Five Steps to Freeing the Creative Within <em>(just published by New World Library)</em>, in which she guides readers on every step, giving the tools needed to create a life full of happiness, inspiration, and purpose.  <em>"When we become anxious or afraid, it’s usually because we feel a lack of connection — with ourselves and with our communities. The antidote to fear is creativity. As fear fades, love takes center stage, and we become ourselves once more."</em>  About Diana:  Diana Rowan is a creative alchemist and founder of the Bright Way Guild, a virtual learning environment dedicated to transforming and inspiring a global community of creatives. From her youngest years, the classical inquiry “What makes a good life?” has driven Diana, and sharing her hard-won dis- coveries with others is her mission. Having recovered from a soul-crushing case of stage fright and other challenges, Diana believes that by shining light on the darkness we fear, we can all become courageous purveyors of Bright Knowledge and live the good life.  Diana was born in Dublin, Ireland, to college-student parents, setting the stage for a lifetime of lively learning and seeking. Soon thereafter, her father became a diplomat for the Irish government, taking his family all over the world in a cosmopolitan pilgrimage. Respect for arts and cultures has always been second nature in Diana’s family, along with a deep streak of mysticism, as embodied by her astrologer mother.  This unusual combination of intellectual seeking, cultural bridging, mystical opening, and artistic engagement is the hallmark of Diana’s life, whether that be in composing music, teaching, writing, or choosing a wine. Diana holds an MM in classical piano performance and a PhD in music theory.   ### ]]></content:encoded>

We discussed keeping an open heart while still having our moments of fear and stepping into our sovereign unity at this time when the world needs each of us to embrace our gifts.<br /> <br /> About Shelli:</div> <div> </div> <div>Shelli L. (Duarte), aka Shell Luna Love, believes in magic and mystery and all the in-between spaces. She suggests we all are ‘magicians’ when we go about finding our own inner essence and start unravelling our own riddles and stories through unconditional love and compassion. Creating, in whatever form, is magical and mysterious, and chock-full of love, joy, and beauty. She uses both the practical and mystical to be her most creative ‘alive’ self. “We are creators whether we are purposefully tending to this aspect or not. No matter if we are artists, parents, spouses, accountants, or engineers, etc., we are always creating.  It’s our inherent design and we have a responsibility to engage it.” <br /> <br /> One part of her work in the world is to spark and catalyze others to access their own heart-full self-leadership to allow an embodied life design. She has a passion and mission to bring tools of inspiration through joy, beauty, and experience. Some of her favourite avenues of experiencing, exploring, and serving in the world are through conversation, image, poetry, writing, and wayfinding with those who want to create and design their most heart-full lives.  Her love to inspire and guide people to their edge of self-empowered leadership is a path to the expanded love, joy, and beauty she wishes to see in the world.<br /> <br /> Shell Luna came into this world as a ‘seer’ and a seeker. She has known herself as a creative being always, just as she sees all others. She sees and seeks beauty, truth, love, mystery, and possibility in the world through inner self-exploration and outer world explorations. She is proud to call herself a ‘Jill-of-many-trades’ in this lifetime, but her soul essence is an illuminary-mystic-dream weaving-designer, an ‘engineer’, an agent of change, wanting to bring healing ideas and tools to hearts, minds, bodies, and spirits.  </div> <div> </div> <div>###</div> <div><br /> <br /></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #82</strong>, my guest is author, speaker, and workshop leader <strong>Scott Stabile</strong>. He joined me for a fantastic conversation on his new book, <strong>Big Love: The Power of Living with a Wide-Open Heart</strong>, which answers the question, <em>"What happens when you fully commit yourself to love?"</em></p> <p>Endless good, he insists who found that out by overcoming plenty of bad. His parents were murdered when he was fourteen. Nine years later, his brother died of a heroin overdose. Soon after that, <strong>Scott</strong> joined a cult that dominated his life for thirteen years before he summoned the courage to walk away.</p> <p>In <strong>Big Love</strong>, his insightful and refreshingly honest collection of personal essays, <strong>Scott</strong> relates these profound experiences as well as everyday struggles and triumphs in ways that are universally applicable, uplifting, and laugh-out-loud funny. Whether silencing shame, rebounding after failure, or moving forward despite fears, <strong>Scott</strong> shares hard-won insights that consistently return readers to love, both of themselves and others.</p> <p><em>"I’d like this book to remind you that you are not alone, not by a long shot. We are all imperfect; we all have busy, fearful minds; and we all struggle. Every single one of us, every single day. I’d like the book to emphasize that you are as worthy of love as anyone who has ever lived, and that nothing you do could ever make you any less worthy. Or more worthy, for that matter."</em></p> <p>About Scott:</p> <p>About fifteen years ago, a friend asked me what I wanted to do with my life. I told him I wanted to spread as much love as possible. My answer’s still the same.</p> <p>I know life isn't always a party. It's often hard, sometimes brutal. My parents were shot to death when I was fourteen. My brother OD'd on heroin nine years later. I grew up around a lot of addiction, dysfunction and tragedy. And with too much shame over the fact that I was gay. I hid my pain, and I hid my truth. Not anymore.</p> <p>We all have our stories. We all have our pain. I've come to believe the only way to have a chance at healing our wounds is to be honest about them. Brave and willing enough to face them. The healing part may be out of our hands, but the brave and honest part is certainly within our power. And it changes everything.</p> <p>For me, love supports it all. ALL OF IT. Love is the base note for everything good—compassion, forgiveness, kindness, authenticity—and choices made from love can only serve ourselves and our world positively. Love's got the power.</p> <p>I've been fortunate enough to publish some books and write a movie and be a part of a supportive and wonderful social media community also committed to looking at their lives honestly and through the all-forgiving lens of love.</p> <p>I've finally started doing what I want to be doing with my life—as I told my friend, spreading as much love as possible. Any which way I can do it.</p> <p>I hope you'll join me.</p> <p>To learn more about <strong>Scott</strong> and his work, visit: <a href="http://www.scottstabile.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">http://www.scottstabile.com/</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #76</strong>, my guest is <strong>Dr. Eric Maisel</strong>, a retired family therapist, active life coach, and the author of more than fifty books.<br /> <br /> <strong>Eric</strong> was one of my first guests on <strong>Life on Purpose</strong> and returns to the show for a wide-ranging conversation on meaning, life purpose, and the epidemic of phantom "mental disorders" in children. And we focus on his new book, <em>Your Difficult Family: 8 Skills for Thriving in Any Family Situation</em>, in which he shows how to stay sane when family isn’t, providing practical strategies that can be implemented immediately.  <br /> <br /> This empowering book is a “field guide” to common types of dysfunctional families, and a big helping of real life success stories that are dinner table tested and approved. Readers will learn to maintain inner peace in the midst of family chaos and maybe even create a better life for their whole family.<br /> <br /> <em>“There is no pill that can make family life easy. There is no pill that can spare you pain if one of your parents is alcoholic, one of your children is troubled, or your mate is cheating on you. M. Scott Peck begins The Road Less Traveled with a simple, eloquent announcement: “Life is difficult.” Tolstoy famously begins Anna Karenina in an equally eloquent way: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”"</em><br /> <br /> About: <strong>Eric Maisel</strong> was born in the Bronx, New York, where he lived until the age of 5. He grew up in Brooklyn, attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, and briefly attended Brooklyn College. After serving in the Army from 1965 – 1968 he attended Oregon State University and the University of Oregon, where he received a B.S. in philosophy.<br /> <br /> Dr. Maisel subsequently lived in Boston, New York and San Francisco and traveled extensively in Europe, spending time in London, Dublin and Budapest. He earned a master’s degree in creative writing from San Francisco State University while ghostwriting mysteries and nonfiction and self-publishing fiction. In the ’80s he returned to school and earned a second bachelor’s degree in psychology, a second master’s degree in counseling, and a doctorate in counseling psychology.<br /> <br /> After completing training, Dr. Maisel became a California licensed family therapist and worked exclusively with creative and performing artists. In time he moved from therapy and the medical model to coaching, where he founded the profession of creativity coaching.<br /> <br /> Dr. Maisel has a son, David Maisel, by his first marriage, and two daughters, Natalya Maisel and Kira Maisel, with his wife Ann Mathesius Maisel. In 2012 Eric and Ann celebrated 35 years together.  They live in the San Francisco Bay Area.<br /> <br /> Dr. Maisel served as adjunct faculty at St. Mary’s College (Moraga, California) for ten years and created and wrote Callboard Magazine’s Staying Sane in the Theater column. He has presented lectures and workshops for the American Psychological Association, the California Association of Marriage and Family Therapists, the Paris Writers Workshop, the North Carolina School of the Arts, the Savannah College of Arts and Crafts, the U.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Life on Purpose Episode #76, my guest is Dr. Eric Maisel, a retired family therapist, active life coach, and the author of more than fifty books.  Eric was one of my first guests on Life on Purpose and returns to the show for a wide-ranging conversation on meaning, life purpose, and the epidemic of phantom "mental disorders" in children. And we focus on his new book, <em>Your Difficult Family: 8 Skills for Thriving in Any Family Situation</em>, in which he shows how to stay sane when family isn’t, providing practical strategies that can be implemented immediately.    This empowering book is a “field guide” to common types of dysfunctional families, and a big helping of real life success stories that are dinner table tested and approved. Readers will learn to maintain inner peace in the midst of family chaos and maybe even create a better life for their whole family.  <em>“There is no pill that can make family life easy. There is no pill that can spare you pain if one of your parents is alcoholic, one of your children is troubled, or your mate is cheating on you. M. Scott Peck begins The Road Less Traveled with a simple, eloquent announcement: “Life is difficult.” Tolstoy famously begins Anna Karenina in an equally eloquent way: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”"</em>  About: Eric Maisel was born in the Bronx, New York, where he lived until the age of 5. He grew up in Brooklyn, attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, and briefly attended Brooklyn College. After serving in the Army from 1965 – 1968 he attended Oregon State University and the University of Oregon, where he received a B.S. in philosophy.  Dr. Maisel subsequently lived in Boston, New York and San Francisco and traveled extensively in Europe, spending time in London, Dublin and Budapest. He earned a master’s degree in creative writing from San Francisco State University while ghostwriting mysteries and nonfiction and self-publishing fiction. In the ’80s he returned to school and earned a second bachelor’s degree in psychology, a second master’s degree in counseling, and a doctorate in counseling psychology.  After completing training, Dr. Maisel became a California licensed family therapist and worked exclusively with creative and performing artists. In time he moved from therapy and the medical model to coaching, where he founded the profession of creativity coaching.  Dr. Maisel has a son, David Maisel, by his first marriage, and two daughters, Natalya Maisel and Kira Maisel, with his wife Ann Mathesius Maisel. In 2012 Eric and Ann celebrated 35 years together.  They live in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Dr. Maisel served as adjunct faculty at St. Mary’s College (Moraga, California) for ten years and created and wrote Callboard Magazine’s Staying Sane in the Theater column. He has presented lectures and workshops for the American Psychological Association, the California Association of Marriage and Family Therapists, the Paris Writers Workshop, the North Carolina School of the Arts, the Savannah College of Arts and Crafts, the U. C. Berkeley Counseling Center, and many other venues.  Dr. Maisel has been a guest on, quoted in, or interviewed by Redbook, Glamour, Cosmo Teen, Men’s Health, Body and Soul, KRON television news, Martha Stewart Living, Self, Marin Magazine, The San Francisco Chronicle, The New York Daily News, The Arizona Republic, Common Boundary, and has provided hundreds of radio, television, and print interviews.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #73</strong>, my guest is the pioneering therapist <strong>Dr. Judith Orloff</strong>, a New York Times best-selling author and Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at UCLA who has helped patients find emotional freedom for more than 20 years. Dr. Orloff synthesizes the pearls of traditional medicine with cutting edge knowledge of intuition, energy, and spirituality to achieve physical and emotional healing.<br /> <br /> In this enlightening conversation, we discussed her brand new book, <strong>The Empath’s Survival Guide: Life Strategies for Sensitive People</strong> <em>(Sounds True)</em>, in which she offers an invaluable resource to help EMPATHIC people survive in an often insensitive world, plus her life and career as "the positive energy guru."<br /> <br /> <em>“Empaths feel things first, then think, which is the opposite of how most people function in our over- intellectualized society,” says Dr. Orloff. "The key to self-care is to recognize when you’re experiencing the first signs of sensory overload or when you start absorbing negativity or stress from others. The sooner you can act to reduce stimulation and to center yourself, the more balanced and protected you will be."</em><br /> <br /> About: Transforming the face of psychiatry, <strong>Judith Orloff MD</strong> asserts that we are keepers of an innate intuitive intelligence so perceptive that it can tell us how to heal -- and prevent -- illness. Yet intuition and spirituality are the very aspects of our wisdom usually disenfranchised from traditional health care.<br /> <br /> Dr. Orloff is accomplishing for psychiatry what physicians like Dean Ornish and Mehmet Oz have done for mainstream medicine -- she is proving that the links between physical, emotional, and spiritual health can't be ignored. Dr. Orloff is a New York Times bestselling author and is on the UCLA psychiatric clinical faculty. She specializes in treating empaths and sensitive people in her Los Angeles based private practice.<br /> <br /> She has spoken at medical schools, hospitals, the American Psychiatric Association, Fortune Magazine's Most Powerful Women Summit, and alternative and traditional health forums -- venues where she presents practical intuitive tools to doctors, patients, and everyday people. In response to her work, The Los Angeles Times calls Dr. Orloff "a prominent energy-based healer."<br /> <br /> Dr. Orloff's latest book “The Empath’s Survival Guide: Life Strategies for Sensitive People” (Sounds True, 2017) is an invaluable resource to help sensitive people of all kinds develop healthy coping mechanisms in our high-stimulus world without experiencing compassion fatigue or burnout. Then empaths can fully embody their gifts of intuition, creativity, and compassion.<br /> <br /> In Dr. Orloff’s first book, "Second Sight" she chronicles her struggles acknowledging and then finally embracing her gift of intuition. Her second book, "Dr. Orloff's: Guide to Intuitive Healing" shows how breakthroughs in healing our body, emotions, and sexuality can be accomplished by listening to intuition.  <br /> <br /> "Positive Energy," which has been translated into 25 languages, takes a probing look at the American epidemic of exhaustion and how we can reverse it using specific strategies to build energy and combat draining people. Her New York Times Bestseller, "Emotional Freedom" describes how to transform negative emotions into positive ones with specific techniques.<br /> <br /> Finally, "The Power of Surrender" describes the power of letting go in everyday life, health, and wellness--an enlivening and sane alternative to pushing, forcing, and over controlling people and situations.<br /> <br /> Dr. Orloff's work has been featured in O Magazine, Forbes, Newsweek, USA Today, the Wall Street Journal, Self, Cosmo, The Washington Times, Teen Vogue, Scientific American, and the New York Post. She has appeared on The Today Show, The Dr. Oz Show, CBS Early Show, CNN, PBS, BBC5, and NPR.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #72</strong>, another "Soul Series" interview, my guest is author and minister <strong>Maria Felipe</strong>, who joined me for a fantastic conversation that can change lives. We discussed her unique story going from a successful <em>(but ultimately unfulfilling)</em> career as an actress, model, and Latina boxing announcer to spiritual teacher and motivational speaker.</p> <p>And we talked about her brand new book, <em><strong>Live Your Happy: Get Out of Your Own Way and Find the Love Within</strong></em> <em>(New World Library)</em>, in which she shares more than twenty years of experience studying and living the principles from A Course in Miracles (ACIM). Live Your Happy is not a philosophic explanation of the Course; it is a practical guide for living it.</p> <p>The book includes real-world examples from the author’s life and from her students’ experiences. In nine crystal-clear chapters, she shows readers how to get the “cuckoo voice of the ego” out of the way, connect with their “inner teacher,” and access personal power and strength.</p> <p><em>“This book is a simple but not necessarily easy guide to learning to live your happy. I will share practical spiritual tools to get you there, along with stories of my own journey and of people I’ve counseled. I empower my clients not by telling them what to do but by helping them understand that they have the answer within,” she writes. “I ask that you trust me and be gentle with yourself. Step by step, I will train you to listen to your right mind. In turn, you will become free to live in happiness consistently. You will even be happy when you have so-called ‘problems.’ How’s that for a miracle?”</em></p> <p>About: a Cuban-American born in Miami, <strong>Maria Felipe</strong> stands at 5’9" tall with a towering personality to match. Her charisma has captivated thousands of viewers across the United States and beyond, as her pursuit of an acting career resulted in dozens of appearances in national commercials, hosting successful TV shows (including World Wrestling Federation shows with live audiences of 20,000), and traveling the world as a model.</p> <p>After success in her field she felt called inward, and studied to become a Reverend with Pathways of Light, an accredited religious school inspired by A Course in Miracles.</p> <p>Maria is a dynamic speaker in both Spanish and English. She leads services monthly at Unity Church in Burbank, where she created the church's first regular Spanish service, as well as performing services in English. Her talks now draw both Spanish and English speakers from all over Southern California. She also leads workshops.</p> <p>Maria has created her own channel on You Tube by hosting MariaCoconut TV, a show designed to share and expand the message of love by interviewing other spiritual leaders. In 2013, Maria been a regular guest on Unity Radio, Awakening Together Radio and Center Of Light Radio.</p> <p>She’s also recently appeared as a motivational speaker on TV shows and news programs for Univison, Telemundo and CNN. She has also spoken alongside prominent teachers David Hoffmeister and Gary Renard in Los Angeles, Mexico, and Greece.</p> <p>People magazine once referred to Maria Felipe as ’’Una Campeona Sin Rival,’’ which means a champion without rival. This is an apt label for this young, vivacious and talented actress, host, and minister. And the gifts she can share with countless others continue to multiply as she allows the expression of her talents to be guided by the inner light of God.</p> <p>To learn more about <strong>Maria's</strong> work, visit: <a href="https://www.mariafelipe.org/" target= "_blank">https://www.mariafelipe.org/</a>.</p>]]></description>

In nine crystal-clear chapters, she shows readers how to get the “cuckoo voice of the ego” out of the way, connect with their “inner teacher,” and access personal power and strength.</p> <p><em>“This book is a simple but not necessarily easy guide to learning to live your happy. I will share practical spiritual tools to get you there, along with stories of my own journey and of people I’ve counseled. I empower my clients not by telling them what to do but by helping them understand that they have the answer within,” she writes. “I ask that you trust me and be gentle with yourself. Step by step, I will train you to listen to your right mind. In turn, you will become free to live in happiness consistently. You will even be happy when you have so-called ‘problems.’ How’s that for a miracle?”</em></p> <p>About: a Cuban-American born in Miami, Maria Felipe stands at 5’9" tall with a towering personality to match. Her charisma has captivated thousands of viewers across the United States and beyond, as her pursuit of an acting career resulted in dozens of appearances in national commercials, hosting successful TV shows (including World Wrestling Federation shows with live audiences of 20,000), and traveling the world as a model.</p> <p>After success in her field she felt called inward, and studied to become a Reverend with Pathways of Light, an accredited religious school inspired by A Course in Miracles.</p> <p>Maria is a dynamic speaker in both Spanish and English. She leads services monthly at Unity Church in Burbank, where she created the church's first regular Spanish service, as well as performing services in English. Her talks now draw both Spanish and English speakers from all over Southern California. She also leads workshops.</p> <p>Maria has created her own channel on You Tube by hosting MariaCoconut TV, a show designed to share and expand the message of love by interviewing other spiritual leaders. In 2013, Maria been a regular guest on Unity Radio, Awakening Together Radio and Center Of Light Radio.</p> <p>She’s also recently appeared as a motivational speaker on TV shows and news programs for Univison, Telemundo and CNN. She has also spoken alongside prominent teachers David Hoffmeister and Gary Renard in Los Angeles, Mexico, and Greece.</p> <p>People magazine once referred to Maria Felipe as ’’Una Campeona Sin Rival,’’ which means a champion without rival. This is an apt label for this young, vivacious and talented actress, host, and minister. And the gifts she can share with countless others continue to multiply as she allows the expression of her talents to be guided by the inner light of God.</p> <p>To learn more about Maria's work, visit: <a href="https://www.mariafelipe.org/" target= "_blank">https://www.mariafelipe.org/</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #71</strong>, my guest is psychologist <strong>Rachel Harris, PhD</strong>, who joined me for an enlightening and hope-filled conversation about her new book <strong>Listening to Ayahuasca: New Hope for Depression, Addiction, PTSD and Anxiety</strong> <em>(New World Library)</em>.<br /> <br /> Ayahuasca, a psychedelic brew from the Amazon rainforest, is entering the Western lexicon through the popular media, the internet, and first-person reports. Considered a medicine by practitioners, the tea has great therapeutic potential that is just beginning to be studied. As a result of her own personal experience with ayahuasca, Dr. Harris was inspired to research how this medicine was being used in North America in the largest study of this kind to date. <strong>Listening to Ayahuasca</strong> describes her findings, including miracle cures of depression and addiction, therapeutic breakthroughs, spiritual revelations, and challenging or bad trips.<br /> <br /> <em>“This book is intended for people considering ayahuasca and for people drinking the medicine. I hope it will help them integrate their insights and visions into their daily lives. There is much work people can do on their own to maximize the healing that ayahuasca offers,” writes Dr. Harris. “I also hope this book will inform psychotherapists about the process of integration after ayahuasca ceremonies, so they can provide a supportive and respectful container for the unfolding of healing.”</em><br /> <br /> About: Psychologist <strong>Rachel Harris, PhD</strong> is the author of <strong>Listening to Ayahuasca: New Hope for Depression, Addiction, PTSD and Anxiety</strong>. She was in private practice for thirty-five years working with people interested in psychospiritual development. During a decade working in research, Rachel received a National Institutes of Health New Investigator’s Award and published more than forty scientific studies in peer-reviewed journals. She has also consulted to Fortune 500 companies and the United Nations.<br /> <br /> Rachel was in the 1968 Esalen Residential Program, Big Sur, CA. This intensive six-month program focused on meditation and body work. In the early seventies, Rachel studied with Dorothy Nolte in the movement system, Structural Awareness, based on Dr. Ida Rolf’s Structural Integration (Rolfing). Rachel also co-edited the Journal of the American Dance Therapy Association for three years. Awareness of how people live and move in their bodies has always been an aspect of Rachel’s approach to psychotherapy.<br /> <br /> During the mid-eighties into the early aughts, Rachel led workshops at Omega Institute, NY and Esalen Institute, CA. She wrote Twenty Minute Retreats: Revive Your Spirit in Just Minutes a Day with Simple, Self-Led Practices (NY: Holt, 2000). This book describes many of the psychological, meditative and body awareness exercises she taught in her workshops.<br /> <br /> In 2005 Rachel traveled to a retreat center in Costa Rica and serendipitously found herself with the opportunity to drink ayahuasca with Ecuadorian shamans. The morning after her first ceremony, Rachel began asking questions about the therapeutic potential of this medicine. She conducted a three-year research project with Lee Gurel, PhD that resulted in “A Study of Ayahuasca Use in North America,” published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs (Summer, 2012).<br /> <br /> Rachel has a married daughter, Ashley Mason, who sings in the chorus at the Metropolitan Opera in NYC. Rachel is the co-author with Dorothy Nolte of Children Learn What They Live and Teenagers Learn What They Live (NY: Workman, 1998 and 2002) and the author of 20 Minute Retreats (Holt, 2000). Rachel spends eight months of the year on a remote island in Penobscot Bay, ME and winters in Napa, CA.<br /> <br /> To learn more about Dr. Harris' work, visit: https://www.listeningtoayahuasca.com/.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #70</strong>, my guest is transformational photographer and coach <strong>Robyn Ivy</strong>, who has 20 years of experience helping clients transform themselves by shifting their focus and learning to see their world through a new lens.</p> <p><strong>Robyn</strong> joined me for an inspiring conversation about photography as a tool for transformation <em>(a conviction I share)</em>, her life and work, and PROJECT 3.8, the compelling campaign she started to raise awareness for pediatric cancer. Robyn brings a deep understanding of what holds people back and brings it into the light so it can be seen and overcome.</p> <p><em>"Have you ever stopped to consider that the way we look at and experience our world is often done by default? Did you know that our vision can be strengthened, like a muscle, and when we exercise it, it transforms, changing the way we view our world and ourselves?"</em></p> <p>About <strong>Robyn</strong>: Much like the world around us, I am constantly evolving—driven by an intense passion to help businesses and individuals transform themselves by learning to see their world through a new lens. As a professional photographer, visual brand strategist, creative director, speaker and coach, I explore opportunities from a variety of perspectives that help my clients see the possibilities, truths and solutions to problem that remain invisible others.</p> <p>For nearly two decades, I have encouraged others to step outside the box, shifting their focus to tell a different story about themselves; one in which the heart of who they are and what they stand for shines through for all to see. The impact of storytelling is very real, and I pride myself on uncovering the deeper message behind my clients’ brands and communicating it to the world through powerful imagery.</p> <p>In 2016, I created Project 3.8, a compelling visual campaign to raise awareness for pediatric cancer, born from the heartache of a close friend losing her 8-year-old son to Rhabdomyosarcoma. I produced a traveling gallery of 20 large scale metal portraits of children ages 3-18 who were either active in their fight against cancer or celebrated survivors.</p> <p>The show’s inspiration, Dorian J. Murray, was our only angel. While I learned much from this experience, my mission was simple: to teach people to “see” childhood cancer in a different light and the impact is has on far too many families. Project 3.8 moved thousands of people and, I’m happy to say, will be an annual event.</p> <p>I share this with you because of how passionate I am about helping people see themselves and their cause from new and unexpected vantage points. When you understand what holds people back and bring it to the forefront so it may be overcome, there’s truly no limit to what you can accomplish.</p> <p>Whether you’re looking to create new pathways to growth, increase ROI, find innovative solutions to difficult problems, or guide others in the direction of our true purpose to make a difference in this world, I want to be part of that journey. I want to be part of your journey.</p> <p>Through my photography, I shoot for a wide range of commercial, corporate and editorial clients, as well as entrepreneurs and those who want to change the world. I also offer workshops and speaking presentations on how to transform your business, your brand or your life by changing your viewpoint.</p> <p>Now that I’ve told you about what I do, I’d like to tell you a bit about who I am. Though I’m a native New Englander, in my heart, I am a citizen of the world. At 15, I spent a year in Germany as an exchange student and it changed my life! Traveling became embedded in my DNA and I spent my youth finding ways to see more of the world. A free spirit by nature, I love a great road trip and the kindred spirits you meet along the way.</p> <p>Long before I was a professional photographer, I worked with baby chimpanzees in Africa, led German tourists on adventure camping trips in Alaska and beyond, taught English to folks in Europe, and spent a year working my tail off with an anti-hunger coalition in Vermont.</p> <p>In 2001, I became a mom and began life’s most valuable journey: raising my two boys, who have quickly (yet not quietly) become teenagers. I'm pretty obsessed with Instagram and I’ve promised myself that one day, I will learn how to knit!</p> <p>To learn more about <strong>Robyn's</strong> work, visit: http://www.robynivy.com/.</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Have you ever asked yourself what is your life purpose? Have you considered what you are doing here and whether you are on the right track to being fulfilled?</em><br /> <br /> For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #68</strong>, my guests are world-renowned Human Design experts <strong>Chetan Parkyn</strong> & <strong>Carola Eastwood</strong>. They joined me for a fascinating and timely conversation about a tool that can help answer those questions: Human Design and their brand new book <strong><em>The Book of Destinies: Discover the Life You Were Born to Live</em></strong> <em>(New World Library)</em>. The book offers readers the opportunity to use the place, date, and time of their births to reveal their Life Theme, which offers a portrait of their true nature and allows them the peace of knowing who they really are.<br /> <br /> <em>“Just like the storyline of a book, or the theme music to a movie, there is a unique, consistent, and recognizable undercurrent to your whole lifetime. It is your Life Theme, which is your melody, your part in the symphony of life, and only you can play it,” say Chetan and Carola. “Knowing and accepting your particular Life Theme is truly transformative. Embodying this awareness gives you reassurance and clarification about your life purpose.”</em><br /> <br /> About <strong>Chetan Parkyn</strong>: Chetan Parkyn has been giving Readings to people of all walks of life and all nationalities for over 35 years. He has spent the past 23 years mastering Human Design. He is more than a leading practitioner of the system. As the author of the first major book on the subject, which has been translated into eleven different language versions, he has made it his mission to bring Human Design to the whole world.<br /> <br /> An entrepreneur’s son by upbringing and an engineer by training, Chetan has fully explored both the mystical and the technological worlds. He’s been a deep-sea dive engineer and a devoted student of meditation. Travels in India and time spent in the company of the enlightened mystic, Osho, finally opened Chetan to his own purpose — helping people develop self-knowledge.<br /> <br /> The details of how Chetan discovered his abilities came about through a reading he experienced from a Chayyashastri (Shadow Reader) in Bombay, now Mumbai, in 1979.  Finding himself no longer satisfied with everything he had understood about himself especially in the field of engineering, Chetan was guided to have a session to find some personal clarification.  Chetan was given a transfixing view of himself in all aspects of his life.  He was told things about himself that he had long forgotten, barely imagined, or never considered important.  At the end of the session, the Shadow Reader asked Chetan to come and work with him : ".......because you know how to do this kind of work."<br /> <br /> Completely startled by the depth of the information he had just received, Chetan declined the invitation.  The Shadow Reader laughed in response and told Chetan that it did not really matter .... "because you are going to do this work anyway," he said. "There is a system that is going to come into your life, and you are going to write books about it, and introduce it to many thousands of people all over the world, and you are going to transform their lives.....and my advice to you is to find a way of reading for people that you like and practice it so you are ready."<br /> <br /> A week later, Chetan met a Psychic Palm Reader who for 10 minutes showed Chetan about many of the lines and markings in a hand.  At the end of the 10 minutes, the Psychic Palmist closed up Chetan’s hands and said : "That's enough!  Now go practice!"  And for the next 14 years, Chetan gave Readings for everyone who held their hands out to him. He also studied numerous systems of divination and ways of revealing people to themselves.....all the time wondering what this "system" the Shadow Reader had been talking about could be.<br /> <br /> In 1993, Chetan met a man called Ra Uru Hu, who had been given Human Design and who first introduced it to the world. Chetan worked with Ra over the next 7 years, beginning his journey towards fully mastering the system. Chetan’s unique gifts include a balance of technical skill and pure intuition. In addition, Chetan is a compelling speaker — fun, inspiring, down-to-earth and personal. Simply through hearing him, many experience the beginnings of deep inner change.<br /> <br /> As Chetan studied Human Design over many years, gave thousands of personal and partnership Readings, he began to realize how few people had access to its extraordinary riches. In 2000, he felt called to make the system accessible to a far wider audience. Chetan began offering Trainings and Seminars along with his life-partner Carola Eastwood. The couple also started training Practitioners in the art of giving wholesome Human Design Readings. But this was not enough.<br /> <br /> In 2009 Chetan wrote the first major book on Human Design, published by Harper Collins UK, and in 2010 by New World Library in the US, and subsequently in many other languages. Combined with powerful free software, the book makes it easy for everyone to create and interpret his or her own Life Chart. Recently, he and his wife, Carola created the first On-Line Human Design Comprehensive Report. Thanks to Chetan Parkyn, Human Design today is becoming available to the whole planet. And as more and more individuals live in alignment with their unique design, the quality of life on Earth will change!<br /> <br /> About <strong>Carola Eastwood</strong>: Carola Eastwood has been a Human Design consultant, teacher and coach since 1999.<br /> <br /> Prior to that she had an established counseling practice and an Astrology clientele in Santa Fe, NM and in San Diego, CA. She has been author of the monthly column, “Planetary Cycles” published by the Life Connection since 1988, and is a highly acclaimed astrological consultant and intuitive counselor. Carola has appeared on national TV, hosted radio shows, and spoken at national conventions.<br /> <br /> As a young woman, Carola discovered her passion to help others awaken to a richer view of themselves and their world, by finding their inner essence, that core of being within each person that is the Spirit expressing in form.<br /> <br /> She undertook years of post graduate training in a variety of human development disciplines, including psychology, psychosynthesis, past life healing therapy, intuitive reading arts, and the science of spirituality. When she discovered Human Design, she realized that this was the missing piece of the puzzle in helping others to change their consciousness and create their own destiny.<br /> <br /> Today, she co-presents Human Design seminars and trainings alongside her husband and partner, Chetan Parkyn. Carola created the experiential seminars as a tool that quickly puts one in touch with one’s own Human Design, and with the Designs of others. She also assists Chetan in presenting Human Design Consultant Trainings.<br /> <br /> Her passion is to assist others to awaken to their own power to create the life they have always dreamed of.<br /> <br /> To learn more about <strong>Chetan</strong> and <strong>Carola's</strong> work, visit: <a href= "http://humandesignforusall.com/" target= "_blank">http://humandesignforusall.com/</a>.</p>]]></description>

Have you considered what you are doing here and whether you are on the right track to being fulfilled?</em>  For Life on Purpose Episode #68, my guests are world-renowned Human Design experts Chetan Parkyn & Carola Eastwood. They joined me for a fascinating and timely conversation about a tool that can help answer those questions: Human Design and their brand new book <em>The Book of Destinies: Discover the Life You Were Born to Live</em> <em>(New World Library)</em>.

Later I served as Administrator of the Program in Eastern Studies, in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. This was a fully accredited Master’s degree program which focused on the many facets of the yoga tradition: hatha yoga postures, stress reduction and breathing exercises, diet, physiology, ethics, philosophy, Sanskrit studies, meditation and research.</p> <p>These days I'm still writing, teaching, and introducing people to their Vedic horoscope. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area where my husband, Johnathan Brown, shares my passion for the Vedic tradition.</p> <p>To learn more about <strong>Linda</strong> and her work, visit: <a href= "http://thousandsuns.users.sonic.net/">http://thousandsuns.users.sonic.net/</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #60</strong>, my guest is certified life coach, mindfulness meditation teacher, author, and blogger <strong>Ora Nadrich</strong>.<br /> <br /> <strong>Ora</strong> joined me for a great chat about her new book, <em><strong>Says Who? How One Simple Question Can Change the Way You Think Forever</strong></em>, how her own life story — including her sister's nervous breakdown when <strong>Ora</strong> was 14 years old influenced her work, and the Says Who? Method she developed.<br /> <br /> In the book, she vividly illustrates and breaks down her simple yet highly effective method, based on the principle that while we all face obstacles and negative thoughts in our lives, it is not enough to simply examine and be aware of them — we must question and challenge them in order to bring about true change.<br /> <br /> <em>“We think 60,000–70,000 thoughts a day, and sadly, it’s the negative ones we tend to hear the loudest. But using a set of daily, simple questions, we can stop them the instant they pop up to sabotage us. It’s as simple a practice as brushing your teeth.”</em><br /> <br /> About: <strong>Ora Nadrich</strong> is a certified Life Coach, and Mindfulness Meditation teacher. She is a frequent blogger for the Huffington Post on Mindfulness, and leads workshops on “Living a Mindful Life.”<br /> <br /> Ora was an actress and screenwriter, where she worked in film, episodic television, and commercials for more than a decade, which she feels provided her vast experience in exploring motivation and the process of self-discovery. During that time, she simultaneously embarked on a two-decade psychological and spiritual journey towards self-awareness and transformation.<br /> <br /> Ora retired from acting, and devoted her time to studying the workings of the mind. On her psychological and spiritual journey she explored Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and a multi-year, intensive study of various disciplines and techniques, including the Technology of Change with Robert Lorenz, and extensive Jungian analysis.<br /> <br /> She studied Kabbalah and Buddhism, and met some of the finest spiritual teachers and leaders like, Gurumayi of Siddha Yoga, Sonam Kazi, the Dalai Lama’s interpreter, and, ultimately, His Holiness himself, the Dalai Lama. Her exploration of self-realization continues today.<br /> <br /> Ora lives with her husband, Jeff, and two sons, Jake and Benjamin in Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> To learn more about <strong>Ora</strong> and her work, visit: <a href="http://www.oranadrich.com/" target= "_blank">http://www.oranadrich.com/</a>.</p>]]></description>

The book is a practical and provocative modern-day manual for the pursuit of a life well lived.<br /> <br /> We also talked about human potential; the incident at age 17 that planted the seeds for his work with the Good Life Project; the art of a great interview; vulnerability; Elizabeth Gilbert's "secret"; Camp GLP; the concept of the three buckets; teaching that thing we each need to learn most; how 9-11 motivated him to live life NOW; and MUCH more!<br /> <br /> <em>“If I'm asking people to be open to ideas, I need to model that same state myself.”</em><br /> <br /> About: A dad, husband, serial entrepreneur, growth strategist and award-winning author, <strong>Jonathan Fields</strong> inspires possibility.<br /> <br /> He currently runs mission-driven media and education venture, Good Life Project®, where he and his team lead a global community in the quest to live more meaningful, connected and vital lives.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #57</strong>, my guest is author and psychotherapist <strong>Susan Anderson</strong>, who has devoted more than 30 years of clinical experience and research to working with the victims of abandonment trauma, grief, and loss and teaches people around the world how to overcome abandonment and its aftermath of self-sabotaging patterns.<br /> <br /> <strong>Susan</strong> joined me for a powerful chat about her new book, <em>The Abandonment Recovery Workbook: Guidance through the Five Stages of Healing from Abandonment, Heartbreak, and Loss,</em> as well as how her own life journey paved the way for her most powerful work, and MUCH more!<br /> <br /> <em>“Learning the steps to take after surviving a great loss is a hopeful process. You discover your ability to benefit from the experience rather than be diminished by it,” says Anderson. “Many of you are going through heartbreak, getting separated or divorced, or feel isolated and alone. Many of you are grieving over someone close to you who has died. Some seek recovery from childhood wounds that impinge on the quality of your current life. But our journey will take us beyond the specifics of your loss, all the way to the underlying source of the fear and despair —abandonment — the crux of the human condition.”</em><br /> <br /> About: <strong>Susan Anderson</strong> is a psychotherapist who has devoted over 30 years of clinical experience and research to working with the victims of abandonment trauma, grief, and loss.

Her five universal stages of abandonment recovery (Shattering, Withdrawal, Internalizing, Rage, and Lifting) are based upon scientific findings related to the psychobiology of separation and attachment. Through her books and public appearances, she shares her own experiences with abandonment, grief, and recovery, speaking passionately from personal and professional experience.<br /> <br /> In addition to her national tours to promote abandonment recovery, she continues in private practice in Manhattan and Long Island.<br /> <br /> To learn more about <strong>Susan</strong> and her work, visit: <a href= "http://www.abandonment.net/">http://www.abandonment.net/</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #55</strong>, a special "Soul Series" interview, my guest is preeminent theologian and bestselling author <strong>Matthew Fox</strong>, a popularizer of Western mysticism.</p> <p><strong>Matthew</strong> joined me for an enlightening chat about his new book <strong>A WAY TO GOD: Thomas Merton's Creation Spirituality Journey</strong>, the Cosmic Christ, the divine feminine, eco-justice, and MUCH more!</p> <p><em>“A WAY TO GOD is a powerful book about Merton’s pioneering work in deep ecumenism and interfaith; about his essential teachings on mixing contemplation and action; and about how the vision of thirteenth century mystic Meister Eckhart profoundly influenced both Merton and Creation Spirituality, which Fox has long espoused and written about.</em>”</p> <p><em>“Merton was above all a man of prayer, a thinker who challenged the certitudes of his time and opened new horizons for souls and for the church. He was also a man of dialogue, a promoter of peace between peoples and religions.”</em> —Pope Francis</p> <p>About: <strong>Matthew Fox</strong> is a preeminent scholar and popularizer of Western mysticism, who became an Episcopal priest after being expelled from the Catholic Dominican Order by Cardinal Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict.</p> <p>He holds a doctorate in spirituality from the Institut Catholique de Paris and has authored 32 books on spirituality and contemporary culture that have been translated into 60 languages.</p> <p>He's devoted 45 years to developing and teaching the tradition of Creation Spirituality and in doing so has reinvented forms of education and worship. His work is inclusive of today’s science and world spiritual traditions and has awakened millions to the much neglected earth-based mystical tradition of the West.</p> <p>He has helped to rediscover Hildegard of Bingen, Meister Eckhart, and Thomas Aquinas. Among his books are Original Blessing, The Coming of the Cosmic Christ, The Reinvention of Work, A Spirituality Named Compassion and Meister Eckhart: A Mystic-Warrior for Our Times.</p> <p>In his latest book <strong>A WAY TO GOD: Thomas Merton's Creation Spirituality Journey</strong>, he reimmersed himself in Merton’s journals, poetry, and religious writings, finding that Merton’s marriage of mysticism and prophecy, contemplation and action closely paralleled that of Meister Eckhart, the thirteenth-century mystic who inspired Fox’s own Creation Spirituality.</p> <p>To learn more about <strong>Matthew</strong> and his work, visit: <a href= "http://www.matthewfox.org">http://www.matthewfox.org</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #51</strong>, my guest is
bestselling novelist and "striving yogi" <strong>Karan
Bajaj</strong>. Born and raised in the Indian Himalayas,
<strong>Karan</strong> now lives in Brooklyn, New York. Via his
website and thriving online community, he shares his attempts to
live a Yogic life in the heart of the material world.</p>
<p><strong>Karan</strong> joined me for a great conversation about
his new book <em>The Yoga of Max's Discontent</em>, which was
published by Random House on May 3rd 2016. The book, called "The
greatest adventure of our Generation" by The Daily Telegraph was
inspired by his one year sabbatical traveling from Europe to India
by road and learning yoga and meditation in the Himalayas.</p>
<p><em>"Growing up in the Indian Himalayas, I saw a steady stream
of professionals — doctors, engineers, lawyers — leave their
careers and live in ashrams and caves near my village. I never
fully understood their motives. But 20 years later, I had the same
strong urge to spend an extended time in silence and find a deep
center of stillness within me after my mother’s untimely death from
cancer."</em></p>
<p>About: <strong>Karan Bajaj</strong> is a bestselling novelist
and striving yogi. Born and raised in India, he has trained as a
Hatha Yoga teacher in the Sivananda ashram in South India and
learned meditation in the Himalayas. He is the author of the novels
Johnny Gone Down and Keep off the Grass, both of which were No. 1
bestsellers in India.</p>
<p>His first worldwide novel, <em>The Yoga of Max's
Discontent</em>, was published by Random House on May 3rd 2016. The
book, called "The greatest adventure of our Generation" by The
Daily Telegraph was inspired by his one year sabbatical traveling
from Europe to India by road and learning yoga and meditation in
the Himalayas.</p>
<p>He's has also worked in senior executive roles at companies like
Procter & Gamble and the Boston Consulting Group and was named
among Ad Age's "Top 40 Under 40 executives" in the US.</p>
<p>About <strong>The Yoga of Max's Discontent</strong>: A violent
encounter on the streets of Manhattan forces Wall Street banker
Maximus Pzoras to confront questions about suffering and mortality
that have dogged him since his mother’s death. His search for a
mentor takes him to the farthest reaches of India, where he
encounters a mysterious night market, almost freezes to death on a
hike up the Himalayas and finally, finds himself in an ashram in a
small drought stricken village in South India where strange things
begin to happen to him.</p>
<p>But are Yogis who walk on water, do impossible poses, and live
agelessly for 200 years the stuff of fiction or fact? Can a flesh
and blood man ever truly achieve nirvana? Max struggles to overcome
his rational skepticism and the pull of family tugging him back
home. In a final bid for answers, he embarks on dangerous solitary
meditation in a freezing Himalayan cave. Will Max penetrate the
truth of human suffering, or is enlightenment just a new age
illusion?</p>

<p>Throughout the various threads of his work, he helps creatives, self-starters and everyday yogis use their words to live the stories they want to be telling.</p>
<p><strong>Dave</strong> joined me for a great conversation about conscious life evolution, creativity, the freedom of NOT knowing, what he's learned from teaching yoga, habit change, cultivating the right container for personal and creative growth, the notion of "service", the importance of tribe, karma vs. dharma, and much more!</p>

He helps self-starters use their words, stories and voices to create healing within and share love in our world. In his former life, Dave was an aspiring presidential speechwriter and sought a path of leadership after 9/11/2001 to become a part of positive change in our world. He abandoned his career in 2009 to dedicate his life to his writing, through which he knew he could lead by example.</p>
<p>Today, as a teacher, workshop leader and founder of an online writers' group,<strong> The Literati Writers</strong> (<a href="LiteratiWriters.com">LiteratiWriters.com</a>), Dave teaches conscientious creatives, self-starters and everyday-yogis how to cultivate their gifts, speak their truth and embody their deepest values.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #48</strong>, my guest is Zen teacher and author <strong>Brad Warner</strong>, who is also a punk bassist, filmmaker, Japanese-monster-movie marketer, and popular blogger. <br /><br /><strong>Brad</strong> joined me for a great conversation about his new book <strong><em>Don’t Be a Jerk: And Other Practical Advice from Dōgen, Japan’s Greatest Zen Master</em></strong> <em>(New World Library)</em>, in which he paraphrases Dōgen’s work for modern times in his trademark style that readers have come to know and love, bringing his wisdom on topics like feminism, reincarnation, and the debate between science and religion to the forefront. <br /><br />We also discuss Dōgen's great work The Shōbōgenzō, <strong>Brad's</strong> life story, a brief history of Zen, and philosophical topics such as the notions of "no self", "not knowing", and the question of why we need to practice, if as the Buddha says, "We are all perfect just as we are."<br /><br />About: <strong>Brad Warner</strong> is an ordained Zen teacher and author of the books <em>There Is No God And He Is Always With You</em> (2013), <em>Sex Sin and Zen</em> (2010), <em>Zen Wrapped in Karma Dipped in Chocolate</em> (2009), <em>Sit Down and Shut Up</em> (2007) and <em>Hardcore Zen</em> (2004).</p>
<p>He’s also a writer for the Suicide Girls website, bass player for the hardcore punk rock group 0DFx (aka Zero Defex), star of the movies “Shoplifting From American Apparel” and “Zombie Bounty Hunter M.D.,” director of the film “Cleveland’s Screaming!” and former vice president of the US branch of the company founded by the man who created Godzilla.<br /><br />Born in Hamilton, Ohio in 1964, in 1972, <strong>Brad’s</strong> family relocated to Nairobi, Kenya. When he returned three years later, nothing about rural Ohio seemed quite the same anymore. In 1982, Brad joined 0DFx (Zero Defex), famous for an eighteen-second burst of noise titled “Drop the A-Bomb On Me.” 0DFx recently reunited and has a new CD out.<br /><br />While still playing hardcore punk, <strong>Brad</strong> became involved in Zen Buddhism. The realistic, no BS philosophy reminded him of the attitude the punks took towards music. He made it to Japan in 1993 where he began studying the philosophy with an iconoclastic rebel Zen Master named Gudo Nishijima. After a few years, Nishijima decided to make Brad his successor as a teacher of Zen.<br /><br />To learn more about <strong>Brad</strong> and his work, visit: <a href="http://hardcorezen.info/" target="_blank">http://hardcorezen.info/</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<title>43: Lea Ann Mallett on Everyday Activism: The Beauty and Power of Small Actions</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #43</strong>, my guest is activist, leadership coach, and wild woman <strong>Lea Ann Mallett</strong>. <strong>Lea Ann</strong> has spent nearly 30 years as an activist with a focus on environmental and social justice issues, including sitting a tree for three days in an ancient forest in British Columbia to protest clearcut logging there and fifteen years as a nonprofit leader. She's since embarked on life as a midlife mom, having two children in her early 40s.</p>
<p>Over time, she came to realize that ALL of us are changing the world, every day, through "<em>The Beauty and Power of Small Actions</em>." Her philosophy is that <em>"every interaction we have with another person, the planet, and the other beings is an opportunity to change the world for the better."</em></p>
<p>About <strong>Lea Ann Mallett</strong>: I have always been convinced that what we do each day in the world changes the world.</p>
<p>From my years as an activist, sitting in an ancient cedar tree for three days to bring international attention to the clearcutting of old growth forests to leading activist blockades in the forests of northern Canada, to my work with street involved youth and my years as a nonprofit leader, I KNOW I have made a difference and I have seen so many people make a difference too.</p>
<p>I have been an intrepid world traveller, heading off to Kenya and Tanzania on my own to go on safari, backpacking across Central America, exploring the street markets of Beijing and roaming through Canada and the U.S. during months-long road trips in my old car with my belongings in the back seat.</p>
<p>I have been a successful activist, collaborating with other environmental leaders in creating thousands of hectares of new protected parks in Ontario, delivering HIV/AIDS education when the crisis was in its earliest stages, changing policies on the federal, provincial and local levels and raising international media awareness on key environmental and social justice issues.</p>
<p>I have successfully led two nonprofit charities, quadrupling the budget of the most recent organization I led and exponentially increasing its reach and impact.</p>
<p>What I also know is that it is easy to lose track of that creative edge, that feeling of having an incredible purpose, being exactly where you are supposed to be. The grind of daily life, the pressures of leading an organization, the wonderful, crazy challenges of being a parent - we can end up on auto-pilot, not creating our greatest impact or living our lives as fully as is possible. I found myself feeling disconnected from my purpose, my creativity and my purpose after taking on the double challenge of becoming a midlife mom and becoming an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I went on a quest to find the best sources of inspiration, creativity, passion and energy to fuel my life, my activism and my business. I studied with world famous coaches, visionary thinkers and successful entrepreneurs to understand their magic so I could meld it with my own.</p>
<p>I am more powerful and create more impact in my life now than I ever have! My personal experiences with powerful coaching and my studies revealed that the limitations that I put on myself are choices and I can choose differently.</p>
<p>The more you become YOU, the more comfortable you become with who you are and tap into your unique talents and passions, the happier and more fulfilled you will be, AND the more impact you will make in your family, your community and your world.</p>

As an artist, photographer, life coach + mentor, I’m redefining what it means to be a SUPERHERO — ‘cause in my world, it’s got nothing to do with capes, spandex or sidekicks and everything to do with tenderness, intuition & baby steps of bravery.<br /><br />Back in 1995 when I was living in New Orleans, a tarot card reader told me that I was an artist. At the time, I held an oh-so practical degree in Economics, and rarely shared my passion for painting + photography with anyone. (But then, you can’t fool a good psychic.)<br /><br />She also said that my real work was as a healer — that I would heal people through my art. All of the hairs on my arms pricked up. All I could think was: Yes! Yes! But how? I never forgot that wise woman <em>(she is still my spiritual advisor to this day)</em> or that quiet promise I made to myself — to fulfill my true calling, and be a healing force in the world.<br /><br />But first, I had to start with myself. I began painting every day.<br /><br />I began painting . . . to find freedom + flexibility. To find the joy in the mess. To keep myself feeling engaged and alive and curious — not necessarily to save the world, but simply to fully experience it.<br /><br />But that’s the beauty of doing what we love — we delight ourselves first, and we can’t help but serve others in the process.<br /><br />To me, a <strong>Superhero</strong> is someone who invites her wisest, bravest, most alive self to come out and play, every day.<br /><br />This doesn’t mean having all the answers, being unshakably strong, or performing dramatic feats of heroism.It means being someone like you – and someone like me.<br /><br />Someone who is anxious and uncertain, oh, say, 50 – 80% of the time. Someone who wants to live a juicy, full, courageous life — but doesn’t always know how. Someone who understands that vulnerability just might be the greatest superpower of all.<br /><br />“To me, a <strong>Superhero</strong> is someone who invites her wisest, bravest, most alive self to come out and play, every day."<br /><br /><strong>Superhero Life</strong> is a love letter + resourceful playground for all my fellow creative superheroes. Moms who want to paint. Painters who want to write. Writers who want to travel. And travelers who want to come home.<br /><br />I’ve been writing + teaching online for nearly 10 years — back when the web was a much quieter place. My intention is to make <strong>Superhero Life</strong> feel like a virtual oasis — a space for unhurried healing, beauty, and joy to unfold.<br /><br />To learn more about <strong>Andrea</strong> and her work: <a href="http://superherolife.com/" target="_blank">http://superherolife.com/</a>.</p>]]></description>

<p>About the book: <em><strong>Succulent Wild Love: Six Powerful Habits for Feeling More Love More Often</strong></em> combines<strong> SARK's</strong> trademark creativity with the more left-brain psychological perspective <strong>Dr. John</strong> brings to the table. Using real life examples, they offer six simple but profound habits for feeling more love more often that speak to readers at every stage in a relationship — whether they are looking for love, happily partnered, or in the midst of uncoupling.</p>
<p>About <strong>SARK</strong>: I’m <strong>SARK</strong>, also known as <strong>Susan Ariel Rainbow Kennedy</strong>- which spells SARK. The name was given to me by the author Henry Miller in the early 1980’s. Soon after, I started taking notes as spirit spoke through me. Those notes turned into all the books and art and everything SARKian. I love representing the SARK spirit and I know that that spirit is inside everyone!</p>
<p>Throughout the course of my life and career as an international expert in personal well-being and transformation, my name has become synonymous with transformation, color, healing, movement & FUN.</p>
<p>I’m inviting you to play and connect with me, letting gladness expand into your heart and touch that place deep inside of you- your inner Wise Self- that already knows everything you’ll ever need in this world is within you.</p>
<p>I’ve written countless books and created programs that I offer to provide a powerfull, grounded and practical approach to feeling glad more often, transforming what hurts into what helps and living a life of joyfull creative expression. No matter what!</p>
<p>About <strong>Dr. John</strong>: <strong>Dr. John Waddell</strong> has spent over 30 years as a practicing psychologist helping individuals and couples lead more joyful lives.</p>
<p>While a psychologist by training, he also spent many years studying metaphysics. This enables him to integrate the tools from both these ﬁelds to help people create richer, more fulﬁlling lives.</p>
<p>His interest in metaphysics led him to specialize in the practical application of the Law of Attraction. And he wrote two novels showing how the characters are able to consciously change their lives using this approach. (<em>John and Jeanie Fly: Living the Law of Attraction</em> and<em> John and Jeanie Fly: Our World and The Law of Attraction</em>).</p>
<p>In understanding his own life and in working with others, he begins with the attitude that we have the power to change any experience, and we have the ability to rendezvous with more joyful and fulfilling experiences, whether it’s with someone close to us, a physical situation, or a desire for more abundance. John created significant wealth and is exploring the true nature of wealth in all forms.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong> was able to transform the painful loss of his wife in 2011, into a marriage where the honeymoon never ended.</p>
<p>His vision was to continue to grow, to be with someone in a relationship that was just as nourishing and would continue to new levels. John kept his vision and in 2012 met Susan Kennedy (<strong>SARK</strong>). Their lifestyles and spiritual connection are uplifting in more ways than John had even imagined. John and Susan live and create happily together in San Francisco.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #39</strong>, my guest is intuitive strategist, corporate change-maker, and life-driven business mentor<a href="http://susanlustenberger.com/">Susan Lustenberger</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong> joins me for another great "Soul Session" — a powerful conversation on abundance, manifesting the life you want, the power of gratitude, moving past obstacles, mindfulness and meditation, the "laws of the Universe", and much more!</p>
<p>About: <strong>Susan Lustenberger</strong> is the only master teacher and intuitive strategist that makes activating universal laws a lifestyle for conscious people and businesses who are weary of theory and hungry for results at a time when the hope of abundance is more common than the experience of it.</p>
<p>She was born Clairvoyant and Claircognizant. Through major life transformations, she learned more about her intuitive strengths and realized that she was put here to help. Along with these gifts came the ability to manifest and help others manifest vast prosperity and abundance in their lives through consciousness.</p>
<p>Through this work, she has been lucky enough to work with an array of clients from guiding pro athletes, movie executives, C.E.O’s on various goals and manifestations to working privately with individuals seeking happiness, answers and authenticity in their personal lives.</p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong> is a Natural energy 3. What does that mean? Well we each are born with on of nine different natural energy centers and each one indicates a different universal strength. A Natural energy 3 soul-type is able to connect with a person’s soul (their deepest dreams and desires) and directs the energy into the Universe for manifesting. It is her SuperPower!</p>

<p><strong>Cynthia</strong> joins me for a powerful and timely conversation in the wake of the recent Paris tragedy and other acts of violence around the world.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>"Creative Expression as a Force for Good,"</em></strong> we discuss her recent piece <em>"Paris, Oh Paris"</em>, which strongly resonated with me and many other creatives, as well as learning to co-exist with uncomfortable circumstances, the need for creativity during tumultuous times, her work helping people getting creatively unstuck, travel as a vehicle for greater understanding in the world, and more!</p>
<p>About <strong>Cynthia</strong>: A coach since 1999, I've helped thousands of creative people get their ideas out of their heads and into the world. Whether it's a book to be written, an idea brought to market or a quest to find authentic voice and expression, I help people get out of their own way so they can make things that matter.</p>
<p>I lead creativity workshop in Colorado and Europe that facilitate not just insights but life-changing actions. I am available to lead one-five day tours for corporate groups that need to get out of the box and refresh their creativity.</p>
<p>I'm a coach and trainer for Jonathan Fields' Good Life Project Immersion program.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #37</strong>, my guest is bestselling author and world-renowned "dream explorer" <strong>Robert Moss</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Robert</strong> joins me for a fascinating and lively conversation in which we discuss fun ways to bring more magic and play to your life; his new book <em><strong>Sidewalk Oracles: Playing with Signs, Symbols, and Synchronicity in Everyday Life</strong></em>; living with a sense of a larger purpose and story; becoming a kairomancer, and much more!</p>
<p>About: <strong>Robert Moss</strong> is the author of Sidewalk Oracles and numerous other books about dreaming, shamanism, and imagination. He is a novelist, poet, and independent scholar, and the creator of <strong>Active Dreaming</strong>, an original synthesis of dreamwork and shamanism. He leads creative and shamanic adventures all over the world.</p>
<p>About <em><strong>Sidewalk Oracles: Playing with Signs, Symbols, and Synchronicity in Everyday Life</strong></em>: Synchronicity is when the universe gets personal. Through this book of games and enchanting stories, you’ll learn how to monitor the play of coincidence and the symbolic resonance of incidents in daily life in order to tap into the deeper logic of events, receive extraordinary counsel, and have wonderful fun.</p>
<p>You will be invited to become a <strong>kairomancer</strong>: someone who is poised to catch the messages in special moments when synchronicity is in play — and to take action to seize the opportunities those moments present. To be a kairomancer, you need to trust your feelings as you walk the roads of this world, to develop your personal science of shivers, and to recognize in your gut and your skin that you know far more than you hold on the surface of consciousness.</p>
<p>This is a way of real magic, which is the art of bringing gifts from a deeper world into this one. Follow it, and you will put a champagne fizz of enchantment into your everyday life.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been psychically-curious? The idea that the deceased can communicate with their loved ones certainly intrigues me! <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #33</strong> is a special "Soul" Edition <em>(periodic explorations of such topics)</em>; my guest is psychic medium <strong>Bill Philipps</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong> joins me for a fascinating and inspiring conversation about his unique work and how he became one of the world’s most renowned psychic mediums. Plus we discuss his brand new book <strong>Expect the Unexpected: Bringing Peace, Healing, and Hope from the Other Side</strong>.</p>
<p>About: <strong>Bill Philipps</strong> is a psychic medium who helps the deceased communicate with their loved ones on earth. Bill’s fresh, upbeat, and direct approach perfectly complements his warm and relatable demeanor, captivating audiences worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong> studied opera at the san Francisco conservatory of Music and graduated in 2008. He found that music, in a deeply spiritual way, enabled him to tune in to and further develop his psychic-medium abilities, which dated to his childhood. He gave readings while attending the conservatory and, after graduating, professionally pursued his true calling.</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong> has appeared on such television shows as Dr. Phil, and his clients include numerous celebrities. He conducts individ-ual readings in person, by phone, or via skype. He also offers small-group readings and large-audience readings throughout the united states. He lives in southern california.</p>
<p>His new book <strong>Expect the Unexpected: Bringing Peace, Healing, and Hope from the Other Side</strong> <em>(New World Library)</em> is a down-to-earth, honest account of how he became one of the world’s most renowned psychic mediums. He explains how spirits communicate with him; why he first denied and then embraced his gift; and how anyone can learn to recognize the signs spirit loved ones use to offer them guidance.</p>
<p>Part memoir, part explanation, and part inspiring testimonies from clients, the book provides the “unexpected”: insight, wisdom, and evidence that there is a life beyond this one and that we are never alone.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Life on Purpose Episode #32</strong> is the long-promised return of the<strong> LoP Round-Table</strong>! For RT#2, I was joined by <strong>Kyle Wood</strong>, <strong>Elloa Atkinson</strong>, and <strong>Toku</strong>. Collectively, they are coaches, trainers, and thought leaders in the mindfulness and personal development communities. They each write, podcast, and speak about mindfulness, vulnerability, and living purposeful lives and they each help others do the same. <br /><br />They joined me for a fantastic deep-dive conversation on the topic of vulnerability — what that really means, how that applies to our lives, holding space for others, and some practical tips for being more vulnerable each and every day.<br /><br /><em>NOTE: I was incredibly fortunate to meet each of my guests at an amazing gathering that I've attended the past two years called <strong>Camp Good LIfe Project</strong>. This conversation began as a meet-up there and I thought it would be incredibly valuable to continue the conversation here on my show. I hope you agree!</em><br /><br /><strong>LoP Round-Table #2 Guests</strong><br /><br />About <strong>Kyle Wood</strong>: Hi, my name is Kyle Wood. And this is scary as hell. The last couple of years have been really challenging for me. It seemed like the work I had done over the years before to try and be a better man <em>(think exercise, meditation, gratefulness practice, etc)</em> had come undone. I had put up my shields and walls to protect myself during this time.<br /><br />When I was ready to make some awesome new friends and grow my business, something was stopping me. It was my walls; while they did a good job protecting me at one time, they were now stopping me from having the kinds of connections I desired. And I had no idea how to tear those walls down.<br /><br />Until <em>(with the help of a coach, psychologist and friends)</em> it hit me. The only way to start tearing down those walls was to start being a LOT more vulnerable. In fact, every success I’ve had this year has come through a moment of being vulnerable. And I want more of that.<br /><br />I’m married, to my amazing wife Zoe. I’m from Melbourne, Australia. I was (still am) a personal trainer. During my time as a trainer I worked on a fun side hustle that I call <em>Bootcamp Ideas</em>. This is now my full time income and allows me ‘location independence’. I still like living in one place at a time, but it is nice to be able to visit family and friends on short notice<br /><br />To learn more about <strong>Kyle</strong>, visit: <a href="http://heartmen.net" target="_blank">http://heartmen.net</a>.<br /><br />About <strong>Elloa Atkinson</strong>: I am a wife, a life-changing coach and entrepreneur, a dancer, a writer, a daughter sister and auntie, and a mum to my lovely rescue dog, Molly Miracle the Westie.<br /><br />I am driven by a vision that stirs the depths of my soul. Through a process of deep coaching, <em>Fearless Expression</em> challenges and my podcast, <em>The Academy of Miracles</em>, I reunite people with their whole self; that I coach + mentor brave people through a process of profound inner and outer transformation.<br /><br />I do this work because I spent the first 18 years and 6 months of my life heading towards a dark night of the soul, and the last 13+ years learning how to live again with authenticity, vulnerability, bravery and intimacy.<br /><br />To learn more about <strong>Elloa,</strong> visit: <a href="http://www.elloaatkinson.com" target="_blank">http://www.elloaatkinson.com</a>.<br /><br /><strong>About Toku</strong>: Toku is short for “Gentoku”, which is the name I received while living at a Zen monastery. In my tradition when you take Jukai and become a card carrying Buddhist, your teachers give you a name. The name they gave me was “Gentoku”, which means “manifesting virtue or present sincerity”.<br /><br />I do my best on my blog and in my training to live up to that name and to help other people embody their best selves as well.<br /><br />I’m originally from Tennessee, but now I live in Portland, OR. I work as a Mindfulness Based executive coach and have clients in Portland, as well as all over the US and Canada.<br /><br />I’m a writer and thought leader in the mindfulness community. My writing has been published on sites such as <em>Tiny Buddha</em>, <em>The Change Blog</em>, and <em>Sea Change</em>.<br /><br />To learn more about <strong>Toku</strong>, visit: <a href="http://unexecutive.com" target="_blank">http://unexecutive.com</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<title>31: Tess Vigeland on Leap: Leaving a Job with No Plan B to Find the Career and Life You Really Want</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #31</strong>, my guest is veteran journalist, speaker, and author <strong>Tess Vigeland</strong>, a well-known voice to millions of American radio listeners as the longtime host with public radio’s Marketplace. In the fall of 2012, she quit what she considered her "dream job" without having a Plan B lined up, or even any idea what she wanted to do next. This set the stage for what happened next...</p>
<p><strong>Tess </strong>joins me for a great conversation about career, life, vulnerability, her life changing speech at WDS 2013 in Portland, and her brand new book<strong> <em>Leap: Leaving a Job with No Plan B to Find the Career and Life You Really Want</em></strong>.</p>
<p>About Tess: <strong>Tess Vigeland</strong> is a veteran journalist, and a well-known voice to millions of American radio listeners. She is the CEO of Tess Vigeland Productions, a Los Angeles-based multi-media company. Tess spent 11 years as an anchor for public radio’s Marketplace, including six hosting the personal finance show Marketplace Money. Her first book, titled “Leap Without A Net: Leaving A Job With No Plan B,” is due out August 25, 2015, from Random House Harmony. When she’s not locked away writing, Tess can be heard as a backup anchor for NPR’s All Things Considered, as well as KCRW’s To The Point and KPCC’s Take Two in Los Angeles. She also serves as a professional emcee, speaker, panel moderator, and interviewer for conferences and other events. Tess also writes for The New York Times and The Guardian, among numerous other publications.</p>
<p>About Leap: Until recently, <strong>Tess Vigeland</strong> was a longtime host with public radio’s Marketplace; it was a rewarding, high-status job, and Tess was very good at it—but she’d begun to feel restless. Without any definite, clear sense of what she wanted to do next (but an absolute certainty that what she’d been doing was no longer truly satisfying), she walked away from her dream job and into a vast unknown. Suddenly she was no longer “Marketplace’s Tess Vigeland,” she was just Tess Vigeland.</p>
<p>For the multitude of Americans who change jobs mid-career (by choice or circumstance), the growing legions of freelance workers, and the entrepreneurially-minded who see self-employment as an increasingly more appealing and viable option, Tess Vigeland has created a personal and well-researched account of leaping without a net. With her signature humor, she writes honestly about the fear, uncertainty, and risk involved in leaving the traditional workforce—but also the excitement, resources, and possibilities that are on the other side.</p>
<p>Leap is also about finding a new definition of success. Tess poses the important question – “Who am I without my job?" She shares the accounts of people who struggled with this question before and after they took their own leap of faith, and ended up finding out more about themselves than they’d thought possible. Success doesn’t have to be measured by salary or a traditional career path, as so many of us are conditioned to think, but by your own happiness and fulfillment.</p>
<p>Part memoir and part field guide, this book offers a funny, thoughtful, and provocative look at how to find satisfaction and success when pursuing a career less ordinary.</p>

			<title>29: Marc Allen on Tantra for the West- A Direct Path to Living the Life of Your Dreams</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #29</strong>, my guest is <strong>Marc Allen</strong>, the internationally renowned author and president/publisher/co-founder of <strong>New World Library, </strong>which has published numerous classics in the personal growth field including Eckhart Tolle's <em>The Power of Now</em>, Shakti Gawain’s <em>Creative Visualization</em>, and <em>The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success</em> by Deepak Chopra.</p>
<p>Marc joins me for a deep and inspirational conversation about the updated edition of <strong>Tantra for the West: A Direct Path to Living the Life of Your Dreams</strong>, in which he introduces a brand new way to experience the ancient and yet modern tradition that is called tantra.</p>
<p>About: <strong>Marc Allen</strong> is an internationally renowned author and president and publisher of New World Library, which he co-founded (with Shakti Gawain) in 1977. He has guided the company from a small start-up with no capital to its current position as one of the leading independent publishers in the country.</p>
<p>Marc is a well-known musician and composer as well, having released five albums of his music for the label he co-founded with Sky Canyon and Robert Powell, Watercourse Media.</p>
<p>His latest book is The Greatest Secret of All. It may be Marc's most important book, because it gives us not only one of the clearest explanations of the "secret" of creating what you want in life, but also the far greater secrets of a life well-lived, a life of happiness, inner peace, ease, and fulfillment, where you contribute to making the world a better place for all.</p>
<p>His previous book, The Type-Z Guide to Success, has been released both in print form and as an innovative multi-media ebook. His most popular book is The Millionaire Course: A Visionary Plan for Creating the Life of Your Dreams. It is an entire course, filled with keys to success.</p>
<p>Over the years, he has written and published several other books, including Visionary Business: An Entrepreneur’s Guide to Success, which brought his principles to those in the business world, and A Visionary Life, which remains one of the best books ever written on personal fulfillment. He has also published The Ten Percent Solution: Simple Steps to Improve Our Lives and the World, and produced a popular audio CD, Stress Reduction and Creative Meditations.</p>
<p>His books, audios, and workshops have been highly rewarding — even life-changing — experiences for thousands of people, and he has produced a 12-part audio version of his powerful seminar called The Success with Ease In-Depth Course.</p>
<p>He lives in northern California, with his wife and two children. Marc and his wife Aurilene have founded the Brazil Hope Foundation to help street kids in Brazil.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #28,</strong> my guest is <strong>Michelle Jones</strong>, a former traditional-model college professor who is starting her own college called the <strong>Wayfinding Academy</strong> in Portland, Oregon. <strong>Michelle</strong> joins me to discuss higher education re-imagined for the 21st Century, the importance of asking questions, passion-based leadership, and the crucial importance of real-world skills and experience.</p>
<p>Many listeners also know <strong>Michelle</strong> as "Michelle the Magician", the behind-the-scenes guru at the annual World Domination Summit (WDS), that was the inspiration behind my first podcast Radio Enso. We talk about that experience and how she's applying what she learned there to her new venture.</p>
<p>About: <strong>Michelle Jones</strong> is a former traditional model college professor who is starting her own college, the <strong>Wayfinding Academy</strong>. Her 15 years teaching leadership and organizational behavior courses at colleges and universities across the country has prepared her well to re-imagine what higher education can be with this new endeavor. She is also drawing on her experience organizing events and communities with TEDxMtHood and the World Domination Summit and founding non-profit organizations such as SuperThank.</p>
<p>About the <strong>Wayfinding Academy</strong>: We're a group of professors, students, higher education professionals, non-profit and community leaders, and everyday citizens with over 100 years of experience in higher education who know college can be the incredible experience it promises to be.</p>
<p>Right now too many students can't afford college, drop out, or even finish college without finding direction or purposes in their lives. We believe there is a better way. We are starting our own college. A new model for higher education.</p>
<p>The <strong>Wayfinding Academy</strong> will be an affordable, 2-year college based in Portland, Oregon focused on what matters most in education: real world experience, community support and individual passion. Students won’t be asked to choose a major from a list, they’ll be supported in discovering their own personal mission. They’ll take core classes building skills that will serve them on any path. And they’ll work with advisors to create handcrafted experiences meaningful to them and build a portfolio through real experiences.</p>

<p>When she’s not seeing clients, <strong>Kim</strong> writes a psychological advice column for the New York, Boston, and Philadelphia Metro daily newspapers http://www.metro.us/newyork, which have an aggregate circulation of roughly 4,000,000 readers. She has also worked as an adjunct professor for the Long Island University’s School of Social Work and served as a Guest Lecturer for NYU’s Post-Graduate Social Work and Spiritual Care certificate program. She also completed a year-long certification at the Association for Spirituality and Psychotherapy in New York.</p>
<p>Before pursuing her MSW at the University of Maryland, <strong>Kim</strong> worked as a journalist for a chain of weekly newspapers in the Bay Area. Subsequently, she has written dozens of freelance articles, including cover stories, for major Jewish newspapers, including The Jewish Week, the Baltimore Jewish Times, and the Northern California Jewish Bulletin.</p>

			<title>25: Emilie Wapnick - Why Some of Us Don’t Have ONE True Calling and Multipotentiality</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #25</strong>, my guest is artist, entrepreneur, writer, speaker, and coach <strong>Emilie Wapnick. Emilie </strong>joins me to discuss what those she calls multipotentialites, people who have many different interests and creative pursuits in life. We also discuss her recent TEDxBend talk entitled<strong> <em>Why Some of Us Don’t Have ONE True Calling</em></strong>, overcoming fear and confidence challenges, and how she lives a life on purpose.</p>
<p>About: <strong>Emilie Wapnick</strong> is an artist, entrepreneur, writer, speaker, and coach. She says she was blessed with so many interests that she was unable to pick just one. She studied music, visual arts, film production and law, and graduated from the Law Faculty at McGill University. After years of feeling anxious about her zigzagging career path and hyphenated credentials, she finally decided to embrace her plural nature and start a movement for others who lean toward being what she calls “multipotentialites.”</p>
<p>Since launching her website, Puttylike, in 2010, <strong>Emilie</strong> has inspired thousands of multipotentialites to stop trying to fit themselves into boxes, and embrace their plurality. She has been featured in Lifehacker, The Financial Times, and The Huffington Post. Currently, she is working on her forthcoming book, <em>“Multipotentialite.”</em></p>
<p>This past April, <strong>Emilie</strong> stood in front of 1,400 people at TEDxBend and gave a talk entitled <em><strong>Why Some of Us Don’t Have ONE True Calling</strong></em>, which encapsulates her findings on multipotentiality in 12 minutes! </p>

After years of feeling anxious about her zigzagging career path and hyphenated credentials, she finally decided to embrace her plural nature and start a movement for others who lean toward being what she calls “multipotentialites.”</p>
<p>Since launching her website, Puttylike, in 2010, Emilie has inspired thousands of multipotentialites to stop trying to fit themselves into boxes, and embrace their plurality. She has been featured in Lifehacker, The Financial Times, and The Huffington Post. Currently, she is working on her forthcoming book, <em>“Multipotentialite.”</em></p>
<p>This past April, Emilie stood in front of 1,400 people at TEDxBend and gave a talk entitled <em>Why Some of Us Don’t Have ONE True Calling</em>, which encapsulates her findings on multipotentiality in 12 minutes! </p>

			<title>24: Sandi Amorim on The 100 Day Promise &amp; How to Create Sustainable Change</title>
			<pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2015 04:55:07 +0000</pubDate>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #24</strong>, my guest is Master Coach, NLP Practitioner, and author <strong>Sandi Amorim</strong>. Sandi joins me to discuss her new book <strong>The 100 Day Promise</strong>, which is designed to guide you over the course of one hundred days to create a promise based on a change you want in your life, and to develop your capacity to follow through with daily actions to bring that promise to life.</p>
<p>About: <strong>Sandi Amorim</strong> is a Master Coach, NLP Practitioner, and creator of the 100 Day Promise, a successful online program created to help people change with greater ease and effectiveness and the title of her BRAND new book. She has spent the past twenty years studying what makes us tick, what keeps us stuck, and most importantly, what helps us thrive.</p>
<p>As a seasoned professional in the field of coaching, she holds coaching certificates from Erickson Coaching International in the Art & Science of Coaching, and Neuro-Linguistic Programming, as well as a Master Coach designation from the Harmony Integration Academy. In 2014 she became one of the first coaches in the world licensed to lead Danielle LaPorte’s Desire Map workshop. </p>
<p>About <strong>The 100 Day Promise</strong>: Change can be challenging, frustrating, and sometimes impossible, but we all want to change something about ourselves. The problem isn’t that you want change; the problem is that you judge yourself harshly when you fail to change the way you want. So how do we get there – to our desired change – from here, the feeling of dissatisfaction and longing?</p>
<p>Frustrated by the popular belief that change only takes 21 days, author <strong>Sandi Amorim</strong> decided to answer that question for herself and her clients. It was a question that led her down a rabbit hole of neuroscience, the cycle of change, the law of attraction, and positive psychology. Like Dr. Joe DiSpenza, she believes that we have to “Go beyond knowing … to know how.” She shares what she discovered in The 100 Day Promise, a guide to changing from the inside out. </p>
<p>What will you have at the end of one hundred days? You get to decide. For some, it’s a new habit or practice in life. For others, it’s releasing an old habit or fear. The best part is that <strong>The 100 Day Promise</strong> gives you resources and strategies you can use over and over again that will help you shift from struggle to ease, and a newfound sense of freedom. </p>
<p><strong>The 100 Day Promise</strong> is a journey that goes deeper with each promise you make, and this will have a profound impact on how you see yourself. You'll realize - maybe for the first time - you've got what it takes to change. </p>

			<title>22: Michelle Fondin on The Wheel of Healing with Ayurveda and Mind-Body Medicine</title>
			<pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2015 18:11:03 +0000</pubDate>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #22</strong>, my guest is Ayurvedic Lifestyle Counselor, yoga and meditation teacher, and author <strong>Michelle Fondin</strong>. Michelle joins me to discuss all things Ayurveda — from how it helped drastically change her life after she was diagnosed with cancer at age 28 to how it can help you find the health answers you're seeking by tapping into your body's inherent wisdom, as well as some of the tools she uses to live a purposeful life.</p>
<p>About: <strong>Michelle Fondin</strong> is an Ayurvedic Lifestyle Counselor, yoga and meditation teacher, author, and since 2008, the Owner of The Ayurvedic Path. She holds a Vedic Master certificate from the Chopra Center and has worked with Drs. Deepak Chopra and David Simon at Chopra Center events teaching yoga and meditation. She regularly sees clients and teaches them how to live an Ayurvedic Lifestyle and achieve optimal wellness. She’s a member of the National Ayurvedic Medical Association, The Association of Ayurvedic Professionals of North America and Yoga Alliance and writes for Chopra.com. She lives in Virginia with her three kids and two cats.</p>
<p>Her most recent book, <strong>The Wheel of Healing with Ayurveda: An Easy Guide to a Healthy Lifestyle</strong> <em>(published by New World Library)</em> offers an in-depth exploration of Ayurveda, which originated in India at least five thousand years ago and has stood the test of time. Ayurveda, the “science of life,” is a complete wellness system that includes all that we associate with medical care — prevention of disease, observation, diagnosis, and treatment — as well as self-care practices that are generally absent from Western medicine.</p>
<p>The book is built around eight “spokes” of the Ayurvedic wheel of healing — physical, spiritual, emotional, relationship, occupational, financial, and environmental health, as well as healing the past. Using the system of three principle doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha), <strong>Michelle</strong> offers readers a self-assessment for discovering their mind-body type, as well as practical ways they can enhance their health based on their type.</p>

			<title>21: Heather Thorkelson and Leah Kalamakis on Making the LEAP to Self-Employment &amp; Freelancing</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #21</strong>, my guests are <strong>Heather Thorkelson</strong>, a location-independent business strategist, certified life coach, occasional Antarctic expedition guide, and founder of the Republic of Freedom and <strong>Leah Kalamakis</strong>, a location-independent freelance web designer & developer and the founder of The Freelance To Freedom Project. <strong>Heather</strong> and <strong>Leah</strong> join me to discuss making the LEAP to self-employment and freelancing <em>(which we've all three done);</em> the joys and challenges of self-employment; and their helpful <strong>LEAP Guide</strong>, which includes "everything you need to know to start and grow your freelance business so you can quit your soul-sucking job and start living life on your own terms."</p>
<p>About <strong>Heather</strong>: Despite seven years working for a pharmaceutical company that she’d rather forget, she left the golden handcuffs behind with no plan and still managed to do all kinds of grown-up things like buy a house and get a dog and travel the world while building an awesome passion-fueled business where she gets paid to help people. (She’s still in disbelief about that.) 43 countries traversed, 7 continents visited, and 7 countries inhabited outside of her homeland (Canada), Heather is an entirely self-made woman who knows fear, uncertainty, adventure, and personal responsibility (plus a few languages) like the back of her hand. She can often be heard waxing poetic over a craft beer, “It ain’t always easy, but it’s always worth it.”</p>
<p>About <strong>Leah</strong>: She spent years in a corporate job because that’s what she was supposed to do, but was only thinking, “This is as good as it gets?” She decided to learn a new skill (web design) after discovering you don’t need a 4-year/$40k degree to do so, side-hustled to build her business and surpassed her corporate income 3 months after her LEAP. Along with running a rockin’ web design business, Leah now helps freelancers take their skills, escape their soul-sucking jobs and start living life on their terms. When she’s not hanging out online, you can find her eating popcorn, riding her scooter along the French coast, or taking le apèro on a terrace in Biarritz.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #18</strong>, I'm joined by entrepreneur, author, and speaker <strong>Jia Jiang</strong> for an inspiring conversation about rejection, fear, conscious intent, and his new book <em>Rejection Proof: How I Beat Fear and Became Invincible Through 100 Days of Rejection</em>.</p>
<p>About: <strong>Jia Jiang</strong> is an Entrepreneur, Blogger, Author, Speaker. His brand new book is entitled <em>Rejection Proof: How I Beat Fear and Became Invincible Through 100 Days of Rejection</em>. Several years into his career in the corporate world, he took a life altering risk and stepped into the unknown world of entrepreneurship, which resulted in everyone’s biggest fear… REJECTION.</p>
<p>This became the catalyst that set him on the path to his true calling. To conquer the fear of rejection, he embarked on a personal quest and started a blog to face <strong>100 Days of Rejection</strong>. His journey revealed a world that was hidden in plain sight, a world where people are much kinder than we imagine, discovering that rejection can be much less painful than we believe, and that it's the fear of rejection that is much more destructive than we know.</p>
<p>He's taken that message to the stage and is an outstanding keynote speaker. His TEDx talk is among the top 200 most-watched TED talks of all-time. His story has also been shared on Bloomberg Businessweek, Yahoo News, Forbes, the Huffington Post, and many more.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #17</strong>, I'm joined by writer, speaker, and entrepreneur <strong>Jeff Goins </strong>for a great conversation about purpose, legacy, creativity, finding your true calling, and his new book<strong> <em>Art of Work- a Proven Path to Discovering What You Were Meant to Do</em></strong>.</p>
<p>About: <strong>Jeff Goins</strong> is a full-time writer who has authored four books, including: The In-Between, Wrecked, and You Are a Writer plus he's written and guest-blogged for more than 100 magazines, publications, and blogs including Copyblogger, Problogger, and Michael Hyatt's Blog. He's also a speaker, online writing teacher, and consultant. His website, <a href="http://goinswriter.com" target="_blank">Goinswriter.com</a>, has been visited by more than four million people from all over the world. He lives just outside of Nashville, Tennessee, with his wife, son, and border collie. and he humbly considers himself the world's foremost expert on guacamole.</p>
<p>His brand new book is the <em><strong>Art of Work- a Proven Path to Discovering What You Were Meant to Do</strong></em>. Steven Pressfield, the best-selling author of the War of Wart says, "It will make you think differently about what you do and how you do it. The author is a fresh young voice in a field full of copycats. He challenges us to approach our work the way we would a canvas—both delicately and with furious discipline."</p>
<p>About the <em><strong>Art of Work</strong>: "Abandon the status quo and live a life that matters." </em>The path to your life's work is both difficult and mysterious, which is why few finish the journey.<em> <strong>The Art of Work</strong></em> is about discovering your true calling—that thing you were born to do. As <strong>Jeff Goins</strong> explains, the search begins with passion but does not end there. Only when our interests connect with the needs of the world do we begin living for a larger purpose.</p>
<p>Those who experience this intersection experience something exceptional and enviable. Though it is rare, such a life is attainable by anyone brave enough to try. Through personal experience, compelling stories, and current research on the mysteries of motivation and talent, <strong>Jeff</strong> shows readers how to find their vocation and what to expect along the way.</p>

			<title>15: Shelli Johnson on living an Epic Life and how you can build your own</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #15</strong>, I'm joined by entrepreneur, motivational speaker, and coach <strong>Shelli Johnson</strong> from <a href="yourepiclife.com" target="_blank"><strong>yourepiclife.com</strong></a>. <strong>Shelli</strong> dares her clients to go off-trail and uphill and to choose their way even if it's the hard way. She asks each of us this crucial question: <em>"We all have an Epic Life; are we living it?"</em></p>
<p>About: In short, people and organizations hire me to light a fire that is inside of them but that may be smoldering or not yet lit. I help you pull yourself up by the bootstraps. I help you get back on the horse. Actually I help you get on the horse in the first place, and the more unforgettable the ride, the better, since the ride is your life. Once in a while, you should have to hold onto your hat!</p>
<p>Speaking of hats, I wear many. I'm an entrepreneur. The Webby Award-winning YellowstonePark.com was my first. An amazing team & I built it over 15 years before selling it to Active Interest Media, the owner of Backpacker, Yoga Journal, and other great magazines. I am a master at bootstrapping and leveraging limited resources. I love creating things and "route-finding" my way to discovery. In 2009, I started my professional reinvention, and started Epic Life Inc/YourEpicLife.com. I'm also a life & leadership coach (CPCC and ICF), a Certified Emotional Intelligence Consultant (EQ-i 2.0 & EQ 360), a NSCA Certified Personal Trainer, a motivational speaker, social media and personal branding consultant, writer, media producer, NOLS grad, certified Wilderness First Responder, and adventure guide. </p>
<p>Mostly, I'm a "champion-for-hire." Someone who wants to, or has to, climb a tall mountain – i.e. make, or endure, a big change in their life – will often enlist me as a coach to help them make the climb. People hire me when they’re thinking about (metaphorically) climbing the mountain, or when they are at the base of said mountain. Often I get “called in” when they’re already en route up the mountain but they hit a particularly difficult patch and they feel they can’t go it alone. They want to stay the course, but could use some help. Rather than giving up on the climb, they hire me as their coach and they lean in and finish the work. In other words, I’m not a helicopter that gets called in. You don't hire me to bail you out. Rather, you hire me to help you overcome the crux..</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #14</strong>, my guest is social change activist, writer, blogger, and photographer <strong>Sash Milne</strong>, who joins me to discuss the <strong>Nothing New Project</strong> <em>(no new things bought for a year)</em>, her <strong>TEDxPerth</strong> talk about the project, and what she calls the <strong>Economy of Human Connection</strong>.</p>
<p>About: <strong>Sash Milne</strong> is a social change activist, writer, blogger, photographer and all 'round hunter of the good life. In her early 20s she decided that a life lived inside the box was not one she wanted to live. She ran away from her mainstream life in search of something simpler. She lived in a very remote village in Indonesia for three years, where she learned some fundamental lessons about community, connectedness and most importantly, happiness. While living with nothing but the basics , she completed her Masters in Social Change and transformed the course of her life, for good.</p>
<p><strong>Sash</strong> then returned to Australia as the single mum of one, with a need to incorporate her passion for community, simplicity and sustainability into a life lived down under. She continually challenges social norms and consumer trends by creatively connecting with other people. She launched her <strong>Nothing New</strong> project at the beginning of 2014 and soon discovered that buying nothing new is perhaps the best way of gaining everything that really matters.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Living a life “on purpose” requires a healthy brain; so <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #13</strong> takes us to places we've never gone before on the show! In this fascinating hour-long chat, <strong>Dr. Andrew Hill</strong> joins us to discuss the newly emerging science of nootropics — supplements and functional foods that improve one or more aspects of mental function such as focus, memory, and motivation. We also talk about NeuroFeedback, a type of biofeedback that uses real-time displays of brain activity such as EEG to teach self-regulation of brain function, as well as neuroplasticity and much more!</p>
<p>About: <strong>Andrew Hill</strong> is a UCLA graduate with a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from the department of Psychology, employed as a Lecturer at UCLA, teaching multidisciplinary courses on Healthy Brain Aging, Neuroscience topics, and Biofeedback. He has extensive experience working with clinical and research populations across many areas, including neurodevelopmental, inpatient and outpatient, and people working to overcome substance abuse challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hill</strong> received his PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from UCLA in 2012, studying how attention operates in the brain. He is currently lecturing for the Undergraduate Education Initiatives program at UCLA, teaching a course sequence gerontology, and the neuroscience of healthy brain aging. <strong>Dr. Hill</strong> has published chapters on measuring and modulating human attention, and continues to research self regulation. Prior to UCLA, Dr. Hill obtained extensive experience working with both psychiatric and developmental populations as well as gaining experience in high technology areas.

			<title>12: Barbara Marx Hubbard on Conscious Evolution: Awakening the Power of Our Social Potential</title>
			<pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2015 23:33:30 +0000</pubDate>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In 1945 the United States dropped atomic bombs on Japan, and the world caught its breath. This pivotal event deeply impacted the young <strong>Barbara Marx Hubbard</strong>, who found herself asking President Eisenhower, "What is the meaning of our power that is good"? Barbara's 40+ year inquiry, and the answers she has found, offer invaluable assistance to us all at this time in our history. Despite the state of the world, we are truly on the threshold of great possibility, of our own conscious evolution.</p>
<p>In this inspirational conversation, <strong>Barbara</strong> and I discuss the revised and updated edition of <em><strong>Conscious Evolution: Awakening the Power of Our Social Potential</strong></em> (New World Library), her seminal book first published in 1998, which laid the foundation for the significance and impact around the world of the idea of conscious evolution.</p>
<p>About: <strong>Barbara Marx Hubbard</strong> has been called "the voice for conscious evolution..." by Deepak Chopra. She is the subject of Neale Donald Walsch’s book The Mother of Invention. And many would agree she is the global ambassador for conscious change.</p>
<p>At her heart, <strong>Barbara Marx Hubbard</strong> is a visionary, a social innovator. She is an evolutionary thinker who believes that global change happens when we work collectively and selflessly for the greater good. She realizes that the lessons of evolution teach us that problems are evolutionary drivers, and crises precede transformation, giving a new way of seeing and responding to our global situation.</p>
<p>As a prolific author and educator, <strong>Barbara</strong> has written seven books on social and planetary evolution.  She has produced, hosted, and contributed to countless documentaries seen by millions of people around the world.  In conjunction with the Shift Network, <strong>Barbara</strong> co-produced the worldwide "Birth 2012" multi-media event that was seen as a historic turning point in exposing the social, spiritual, scientific, and technological potential in humanity.</p>
<p>In 1984 her name was placed in nomination for the Vice Presidency of the United States on the Democratic ticket, calling for a "Peace Room" to scan for, map, connect and communicate what is working in America and the world. She also co-chaired a number of Soviet-American Citizen Summits, introducing a new concept called "SYNCON" to foster synergistic convergence with opposing groups. In addition she co-founded the World Future Society, and the Association for Global New Thought.</p>
<p><strong>Barbara Marx Hubbard</strong> is not an idealist, nor does she believe that social and planetary change is simple.  But she does believe that humanity has the tools, fortitude, and resolve to take the leap towards conscious evolution.</p>

			<title>04: Marney Makridakis on Hop, Skip, Jump: 75 Ways to Playfully Manifest a Meaningful Life</title>
			<pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2015 05:59:33 +0000</pubDate>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In addition to mentoring hundreds of small business owners, publishing Artella magazine, and authoring hundreds of online workshops and courses, <strong>Marney Makridakis</strong>' first book, <em>Creating Time: Using Creativity to Reinvent the Clock and Reclaim Your Life</em>, was published by New World Library in 2012, and hit #1 on Amazon’s bestseller lists in several categories.</p>
<p><strong>Marney</strong> is also the founder of the ARTbundance approach to self-discovery through creativity. Since 2009, the ARTbundance Certification Training Program (ACT) has trained over 300 coaches and practitioners in her techniques, and is the result of her deep desire to help creatively minded people design a successful business rooted in true passion, personal joy, and creative meaning.</p>
<p>A graduate of Duke University, <strong>Marney</strong> playfully hops, skips, and jumps in Dallas, Texas, with her wonderful husband and their wise and adventurous young son, Kai. She names these things as being essential to her creative well-being: the color orange, poetic novels, singing loudly, daily naps, the love of a good man, and hero worship of Mary Poppins.</p>
<p><strong>The New Book</strong>: We habitually view work and play as mutually exclusive opposites. But what if we didn’t? What if we could manifest whatever our heart desires from a place of fun, joy, and ease? What if having more fun could mean getting more done?</p>
<p>In <strong>Hop, Skip, Jump: 75 Ways to Playfully Manifest a Meaningful Life</strong> (New World Library, November 15, 2014), creativity expert and bestselling author Marney Makridakis presents a blueprint for melding work and play into a single approach and shows how doing so can transform every aspect of our lives — from work to health to family to money, and beyond.</p>
<p><em>“When it comes to the intersection of play and productivity, the secret is quite simple: what moves us is what moves us, which simply means what moves us emotionally is what moves us to action,”</em> writes Marney. <em>“This is why play helps us be productive. Play is many, many things, but it is never still, stuck, or stagnant; it somehow always moves. So when it comes to manifesting a meaningful life, play works.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Marney</strong> explains that successful manifestation unfolds through the following three phases. However, the quality of time, energy, and pleasure experienced in each phase varies greatly, based on an individual’s natural tendencies and conscious choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hop – Focuses on exploring new beliefs.</li>
<li>Skip — Helps us harness spontaneity, wonder, and love.</li>
<li>Jump — Spurs us into inspired action.</li>
</ul>
<p>The introduction of <strong>Hop, Skip, Jump</strong> includes a quiz that helps readers identify which of the three phases represents their manifestation strengths. This allows readers to fully enjoy the part of the process that comes naturally to them, while encouraging them to step out of their comfort zones to embrace the other key elements as well. Then, 75 playful tools and techniques help readers activate all three phases.</p>
<p><em>“Think of anything you’ve manifested in your life, and if you look closely, I believe you’ll see that you touched on each of these phases in some way, though likely spending more time in some phases than other,”</em> writes <strong>Marney</strong>.<em> “If you look at the things you want but have not yet manifested, you will likely realize you have not hit all three phases yet, or perhaps have not explored them all fully.”</em></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dr. Eric Maisel</strong> is a bestselling author, psychotherapist, and creativity coach. He's the author of 40 books on a wide variety of subjects, from the challenges of living the creative life to natural psychology, the new psychology of meaning; those books including Fearless Creating, The Van Gogh Blues, and Coaching the Artist Within. A licensed psychotherapist, he reaches thousands through his Psychology Today and Fine Art America blogs, his print column in Professional Artist magazine, and workshops in the United States and abroad. He's an advocate for a changed and revitalized view of mental health services, one that does away with our current mental disorder naming system. He's also an advocate for a global paradigm shift from seeking meaning to making meaning, a very crucial distinction that we'll talk about today.</p>
<p>His latest book, LIFE PURPOSE BOOT CAMP, recently released on New World Library, talks about that very shift, as he helps readers who are seeking meaning in their lives understand how, by adopting certain ideas and engaging in specific practices, they can effectively meet their pressing life purpose challenges.  To do that, he suggests that readers do three things, which he explains in great detail in the book: get clear on what their unique life is all about, upgrade their personalities, and manage their circumstances as mindfully as they can.</p>
<p>We talk all about that, along with his life journey, and how he lives his own life "on purpose". For more information on Eric, visit: <a href="http://ericmaisel.com">http://ericmaisel.com</a>.</p>]]></description>
