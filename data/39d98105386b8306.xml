    <description>Three men who dream of Olympic glory and have as much athletic prowess as a piece of cheese sit down (or stand up) and discuss the Olympics, bringing you daily updates, segments and attempted humour that would make even the most passionate Olympics fan in the world crack a wry smile. Well, at least we hope. If it doesn't then we'll gladly give you your money back.</description>

        <![CDATA[<p>It's time to get on your bike once again as we return to the sport of Cycling by speaking with two-time Australian Olympic cyclist Georgia Baker about the sport, he Olympic experiences and getting Ben excited for being the first Tasmanian female Olympian to appear on the show as well! We find out from Georgia about her talented sporting background and how it was cycling that she ended up landing a career in. We also find out the process of making her way through the ranks into the Australian team and the experiences of representing her country at the Olympic Games. Added to this we learn just how much love she has for the Olympics and what unique things she did to show that growing up, how proud she is to represent Tasmania on the world stage and give us her thoughts on potentially switching sports to create some history in the future. It's an entertaining chat that we know you will love! </p>]]>

We find out from Laurent just how influential his Olympian parents were in getting into the sport as well as why he actually never knew his parents were Olympians as a young child. We also learn about his experiences at multi-sport games growing up which helped towards his eventual Olympic experiences and why he wishes there were more to attend. Added to this we find out how he was able to overcome the disappointment of not making the 2014 Olympics to his advantage, why winning the silver in Beijing felt like a gold and just why he also may own the most expensive drink coaster in the world. It's an incredible chat that you won't want to miss! </p>]]>

Added to this we find out what it was like to be part of such a historic day at the Olympics for Australia, the weird experiences of carrying his gold medal through airport security and how his friends reacted to being able to lick the back of his head.

        <![CDATA[<p>It's time for a special interview on the show today as we are joined by two-time American Olympic kayaker Cliff Meidl and American doctor Dr. Malcolm Lesavoy to learn about their unique friendship and just how together they created one of the most inspirational Olympic stories in recent history! We find out from Cliff how a horrific accident set him on a path to the Olympics and just how overcoming the prospect of losing his legs and coming into contact with Dr. Lesavoy helped him along the way. We also learn from Dr. Lesavoy just what it was about Cliff that inspired him and how he was able to ensure that his journey post accident was able to continue. Added to this we find out just what it was like for Cliff to walk out into Stadium Australia carrying the US flag, how Dr. Lesavoy felt seeing Cliff represent his country twice at the Olympics as well as how and why their unique bromance still continues to this day. It's an amazing inspirational story that you won't want to miss!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Excited to bring you another epic interview today as we chat with two-time Aussie Olympic snowboarder Adam Lambert about his incredible career and even more incredible Olympic experiences! We find out from Adam just how being strapped to a snowboard at 18 months old helped him on his journey towards the Olympics and how his supportive parents fueled that passion even more. We also find out which other sport he could've potentially gone to the Olympics in and when the Olympic bug finally bit him with snowboarding. Added to that we learn about how the influence of the late great Chumpy Pullin still is felt on the Australian team, just how the disappointment of Beijing is spurring him on towards the next Olympics and how sharing the name with a famous singer impacts his life. It's another entertaining and insightful chat that you won't want to miss!</p>]]>

In this chat we learn just why this story was chosen by Sean to write a book about and why it should be more well known out there amongst sports fans. We also learn from Doug some of the innovative ideas he had during the lead up to the 1984 Olympics and why some of them wouldn't work today. We also find out which Hollywood superstar helped them on their journey to gold as well as just why they might be involved in the next Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. It's a great chat that you simply can't miss!</p>]]>

Were we satisfied with how Canada and Australia closed things off since our last episode? Was the closing ceremony better than that travesty we got back on the Gold Coast? Do we get sad for the Commonwealth Games ending like we do for the Olympics or are we ready to move on? And are we looking forward to the next Commonwealth Games in Australia in 2026 or are we over them being hosted down under? It's all ready and waiting for you in another episode that you will be smiling through every second of!</itunes:summary>

Did we enjoy it or did it not live up to what we were hoping for? How excited were we for the flag bearers of Australia &amp; Canada? Why do the Commonwealth Games love giant animals taking over stadiums? How awesome was the bull? Why are we so influential on opening ceremonies all of a sudden? Where was the Queen? How awesome was Duran Duran? Why did we have random interviews &amp; celebrity appearances? And how did it compare to the Gold Coast opening ceremony as well as the past few Olympic opening ceremonies? It's all here and more in one episode you simply can't miss!</p>]]>

Added to this we find out how he was able to use the disappointment of winning silver in Rio to help him towards gold in Tokyo, just why sailing is an incredibly exciting sport and should be treated more like one and why he is so obsessed with a certain movie from the 1980s.

        <![CDATA[<p>A massive interview coming your way today on Off The Podium as we bring back one of our favourite guests in Canadian ski jumper Ale Loutitt and also welcome her Beijing teammate Matthew Soukup to the show for the first time to chat about their history making bronze medal win at the 2022 Olympics and everything else in between! We find out from both Ale and Matt just how they have recovered since their history making medal win in February and how the reaction has been for both of them since returning home. We also find out all of the emotions and feelings that came from winning the medal and how they were able to deal with all the attention they received afterwards.

How is Canada feeling about (technically) winning the gold in the monobob? Or are we only counting the bronze? How did Ben do in the monobob and is he pleased with his debut Olympic run by finishing 5th? Are we heartbroken over the aerials or more heartbroken over the OTP curse continuing? What noises is Colin excited to talk about that were made by the CBC today? And are there some winter events that we are maybe starting to question as being part of the Olympics? Get all romantic up in here for another episode of your favourite Olympic podcast!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>A massive day of Olympic action is behind us as we celebrate Australia getting back into the medals and celebrate a queen still being a queen as we recap day 7 of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics! How great is it to celebrate Scotty James winning another medal and how great are we feeling that we predicted it would be silver? How are we feeling about the departure of Shaun White? Is Ester Ledecka still the queen despite not being able to back up her double double? Why is skeleton the sport that Australia needs to really get behind thanks to how great Jaclyn Narracott is doing and do we need to excited or worried ahead of tomorrow? Which special guest do we have on tonight to keep things a little Canadian without a Canadian? Why are we so excited about Irish cross-country skiers all of a sudden? And are we pumped for some excitement tomorrow with the medal tally or are we not feeling the vibe? Snow and ski your way into some more entertainment and get behind another episode you won't want to miss!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Another day of Beijing is in the record books and we're back to go over everything that happened and more on a day that brought multiple medals for Canada and multiple non-medals for Australia! How is Canada feeling with a couple more history breaking medals? How is Australia feeling after the disappointment of the snowboard cross? What are our actual thoughts on figure skating and does something need to change with it? Did we even need to watch the women's halfpipe when we already knew the result? Why does the OTP curse continue in a big way today and is in particularly special visual form? Do we feel athletes with doping violations should be eligible for the DAILY DALE? And why are Australian viewers really missing out on some of the Canadian coverage? Listen in to get your Olympic vibes sorted for another action packed day!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Well after a bit of a stutter with no episode yesterday (damn COVID) it's time bring you an episode worth of a double dose of action as we recap two action packed days of Beijing 2022 and be sure to crown a queen and everything else in between! Why are we just not worthy of Ester Ledecka and her amazingness? Why is it only going to get better for her and our love for her? Who else over the last two days has gotten our love worthy of queen status? Are we sick of hearing the word GOAT? What new nickname have we developed for Mikaela Shiffrin? How sorry for the US do we feel that they had to suffer such a gold medal drought? What the hell is a screaming seaman? And do we all survive this episode with or without COVID? Strap yourself in and cough away for another entertaining episode you can't miss!</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>We are here for the first proper day of competition for Beijing 2022 and we have the whole gang together to recap one epic day! We talk about a medal winning day for Canada and find out from Colin just how he feels about their first day of success. We also get back on the commentary slopes to call some more moguls and leave some more memories that you won't soon forget. Added to this we find out just why we still love the curling, why the women's ice hockey should just be called right now, why Hakuna Matata is such a wonderful phrase and celebrate another iconic Aussie Winter Olympian and award another edition of the DAILY DALE. It's one stacked show that you won't want to miss!</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>The Olympics in Beijing are officially here and we're back to review the Opening Ceremony in classic Off The Podium style! Was this an opening ceremony that we can finally enjoy for once or was it once again a bit of a let down? Why did we enjoy kids falling down too much? What segment are we really starting to get sick of? What did we think of the flag bearers and why were the uniforms amazing this year? As well as the opening ceremony we also talk up some of the great events we have seen so far, including why Australia is going absolutely curling crazy and why we love Dean &amp; Tahli so much, what the hopes are for both Australia and Canada to hold onto our lead in the men's and women's moguls and also just why our first ever DAILY DALE might go down slightly interestingly today. It's an action packed episode you won't want to miss, so get to listening!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>It's only hours until the 2022 Beijing Olympics and we have saved our biggest interview ahead of the games till last as we speak with the most decorated US Winter Olympian of all time and one of the greatest Short Track Speed Skaters of all time Apolo Ohno about his decorated career, his new book and everything else in between! We find out from Apolo just what brought about him writing his new book and how he hopes it will inspire people moving forward. We also learn more from his perspective of THAT race in Salt Lake City that saw Steven Bradbury famously win Australia's first ever Winter Olympic gold and what he thinks about it 20 years later. Added to this we also find out what the chances are for the US to break their 16 year drought of not winning a gold medal in short track, as well as if his blood is really that deadly if it touches the ground in Tasmania. It's an amazing interview that you simply can't miss, so get to listening and get yourself even more in the Winter Olympics zone!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>With only days until the Beijing Olympics, we continue our chats with some great winter athletes as we chat with Australian Alpine Skier Harry Laidlaw about his incredible sport and his incredible career &amp; Olympic achievements! We find out from Harry just how he got into the sport and what other sports we could've seen him make a name for himself in had things taken a different route. We also find out just how difficult it is for an Australian to make it in the sport of Alpine Skiing and just how he is able to relate to his fellow competitors from other non-skiing nations. Added to this we try and work out what an Australian equivalent of the cow bell could be during competitions down under and just what other sports Harry could try his hand in to try and compete with a certain cross-sport skier from the Czech Republic. It's an incredible chat that we know you won't want to miss, so get to listening!</p>]]>

We find out how Chad was literally born with skates on his feet and how this enabled him to dominate the sport in both inline and speed skating. We also learn how a trip to the 1988 Calgary Olympics didn't turn out how it perhaps should've and how close he felt he came to making a different Olympics had things played out differently. Added to this we learn which Olympic medal he won that means the most to him and just how he feels knowing he was the last person to beat the legendary Sven Kramer at an Olympics in the 5000m. It's an amazing chat that you won't want to miss!</p>]]>

We find out more from Daniel just how he transitioned from roller sports into ice sports and how difficult that transition was as an Australian in a sport in which there are no full sized facilities anywhere the country. We also find out just how it is impossible to ever skip leg day in speed skating and just how grueling of a sport it is to compete in. Added to this we learn more about just how his devastation at his first Olympics actually helped him further in life and how he could technically be classed as an Olympic silver medallist in an unofficial Olympic event. It's a great chat that you will want to hear so make sure you don't miss out!</p>]]>

We find out from Ash more about growing up in rural Western Australia and how deciding not to go on a trip with her family ultimately helped her towards her future Olympic appearance. We also learn more about her initial feelings of making the Hockeyroos and how she was able to turn that experience around into playing the best hockey she has played in her career between narrowly missing out on a spot in Beijing to her eventual London appearance. Added to that we also find out just why she can't stop meeting the Queen and why she probably won't be eating too many chicken sandwiches from the UK anymore. It's a great chat that you won't want to miss!</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>It's time to bring you our first ever Field Hockey athlete today as we speak with London Olympian Ashleigh Nelson about her incredible career for the Hockeyroos and Olympic experiences! We find out from Ash more about growing up in rural Western Australia and how deciding not to go on a trip with her family ultimately helped her towards her future Olympic appearance. We also learn more about her initial feelings of making the Hockeyroos and how she was able to turn that experience around into playing the best hockey she has played in her career between narrowly missing out on a spot in Beijing to her eventual London appearance. Added to that we also find out just why she can't stop meeting the Queen and why she probably won't be eating too many chicken sandwiches from the UK anymore. It's a great chat that you won't want to miss!</itunes:summary>

We learn from Luke just how he got into rowing and the process it involved to go from just starting out through to competing for Australia on the world stage. We also learn just how close he was to walking away from the sport, and how the pandemic actually helped him to eventually land a spot on the Tokyo Olympic team. Added to this we learn more about that epic day 5 of Tokyo and how the energy was in the rowing team with all the success that followed, as well as learning more about his love for a certain classic Australian movie. It's a great chat that we know you will love, so click away and get to listening!</itunes:summary>

It’s one hell of an interview that you simply can’t miss! So get to listening!</itunes:summary>

Just how did Rhydian get into race walking and why is it more of an amazing sport than people give it credit for? Why does having the sport featured in comedy shows such as <em>Malcolm In The Middle</em> and <em>Kath &amp; Kim</em> actually help it more than hinder it? Why does Australia seem to produce so many talented race walkers? What brought about his changeup from competing in the 20km event in Rio to the 50km event in Tokyo? How does Rhydian feel about the 50km event being dropped from Paris? And just what happened with a cat before Tokyo that may have his future wife scared for the future? It’s all here and more in another fascinating interview that you won’t want to miss!</p>]]>

We learn from Ji how the quintessential Aussie activity of jumping on a trampoline in his backyard lead him to becoming one of the most decorated trampoline athletes of the 90s, as well as how watching the 1980 Moscow Olympics harboured an Olympic ambition from him from a very  young age. We also learn about his entire Olympic experience during Sydney, and why qualifying nearly a year out from the games helped him take in more of the unique Olympic atmosphere that was in Australia at the time. Added to this his memories of the night he won silver, why he believes so many people remember his silver win so fondly and just how close he came to becoming an Olympian in another sport, it’s a jumpingly great chat that you won’t want to flippin’ miss! </p>]]>

We learn from Ji how the quintessential Aussie activity of jumping on a trampoline in his backyard lead him to becoming one of the most decorated trampoline athletes of the 90s, as well as how watching the 1980 Moscow Olympics harboured an Olympic ambition from him from a very  young age. We also learn about his entire Olympic experience during Sydney, and why qualifying nearly a year out from the games helped him take in more of the unique Olympic atmosphere that was in Australia at the time. Added to this his memories of the night he won silver, why he believes so many people remember his silver win so fondly and just how close he came to becoming an Olympian in another sport, it’s a jumpingly great chat that you won’t want to flippin’ miss!</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>Excited to bring you another Fencing interview today and our first interview with an athlete who is just back from Tokyo as we chat with Canadian foil fencer Alanna Goldie. Alanna gives us a great insight into how coming from a fencing family helped get her into the sport, and why she was so keen to start earlier than she could. We also learn about her experiences competing at the Youth Olympics back in 2010 and how that helped her when it came to competing at the full Olympics 11 years later, as well as how she was able to overcome the disappointment of not making Rio in 2016 to help spur her on towards her eventual Tokyo ticket. Added to this we learn more about her special friend Albert, some new epic ways to improve team fencing and just how she is a global trend setter. It’s an epic interview that you simply can’t miss!</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>A special treat for you today in the lead up to the Beijing Olympics as we not only speak to our first ever biathlete, we also speak to our first ever New Zealand Olympian as we chat with New Zealand’s only ever Olympic biathlete, Sarah Snowsell. Sarah talks us through just how an injury in a completely unrelated sport helped her take up biathlon, and just how this journey ended up leading her to compete for New Zealand at the Olympics. She also goes over the unique training needed for the sport of biathlon, just how intense the rivalry is between the biathletes, cross-country skiers and alpine skiers as well as just why she is basically James Bond in real life. It’s a great and fun interview that you will enjoy so get to listening!</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>As we continue to get closer to the Beijing Olympics, we’re thrilled to bring you an interview today with one of the biggest names in Australian winter sports, aerial skier Danielle Scott! Danielle chats about her journey from gymnastics through to aerial skiing, including which legendary athlete helped recruit her to the sport and just what it was like transitioning between gymnastics and aerial skiing. Danielle also talks about how important the mental aspect of the sport is, what that feeling is like during a jump and landing it perfectly, as well as teaching us just what great pump up songs are needed to really get the adrenaline flowing in a competition and what her hopes will be for Beijing in a few months’ time. It’s another great interview that you can’t afford to miss!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Another exciting interview is coming your way today as we chat with Australian bobsleigh pilot Ashleigh Warner about her amazing career and how she is tracking ahead of the upcoming Beijing Olympics. We learn from Ash the unique way she got into the sport of bobsleigh and just how close she was to making the Olympics in another sport. We also learn more about the transition from being a brakewoman to a driver and how that has helped her driving in the sport, which types of tracks she prefers as well as just how the disappointment of being cut from the PyeongChang Olympics at the last moment has spurred her on towards her goal of 2022. We also learn which fellow Australian athlete she’d like to swap places with for a day and discover what her dad might say about her on Channel 7 next year should she come away with an Olympic medal. It’s one fun chat that you definitely won’t want to miss!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to bring you a great interview today as for the first time we get to learn a little bit more about the sport of luge by talking with two-time Olympian Hannah Campbell-Pegg. Hannah talks us through her journey in getting into the sport, from starting off as a bobsleigh athlete to what brought about the transition into luge. She also takes us through her two Olympic experiences, detailing what it is like for an athlete from a country with no luge history to compete on the world stage as well as going over the experience in Vancouver after the tragic death of her friend Nodar Kumaritashvili. We also learn more about what is in store for the sport in Australia moving forward, and just why her parents weren’t exactly too happy with her after her first time competing in the sport. It’s one great and informative interview that you won’t want to miss!</p>]]>

Added to that we bring back some commentary with our final taste of swimming, work out if getting 'given' a medal in the tennis still counts and find out what sport we watched that we are really in love with that has surprised us.

We talk up just how Tasmania is higher on the medal tally than most nations, and just how they are comparing to Canada right now. We also find out just how good rowing is and why it deserved more attention than it got. We also celebrate queen Penny Oleksiak and her history making day for Canadian Olympic history, bring you some epic badminton commentary and see if we can actually agree today on an athlete of the day. It's all here on a massively golden day at the 2020 Olympics!</p>]]>

Why is Kaylee McKeown the hero we never knew we needed? Is our commentary of the final our best yet? Is surfing now our new favourite sport? Why are we all angry that softball won't be returning at the next Olympics? How sad do we feel for Jess Fox? Why do we find weightlifting so funny? And why is today's athlete of the day the hardest one we've ever had to decide on? All of these questions will be answered and more on another epic edition of your favourite Olympic podcast!</p>]]>

Yes that's right, Tasmania is finally on the board after an epic day that we will celebrate! We go over all the medal wins and talk up why Tasmania clearly is the star of the day.  We also find out why watching the triathlon was a bit more revealing than we were expected, as well as find out why the Off The Podium curse hasn't been put in the purse just yet. We also bring you some more exciting commentary, this time from the great sport of fencing, and also find out why Canadian judo athletes are sad and why Australian softball players are even sadder. It's another massive day of action you won't want to miss!</p>]]>

How disappointed are we all that there were no medals for either Canada or Australia on the first day? How can we use our commentary skills to perfection when it comes to the great sport of dressage? Did the road race go on maybe for a bit too long? How do we feel about the two epic Canada v Australia battle royals that happened today? Is Canada finishing 5th in the road race basically a gold medal win for them? Why was the weightlifting and the fencing maybe the best things to watch today? And just what type of kid talk do we need to work on when it comes to describing one of the new Olympic sports? Get yourself clicking and into the know once more as we wrap up day 1 of Tokyo in style! </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>It's time to light that cauldron and get yourself even more excited than you already are as THE GAMES HAVE OFFICIALLY BEGUN! Yes, that's right, after the...uh...somewhat 'interesting' opening ceremony it's time for your favourite Olympics podcast to go over everything that you just watched and give our very unique take on it in true Off The Podium style! Did it live up to expectations? Did Channel 7 and CBC make fools of themselves already or were we pleasantly surprised at how they handled themselves? Which country had the best outfit? Which had the worst? Did we miss Nikki Webster? Does it make us want to buy treadmills? And has this made us more excited for the next 16 days of competition? Added to our review of the opening ceremony, we also take a look at some of the results that have already come our way so far, look ahead to an epic day 1 of competition happening tomorrow and find some unique ways to bring you some fan engagement for both Canada and Australia! It's all here and more in one epic episode that any Olympic fan can't afford to miss!</p>]]>

Yes, that's right, the Olympics will officially be hosted in Australia for the third time, with Brisbane being awarded the right to host the 2032 Olympics! We break down the news and talk about just what it means to Australia to have the Olympics back and how these games will be different compared to others. We also talk about just how the announcement went down, whether or not waiting for 11 years instead of 7 years is a good or bad thing and try and work out some long term predictions for the ceremonies, sports and even the person who will light the cauldron. Added to this we discuss some early Olympic results and give our final thoughts ahead of the Opening Ceremony in just two days time. It's one big episode you can't miss!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>THE GAMES ARE FINALLY HERE! Yes that's right, after an extra year of waiting we are finally about to celebrate the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and make ourselves very busy and excited for the next two weeks! And with that in mind, it's time to bring you a full preview episode of everything you need to know ahead of the Olympics and just what to expect when you're glued to your screens over the next 16 days. We go over the big medal hopes for both Australia and Canada and talk up some of the events we are most excited for, as well as the ones we're maybe not that excited for as well. We also go over which athletes we have probably jinxed a lot by them appearing on our show, as well as trying to talk up the mascot (and pronounce it correctly), trying to talk up Channel 7 and CBC and trying to talk up anything to do with dressage and rhythmic gymnastics. It's all together in one massive preview episode for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics that any Olympic fan simply can't miss!</p>]]>

In one of our most personal chats to date, Tristan opens up about the unique way he got into the sport and the 'sliding doors' moment that very nearly saw him not go down the path as a runner. He also talks about his experiences at the Olympics and why he looks back on it differently, as well as the various challenges that came after his time in London. We also hear from Tristan about the athletes to watch out for at the Tokyo Olympics. It's a fun, informative and open chat you won't want to miss!</p>]]>

We also find out just how close each of them were to making the Tokyo team and learn just why these Olympic games are breaking an unwanted record for Australia when it comes to the sport of wrestling.

        <![CDATA[<p>In the latest episode of Off The Podium we're excited to learn a bit more about the sport of diving for the very first time, as we sit down with Australian diver Laura Hingston to learn more about the sport and her amazing career. We find out which sport Laura started off in and how it brought about an interesting transition into diving. We also learn all about the finer details of just how the skills are developed and why a fear of heights isn't exactly a barrier when it comes to certain disciplines in the sport, as well as learning how the disappointment of not making the Tokyo team is spurring her on towards a tilt at Paris 2024. It's one fun chat that will have you trying not to splash your entry into listening, so get to it!</p>]]>

Just how far did this bid get? Was he ever serious about? What was the endgame of the bid? Did he lead people on with it? Why did it stop? And does he believe that smaller cities such as Hobart could ever host the games? It's an episode that you probably will want to miss, but we think you shouldn't as it still is entertaining and informative! So tune in!</p>]]>

Do the boys agree with the decision to postpone the games? Do they feel our favourite Count Dracula impersonator Thomas Bach should stay as President or is his time done? Just when will the games be held? Will it be weird to potentially have a Summer and Winter Olympics within only a few months of each other like it used to be 30 years ago? Which athletes do they think this will help now that they have extra time to try and train? What will it mean for our TV viewing in a few months? And why does this mean that the Hobart 2020 Olympic Bid might all of a sudden be back on the table? There is so much to discuss and catch up on as your favourite Olympic podcast returns with a bang!]]>

        <![CDATA[We are ALL back to talk about the final days of the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. Ben gives us more first hand experiences from his work at the Boxing events, while Jarrod tells us all about the extensive 2 hours of coverage he managed to see over the course of 11 days. Meanwhile Colin has mostly positive things to say about Canada's exclusive coverage from the DAZN (Da-Zone) app, including the CBC network deciding to throw a few time slots in there. Why are Australians so down on the Closing Ceremonies? What does Ben have to say about being one of approximately 13 people to attend the Closing Ceremonies in person (not including a slew of Australian Idol and X-Factor contestants).  Why do Australians get so defensive over trash talking the Campbell Sisters? Why do Canadians love Taylor Ruck and Erica Wiebe so much? Why should nobody touch Callum Hawkins when he goes down in the Marathon? Why should you never change the channel to Badminton at the 2:03:00 mark of a Marathon? And why how close (or far) did we all come in our medal tally predictions? It's a jam packed wrap up of the Commonwealth Games that will make all of the Commonwealth tweet out #TheseAreOurOlympics]]>

Ben takes time out of his busy day working the Boxing venue to tell us all about his experiences behind the scenes of working the Commonwealth Games. Who will come out on top between the Aussies and Canadians in the pool? Which boxer could fist bump Ben to the ground?  Which Canadian commentator just cuts in and out of coverage as he pleases? What was the giant inflatable whale like up close at dress rehearsals? What is DAZN and why is it not carrying Netball? Why is Colin demanding Olympic success from his 2 year old son? And how many places in Queensland can one run into Tom Daley? It's the on the scene podcast coverage of the Commonwealth Games that will make you scream Jai Ho!]]>

Why is it such a big deal for Canadian's to break the car robbery drought and create a new Ryan Lochte? Are squirrels that scary that snowboarders should run them over?

Just how on earth did Canada lose to Germany in ice hockey? Just how on earth did Canada lose to Switzerland in curling? Just how on earth is it deemed a failure for Canada despite the fact they won a medal of every colour on day 14? How on earth is channel 7 even in Korea still when they are so focused on the Commonwealth Games already? And do you think Roger Federer would be a fan of our show if we were Swiss? So much to answer, so little time for you to click download!]]>

        <![CDATA[It's time to finally bring back a Canadian perspective (given they're wining medals and Australia isn't) and get ourselves worked up over some terrible judging as we recap the 9th day of PyeongChang 2018. Just how much bullshit was coming from the judging of the men's aerials and why is David Morris just such an awesome human for taking it so well? Has Colin recovered from basically being dead and can he survive long enough to survive so much alpine skiing being shown? Can bobsledders actually draw and why do we need to tweet them to work out what it is they're drawing? And how excited is Jarrod about the Norwegian curling team and their pants? It's clicking away and no replays away with another episode of your favourite Olympic podcast!]]>

Jarrod comes in fresh with some research about just how having a Swisse ad campaign actually hurts your chances of success in an Olympics. There is also talk about why Australia should be better in long-track speed skating, why the athletes Channel 7 doesn't care about do better, why we need to interview people who do doubles luge and some of the funniest fan messages you'll hear from the Australian Olympic Team website.

Just why does it matter that Jarryd and Chumpy don't get along? Why does Lydia need to stop apologising and realise how awesome and amazing she is? Why is it sad that Jacqui Cooper isn't being appreciated more as a commentator? Why is the luge relay perhaps the greatest sport that has ever existed? And can we finally break the 3 medal hoodoo and end up with our 4th medal? It's all here and more on our special CHUMPY &amp; LYDIA day!]]>

      <itunes:subtitle>Another day, another medal for Australia (and a few for Canada too) as Ben &amp; Jarrod return to give their take on another entertaining day of the Olympics! Just why does it matter that Jarryd and Chumpy don't get along? Why does Lydia need to stop apologis</itunes:subtitle>

        <![CDATA[It's a bronzed day here on Off The Podium as we get excited for another medal for Australia and a day we can officially say we beat Canada in! So disappointed are Canada with their lack of medals that they apparently didn't want to be represented on this episode which means more love for Australia! It also means more hate for Channel 7 and how bad their coverage is, more love for doubles luge, more love for Nordic combined and more love for what could quite possibly be 'Chumpy day' when we next do this episode. So get listening and get on top of your best friend and sled your way through a bronzed episode!]]>

Well for Canada sure, but we can faceplant like an Aussie snowboarder to make your day even better! There is plenty of time to relive Canadian success, as well as work out why Canada has something against Chloe Kim. There is also talk about Australians including just whether or not Scotty James can be the next Campbell sister, as well as discussing why PyeongChang has trouble coming up with a good logo and motto and find out why we might've killed a luge athlete by the time you listen to this episode.]]>

Ben &amp; Jarrod are joined by Mallory again to get all Matt Graham excited, as well as Team Canada excited and twizzle their way through the news of the day. We also try and work out why everyone at the Winter Olympics are all so much happier than the Summer Olympics, why these games make us dislike the Campbell sisters even more, talk up just how great curling is and wish all sports were like it and find out if Mallory actually knows anything about Canada. It's all available to click yourself into gear so wrap that silver around your neck and ski ski ski faster than Harry Laidlaw!]]>

With Mallory returning, you know we're in for a fun (and long) episode, featuring some (sort of) golden moments for New Zealand, a day of medals for Canada, more bloody medals for Norway and a first ever medal for a 12 year old kid. There is also some exciting Canadian profiles to be heard, more Aussie athlete fan messages (featuring extra schnitzel) and more laughter than you can poke a before and after picture at! It has it all, so make sure you get into it and mogul mogul mogul it all the way down!]]>

If you're Australian it's been filled with endless coverage and replays of the moguls, if you're Canadian you're actually getting to see the games! There has also been some excitement for New Zealand with it soon set to be a national holiday in recognition of the great Carlos Garcia Knight. There has also been some late nights for Jarrod &amp; Ben with the epic ski jumping being exciting when it really shouldn't be. We also get excited over pink guns with ponies on it, that great TV show 'Games of Throne' as well as trying to work out why the Koreans aren't going to the events, decoding why Channel 7 really sucks at covering the Olympics and working out if the Moguls are more important than 'My Kitchen Rules'. It's all in another days work for us here on Off The Podium!]]>

Just how bad were Channel 7 in covering the event? What was with all the outfits? Did the cauldron look like a giant space penis? How good was the traditional Korean song of 'Imagine' performed by out of tune buskers? Why was everything pre-recorded? Why did we have to add another Canadian to the episode to balance it out? Have we found our winter Ryan Lochte already? Why do Canadian skiers poo themselves? And can any of our fan messages actually get published on the AOC website? It's all here and more in our epic recap of the opening ceremony of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics!]]>
