      <title>Do You Feel Special, The Warren Markowitz Show, Politically Incorrect, 19 Jan 2018</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.podomatic.net/ts/b9/85/9a/warren61800/3000x3000-1251x1251+704+0_11673303.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Warren Markowitz Show, It's My World You Just Live In It. A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day.

The government is facing a shutdown, but the reason is not because we are running out of money, or we are facing a future as seen in the televison series &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;, no its because one party is holding 327 million people hostage to benefit 3.5 million people that are here without our permission. To make matters worse, and yes they can be worse, California is taking action openly hostile to the Federal Government that hasn't been seen since the Civil War. Toss in the conversation that California is looking to split in two and we've got a crockpot of headaches, and a chili of disaster on the menu. 

Tune in as we discuss the matters of the day, that could be a bit longer. 

Join me at 1030am Pacific, when I open up the lines, and discuss these and much more.

Trigger Warning; I'm not intending to be Politically Correct.

A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. Identity Politics,

Immigration, the Wall, security, unwanteds, deportations, and the list goes on and on. The Left seems to think the good times will continue to roll in and when it does make an appearrance, they think its just a blip, an abberation, but they still want to be the altrustic sort that puts others first, with complete disregard for oneself. The past week has seen the government take action in immigration, toe the line with good and bad decisions, and of course fall flat on its face when caught with its hand in the proverbial cookie jar. So, whats left to talk about? Well, tune in and see.

Join me tomorrow at 1030am Pacific, when I open up the lines, and discuss these and much more.

      <title>DACA, TPS, and The Bundy's, Government at its worst, The Warren Markowitz Show</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.podomatic.net/ts/b9/85/9a/warren61800/3000x3000_12572223.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Warren Markowitz Show, It's My World You Just Live In It. A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. Identity Politics,

This week has been filled with an exciting buffet of government actions. From the outright threat from the left to keep an illegal immigration policy in place (DACA), to the complaints that the Temporary Protected Status for 200,000 Nicaraguans is being lifted, to the events in Las Vegas, NV when the Federal Judge dimissd the case against Clliven Bundy and some of his suppporters. Hardliners on both sides have had something to say with little to contribute.

Join me tomorrow at 1030am Pacific, when I open up the lines, and discuss how all of these changes are good for us, and even the people that they effect.

The world never stops, and we never get disappointed, another news cycle, another politician caught were he doesn't belong and of course, the censorship of the left, just to keep things flavorful.

The world never stops, and we never get disappointed, another news cycle, another politician caught were he doesn't belong and of course, the censorship of the left, just to keep things flavorful.

Now that the election is out of the way, the protests begin, the riots, crying and concern moves in full force. 
With Trump elected, and Hillary effectively eliminated from politics, we now need to move forward and govern. We need to do what has always been done, build coalitions, move to the center, do what's best for America and return to the traditional approach of politics, working with the otherside. Can we do this? I think so, Lets see what's in store in the near future.

      <title>Where Do We Go From Here?</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.podomatic.net/ts/b9/85/9a/warren61800/3000x3000_11725332.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Warren Markowitz Show, It's My World You Just Live In It. A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. 

Where Do We Go From Here?
That's the question most of us will ask ourselves on Nov9th, 2016 when the dust settles and the election comes to a close. The process itself will take until mid January 2017 to flush itself clean, when the new President takes the oath of office, and we move to sit a new Congress shorty thereafter, but what about the economy, world events, the military, the poor, the dependent, taxes, our currency, etc. These are the questions that we must address as a nation, the things we must work together to resolve and move us forward, because unless we do so effectively, their will be no tomorrow to worry about because when the music stops, there may not be a chair for us to take.

We Get What We Deserve.
The political season draws quickly to a close, as the major party candidates continue to battle for support of the undecided voter. Is change in the air? Are there issues that are truly impactful? Has America made it to actual appathay or do we not care anymore? Let's find out, maybe kick the idea around and see where we can go with this.

A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. 

With the Political Race for the Whitehouse drawing to a rapid close, have you given it a good thought as to where foreign relations have gone in the past 8 years, how we are seen by the world and if we are in a position to defend or advance our holdings, allies and interests? With the rise of the Chinese and Russian Empires again on the world stage, are we an advancing society or declining. History tells us that all things are circular, just ask the English and the Spanish. Join me as we discuss the current political climate as it pertains to the thing we hold most dear, our very own skin.

Things still getting weird, Oct 4th 2016
With the Presidential Election of 2016 barrelling down on the American People, we continue to see the confusion and irational behaviour pouring forth in to the American lexicon. From not speaking about things to teaching and enforcing restrictions and limitation on language we are building or allowing to be built a second generation of people that are incapable of dealing with others, afraid of words and lack the ability to identify and manipulate situations that require substantial interaction between differing peoples. Join me as I examine instances of this in the political field and higher education.

I for one am glad the debate is behind us so that we can look at the things that really matter. Things like the UNHC &quot;suggesting&quot; that we pay reparations to the suppreseed minority in the US, yes that righs we need to pay for an outdated social construct that we spent nearly 600,000 lives removing from the US 150 years ago, so it seems that isn't enough; and if that isn't the topper of stuppidity maybe the US turning the keys of the Internet over to the UN takes the cake. Join me as we look into the matter and discuss the issues that make you step back and question your own sanity.

So what does it take to recognize that we are involved in a war that is going to determine our society, our freedoms and our future? The recent bombings in NYC and the rampage stabbing in MN are only small examples, but when you add them up with the shooting rampage in California and the numerous people leaving to fight for ISIS or to conduct jihad America must come to the only conclusion, her survival is more important than the lives of those that only wish to undermine her success for the purpose of advancing an archaic civil and political system.

The recent bombings in NYC and the rampage stabbing in MN are only small examples, but when you add them up with the shooting rampage in California and the numerous people leaving to fight for ISIS or to conduct jihad America must come to the only conclusion, her survival is more important than the lives of those that only wish to undermine her success for the purpose of advancing an archaic civil and political system.

A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. 

Guilty as charged.  Its that time again to stand and advance the simple facts, that as I am Politically Incorrect, and so are many of you, that telling the truth is an act of disobedience. The very simplest of things are what are being used as a social experiment, that education, economics and critical thinking, are not being advanced but undermined in order to create a group of drones, slaves if you will to do the masters bidding. Are you ready to be a slave?

      <title>The 47% Moment, Sept 13th 2016</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.podomatic.net/ts/b9/85/9a/warren61800/3000x3000_11666076.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Warren Markowitz Show, It's My World You Just Live In It. A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. 
The 47% moment. Modern Politics is filled with gaffs, trips and falls from the politicians. It is also covered by the 4 hour news cycle, so when one candidate insults nearly 1/2 of the supporters of the other, don't be surprised to learn that life can take a dramatic turn for the worse. Stand up Deplorables, and make your Country Proud.

      <title>I'm Back and with Lots to Say, Sept 9th 2016</title>

events and politics of the day. 

I'm back and with lots to say, is my opportunity to return to the waves with commentary and insight in to the things that have become commonplace. Segregation, flag burning, insults, these are now the matters of the day, but now the shoe is on the other foot. Join me as I explore issues that have returned to haunt us.
