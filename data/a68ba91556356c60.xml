      <title>S7E3.5 - Overheard on Greeking Out - The Hole Where King Tut’s Heart Used to Be</title>
      <description>This is a kid-friendly episode of Overheard at Nat Geo! We encounter descriptions of mummification, a game show, lots of Black Goo, the aftermath of the Amarna period, and a missing heart!
We dig into why ancient Egyptian King Tutankhamun’s heart is missing from his tomb and what archaeologists have learned a century since the discovery of the young pharaoh’s tomb.
One hundred years since the discovery of King Tutankhamun’s tomb, archaeologists are still puzzling over the mystery of why his heart is missing. In ancient Egyptian religion, the heart is thought to be the seat of intelligence and key to the afterlife–when a person dies, it’s weighed against a feather to determine where the soul goes. We’ll head into National Geographic Museum’s King Tut exhibit with archaeologist-in-residence Fred Hiebert to hear his take on what happened to Egypt’s boy king and hear from mummy expert Salima Ikram about how recent excavations of the tomb are helping scientists get closer to the answer.

This week's episode features the first chapter from Rick Riordan's new book Daughter of the Deep. Here's a little about the book:
#1 New York Times best-selling author Rick Riordan pays homage to Jules Verne in his exciting modern take on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
Ana Dakkar is a freshman at Harding-Pencroft Academy, a five-year high school that graduates the best marine scientists, naval warriors, navigators, and underwater explorers in the world. Ana's parents died while on a scientific expedition two years ago, and the only family's she's got left is her older brother, Dev, also a student at HP. Ana's freshman year culminates with the class's weekend trial at sea, the details of which have been kept secret. She only hopes she has what it'll take to succeed. All her worries are blown out of the water when, on the bus ride to the ship, Ana and her schoolmates witness a terrible tragedy that will change the trajectory of their lives.
But wait, there's more. The professor accompanying them informs Ana that their rival school, Land Institute, and Harding-Pencroft have been fighting a cold war for a hundred and fifty years. Now that cold war has been turned up to a full broil, and the freshman are in danger of becoming fish food. In a race against deadly enemies, Ana will make amazing friends and astounding discoveries about her heritage as she puts her leadership skills to the test for the first time.

      <title>S2E5 - Ancient Greece's Most Wanted</title>
      <description>Oh Muses! In this episode we tell the tale of the inhabitants of Tartarus, and their dastardly deeds. We come across violations of hospitality, someone who tries to cheat death, and people who are just plain mean. Some people get eaten, and we all learn some lessons. So listen up! -- Seriously, though, this one has a lot of cannibalism. Younger listeners may want to skip it.
