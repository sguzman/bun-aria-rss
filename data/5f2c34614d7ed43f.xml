   <media:description>When Karina and Ronald Kurzawa first became known as SIS vs BRO, it was obvious that they loved the content that they were creating. However, over the years, this slowly changed. SIS vs BRO fell out of love with the content, and the channel was completely abandoned. The only signs of SIS vs BRO these days are on their personal channels, RonaldOMG and Gamergirl, as well as on other social media outside of YouTube, such as TikTok. What happened to the siblings?

This is, The Brutal Collapse of SIS vs BRO.

   <media:description>Planet Fitness is not only the most hated gym in the world, but possibly the most hated business / company in the entire world. Why? Is Planet Fitness really that bad?

   <media:description>Eminem dissed his mother so bad, she sued him, and not for an insignificant amount either. Eminem's mom sued him for $10m, with the lawsuit eventually succeeding, although not for the amount that Debbie Mathers initially expected. This event had come after the time Eminem got sued by his childhood bully, marking just one of the many times Marshall Mathers got sued.

   <media:description>Out of every conspiracy theory thought up by mankind, &quot;Australia Doesn't Exist&quot; has to be the nuttiest. So nutty, you might expect nobody in the world to believe it. However, YouTuber RagReynolds is one of the few who is pushing this conspiracy theory into the mainstream. It makes flat earth seem like a logical theory, and it makes for some great entertainment.

   <media:description>James Corden has slowly developed one of the worst reputations in Hollywood. He began as a respected actor on the hit comedy series Gavin and Stacey in the UK, however since becoming The Late Late Show host, things haven't been going too well for him. He was called out by the internet on an iconic Reddit post on r/IAMA, he got into a fight with Patrick Stewart in front of a live crowd, and has recently announced that he plans on leaving the public eye in 2023. So, how did The Late Late Show With James Corden destroy his reputation?

   <media:description>Over the last 7 months, Meta, the parent company for Facebook and Instagram, has fallen by 52%. What's going on? What has caused Facebook to tank in the markets so heavily? Is it related to the Metaverse? Has TikTok proved too strong as competition for the two apps? Is Instagram worse off, or Facebook? What is Mark Zuckerberg doing to stop the decline?

   <media:description>When Zyzz and Chestbrah began their fitness journey at the age of 17, they could have had no idea where it would take their life. By uploading videos to the internet of their workouts, life and physique, ZYZZ and Chestbrah stumbled into fame. Although, with it would come an array of downsides that would turn much of this fame into a negative.

   <media:description>Everyone has different tastes and preferences, however, one thing that the entire world seems to universally agree upon, is that Nickelback is the worst band of all time. But why? What's the actual reason for it? How did they manage to become more hated than Creed, Insane Clown Posse, and Limp Bizkit all put together? Are they bland and completely unoriginal? Does it have something to do with the frontman Chad Kroeger's behaviour?

   <media:description>When That Vegan Teacher began to criticise Gordon Ramsay in January 2021, she probably didn't expect him to respond. However, after That Vegan Teacher made a bad song about Gordon Ramsay on Tik Tok, she was roasted and destroyed... twice. But, was the TikTok roasting by Gordon Ramsay beneficial for That Vegan Teacher as well? How did the event go down and how did it benefit each TikToker?

   <media:description>For over 6 years, 100 million views per month was the norm for Kwebbelkop. However, in mid 2021, something changed. In the 12 months that followed May 2021, Kwebbelkop's viewership fell by approximately 90% to an average of between 5 and 20 million per month. What caused this decline? Was it something to do with his break up with Azzyland? Or the disintegration of the Robust group with Jelly and Slogo / Slogoman? Was it something to do with his new second channel Bloo? Or perhaps something to do with him feeling the need to flaunt his wealth? This video will explore How Kwebbelkop Lost His Entire Audience In 1 Year.

   <media:description>People have tried to cancel MrBeast many times. The reasons for which vary, but with so many cancellation attempts over such a long period of time, some of them are bound to be a lot pettier than others. This video will cover three of those incredibly stupid attempts, from people being angry at Chris and MrBeast for dressing up as a helicopter, to That Vegan Teacher claiming that MrBeast was destroying the environment by not having pineapple on his &quot;Worlds largest slice of pizza&quot;.

These are, The Dumbest Attempts To Cancel MrBeast.

   <media:description>When DaddyOFive first began their channel back in 2015, the goal was simple: play some light hearted pranks in order to generate views. In the beginning, the Daddy'O'Five channel was fun, however as time progressed, it would steadily descend into an increasingly tragic tale. Eventually, DaddyOFive would lose custody over part of his family, have his channel deleted, and completely steamroll his reputation in the process.

This is, The Tragedy Of YouTube's Saddest Family Channel: DaddyOFive.

The idea for this video was partially inspired by &quot;InternetAjay&quot; who posted a video on a similar topic in August 2021 titled &quot;The Rise And Fall Of DaddyOFive: From Family Prank Channel To Deleted&quot; You can watch his version here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuT98suaoc</media:description>

   <media:description>Back in 2019, Morgz was being talked about by every single YouTuber from Cody Ko to the Sidemen to PewDiePie, in the process finding himself in a beef with MrBeast. However, over the past few years, things have changed dramatically. Morgz' viewership has fallen from over 100 million per month to around 5 million per month, creating a question of &quot;what on earth happened?&quot;

This is, Morgz' Career Is Completely Dead. What Happened?
