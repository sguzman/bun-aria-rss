D.C.'s 700,000 residents don't get to elect a voting representative to Congress, and the federal government can block their laws. 51st will trace how racism, party politics, and even an attempted mutiny in Pennsylvania have stood in the way of the city’s path to full representation. We’ll also try to figure out if D.C. has a real shot at achieving statehood today. Could D.C. ever be the 51st state?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[To see the latest coronavirus coverage, visit <a href="https://wamu.org/">WAMU.org</a> and <a href="https://dcist.com">DCist.com</a>. We're updating our stories around the clock. We've also created a Facebook group. To join, search for "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/coronavirusDC/">D.C. Area Coronavirus Updates</a>" on Facebook.

The reporters behind What's With Washington have been hustling to cover COVID-19 in every way they can, and in this episode, we're highlighting some of their work. Daniella Cheslow, WAMU's power and influence reporter, joins Mikaela to break down a question many of us are asking: Why is it taking so long to get lots of people tested? Then, we look for ways to help our community and our region with stories from Elliot Williams, Maureen Pao, Jonquilyn Hill and Eliza Berkon.

More details on how to help:

Mikaela Lefrak (Arts and Culture Reporter, WAMU) talked about how you can <a href="https://wamu.org/story/20/03/13/its-still-safe-to-donate-blood-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-hospitals-wish-you-would/">donate blood at your local hospital.</a>

			<description><![CDATA[The former Iranian Embassy and ambassador's residence on D.C.'s Embassy Row have been boarded up for decades. But recently, a listener noticed construction outside one of them, and asked us to investigate. The story of the mansions involves wild '70s parties, the Iranian Revolution, and a landlord you wouldn't expect: the U.S. State Department. Monna Kashfi, the executive producer of WAMU's Kojo Nnamdi Show and an Iranian politics expert, joins the show.
