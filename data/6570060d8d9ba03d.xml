			<description><![CDATA[<p>News travels fast, and not always accurately - Lady Catherine de Bourgh has arrived at Longbourn with the impression that Elizabeth is engaged to Mr. Darcy. How could this obstinate, headstrong girl get in the way of her ladyship's daughter's tacit engagement? Lady Catherine cannot let it stand, but Elizabeth will not give in that easily. After such a heated conversation, she needs a moment to rest. Let yourself rest too as today's story helps you fall into a deep and restorative sleep.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's a few months later than Mrs. Bennet planned, but the Netherfield gentlemen are finally at Longbourn for their dinner date. While it's clear that sparks are flying once more between Bingley and Jane, it's less clear what Darcy is doing there. Why show up if he's not even going to try to talk to Lizzy? She's working herself up trying to figure out what is going on - she needs to pause to rest and regroup her thoughts. Let her story help you take your own pause and take you on a journey into restful and restorative sleep.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's really happening - Lydia is going to marry Wickham. And in reflecting on their upcoming marriage, Lizzy realizes that perhaps she was too hasty in rejecting Mr. Darcy. Meanwhile, Mrs. Bennet has finally returned downstairs, and with a little coaxing from Lizzy and Jane, Mr. Bennet will even let Lydia and Wickham visit Longbourn before Wickham relocates to the North. The Bennets all need a good night's rest to prepare themselves for <em>that</em> visit, and this week's story will help you fall into deep and restful sleep as well.&nbsp;</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s really happening - Lydia is going to marry Wickham. And in reflecting on their upcoming marriage, Lizzy realizes that perhaps she was too hasty in rejecting Mr. Darcy. Meanwhile, Mrs. Bennet has finally returned downstairs, and with a little coaxing from Lizzy and Jane, Mr. Bennet will even let Lydia and Wickham visit Longbourn before Wickham relocates to the North. The Bennets all need a good night&apos;s rest to prepare themselves for &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; visit, and this week&apos;s story will help you fall into deep and restful sleep as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Chapter 49 of Pride and Prejudice</p>
<p>The Bennets finally receive word from Mr. Gardiner - Lydia and Mr. Wickham are to be married! What a relief. Yes, Mr. Gardiner probably paid Wickham off, and Mr. Bennet has no idea how to repay him, but they'll worry about that later. It's such great news that Mrs. Bennet is ready to leave her room, tell the world her joy, and of course order wedding clothes. In all of the excitement, Lizzy retreats to her room for a moment of quiet - the kind of quiet respite you will feel upon letting this week's episode help you fall into deep and restful sleep.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ladies of Longbourn are on edge, waiting for a letter from London to give word of Lydia and Wickham. All they've gotten so far is condolences from Mr. Collins, which were...not helpful. But soon, Mr. Bennet returns, and even though he didn't fight Wickham in a duel to make him marry Lydia, the family is glad to have him back home. Let his calming presence help soothe you into a deep and restful slumber.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Darcy is at Pemberley! And just as Elizabeth was getting comfortable on her tour. It's hard to say who is more embarrassed at this chance run-in. But strangely enough, Mr. Darcy's manners are completely transformed. Might he actually be civil, and dare we say, pleasant? This is far too much for Elizabeth to take in. She is ready to rest after such an eventful day, and you will be too with tonight's relaxing story.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Mr. Darcy is at Pemberley! And just as Elizabeth was getting comfortable on her tour. It&apos;s hard to say who is more embarrassed at this chance run-in. But strangely enough, Mr. Darcy&apos;s manners are completely transformed. Might he actually be civil, and dare we say, pleasant? This is far too much for Elizabeth to take in. She is ready to rest after such an eventful day, and you will be too with tonight&apos;s relaxing story.&lt;/p&gt;
