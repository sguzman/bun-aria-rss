      <title>Ep. 145 | 2 Bears 1 Cave w/ Tom Segura &amp; Bert Kreischer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Tom Segura and Bert Kreischer share stories about pregnancy scares, discuss the overturning of Roe v. Wade, find out about the history of orphanages, and revisit the PLASTT subreddit. Bert raves about the Oculus, which he just tried thanks to Brian Simpson, and a conversation about exes prompts the Bears to question which one of them is easier to fall in love with. They wrap up by discussing tequila, which Bert has officially switched to from vodka.

How much should Bert get to be in a boxing ring with Israel "Stylebender" Adesanya? The bears discuss the recent passing of Louis Anderson, Bob Saget, and Norm McDonald. Tom shares a story about him and Ryan Sickler smoking out Norm and seeing him go on stage right after. Bert then shares a story of a Paralympian swimmer Chloe Toscano who recently removed her arm and the bears gauge the room on some playful choking in the bedroom.</p>

      <title>Ep. 12 - 2 Bears 1 Cave 2 w/ Bert &amp; LeeAnn Kreischer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on 2 Bears 1 Cave, Tom Segura is still on his Euro-tour and couldn't attend this recording. However, Bert Kreischer brought Mama-Bear LeeAnn. If you thought Bert was safe from being checked for an hour straight just because Tom wasn't there, GUESS AGAIN. We first get into Bert's recent weight loss. He actually legit looks good, but everyone (including himself) knows it won't last too long. We get into the inner working of Bert and LeeAnn's marriage. What would Widow-Bert and Widow-LeeAnn's lives look like? Does Bert have a "condition" he's not telling us about? We then get into what exactly IS and IS NOT cheating on your spouse, we give Tom a call, we get into Louis CK's tour email, and more!</p>
