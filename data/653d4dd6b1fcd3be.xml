   <media:description>More than 150 masterpieces owned by the late Microsoft cofounder—including works by Botticelli, Cezanne, Seurat, Monet and Hockney—paint a portrait of the billionaire as a passionate collector. Next week they go on the block at Christie’s and will break a record for the most expensive sale of all time.

In a crowded Christie’s auction room in May 2018, Mexican artist Diego Rivera’s 1931 painting The Rivals came to the stage. Commissioned by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller and given as a wedding gift to her son, David, and his new wife, Peggy, in 1941, the work was a small part of the largest auction to date, one that eventually set a record with its $835 million total.

Within a few minutes, The Rivals sold for nearly $9.8 million, a record for a Latin American artist at auction (one eventually shattered by Rivera’s wife, Frida Kahlo, in a $35 million sale in 2021). The new owner, however, a phone bidder, remained a mystery.

Four years later, The Rivals is once again up for sale at Christie’s, alongside more than 150 rare works of art in another groundbreaking auction that sheds light on one of the world’s greatest private collectors: the late Microsoft cofounder—and The Rivals’ mysterious phone bidder—Paul Allen.

   <media:description>Dan Snyder has retained BofA Securities to sell the Washington Commanders, sources tell Forbes. According to a person familiar with the process, Snyder already has at least four calls from groups interested in buying the team. Snyder and his bankers are exploring all options, and a transaction could be for the entire NFL team or a minority stake.

Neither the Commanders nor Bank of America, which has handled such notable team sales as the purchase of the Los Angeles Clippers by Steve Ballmer in 2014, would comment.

   <media:description>The New York Yankees are the most valuable team in baseball, and in large part because of the late George Steinbrenner’s moves, his heirs are billionaires. 

George Steinbrenner, at the time of his death 12 years ago, was worth $1.1 billion. Now, Forbes estimates that siblings Hal Steinbrenner, Jessica Steinbrenner and Jennifer Steinbrenner Swindal each got one-fourth of George’s estate and are each worth roughly $1.3 billion or more, primarily from the family’s controlling ownership of Yankee Global Enterprises. 

Hal’s assets also include a group of hotels, which likely would add another $100 million to his fortune. George’s eldest son, Hank, also got one-fourth but he died in 2020 and it’s unclear what happened to his estate.

   <media:description>Twitter’s new owner Elon Musk on Wednesday insisted that no decisions will be made on restoring banned Twitter accounts for at least a “few more weeks” as the company tries to put a clear process in place for doing so, amid reports that advertisers are planning to cut back spending on the platform over content moderation concerns.

   <media:description>Ratajkowski knows that she courts controversy for talking about women’s empowerment while also building a career centered around her body and sexuality. She doesn’t agree, but has come to terms with it.

Forbes Women Editor Maggie McGrath spoke with Ratajkowski at the 2022 Forbes Power Women's Summit.

   <media:description>Rob Hale, 56, likes routine. His typical workday includes nabbing the parking lot’s fifth spot (five is his lucky number), downing four extra-large decaf Dunkin’ coffees (two in the morning, two in the afternoon), overseeing a second group workout at noon (this one, mercifully, 20 minutes), then getting home in time for dinner with Karen, his wife of 28 years. “My life is very regimented,” Hale explains. “It doesn’t deviate much at all.”

Such discipline pays big dividends. Privately held Granite generated over $1.6 billion in sales last year and has no long-term debt. Twenty years after Hale’s first company collapsed, he boasts a $5 billion fortune from his estimated 70% stake in Granite and is one of America’s 400 wealthiest people for the second year running.

How did he do it? Forget about the blockchain, the metaverse or the cloud. The Bostonian built a 21st-century telecommunications empire on the back of 150-year-old technology: twisted-copper-wire telephone lines, or “plain old telephone service” (POTS, as it’s known in the industry). Granite, a telecom wholesaler, leases these old-fashioned lines from phone companies, then sells the service back to businesses at a premium.

POTS has one huge advantage over fiber-optic cables and wireless: unmatchable reliability. Unlike glass fiber, twisted copper can transmit electric power, meaning POTS keeps working even during a blackout. That makes it attractive for powering essentials such as fire alarms, security systems and emergency elevator phones. “Wall Street thinks they’re dead, but every retailer on the planet has a couple of POTS lines,” Hale says.

Granite’s angle is to sell POTS to national retailers (Nike, CVS and PepsiCo are clients) whose IT chiefs want a single point of contact for their many phone lines in many different states. When a POTS line in Montana goes down, techies at CVS don’t have to chase after the local phone carrier to fix it; they call Granite, which does it for them.

“Any national brand you can think of, they don’t want to deal with seven phone companies,” Hale explains. “They want to deal with one.”

That deceptively simple formula has worked for years. But now Granite faces an existential crisis: Hang up on landlines or get left behind.

   <media:description>Less than a week into Elon Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, employees are anxiously awaiting information on massive layoffs across all departments, with as many as 25% of staff to be let go in a first round of cuts, the Washington Post reported Monday, a week after the billionaire Tesla CEO reportedly walked back plans to slash staffing by 75%.

   <media:description>Charles III's official coronation may not occur until May 6, but the new British monarch has already inherited a $25 billion real estate portfolio fit for a king.

When he acceded the throne in September, the 73-year-old sovereign assumed control of a $42 billion empire, much of it in real estate. Forbes scoured property records, annual reports, audits, archives and legislative documents to find all of the king’s new possessions. His holdings span from Buckingham Palace—the official headquarters of the monarchy, which Forbes estimates is worth $4.9 billion—to Highgrove House, a country residence in Gloucestershire that Charles first purchased in 1980 for £865,000 ($3.7 million today,) now valued at $39 million.

Although he has only had the crown for a few weeks, Charles is expected to break with seven generations of tradition and reject Buckingham Palace as his London residence to remain in his current home at Clarence House (estimated value: $72 million.) But he will also reportedly continue to spend some time at Highgrove. That means he’ll have to pay about $740,000 in annual rent to his son William, who succeeded him as Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall and now holds Highgrove under the Duchy of Cornwall.

Those properties are part of a vast collection of at least seven palaces, 10 castles, 12 homes, 56 holiday cottages and 14 ancient ruins, per Forbes’ count. Aside from Balmoral Castle in Scotland and Sandringham House in Norfolk, which he inherited from the Queen and now personally owns, none of these opulent residences and historic monuments are directly owned by the King. Most are held by the Crown Estate, the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall, institutions held “in right of the Crown” for the duration of his reign. Others are controlled by the monarchy itself “in trust” for his successors and the nation, while another four properties are held by two foundations which the King established when he was Prince of Wales.
