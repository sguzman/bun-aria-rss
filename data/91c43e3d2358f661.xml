We had a blast at the Texas Theatre talking the venue's connection to the JFK assassination and its supernatural occurrences.

Watch the entire show on-demand for the next 10 days.
This won't be released in our feed, so the only way to catch the fun is on Moment. Check it out before it's gone!

      <title>Episode 210: Resurrection Mary</title>
      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-210-resurrection-mary</link>
      <description>A stretch of road on Chicago’s south side has been home to this eager passenger for a century. She accepted rides from strangers but wasn’t always the most gracious guest. Screaming, jumping in and out of the car, and in some cases, ghosting those who offered to take her home. Is this a case of mistaken identity and late night hallucinations? Or do drivers headed down archer simply need to prepare for an extra rider?

      <title>Episode 209: The Murder of Robert Poynter</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-209-the-murder-of-robert-poynter</link>
      <description>A decorated firefighter, a dedicated dad, and an optimistic husband. His family knew that they may lose him suddenly, but they never predicted the cause would be murder. Late one night in 2016, police responded to frantic 911 calls from a dirt road in Texas. When they arrived, the only witness began giving details that just didn’t add up.

      <title>Episode 208: The Baleroy Mansion - The Most Haunted Home in America</title>
      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-208-the-baleroy-mansion</link>
      <description>Art, cars, crystals, and death chairs? This Philadelphia landmark was home to one of the city's greatest collectors - of antiques, priceless artifacts, and ghosts. When his family of Pennsylvania elites moved into the mansion on the hill, they had no way of knowing that some of the family members were moving in for eternity. Was this structure truly haunted or were spirits attached to the treasures within its walls? 

Recorded live at Theatre for Living Arts in Philadelphia, PA

      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-207-the-jeff-davis-8-part-2</link>
      <description>With 7 victims already found dead, the local police tried to appease families by creating a task force, but yet another body was found. Soon it would become apparent that the corruption plaguing the community for decades was powerful enough to infiltrate the task force, too. Years passed, suspects’ names were whispered by neighbors, but no arrests were made.

Her roles as a champion for women and a source of knowledge and advice for her neighbors were outshone only by her incredible skills as a seer. Her remarkable life has been the subject of books and movies, and with all her powers, she’ll let people know if they’re doing her story justice.

      <title>Episode 200: Teal Swan: Spiritual Influencer or Modern Day Cult Leader? - Part 3</title>
      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-200-teal-swan-part-3</link>
      <description>Listener note: This episode contains discussions of alleged child sexual abuse and suicide.
With her hypnotic voice and clever use of technology, Teal Swan amassed an online following that numbered in the millions. But the increased attention brought increased scrutiny - from regulators, cult experts, and victims’ families. Were the allegations that she was running baseless or were they rooted in her own documented behavior?

      <title>Episode 197: Teal Swan: Spiritual Influencer or Modern Day Cult Leader? - Part 1.</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-197-teal-swan-part-1</link>
      <description>Listener note: This episode contains discussions of alleged child sexual abuse and suicide.

A beautiful YouTuber gained millions of views, but the families of some of those swayed by her videos claim she took her influence too far. Soon accusations of practicing counseling without a license, leading a cult, and exerting mind control over her followers gained this content creator and spiritual leader quite a reputation. Is she a source of comfort for her followers? Or is she creating a community under her total control?

      <title>Episode 195: The Ryman Auditorium and The Grand Ole Opry</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-195-the-ryman-auditorium-and-the-grand-ole-opry</link>
      <description>A beautiful structure looms over the bustling party scene of Broadway in the Music City. A venue like no other, this building's religious beginnings give it a stately elegance. The music that echoed through its halls has made careers and, according to some, started curses. Some restless souls never left the hallowed halls of the Mother Church of Country Music. 

Recorded live at Zanies in Nashville, TN

      <title>Episode 194: The Nain Rouge</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-194-the-nain-rouge</link>
      <description>It takes boldness to build a city, but for Motown’s founder, being self-assured meant his downfall. The hubris of man is a dangerous thing, but not as dangerous as a demonic force that must be appeased to keep it from wreaking havoc on those it encounters. Detroiters know to beware of this devilish creature, if not, the consequences can be severe.

      <title>Episode 192: The Fresno Nightcrawler</title>
      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-192-the-fresno-nightcrawler</link>
      <description>A resident of this central California town captured footage of an unidentifiable creature scurrying across his lawn. He offered the tape to experts and the media who couldn’t determine what this strange monster was. Soon, more sightings were reported across California and beyond. The odd-shaped scampering being didn’t do any harm and was soon embraced as an online phenomenon.

      <title>Episode 189: The Murder of Betty Gore - Part 2</title>
      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-189-the-murder-of-betty-gore-part-2</link>
      <description>With an extra-marital affair behind them, Allan and Betty Gore seemed to be back on track in their marriage. Betty was leading a Marriage Encounter group, and Allan was trying to reduce the number of work trips that took him away from his wife and their five-year-old and eleven-month-old daughters. When he left on a work trip Friday, June 13, 1980, Allan never knew that would be the last time he would see his wife alive. Their small community would be rocked by a brutal murder committed in broad daylight by someone so close to them.

      <title>Episode 187: The Gates of Hell</title>
      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-187-the-gates-of-hell</link>
      <description>The discovery city, the capital of Ohio. C-bus is the gateway to many things - Industry, museums, and a world-class education at The Ohio State University. But lurking just moments away from the home of the Buckeyes is a doorway to something more sinister. Is this location just a hangout for skaters and teens or is it a portal to the underworld?

Recorded live at Funny Bone in Columbus, Ohio

      <title>Lorena Bobbit: Part 2 (Re-Release)</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/rerelease-lorena-bobbitt-part-2</link>
      <description>CW: This episode contains discussions of domestic violence and sexual assault

In case you missed it, a new special titled Lorena: Escaping Bobbitt premiered this past week. The new special shows Lorena offering details about the abuse she suffered during her marriage as well as the ongoing harassment she faces from John to this day. In our episodes, we dive into her history, tell the story of that fateful night, and provide legal analysis of the trials.

After the media got ahold of the initial details of the case, the circus began. But the truth would come out via the testimony of dozens of witnesses at trial. One woman was both a defendant and a victim, and the trial focused on the reign of terror she had endured. But the verdict wasn't the end of her story.

      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-185-the-hat-man</link>
      <description>Deep in the night, out of the shadows, a figure emerges. Tall and thin, it glides toward you, but all you see is its flowing cloak and signature hat. When you ask others about what you’ve seen - you find out you’re not the only one to experience this worldwide phenomenon. Is he real? Is he a figment of your imagination? Or is he something not of this realm?

      <title>Episode 181: Sherri Papini - Part 2</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-181-sherri-papini-part-2</link>
      <description>Update: After we recorded this episode, Sherri agreed to plead guilty to lying to a federal agent and mail fraud. Once more is known, we will release an update on our Patreon

Investigators listened to the stories she spun, however, cutting-edge technology revealed what really happened to the missing supermom from Northern California. The tale she wove unraveled quickly, and she would soon, finally, face consequences.

      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/freakyfriday</link>
      <description>A ghost that feels the need to set the house alarm...but is it to keep someone in, or something out? A stabbing that wasn't meant to be seen. A familiar face, or so you think. A bank robbery gone wrong that no one knew about for decades, And how one teen's decision to skip school in Chowchilla in 1976 possibly saved his life.

      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/the-disappearance-of-kristin-smart-parts-1-3-rerelease</link>
      <description>Since we covered Kristin's case, a month and a half-long preliminary hearing was held to determine whether the case against Paul and Ruben could proceed. The court heard testimony from more than two dozen witnesses, including law enforcement officials, former friends and acquaintances of both Paul and Kristin, cadaver dog handlers, and soil experts. In September 2021, the judge in the case ruled that there is sufficient evidence to move the case forward to trial. Currently, the trial is set to occur on April 25, 2022.

Years passed and the Smart family was no closer to finding answers to what happened to their daughter on May 25, 1996. Once civilians and private detectives stepped in, the family saw some progress. It wasn't until a new sheriff was elected that moves were made. What eventually brought the case close to an end was a breakout podcast that shed new light on the details and unearthed new clues, finally leading to some arrests in the case.

With their daughter missing, her devastated parents relied on law enforcement to conduct a thorough investigation. To their dismay, the case was passed between departments and delayed long enough for key evidence to be lost. Despite sufficient evidence for officers to identify a suspect, they needed his cooperation to close the case. All the suspect was willing to do was plead the fifth. Decades would pass before they got any real answers.

Four students leaving a party. A dark street. A short walk back to campus. But for one college freshman, the person trusted to walk her home seems to be the reason she was never seen again. For decades, the case lingered, the investigation changed hands, and it wasn’t until a renewed media scrutiny that arrests were made. Did authorities have their suspect from day 1?

      <title>Episode 179: The Tinder Swindler</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-179-the-tinder-swindler</link>
      <description>He matched with women online, flaunting his high-roller lifestyle, telling tales of family riches, and sharing fears about dangerous enemies. Soon, the enemies would supposedly come calling, and this prince charming would ask women to cover his exorbitant bills. Estimates are that he took his victims for over $10 million, yet today he walks as a free man in Gucci shoes. What happened and why has he, so far, evaded major consequences?

      <title>The Murder of Ellen Greenberg (Re-Release)</title>
      <link>https://www.change.org/p/justice-for-ellen-rae-greenberg-justiceforellen</link>
      <description>Ellen's family got some bad news at the end of February when the Pennsylvania attorney general's office reviewed the case again and still supports suicide as her cause of death despite all the evidence. Her parents told CBS News they were disgusted and disappointed by the finding. The Greenbergs are still in the process of suing Philadelphia, trying to change Ellen’s manner of death from suicide to homicide or undetermined.
We've included a link to her family's petition at the top of our show notes. The petition also includes ways to get in touch with Attorney General Josh Shapiro and demand that his office re-open her case.

      <title>Episode 176: Dragons</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-176-dragons</link>
      <description>Ancient civilizations around the world have included imagery of this mythic beast in pieces that have lasted centuries. In each culture, it represents something different - strength, nobility, an enemy to be defeated. But how did such a myth evolve in far-flung regions around the world with no connection to one another? Could these ancient monsters be even more ancient than we imagined? And are they hiding out waiting to be discovered to this very day?

      <title>Episode 175: The Wrongful Conviction of Ryan Ferguson - Part 2</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-175-the-wrongful-conviction-of-ryan-ferguson-part-2</link>
      <description>Arrested for something someone saw in their dreams, Ryan Ferguson hoped justice would prevail in court. He wasn’t prepared to face a corrupt system, fabricated evidence, and a prosecutor who seemed willing to do anything to win. It would take an army to right some of the wrongs, but an innocent man remains in jail and a killer is still on the loose.

      <description>A college town is shocked by the heinous and violent murder of one of the city’s most beloved journalists. For two years, the case was cold until an unlikely pair of suspects emerged. The only problem? There was no evidence linking either of them to the crime. Still, one of them confessed leading to a years-long battle for justice.

      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-172-the-north-pond-hermit-christopher-knight</link>
      <description>The past two years have made us all feel a little isolated. But this man took the concept of solitude to another level. 27 years in the woods alone, and he never once sought out human contact. He sought out other things, though, - books, food, clothes, tools, and anything else he could get his hands on. Was he an unrepentant criminal or just a guy trying to make it on his own?

      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-171-the-murder-of-maurizio-gucci-house-of-gucci</link>
      <description>A legendary brand. A family legacy. A tumultuous love affair that cost a man his life. Hollywood has put its own spin on this story, but the movie’s subjects have made their anger with their portrayal well known. Is there more to this story than the film would have you believe?

      <title>A Conversation With Tybee Diskin from Chasing Immortality</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/bonus-a-conversation-with-tybee-diskin-from-chasing-immortality</link>
      <description>We were so fortunate to sit down with Tybee Diskin from the excellent podcast Chasing Immortality! After we covered the wild world of Transhumanism, we wanted to get Tybee’s insights as she covered FM-2030 on her past season. We also talk about the ethics of transhumanism, how we’re closer to the singularity than we even realize, and Tybee’s hilarious run-in with Google voice assistant. Next season, Chasing Immortality will cover Ray Kurzweil, and we can’t wait to chat with Tybee again once that episode is released. Until then, check out Chasing Immortality wherever you get your podcasts, and be sure to check out her in-depth episode on FM-2030, available now.

Thanks again to Tybee for joining us, and we hope you all enjoy our conversation!

      <title>Episode 170: The Transhumanism Movement</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-170-the-transhumanism-movement</link>
      <description>Benjamin Franklin once said, “In this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” While this group of genius thinkers may not be able to stop the inevitability of taxes, they’re working together to eliminate that relentless foe who comes for us all - death. Will technology enable us to outrun our impending demise? And will it happen sooner rather than later?

      <description>You better watch out, you better not cry, you better hold your hands up high because Santa has a gun and is robbing the place. In 1927, a Texas town was shaken up at Christmas when St. Nick pulled a heist on the local bank.

      <title>Episode 166: Horror Movie Curses</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-166-horror-movie-curses</link>
      <description>When you turn on a scary movie, you expect to be frightened by what you see on screen. But for these movies, what happened behind the scenes was also the stuff of nightmares. Is this the case of simple coincidence, with large casts and crews falling victim to unfortunate but common tragedies? Or, were these films cursed by their supernatural subject matter?

      <title>Episode 165: The Trial of Julius Jones</title>
      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-165-the-trial-of-julius-jones</link>
      <description>In July 1999, Paul Howell was murdered in front of his sister and two young daughters during a carjacking. When police tracked the vehicle, it led them to a gang affiliate who pointed a finger at the shooter. After a trial tainted with racial bias, under-resourced defense attorneys, and a prosecutor hell-bent on securing an execution, the defendant was sentenced to death. But for decades he proclaimed his innocence and begged for his life. Did the jury convict the right man?

      <description>You hear the sounds of wings flapping against a clear night sky. In the trees, you spot something. Unlike any bird or creature you've ever seen before, the beast makes eye contact with you then jets off into the night. It's not a bird. It's not a plane. It's the Houston Batman.

In this peek, you'll hear a clip from our listener-submitted Am I The Asshole segment where we advise someone on her secret-spilling mom. Then you'll hear us tackle a Reddit Am I the Asshole where a father-to-be prioritizes beats over his new baby. Next, you'll hear us in the Q&amp;A answer a spooky would-you-rather question. Then you'll hear us give Relationship Advice on what to do when your house guests start moving in on your man.

      <title>Episode 160: Skinwalker Ranch</title>
      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-160-skinwalker-ranch</link>
      <description>For centuries, this region was home to bright lights in the sky and treacherous monsters on the land and water. Soon, it became clear - nearly all of the out-of-this-world events centered around one family’s homestead. Once word spread, journalists, scientists, researchers, and billionaires descended on the place, hoping to capture hard evidence. Is what they found proof of visitors from another world or just the basis for a great story?

      <title>Episode 159: The Stanley Hotel</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-159-the-stanley-hotel</link>
      <description>One man set out for Colorado, looking for the healing power of the mountains where built himself a grand empire. A half a century later, with the enormous structure crumbling, an author on a mission happened upon the place and introduced it to his readers as one of the most haunted hotels in the country. Were the ghosts always there, waiting to show themselves to a willing visitor, or is this another one of the legendary writer’s creative tales? This week's episode is The Stanley Hotel.

      <title>A Conversation With Ben and Ronnie from Watch What Crappens</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/bonus-a-conversation-with-ben-amp-ronnie-from-watch-what-crappens</link>
      <description>We were so fortunate to sit down with Ben and Ronnie from the Bravo-tastic podcast Watch What Crappens!
After we covered the crimes of Jen Shah, we wanted to get the insights of some Real Housewives experts - and nobody knows Bravo better than Ben &amp; Ronnie.
We also talk about who our favorite housewives are, updates on the Housewife and the Hustler Erika Jayne and Tom Girardi, and all our hot takes on Jen Shah's alleged crimes.
You can also check us out on their feed in a bonus episode where we discuss Teddi Mellencamp's MLM scheme and the various lawsuits of PK and Dorit on the Real Housewives of Beverley Hills. Be sure to check out their show - Watch What Crappens - wherever you get your podcasts. Thanks again to Ben and Ronnie for joining us, and we hope you all enjoy our conversation.

      <description>In Season 1, she introduced herself to us as being queen bee and MVP, but by Season 2 of Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, the MVP was staring down a possible 30 years in the federal penitentiary. Though the only guilt she admits to is being "Shah-Mazing" the jury may hand down a much harsher conviction.

Patreon subscribers get to watch a livestream video version of this and participate with us via the chat. This clip includes an existential question that made us laugh and think. Finally, you'll hear a clip from our livestream performance of Reddits' Am I The Asshole, where we cover a workplace incident involving a boss's out-of-control mom.

      <title>A Legal Explanation and Discussion on SB8</title>
      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/legal-explanation-and-discussion-on-sb8</link>
      <description>This is a special bonus episode we're releasing at the request of our Patreon subscribers. We normally do "true crime headlines" as part of our weekly bonus content, but when we covered the new Texas abortion ban SB8, our Patreons asked if we could make it public so they could share.
Seeing as we live in Texas, we have received a lot of questions lately about SB8. In this segment, we discuss the legal and constitutional questions and violations pertaining to the ban. Of course, our own opinions are thrown in as well. If you're interested, please listen. If this isn't for you, that's ok, too. 
We hope this provides a quick overview for you on what the law means, its constitutionality, and where the law is headed going forward as it impacts all people seeking access to reproductive care. We recorded this a few weeks ago when the law first went into effect. Since then, there have been some news updates, movement in litigation challenging SB8, and clarifications in the analysis of the law including who it does and does not apply to. So as we say in the segment, be sure to keep up with the updates on this law as it impacts you and those you love. You can also visit the episode link for updates that have happened since we recorded.

All our love, from TX

      <title>Episode 156: Polybius</title>
      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-156-polybius</link>
      <description>At the height of the video game craze in the early 80s, this arcade machine was said to take from its players a lot more than quarters. Kids who spent time in front of its screen allegedly suffered headaches, nightmares, amnesia, or worse. Soon men in black suits whisked the cabinets away, leaving behind nothing but a legend. Was this a case of the government using mass media to control the minds of the youth, or can this story be rated M for myth?

      <description>After the prosecutor recused himself citing conflicts of interest, the state of the Murdaugh murder investigation seemed to stall. Then, breaking news reports on the shooting of yet another member of the family who happened to be the only named person of interest in the June slayings. Who could have attacked the once prominent trial lawyer? And what led to his sudden resignation from the firm his family started?

      <description>With a string of deadly incidents in their wake, members of a powerful Lowcountry family suddenly found themselves searching for justice. Two brutal slayings, a rain-soaked crime scene, and several possible motives. Authorities are only releasing new information in tiny increments causing speculation to run rampant. With the solicitor in charge finally recusing himself due to conflicts, does that point to a possible development?

      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-151-the-murdaugh-family-murders-part-1</link>
      <description>For generations, a single family wielded control over the justice system of South Carolina’s Lowcountry. Over the past six years, five people with ties to the legendary family have been killed. Is this just a coincidence in a tight-knit community, or is there a more sinister explanation?

The United States finally rekindled its long-lost relationship with its Caribbean neighbor. But not long after being sent to their reopened embassy, American diplomats and CIA officers began complaining of strange symptoms. Then the symptoms spread to their Canadian colleagues. Later, diplomats worldwide would be afflicted by this series of incidents. Was it a concentrated attack from an unknown foe? Or was it all in their heads?

      <title>Episode 149: The Wrongful Conviction of Clemente Aguirre-Jarquin </title>
      <link>https://www.sinisterhood.com/shownotes/ep-149-the-wrongful-conviction-of-clemente-aguirre-jarquin</link>
      <description>A young man with his whole life ahead of him set his sights on sunny Florida in order to escape life-threatening gang violence in his hometown. But when he arrived, he found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. After a hasty trial, he was convicted of double murder and faced a death sentence. Would DNA and multiple confessions from another suspect be enough to set him free?

      <title>Robert The Doll (Re-release)</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/robert-the-doll-re-release</link>
      <description>Hey everyone, we’re taking the week off. We’ll be back next week with a brand new episode. This week, we're re-releasing our episode on the mischievous haunted doll, Robert, and all his antics.
In the meantime, you can head over to our Patreon for some bonus content like our minisodes, including a recent update on the #FreeBritney movement and a Reddit relationship_advice segment that had both of our jaws on the floor.
We also added an all-new segment, Dear Sinister, where we take personal questions from listeners and provide them with our best advice.
Thanks so much and keep it creepy!

A harmless gift, a simple doll in a boy’s sailor suit. But for one man, this doll was more than a plaything, it was a companion, a lifelong friend, and a force in his life. Is this creation, made of fabric and wool, nothing more than a misunderstood toy? Or has he earned his reputation through decades of chaos and destruction?

      <title>Episode 148: Gwen Shamblin Lara and the Weigh Down Diet - Part 2</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/148</link>
      <description>CW: This episode contains discussions of weight loss methods and diet culture as well as brief mentions of child abuse. Listener discretion is advised.
It’s one thing to start your own church, but this fervent leader created an intense group that slowly took over its members’ lives - allegedly controlling who they married, how much they weighed, and even what psychiatric medication they were allowed to take. It looked like an empire that would continue to grow and last forever. Then a sudden tragedy changed it all. What’s next for this controversial group?

      <description>CW: This episode contains discussions of weight loss methods and diet culture as well as brief mentions of child abuse. Listener discretion is advised.  
A self-described dumb blonde with a genuine heart for God, this registered dietician combined her love of the Lord with her professional training to craft her lightning rod hit weight loss program.

      <title>Episode 146: El Chupacabra</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/146</link>
      <description>Under the cover of darkness, an unknown monster stalked its prey in Puerto Rico and throughout south Texas, leaving farm animals and house pets completely drained of their blood via two vampire-like puncture wounds in their necks. Witnesses reported sightings of a grotesque creature, sparking rumors that the true culprit was something much more sinister than any predator they had ever seen before.

      <title>Episode 145: Tom and Erika Girardi, The Hustler and the Housewife - Part 2</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/145</link>
      <description>She's an enigma wrapped in a riddle and cash - that has been allegedly taken from the pockets of the victims of tragedy. With her husband and his firm under investigation, and his so-called house of cards collapsing, the realest of housewives dropped an election day bombshell - she was filing for divorce. But was it due to years of mistreatment as she said? Or, was it really a sham meant to keep her hands on that precious cash to fund her lavish lifestyle?

      <title>Episode 143: The Mysterious Death of Ellen Greenberg</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/143</link>
      <description>CW: This episode includes extensive discussion on suicide and domestic violence
A vibrant young woman was found by her fiancé, stabbed to death inside their shared apartment. Police arrived, found she suffered twenty stab wounds to her front and back, and quickly determined her cause of death was… suicide? The Medical Examiner first disagreed and called it a homicide, but caved to pressure and changed his opinion to suicide. Now her parents have assembled a team of world-renowned forensic experts who all agree on one thing - their daughter was killed by someone else’s hand. Will a civil lawsuit help put them on a path to justice?

      <title>Episode 142: The Murder of Zona Heaster, the Greenbrier Ghost (ATWWD Crossover)</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/142</link>
      <description>This week we were thrilled to be joined by Christine and Em of And That's Why We Drink to discuss a true crime that also involves the paranormal - something for both of them, and for everyone else! Be sure to also check out our appearance on their show that will come out next Sunday, June 20th, wherever you listen to your podcasts!
A young woman was unexpectedly found dead, and her mother suspected something more sinister - possibly her drifter husband - was to blame. When her daughter appeared to her as a ghastly figure, she confirmed the mother’s suspicions and all the details of the murder. Would the ghost’s story be enough to bring her killer to justice?

Social media has become a way for us to connect with friends, keep up with the news, and more recently, get sucked into possibly harmful spiritual groups.

Is he inviting followers to an enlightened lifestyle, or recruiting suckers to fund his exotic vacations, fine whiskies, and expensive cigars?

      <title>Episode 138: The Disappearance of Kristin Smart - Part 3</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/138</link>
      <description>Years passed and the Smart family was no closer to finding answers for what happened to their daughter on May 25, 1996. Once civilians and private detectives stepped in, the family saw some progress. It wasn't until a new sheriff was elected that moves were made. What eventually brought the case close to an end was a breakout podcast that shed new light on the details and unearthed new clues, finally leading to some arrests in the case.

      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/137</link>
      <description>With their daughter missing, her devastated parents relied on law enforcement to conduct a thorough investigation. To their dismay, the case was passed between departments and delayed long enough for key evidence to be lost. Despite sufficient evidence for officers to identify a suspect, they needed his cooperation to close the case. All the suspect was willing to do was plead the fifth. Decades would pass before they got any real answers.

      <description>Four students leaving a party. A dark street. A short walk back to campus. But for one college freshman, the person trusted to walk her home seems to be the reason she was never seen again. For decades, the case lingered, the investigation changed hands, and it wasn’t until a renewed media scrutiny that arrests were made. Did authorities have their suspect from day 1?

After a failed defense, the murderer was sentenced to death, but that was not the end for him or for Kitty’s story.

      <title>Episode 134: The Murder of Kitty Genovese - Part 1</title>
      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/134</link>
      <description>For 50 years, psychology textbooks used the tragic story of a murdered young woman to teach students about the devastating impact of inaction by neighbors. The magic number - 38 - was chosen by the media as the number of careless onlookers who heard the woman’s demise in real-time and did nothing. But the true story of what happened that night teaches us that even when there are bystanders, there are still plenty of helpers willing to come running when they’re called to aid a beloved friend.

      <link>https://sinisterhood.com/133</link>
      <description>Bulging, glowing eyes in the dark. A leathery green face. A silhouette standing four feet tall wielding a wand. What sounds like the stuff of fairytales is real life for several citizens of southwestern Ohio. Did they really find themselves face to face with an amphibious monster, or was this nothing more than frog-wash?

      <description>A charismatic leader with a Zen philosophy and a fitness model physique. A crowd of eager young disciples looking for a direct path to God. On the outside, this group had all the features of a Shangri-La society but on the inside, it became mandatory to worship the leader and submit to his every whim.

      <title>The #FreeBritney Movement: Part 2 (Re-release)</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/thefreebritneymovementpart2rerelease</link>
      <description>Hey everyone, we’re still out on maternity leave. This week we’re bringing you a double feature re-release of our coverage on the #FreeBritney movement. 
If you haven't already, check out part 1 of our coverage. You can also watch The New York Times new documentary, "Framing Britney Spears" which shows the unfair and invasive media coverage Britney received as she struggled under the scrutiny of the public eye.
This episode covers the beginning of the conservatorship, its legal intricacies, how it has changed over the years, and sadly, how it's stayed much the same, even while Britney has become, what her lawyer has called, "highly functioning."
After checking out these throwback episodes, you can head over to our Patreon for some bonus content like our minisodes, including our update on the FreeBritney movement that was released after these episodes. We also have other bonus content like mixed bags, Wheel segments and Am I the Asshole questions - where Reddit users ask whether they're acting like assholes and we judge them!
Enjoy the episode! Thanks so much and keep it creepy
_As one of the biggest pop stars in the world, the paparazzi’s cameras were trained on her as she struggled to maintain control of her life. Then she wound up in one of the most restrictive arrangements under the law. Her family and legal team said it was necessary, but fans believed their beloved icon was begging for their help on her social media pages. Then the movement finally found some traction - but what happens next? _

      <itunes:subtitle>As one of the biggest pop stars in the world, the paparazzi’s cameras were trained on her as she struggled to maintain control of her life. Then she wound up in one of the most restrictive arrangements under the law.

      <itunes:summary>Hey everyone, we’re still out on maternity leave. This week we’re bringing you a double feature re-release of our coverage on the #FreeBritney movement. 
If you haven't already, check out part 1 of our coverage. You can also watch The New York Times new documentary, "Framing Britney Spears" which shows the unfair and invasive media coverage Britney received as she struggled under the scrutiny of the public eye.
This episode covers the beginning of the conservatorship, its legal intricacies, how it has changed over the years, and sadly, how it's stayed much the same, even while Britney has become, what her lawyer has called, "highly functioning."
After checking out these throwback episodes, you can head over to our Patreon for some bonus content like our minisodes, including our update on the FreeBritney movement that was released after these episodes. We also have other bonus content like mixed bags, Wheel segments and Am I the Asshole questions - where Reddit users ask whether they're acting like assholes and we judge them!
Enjoy the episode! Thanks so much and keep it creepy

      <title>The #FreeBritney Movement: Part 1 (Re-release)</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/thefreebritneymovementpart1rerelease</link>
      <description>Hey everyone, we’re still out on maternity leave. This week we’re bringing you a double feature re-release of our coverage on the #FreeBritney movement. 
Britney is still under the conservatorship and the control of her dad. The New York Times released the documentary "Framing Britney Spears" which featured video footage spanning the many years of this restrictive arrangement.
This episode covers Britney's early years all the way through the actions that caused her dad to petition for a conservatorship.

_Starting with her pigtailed debut, she rocketed to stardom as one of the biggest pop stars of all time. At first, all her dreams seemed to be coming true. But behind the scenes, things weren’t going so well for this icon. A divorce. A custody battle. Stints in the hospital for mental health reasons then finally, her rights were stripped away via an allegedly temporary legal mechanism. A decade later, the conservatorship remains. How could a pop legend end up with her every move controlled? _

      <title>The Dyatlov Pass Incident (Re-release)</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/dyatlovpassrerelease</link>
      <description>Hey everyone, we’re still out on maternity leave. (You like how I said “we”??) This week we’re bringing you a classic episode that’s been making the headlines recently. 
National Geographic has reported that scientists using animation software from the movie Frozen have determined what really happens to the hikers of the Dyatlov pass incident. 
Did they finally prove that the KGB stalked the hikers and took them out? Or did they find evidence of a yeti? Aliens? Olaf?
Not quite. They’re saying it was a simple explanation - the hikers perished in an avalanche. But listen on, because there is a mountain of evidence that points to a much more sinister explanation. 
After checking out this throwback episode, you can head over to our Patreon for some bonus content like our minisodes, mixed bags, Wheel segments and Am I the Asshole questions - where Reddit users ask whether they're acting like assholes and we judge them!
Enjoy the episode! Thanks so much and keep it creepy
Nine hikers go missing on a treacherous and difficult hike up, what some call, Dead Mountain. Russian Military, aliens, bigfoot - who or what is to blame for the Dyatlov Pass incident?

      <title>God's Salvation Church (Re-release)</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/godssalvationchurchrerelease</link>
      <description>Hey everyone, we’re taking this week off. We're re-releasing one of our favorite past episodes - Gods Salvation Church about a Dallas-based doomsday cult and it's rise and fall in one of our local suburbs.
After checking out this throwback episode, you can head over to our Patreon for some bonus content like our minisodes, mixed bags, and Wheel segments where we spin an actual game show wheel to determine what we're going to talk about!
Thanks so much and keep it creepy!
On the brink of the new millennium, one man claims to know the day God will return to Earth...and He's doing it on a spaceship. When he and the rest of the UFOlogy cult take up residence in a Texas suburb, decked out in all white and cowboy hats, officials fear they may have a Heaven's Gate situation on their hands. Will it end as badly as everyone thinks, or will Hon-Ming Chen turn out to be just another false prophet?

      <title>Introducing 'Power: The Maxwells'</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/powerthemaxwells</link>
      <description>Everyone’s heard of Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffery Epstein’s alleged partner in crime. But there’s a shadowy figure who hangs above her who you likely don’t know: her father, media tycoon Robert Maxwell.


His rise from nothing, to his success as a businessman, to his fall from the deck of his super yacht under mysterious circumstances, is something straight out of a crime novel. And his favorite daughter Ghislaine’s theory?: her father was murdered.


From Somethin’ Else, makers of ‘The Immaculate Deception’ and ‘Faultline: Bush, Blair &amp; Iraq’, hosted by Investigative journalist Tara Palmeri, ‘Power: The Maxwells’ is a seven part series on the incredible true story of a media mogul whose legacy is still being felt today and the family saga of Ghislaine, a millionaire daddy’s girl who became an accused sex trafficker and her brother, Kevin, who became Britain’s biggest personal bankrupt.


'Power: The Maxwells’ tells the story of a family like no other - a rags to riches to rags again tale of power and greed. New episodes drop every Tuesday wherever you get your podcasts. We know we'll be listening and we hope you will, too.

      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/125</link>
      <description>A suburban wife and mom turned to the internet to make a little cash with a side hustle. But when she ended up dead outside her home, the media swarmed and focused on her adult-themed business. To catch her killer, police looked no further than her own husband as the culprit. Was this a tragic accident as her husband claimed, or was the answer something more sinister?

      <title>D.B. Cooper (Re-release)</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/dbcooperrerelease</link>
      <description>Hey everyone, we’re taking the week off. We’ll be back next week with a brand new episode. This week, we're re-releasing our episode on the only unsolved American sky jacking case in history, D. B. Cooper.
In the meantime, you can head over to our Patreon for some bonus content like our minisodes, including a recent update on the #FreeBritney movement.
We also added an all new segment, THE WHEEL, where we spin an actual game show wheel and discuss topics chosen by you.
Thanks so much and keep it creepy!
The late 1960s were a golden age of air travel - spacious legroom, glamorous flight attendants, delicious meals on every flight... and a rash of violent hijackings. Some were politically motivated, while others were fueled by greed. The most famous and mysterious hijacker of all took control of a 727 with nothing more than a black briefcase, a handwritten note, and a pair of sunglasses. He got his money, and his parachutes, then disappeared into the night, never to be heard from again. Did he die in the Washington wilderness? Or did he manage to make an escape with his bag of cash?

      <itunes:summary>Hey everyone, we’re taking the week off. We’ll be back next week with a brand new episode. This week, we're re-releasing our episode on the only unsolved American sky jacking case in history, D. B. Cooper.
In the meantime, you can head over to our Patreon for some bonus content like our minisodes, including a recent update on the #FreeBritney movement.
We also added an all new segment, THE WHEEL, where we spin an actual game show wheel and discuss topics chosen by you.
Thanks so much and keep it creepy!
The late 1960s were a golden age of air travel - spacious legroom, glamorous flight attendants, delicious meals on every flight... and a rash of violent hijackings. Some were politically motivated, while others were fueled by greed. The most famous and mysterious hijacker of all took control of a 727 with nothing more than a black briefcase, a handwritten note, and a pair of sunglasses. He got his money, and his parachutes, then disappeared into the night, never to be heard from again. Did he die in the Washington wilderness? Or did he manage to make an escape with his bag of cash?

      <description>Hey everyone, we’re taking the week off. We’ll be back next week with a brand new episode. Please enjoy this all-too-timely re-release, our episode on QAnon.
You can also head over to our Patreon for some bonus content like our all-new Wheel segment, and our latest minisode on Zozo the Ouija Board demon.
Thanks so much and keep it creepy.
The internet is home to a wide range of tales, fringe groups, and conspiracy theories. But one theory has become the centralized narrative to unite them all. It starts in Washington D.C. and extends from Hollywood, around the globe, and even into space. Has a message board managed to get a straight line to the white house or is this just another case of the internet gone wild?

      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/113</link>
      <description>Starting with her pigtailed debut, she rocketed to stardom as one of the biggest pop stars of all time. At first, all her dreams seemed to be coming true. But behind the scenes, things weren’t going so well for this icon. A divorce. A custody battle.

      <title>Episode 112: The Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/112</link>
      <description>The gorgeous architecture and intricate stonework hide a century’s worth of abuse and horrors in this now-abandoned facility. At the height of its operation, the rooms and halls were filled with vulnerable and abused patients. Now closed, this asylum is supposedly occupied by otherworldly residents and has gained a reputation as one of the most haunted places in America.

Thanks so much &amp; keep it creepy!
Self-Help. Personal Growth. Life-improvement. Multi-level marketing schemes promise riches, better lives, and unimagined happiness. But beneath the surface of this organization was a secret society that drained its members of money, personal autonomy, and even their lives.

      <title>Episode 111: The Georgia Guidestones</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/111</link>
      <description>Imposing and majestic, these stone slabs were placed mysteriously on a mountain in 1980 by an anonymous group. The words inscribed on them seemed innocent at first. But some theorized that the words actually have an evil meaning. Was this monument truly just an innocent marker meant to help humanity or was it inspired by a much more sinister purpose?

      <title>Introducing Smoke Screen: Fake Priest</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/smokescreenfakepriest</link>
      <description>Father Ryan was a popular priest who spent the last thirty years traveling the Midwest swindling millions of dollars out of people where he used the money to enrich himself, spend away, and declare bankruptcy whenever outed for falsifying his identity. Despite this, only once did law enforcement officially charge Father Ryan with crimes related to his church. But even then, he managed to essentially win the case. He’s now free and working on his next con. 


Smoke Screen: Fake Priest from Neon Hum Media, is a new documentary podcast hosted by Alex Schuman, a news reporter from the Midwest, that has been chasing Father Ryan’s story for years. The craziest part is that Alex also gets an exclusive sit-down interview with Ryan himself and in it, the Fake Priest reveals a shocking secret.

      <itunes:subtitle>Father Ryan was a popular priest who spent the last thirty years traveling the Midwest swindling millions of dollars out of people where he used the money to enrich himself, spend away, and declare bankruptcy whenever outed for falsifying his identity. Despite this, only once did law enforcement officially charge Father Ryan with crimes related to his church. But even then, he managed to essentially win the case. He’s now free and working on his next con. 

Smoke Screen: Fake Priest from Neon Hum Media, is a new documentary podcast hosted by Alex Schuman, a news reporter from the Midwest, that has been chasing Father Ryan’s story for years. The craziest part is that Alex also gets an exclusive sit-down interview with Ryan himself and in it, the Fake Priest reveals a shocking secret.

      <title>Episode 108: Rey Rivera: Part 2</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/108</link>
      <description>Rey Rivera’s body had been found, but what led to his disappearance was still a mystery. His family looked everywhere for answers - from the cryptic note he left behind, to the strange phone call that caused him to leave home, and especially to his ties with his former employer. Does one theory explain how these led to his death? Or will his family ever find answers?

      <description>They were a seemingly happy couple with a perfect life. But one phone call seemed to change everything. When their beloved husband, brother, and son goes missing, an entire community searches for him. But when he is finally found, they instead begin searching for clues. Was this a tragic case of an unanswered cry for help? Or was their missing loved one the victim of a game among power players for which he paid the ultimate price?

      <description>Unscrupulous thieves are willing to steal anything of value they can get their hands on, and the underground market for this sweet product is something beyond imagination. A simple breakfast table staple can net an enormous illegal profit.

      <title>Jeffrey Epstein (Re-release)</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/epsteinrerelease</link>
      <description>Hey everyone! We're taking the week off, but we'll be back next week with an all new episode. We decided to re-release this episode since it’s back in the news right now.
You can also head over to our Patreon for some bonus content like our weekly mixed bags and monthly minisodes. And this month’s minisode will be an Epstein update. 
Thanks so much &amp; keep it creepy!
An enormous mansion in New York. Another in Miami. Jets, employees, charities. His own private island. This mysterious billionaire had it all and thought he was above the law - until brave victims and a bombshell news story blew the lid off the whole thing. Even with an arrest and an indictment, will his victims ever truly find justice?

      <description>A harmless gift, a simple doll in a boy’s sailor suit. But for one man, this doll was more than a plaything, it was a companion, a life long friend, and a force in his life. Is this creation, made of fabric and wool, nothing more than a misunderstood toy? Or has he earned his reputation through decades of chaos and destruction?

Though its odd appearance may make it seem innocuous, it’s actually poisonous, aggressive and some say even electric. Are the warnings about its danger nothing more than legends?

      <description>While cults sometimes prey on the vulnerable, this exclusive and esoteric group attracted the wealthy and successful. Was this in order to build an elite new colony of people in another dimension, or was their money used to fuel the lavish lifestyle of their leaders? When it all came crumbling down, the results were deadly.

      <title>Feed Drop: The Why You...? Podcast</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/feeddropwhyoupodcast</link>
      <description>Hey guys. Christie and Heather here. As you may have noticed from the title of this week's episode, we're doing something different. After talking about it, we decided that given the renewed focus on racial justice, criminal justice reform, and the violent actions of the government against protestors and the black community, we wanted to step back from the mic and instead amplify the voices of black creators and create space to share their show with you.


The Why You...? Podcast is a brand new podcast by fellow Texans, and husband and wife duo, Mikayla and Alfonso Davis. Their first three episodes dropped June 2 and can be found on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, and Spotify. We're bringing you their first episode which focuses on anxiety and how they have coped with it throughout their lives. They are funny, charming, and inviting. We are so grateful that they're letting us share their first episode with you and know you'll love it just as much as we do.


Like, subscribe, share, and follow them on social media on Instagram at WhyYouPod_ and on twitter at WhyYouPod. Also head to their feed where you'll find two more episodes. Links are in the show notes.


If you're like us, you have spent a lot of time this week wondering how you can show your support to the black community and protesters. We have compiled a list of resources we hope you find helpful. Head to our website and click “Justice Resources” in the top right corner to find ways to help. Please enjoy this episode. Thank you so much and stay safe!

      <description>Once a year, America’s wealthiest and most influential men descend on a collection of cabins in the lush forests of Northern California. They claim the retreat is a break from business, meant to recharge and relax their minds. But some people believe the true plans are something more sinister. Are these titans of politics and industry meeting to perform satanic rituals in an attempt to take over the world? Or is that even necessary since they already run it?

      <description>Talk shows in the 1990s focused mostly on the outrageous - family drama, out of control teens, secrets, and surprises. But one secret set off a chain of events that tragically took a life. That crime started a national conversation that left the country searching for where to place blame. Was it the talk shows' fault or was the one to blame the man who pulled the trigger?

      <title>Episode 97: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/97</link>
      <description>For centuries, humankind has seen objects in the sky. For every report they’ve made, those who have claimed to see unidentified flying objects have been mocked and brushed off by skeptics. But with the advent of modern technology, those sightings have now been recorded, and some have been released to the public. Were the US’s most elite pilots witness to a visitor from another planet? Or was this merely an encounter with a highly advanced Earth-based foe?

      <description>Tales of possession have endured since ancient times, warning the faithful of what may happen if they turn toward sin.

      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/95</link>
      <description>For centuries, treasure hunters have dug deep into the depths of this small island searching for the supposed treasure that lies beneath the earth. Hopeful searchers have sunk millions of dollars into the quest, with each hunt bringing back only fragments of the booty the legend promises. Is there a treasure chest waiting for them at the end of the hunt, filled with riches beyond their wildest dreams? Or will the search turn up nothing more than fool's gold?

      <description>For decades, true believers have insisted that the government knows more than it lets on about aliens, time travel and mind control. Proof may lie deep under the lush green grass of this Long Island location, where the government conducted experiments that tore through the fabric of space-time and inspired the plot of the hit Netflix show Stranger Things.

      <description>After a superstar defense secured an acquittal and his prior conviction sat awaiting appeal, things seemed to be looking up for the fallen Patriots star. But less than a week after the jury returned the good news, a prison guard would make a devastating discovery. What could have caused Aaron Hernandez's irreversible decision - was it drugs, depression, long term brain damage? And did his death mean he had finally cleared his name?

One psychologist has suggested that money doesn’t buy happiness, but instead buys a lack of culpability. In this infuriating case was this a legitimate defense or just another example of the favorable treatment of the rich in our justice system?

      <title>Episode 80: The Mandela Effect</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/80</link>
      <description>Some things we swear we remember exactly. A movie quote. The name of a book. The death of a celebrity. But then we find out - we were wrong.

      <title>Episode 79: Y2K</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/79</link>
      <description>20 years ago on New Year's Eve, the world held its breath as the clock ticked down towards midnight. Planes falling from the sky. Bank accounts drain to zero. Traffic lights gone dark. The turning of the century called for chaos and confusion. But what happened was more akin to an average, everyday glitch. Was this really the tale of the government who cried wolf or was the United States closer to the brink that we all thought?

      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/78</link>
      <description>His victims were often marginalized, their cries for help ignored by the justice system. This man, now considered by the FBI to be the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history, exploited vulnerable members of society to allow his crime spree to last for over 35 years and span states across the nation. It took multiple law enforcement agencies to bring him to justice, and with recent FBI interviews, the magnitude of this monster is finally being discovered.

      <description>A black defendant in a small town is convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to death. But years of new evidence lead his family and new defense team to plead with the court that the wrong man was on death row. After witnesses come forward and fresh eyes weigh in on the case, a Texas court issues an eleventh-hour reprieve, preventing the wrong man from being executed for a crime he did not commit.

      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/74</link>
      <description>The internet is home to a wide range of tales, fringe groups, and conspiracy theories. But one theory has become the centralized narrative to unite them all. It starts in Washington D.C. and extends from Hollywood, around the globe, and even into space. Has a message board managed to get a straight line to the white house or is this just another case of the internet gone wild?

      <title>Episode 69: D. B. Cooper</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/69</link>
      <description>The late 1960s were a golden age of air travel - spacious legroom, glamorous flight attendants, delicious meals on every flight... and a rash of violent hijackings. Some were politically motivated, while others were fueled by greed. The most famous and mysterious hijacker of all took control of a 727 with nothing more than a black briefcase, a handwritten note, and a pair of sunglasses. He got his money, and his parachutes, then disappeared into the night, never to be heard from again. Did he die in the Washington wilderness? Or did he manage to make an escape with his bag of cash?

      <description>When screams and shrieks tear through the pine forest of southern New Jersey, locals know what comes next. Hoof tracks. Flapping wings. And the hideous head of a goat. This demonic presence has stalked the lush green southern coast of the Garden State for centuries. Can it be explained by science, blamed on 18th-century ignorance, or is there something more sinister to blame?

      <description>There are many ways to get rich - be born into money, win the lottery, work hard, or solve a series of clues written into a poem by an eccentric, modern-day Indiana Jones. Thousands of people have undertaken the search, but still, the treasure remains hidden. Are the clues as easy to solve as the writer would have you believe? With at least two people coming within 200 feet of the orante Romanesque chest filled with ancient artifacts, jewels, and gold, there is hope that a thrill-seeking treasure hunter will find the treasure of a lifetime.

      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/64</link>
      <description>A man with no identity, he gave different names and stories to everyone he met. Popping in and out of cities, never leaving a trace. Until one day, he left the biggest clue of all - an abandoned little girl, left at a trailer park. Years later police would learn his crimes spanned the country and decades, and a team of strangers made up of law enforcement and everyday people would finally get some closure on one of the biggest cold cases of their careers.

      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/ep-63-anna-delvey-sororkin</link>
      <description>Some people work their whole lives to achieve wealth and success. But for one woman all it took was a European accent and multiple promises of future wire transfers. Suddenly she found herself at the hottest hotels and at lavish dinners with celebrities. But it all came crashing down once the bills were due. Criminal charges, jury deliberations, and fabulous courtroom ensembles are just a few of the things that make up this wealthy web of lies.

Is it a prehistoric beast, still alive after centuries, a family of misunderstood creatures who just want some peace of their own, or is it all much ado about nothing brought on by those desperate to see something that really isn't there?</p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sinisterhood?fan_landing=true">Support Sinisterhood</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>Self-Help. Personal Growth. Life-improvement. Multi-level marketing schemes promise riches, better lives, and unimagined happiness. But beneath the surface of this organization was a secret society that drained its members of money, personal autonomy, and even their lives. A sex cult where women were referred to as "slaves", branded like cattle, and forced to have sex with a leader they called Vanguard all under the guise of "female empowerment."

      <description>A concept created to inspire audiences and delight children can sometimes take on an unnerving and nightmarish form. With painted faces and bouquets of balloons, they lurk on street corners or wait for you in the woods, luring children and frightening adults. Are they simply teenage pranksters or is there something more sinister at play?

      <description>The early 1970s were a time of great turmoil and upset with the free love of the 60s fading to cynicism and growing dangers. For the women of the Pacific Northwest, activities as seemingly harmless as going to the beach or hitchhiking suddenly had deadly consequences. Women began disappearing at a rate never before seen by law enforcement and tips poured in to help catch the cold-blooded killer. Could this handsome, charming law student named Ted be their prime suspect?

      <title>Episode 49: Gypsy Rose Blanchard</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/ep-49-gypsy-rose-blanchard</link>
      <description>By all accounts Dee Dee Blanchard and her daughter Gypsy Rose were an unfortunate pair - a single mom, forced to care for her daughter and her many illnesses. As if that weren't bad enough, their home was destroyed in Hurricane Katrina. When Habitat For Humanity was gracious enough to build them a new home in Springfield, Missouri, neighbors welcomed the devoted and loving mother and the sweet young girl who always had a huge smile on her face despite her sickly condition. But things aren't always as they appear, and what neighbors didn't suspect was one of the worse cases of Munchausen syndrome by proxy was occurring right across the street. Even more shocking is how the horror would end. Dee Dee and Gypsy's story gripped the nation and can now be seen in the HBO documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest, the Hulu series_ The Act_, and continues to make headlines from the courtroom.

Even more shocking is how the horror would end. Dee Dee and Gypsy's story gripped the nation and can now be seen in the HBO documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest, the Hulu series_ The Act_, and continues to make headlines from the courtroom.

        <![CDATA[<p>By all accounts Dee Dee Blanchard and her daughter Gypsy Rose were an unfortunate pair - a single mom, forced to care for her daughter and her many illnesses. As if that weren't bad enough, their home was destroyed in Hurricane Katrina.

      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/ep-48-la-llorona</link>
      <description>What could drive a beautiful young mother to commit the unthinkable? An unfaithful husband, the desire to live a carefree life, or something even more sinister? There are many versions of this Mexcian folklore but one thing remains a constant: if you see a weeping woman roaming the river banks at night, dressed in a white gown with long black hair, RUN!

      <description>This West Texas town went from desolate to impossibly hip as it became an art and cultural hot spot. But while the town’s face may have changed over the years, one thing has remained the same since before settlers decided to make this desert oasis their home. Glowing lights dancing over the desert mountains, beacons to ranchers and tourists alike. But what are these lights in the distance? Ancient spirits? An inexplicable phenomenon? Or are they messages from another world...?

      <description>Kaufman is a sleepy town on the outskirts of Dallas, but what should have been a tight-knit community was torn apart when three innocent people, including the county’s top prosecutors, were gunned down in two incidents. A sinister message to police indicated more assassinations were planned. Was this the work of a white supremacist prison gang or was the terror closer than they could have imagined?

      <description>A beautiful family. A luxury home. An idyllic street. A perfect town. Seems like the recipe for the American dream. But this family's dream soon turned into a nightmare when they began receiving threatening letters from someone simply known as The Watcher who made it very clear they were not welcome in the neighborhood. But who could have been demented enough to send these sinister messages? Was it a neighbor from hell, a bitter real estate agent, or could it possibly be the entire thing was a hoax concocted by the family themselves?

      <title>Episode 40: God's Salvation Church</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-40-gods-salvation-church</link>
      <description>On the brink of the new millennium, one man claims to know the day God will return to Earth...and He's doing it on a spaceship. When he and the rest of the UFOlogy cult take up residence in a Texas suburb, decked out in all white and cowboy hats, officials fear they may have a Heaven's Gate situation on their hands. Will it end as badly as everyone thinks, or will Hon-Ming Chen turn out to be just another false prophet?

      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-38-sam-cooke</link>
      <description>The voice of an angel, the soul of a change maker, the mind of a businessman. Sam Cooke was the highest selling artist of the 1960s, second only to Elvis, and his crossover appeal made him a fan favorite of audiences of all races. He was at the height of his career when he was gunned down in a seedy Los Angeles motel. Was it a justifiable homicide as the police would have you believe? Or did something more sinister happen?

      <description>Usually, you send flowers and chocolate on Valentine's Day, but Al "Scarface" Capone decided he was going to send a bloody message to his longtime rival Bugs Moran. On Feb. 14, 1929, seven of Moran's men from his North Side gang lay dead on a warehouse floor, gunned down by Thompson Submachine guns. Was a power struggle to control the lucrative bootlegging operation the motive for this massacre, or, like love, is this story a bit more complicated?

The United States government claims it will do whatever it takes to protect its citizens, but what if they very citizens they claim to be protecting are unwittingly part of a horrific psychological experiment? One journalist blew the lid on this decade long government-sanctioned torture. But did it really ever end?

While some of these stories have happy endings, sometimes the events surrounding the disappearance, and eventual discovery of their loved ones, are so bizarre that friends and families are left with more questions than answers. Could harsh environments or predatory animals explain what happened, or is something more sinister to blame?

      <description>Is evil born or made? Given the right circumstances will good people turn on their fellow man or woman? In 1971 an elite psychology professor conducted what some would call the most groundbreaking and controversial experiment the world has ever seen in search of the answer. But was the experiment unbiased or were the results tainted because of the professor's own sadistic tendencies?

      <title>Episode 31: Mothman</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-31-mothman</link>
      <description>A man-sized bird creature that stands 6 feet tall, has a wingspan of 15 feet, and ominous glowing red eyes. There have been many speculations as to Mothman's origins since he was first spotted in Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1966. Some believe he is an alien creature or a government experiment gone wrong. Skeptics dismiss the phenomena saying Mothman sightings are really just sightings of a Sandhill Crane or an elaborate teenage prank. So what exactly is Mothman? And more importantly, does he visit cities and towns to warn them of impending danger or is his presence what causes the tragedies?

      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-30-the-death-of-jonbent-ramsey-part-2</link>
      <description>JonBenét Ramsey's brutal murder captivated a nation. At the time, the family hired an army of lawyers and refused to talk to police. Did they have something to hide, someone to protect, or were they simply taking precautions against an overzealous police force bent on framing them? Suspects have cropped up, but DNA evidence, behavioral analysis, and expert testimony all provide conflicting theories. Through all the theories, one goal emerges - justice for an innocent girl slain on Christmas.

      <description>For decades the mystery that has shrouded Area 51 has led to some of the most bizarre conspiracy theories out there. Is it where the remnants of a possible crashed alien spacecraft from Roswell, New Mexico being housed? Has the government mastered time travel in an underground lair? Is there really an invisible runway that can only be detected when sprayed with water? Hundreds of eyewitnesses claim to have seen UFO's flying in the airspace above the military base. But were those just black project spy planes? Or is the truth really out there and can be found in the Nevada desert?

      <title>Episode 26: The Assassination of John F. Kennedy: Part 2</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-26-the-assassination-of-john-f-kennedy-part-2</link>
      <description>The "official" report from the Warren Commission states Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of President Kennedy. However over 60% of Americans believe otherwise. Could Oswald have been working with the CIA, KGB, or both? Did LBJ's desire to be President cause him to orchestrate the unthinkable? Was the mafia sending a message to Bobby Kennedy by killing his brother? With a laundry list of people that would have benefitted from Kennedy being out of the picture it's difficult to know who really was the mastermind behind the events of November 22, 1963. Of course it was probably Rafael Cruz and a poison shrimp dart.

      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-25-the-assassination-of-john-f-kennedy-part-1</link>
      <description>In an effort to win over a conservative city that he and LBJ lost in the election, John F. Kennedy visited dallas on November 23, 1963. Depsite a warm reception the fanfare was cut short when shots rang out in Dealey Plaza and JFK became the fourth President of the United States to be assassinated. There were dozens of eye witnesses but did anyone really see what happened? Or did the CIA have the wool pulled over the nation's eyes?

      <title>Episode 23: The Kennedy Family Curse</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-23-kennedy-family-curse</link>
      <description>One of the most powerful families in American history has been beset by tragedy since they first set foot on American soil. Multiple plane crashes, two political assassinations, cancer, drug overdoses, suicide. Think of something horrible and it has almost certianly happened to the Kennedy's. Some blame an old Irish curse for their endured hardships while others believe a large family with high risk professions and a domineering father is the cause. Whatever the reason one thing is for certain - you do not want to be a Kennedy.

      <description>Traveling abroad with your best friend sounds like a dream come true, but for Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon it became a living nightmare. More than four years after they went missing in the Panamanian jungle there still isn't a definitive answer as to what tragedy befell these women. Phone records recovered from their cell phones tell a story of two women desperately trying to get help. Pictures recovered from their camera seem like they were trying to send a message to their families as to what had happened. But what did happen still remains a mystery...

      <title>Episode 19: The Smurl Family Haunting</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-19-the-smurl-family-haunting</link>
      <description>The Smurl family claims that they were tormented by a demonic presence in their home for 13 years. Black masses would materialize before them, loud banging and scratching in the walls would keep them up at night, and a succubus with the head of a young woman and the body of an old lady covered in scales did the unthinkable. The Smurls and famed demonologist and clairvoyant Ed and Lorraine Warren claim their horrifying stories are true. However many believe this was the product of untreated health conditions or just an elaborate hoax for fame and fortune. You be the judge.

      <title>Episode 17: Elisa Lam</title>
      <link>http://sinisterhood.com/shownotes/episode-17-elisa-lam</link>
      <description>Bizarre behavior captured by an elevator camera launched this case into the spotlight. What caused Elisa Lam's erratic and paranoid behavior at The Cecil Hotel? Paranormal activity, a game to access another dimension, government testing? Could the dark and tortured history of the hotel and its seedy residents be to blame? Or was it her lifelong battle with mental illness? Years after her body was discovered floating in the water tank on the hotel rooftop there are still more questions than answers.

      <description>You might think Manhattan's best kept secret is that swanky new underground club you and your friends can't get into. However, it might just be this modern day doomsday cult that meets weekly in a Murray Hill brownstone. Descendants of an Atlantis Aryan super race, a future without stomachs, rampant homophobia - "The Light" really ticks all the crazy boxes! And you probably wouldn't want any of them designing your home...unless you REALLY like owls.

      <description>Where it all began! Lucky number 13 is the perfect place to start a creepy podcast!
The deadliest diving cave in Florida, locked with a rusted gate, has claimed many lives. So what makes one man's disappearance any different? A missing body. An abandoned life. Did the depths claim Ben McDaniel or did he fake his own death to start a new life? Or, perhaps, it was something even more sinister.
