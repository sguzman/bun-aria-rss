      <title>Amazon Device May Be Able to Read Your Emotions</title>
      <description>Amazon is working on a voice-activated device aimed at recognizing your emotions. The wrist-worn gadget is described as a health and wellness product, but could very well help the e-commerce behemoth target you for advertising. Andrew Mach speaks to Bloomberg News technology reporter Matt Day on the tech giant's move to wearable (and very personal) technology and the potential privacy concerns if the device ever makes it to market.

      <title>Trump Impeachment Calls Grow Louder</title>
      <description>Impeachment is having yet another moment on Capitol Hill, as Democrats look for a way to enforce what they consider their constitutional duty to investigate the Trump White House. In a surprise Rose Garden speech Wednesday, President Trump said he could no longer work with Democrats until they stop their investigations into his administration and finances. Meanwhile, Democrats argue impeachment is the answer because he's holding up those investigations. Andrew Mach speaks to Bloomberg News congressional correspondent Billy House about the temper tantrums on both sides of the aisle and the road ahead.

      <title>Insurers Miss Mark on Mental Health</title>
      <description>May is Mental Health Awareness month, but the U.S. is in the midst of a mental health crisis. More than a decade ago, the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act was passed, requiring insurers to provide comparable coverage for mental health and medical treatments. But insurers are missing the mark - denying claims, limiting coverage, and finding other ways to skate around the law.

      <title>Trump's Immigration Sales Pitch</title>
      <description>President Trump made a Rose Garden speech to roll out his new immigration plan, which was crafted by his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. The administration is hoping to overhaul the current U.S. system, shifting it from family based to a merit-based one that prioritizes visas for high-skilled workers, secures the southern border and potentially generates an estimated $500 billion in net federal revenue. Andrew Mach speaks to Bloomberg News White House reporter Justin Sink about what's in the plan and it's likely path forward.

        <![CDATA[<p>President Trump made a Rose Garden speech to roll out his new immigration plan, which was crafted by his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. The administration is hoping to overhaul the current U.S. system, shifting it from family based to a merit-based one that prioritizes visas for high-skilled workers, secures the southern border and potentially generates an estimated $500 billion in net federal revenue. Andrew Mach speaks to Bloomberg News White House reporter Justin Sink about what's in the plan and it's likely path forward. </p><p><strong>FOLLOW UP</strong></p><p>Mark's latest report: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-15/trump-to-unveil-kushner-s-immigration-overhaul-plan-on-thursday">Trump Unveil's Kushner's Immigration Overhaul Plan </a>You can follow Justin at: <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsink?lang=en">@justinsink<strong> </strong></a></p><p>----</p><p><em>TicToc is a daily news podcast hosted by Andrew Mach (</em><a href="https://twitter.com/andrewjmach"><strong>@</strong>andrewjmach</a><em>), produced at Bloomberg Worldwide HQ in New York City.

      <title>Making the Deepest Ocean Dive in History</title>
      <description>Victor Vescovo completed the deepest ocean dive in human history when he reached 10,928 meters into the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench of the Pacific Ocean. The entire journey took nearly 12 hours — four hours to descend, four hours spent at the bottom, and then about four hours to ascend again. Jennifer Zabasajja speaks with Vescovo on his unprecedented dive and how the experience changed him for good.

      <title>China Strikes Back in Trade War with U.S.</title>
      <description>In the newest wrinkle in the U.S.-China trade war, China announced it will raise tariffs from 10% to 25% on $60 billion of U.S. goods beginning on June 1. It's a retaliatory measure after President Trump last week raised tariffs to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods. But who's really paying for the tariffs? Andrew Mach speaks to Bloomberg News senior economics writer Shawn Donnan about what happens when the politics of getting tough on China collides with the economics of the tariffs for the rest of the world.

      <title>Is Nashville the Next Austin? Not Quite</title>
      <description>Over the past few years, Nashville has slowly caught up with Austin as a go-to U.S. destination. Like Austin, the city has flourished despite being in a deeply conservative state. A slew of anti-LGBTQ bills from Tennessee legislators though may get in the way of the city's booming economic scene. Bloomberg News Legal Reporter Erik Larson joins Jennifer Zabasajja to talk about this story, which he writes about in the latest issue of Bloomberg BusinessWeek.

      <title>Road Ahead for Uber After IPO</title>
      <description>It's been a long 10 years as a private company for Uber. Finally though, the ride-hailing giant is preparing to make its long-awaited initial public offering. Analysts expect the listing to be one of the largest for technology IPOs in 2019, that doesn't mean the ride ahead is all smooth sailing though. Bloomberg News Startup Reporter Eric Newcomer joins Jennifer Zabasajja to discuss what's ahead for the company as it enters the public market.

      <title>Can the Iran Nuclear Deal Be Salvaged? </title>
      <description>Iran suspended two parts of the 2015 deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, namely the sale of surplus enriched uranium and heavy water. The announcement came on the one year anniversary of President Donald Trump pulling the U.S. out of the deal that was also signed by France, Britain, Germany, Russia, and China. Andrew Mach speaks with Bloomberg News State Department reporter Nick Wadhams to discuss the implications of this announcement, especially in light of renewed U.S. pressure on Iran through sanctions on metals and an increased military presence in the region.

      <title>Breaking Down Georgia's Heartbeat Bill</title>
      <description>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed a “heartbeat bill” on Tuesday. The bill bans abortions in the state once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks. Georgia is one of several states in the U.S. that has attempted to pass this bill. Is this a potential indicator that Roe v. Wade is in danger of being overturned?

      <title>U.N. Biodiversity Report Puts World 'On Notice'</title>
      <description>More than a million species of plants and animals are in danger of extinction, according to a United Nations report released Monday. The study by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services concluded that the threat is due to humans, with species loss now occurring tens to hundreds of times faster than it has in the past. World Wildlife Fund Chief Scientist Rebecca Shaw joins Andrew Mach to discuss the most comprehensive review yet of the damage people are inflicting on the planet—and the changes will put people at risk.

      <title>Beto O'Rourke's $5 Trillion Green New Deal</title>
      <description>Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke released a $5 trillion plan to combat climate change over the next decade with a goal of achieving net-zero emissions in the U.S. by 2050. He said he would put the U.S. back in the Paris Agreement, if elected, and seek legislation in his first 100 days in office to set a “legally enforceable” requirement that the nation remove as much greenhouse gases as it emits, with half of that goal completed by 2030. Andrew Mach speaks to Bloomberg News political reporter Emma Kinery about how his ambitious plan may affect his 2020 chances.

      <title>Hollywood Writers and Agents Torn Apart</title>
      <description>The Writers Guild of America, the body representing most major screenwriters, instructed members to sever their ties with Hollywood’s biggest talent agencies late last week due to a contract dispute. As top agencies have expanded the scope of their business in recent years, including financing and producing their own projects, more writers are feeling overlooked when it comes to their paychecks, especially in the era of Peak TV. Andrew Mach speaks to Bloomberg News entertainment reporter Anousha Sakoui about whether the disagreement will affect film and TV production.

      <title>The First-Ever Picture of a Black Hole</title>
      <description>Scientists revealed the first-ever glimpse of a super-massive black hole Wednesday, as the Event Horizon Telescope released its findings in a “ground-breaking” discovery that's being hailed as a paradigm shift for astronomy. In their attempt to capture an image of a black hole, scientists combined the power of eight radio telescopes around the world, creating a virtual telescope around the same size as the Earth itself. Andrew Mach speaks with Katie Bouman, who was part of that international team of astronomers and developed an algorithm to piece together the historic image.

      <title>The Spicy Success of Sriracha </title>
      <description>If you like hot sauce, chances are you know about Sriracha. The chili sauce was brought to American consumers by David Tran, a now 73-year-old Vietnamese refugee, who founded a food company named after the boat that brought him to the U.S. Now, nearly 40 years later, the company controls nearly 10% of the $1.55 billion American hot sauce market, and other hot sauce makers are stepping into the ring, aiming to take over American fridges.

      <title>Netflix's Queen Bey</title>
      <description>Beychella is coming to Netflix. The streaming service released the first trailer for Beyonce's "Homecoming" special about her 2018 Coachella performance that's been dubbed "a cultural movement." Beyonce directed the documentary, set to be released April 17, and its trailer seems to indicate fans will get a behind-the-scenes look at how her performance, years in the making, all came together. Andrew Mach speaks to Bloomberg News' Lucas Shaw about how the film fits perfectly into Netflix's strategy of industry domination—and Beyonce's strategy to do just about anything she wants.

      <title>The 'Mysterious Genius' of Kurt Cobain</title>
      <description>It's been 25 years since the death of Kurt Cobain, the Nirvana frontman who heralded rock's grunge era of the early 1990s. The iconic musician tapped into a collective state of mind through earnest songwriting that challenged the angst and alienation of his time. Now, 25 years later, his impact on music remains as important as ever. Andrew Mach speaks to Danny Goldberg, Nirvana's co-manager from 1990 to 1994 and author of "Serving the Servant: Remembering Kurt Cobain," who says that while Cobain hated being called the voice of a generation, his legacy is ultimately exactly that.

      <title>What You're Not Eating Is Killing You</title>
      <description>Which risk factor is responsible for more deaths around the world? It’s not smoking. It’s not even high blood pressure. It’s a poor diet. In fact, it’s what we’re not eating that’s killing us faster, according to a new global study. Andrew Mach speaks to Dr. Ashkan Afshin of the University of Washington, who authored the study that was published this week in the medical journal The Lancet, and he says the fix is more than just eating more fruits and vegetables.

      <title>The Bombshell Bezos Twist</title>
      <description>The fight between Jeff Bezos and the National Enquirer just got even uglier. Earlier this year, the tabloid got hold of text messages of the Amazon CEO that confirmed an extramarital affair which allegedly led to the end of his 25-year marriage. Now, in an unexpected turn, a private investigator claims that Saudi Arabia had access to Bezos's phone before the photos and texts were ever leaked. Andrew Mach speaks to Bloomberg News reporter Spencer Soper about how this new development raises the stakes of this global scandal.

Jennifer Zabasajja speaks to activist, writer and director Maria Giese, who’s at the center of the new documentary “This Changes Everything,” at the Bloomberg Business of Equality Summit about the fight for more female voices in the entertainment industry.

      <title>Disney Begins Year of Live-Action with "Dumbo"</title>

      <title>Trump's Push to Gut Obamacare</title>
      <description>The U.S. Justice Department is ramping up its efforts to topple Obamacare once and for all. In a dramatic reversal, the Trump administration now says the entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down. President Trump has repeatedly said he would protect people with pre-existing conditions. Andrew Mach speaks to Bloomberg News health policy reporter Anna Edney about how this new shift doubles down on stripping away all of the law's health care protections—and sets up a new fight on the road to 2020.

      <title>The Fight Over Mueller's Findings</title>
      <description>Even though Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 22-month investigation is over, in many ways, the political battle is just heating up. While we don’t know the full extent of the findings, we do know President Trump declared victory after the report found insufficient proof that he or anyone from his campaign colluded with Russia. Andrew Mach speaks to Bloomberg's Shannon Pettypiece about how the reality of the situation is a bit more complicated.

Andrew Mach speaks to Bloomberg's Apple reporter Mark Gurman on what  this marketing strategy means for Apple as it competes with slowing smartphone sales and tries to envision a future without the iPhone at its center?

      <title>Facebook’s Endless Damage Control </title>
      <description>Over the past year, Mark Zuckerberg has faced his share of bad weeks. This week might rank near the top. His social network faced its largest service outage ever, it faced more questions on its data-sharing practices, it lost one of its most senior executives and it all culminated when the suspect in a terror attack in New Zealand streamed the mass shooting on Facebook. David Meyers speaks to Bloomberg's Facebook reporter Sarah Frier about the endless damage control Zuckerberg and Facebook seem to find themselves in.

      <title>Understanding "Operation Varsity Blues"</title>
      <description>It's been called the largest college admissions scam ever prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice. For years, dozens of rich parents used their wealth to cheat the system with lies and with bribes that totaled $25 million, all with the hopes of getting their kids into some of the most prestigious schools in the country. David Meyers speaks to Bloomberg's Erik Larson on how this house of cards was built and how it all came tumbling down.

      <title>Boeing's Crisis Deepens </title>
      <description>The crash of the Ethiopian Airlines flight that killed all 157 people onboard Sunday continues to draw global attention. The reason why? The plane was a Boeing 737 Max 8. The same model as the Lion Air flight that crashed less than five months ago killing 189 people. David Meyers speaks to Bloomberg's Justin Bachman about the debate on whether there is a connection or if the two catastrophes are just a tragic coincidence.

      <title>SXSW: Keeping Austin Weird</title>
      <description>It started as a small music festival over 30 years ago. Today, the South By South West festival is the center of the universe when it comes to culture, politics and technology.

But as Austin becomes more and more reliant on big tech, can it continue to live by its motto of keeping Austin weird?

      <title>Dems Divided on Israel Comments</title>
      <description>From the moment House Democrats took control of power, they have had one, unifying objective: to push back against what they saw as the wrongdoings of the Trump administration. But a fight inside the party has now developed over the U.S.'s policy toward Israel and accusations of anti-Semitism. David Meyers speaks to Bloomberg's congressional corespondent Anna Edgerton on how it's a fight pitting the old guard of the party against the new guard and threatening a generational rift.

Brown tells David Meyers, what many are also doing is legally, yet unknowingly, exposing their genetic data to law enforcement agencies--possibly opening a Pandora's Box of privacy.

David Meyers speaks to Bloomberg's Caleb Melby about the serious questions now being asked about those who ran the committee and how they spent the money.

      <description>For millions of Americans, tax season might be a pain, but it's one that typically comes with a refund that many families depended on. But this year that pain is coming with a big surprise. Rather than a refund, many are actually getting a tax bill instead. David Meyers speaks to Bloomberg tax reporter Ben Steverman on why this is happening despite the tax code overhaul that lowered rates for most Americans.

      <description>In a stunning blog post by the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos directly accuses the publisher of the notorious grocery store tabloid The National Enquire of attempted blackmail.

      <title>America's Lunchroom War</title>
      <description>A surprising war is being fought in the lunchrooms of America's schools. On one side of the battle: the Obama-era regulations to feed children healthier meals. On the other: President Trump's Agricultural Department which wants to put more fat, sugar and salt back on school menus. And as Bloomberg's Peter Robison tells David Meyers, you might be surprised to learn who's winning that battle.
