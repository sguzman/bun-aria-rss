      <title>The Big Suey: Meadowlarkers 51 "An Athlete In The Family"</title>
      <description>The Meadowlarkers crew is back in full force as Kate, Howard, and Amin discuss a recent article from The Atlantic about the downsides of having an athlete in the family. The crew dives into the professionalization of youth sports and how it's taken away from free play for kids and changed the way we view sports as a whole. As a child becomes the "family business," how does it change relationships with their parents and even their siblings? And how do college scholarships being associated with sports affect how we approach them? The Meadowlarkers are here to explain.
