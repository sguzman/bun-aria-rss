      <title>145 - Roux the Day</title>
      <description>Tim and Heather are darn near driven to bankruptcy by an extra order of guac. The gang has a classic Hawkins playlist session, in which Luke is particularly affected by Heather’s least favorite song in the universe. Livy sings a traditional Irish folk ballad (chaos ensues because there’s no vocal guitar). Jackson calls in to say hello, and don’t worry, he probably got the job!

Tim softens the blow on telemarketers after Heather sets him straight. Luke and Levi relive the foundation of human civilization through a game of squish ball. Oh, and there will be scat.

      <title>143 - You Just Got Sconed</title>
      <description>Tim’s inside news source in Eastern Europe has almost no clue what’s going on in Ukraine. The gang receives a complimentary batch of 2-piece swimsuits. Livy breaks down the step-by-step process of raising comedically gifted children. Heather gets road rage and hits a building with her car that was giving her some attitude. Luke recalls his boyhood days in the woods and, reportedly, is the first human to successfully put his phone charger into the wall in one fell swoop.

      <title>136 - To Eat a Mockingbird</title>
      <link>https://poddybreak.libsyn.com/to-eat-a-mockingbird</link>
      <description>The gang is back for an epic 2022! This week, Jackson steps off his soap box and takes a seat to join the conversation. (Don’t worry…ranting to follow). Everyone puts their heads together to try and make certain rap songs family friendly, Livy educates everyone on the art of the fitted sheet, and Jackson goes full-on Scottish. A sprawling fast food discussion ensues that will surely be referenced in academic papers. Plus, Omicron itself calls in to profess both its iron-fist rule and its fandom of the show...so sweet!

Livy and Heather try to nail down what to get Tim for Christmas...even though he just wants a candle. Plus, a special call in from Mark Zuckerberg, who explains the true meaning of Meta and has a binary sneezing fit.

      <title>129 - Al Go Rhythm with special guest John Branyan</title>
      <link>https://poddybreak.libsyn.com/129-al-go-rhythm</link>
      <description>The gang is joined by comedian and good ol’ Tim pal, John Branyan! A masterclass ensues on the art of stand up and everyone tries out material, new and old, that you won’t want to miss. Resolved in this episode: God decides who’s funny and who’s not and the government can get over your fence if they so desire...probably. Luke speaks blasphemy of cotton candy and Livy counts down from ten.

Livvy performs a soul-altering guitar solo without a guitar and yet another family is ripped apart by debates over the 2009 classic, Avatar.

      <link>https://poddybreak.libsyn.com/044-spencer-hawkins-smells-bowties-and-monkey-skulls</link>
      <description>Ding ding, back in the ring, for another round of Poddy Break! Tim’s eldest son Spencer is on the show, and he’s making bowties for dogs! Caleb’s been bored during the slow work season, and Tim has lactic acid in his quads. Freight sings a sliver of karaoke, and laughs at a dog. And the Hawkins clan makes a terrifying discovery in the family van.
  Also in this episode: Tim misses the smell of mimeograph ink. Luke Bryan hits Dylan Scott with a folding chair. Kevin the Guitar Center guy shows up and plays some monster riffs. Freight speaks in his Russian Accent. And Spencer eats a whole jar of strawberry preserves.Get your Poddy Break Merch!

      <description>Jonnie W is back! (and we could talk to him if Freight didn't take his sweet time getting to the dadgum microphone...) Tim gets flummoxed by cheese cubes. Jonnie gets in trouble with his wife because of something Caleb said. And, in a special turn of events... JASON THE BUS DRIVER IS ON THE PODCAST! Jason gets a poignant phone call from the strange man that he found in his hotel room. (and it's amazing!)  
   Also on this episode: Jonnie talks about his past jobs. Tim starts "hot sauce talk". Jonnie rants about E.T. for the Atari 2600. Freight touches his mic. The gang talks about Fortune Cookies, Ouija Boards and Magic Eight Balls. And Jonnie leaves his rental car running during one of his shows.

      <link>https://poddybreak.libsyn.com/026-tims-mom-hand-towels-dancing-and-hot-crossed-buns</link>
      <description>Tim's Mom is here! Pooz is here! John Crist is here! Honestly, this is the most people we've ever had on the bus. But even with those cameos this show is about the greatness that is Nelda Hawkins, Tim's mom.
 Hear her spin yarns about not being able to find a towel at the hotel, Coach accidentally drinking champagne, and the time Tim drank a bottle of laxative. She's got stories about not dancing, what Tim was like as a baby, and what it's like having a comedian as a son.

      <link>https://poddybreak.libsyn.com/019-tims-kids-spoiled-rich-kid-flip-phones-and-hockey-talk-0</link>
      <description>THE RETURN OF SPOILED RICH KID… This episode is a special one, because Tim, his kids, Spencer, Olivia (Livi), Levi, and Spencer's new bride, Keagan are all along for the ride. Spoiled Rich Kid kicks things off, and educates Caleb on bidets. Tim gets a flip phone, and gets upset when people eat his macadamia nuts. Levi's hair looks like Twitty from Even Stevens, and family friend Brock gets mauled by a house cat off camera.
 Spencer and his new bride, Keagan honeymoon at Disneyland and eat bad Japanese candy. Keagan gives her insights into the St. Louis Blues off season strategy, while Spencer and Tim get overly aggressive on the ice. Olivia gets a sloth for graduation, pledges her allegiance to the monarchy and cries at mean YouTube comments. Caleb and Tim get a curry in the basement of Rashpoot and talk about their trip to England.
 Oh, and Spoiled Rich Kid is back, if you're into that sort of thing.

      <title>018 - Kirk Cameron - Perm-mullets, Mouth Ulcers and the Hate-able Good Boy</title>
      <link>https://poddybreak.libsyn.com/018-kirk-cameron-perm-mullets-scottish-accents-and-the-hate-able-good-boy</link>
      <description>Show me that smile, again… Because it's time for another Poddy Break! This week, we've got the amazing Kirk Cameron! Tim is concerned for Kirk's disheveled appearance. Kirk suggests that Tim should take a turn on Dancing with the Stars, and Tim blames Kirk for his haircuts in the 80s. Friend of the show, Gary King, asks a serious question, and Tim gives a terrible answer. Then Kirk asks a serious question, and Tim gives another terrible answer. Kirk buffs up and beards up for a movie roll.
 Also in this episode: The gang discusses the secret areas of Disneyland. Caleb orders Panda Express in the middle of the show. Tim has a movie idea, and gives Kirk the right of first refusal. Two new characters call into the show after Kirk decides to give away tickets to Tim's shows in exchange for answering a trivial question. And Kirk's marriage seminars prove, as long as we've got each other, we can take anything that comes our way.

      <description>Whoopsie! You know when your computer goes all haywire, and you lose all your files, and you eat a pint of ice cream while weeping softly to yourself and watching old episodes of "House Hunters"? Okay, well most of that happened, and now, we can't release what would have been episode two.
 So, grab a bowl full of Chunky Monkey, keep a stiff upper lip, and head on over to episode 3! It's available now!
 We apologize for the inconvenience, and now back to your regularly scheduled shenanigans.
