No one knows exactly the ‘daily new cases’. What we can measure is the ‘daily new <em>confirmed</em> cases’, and it of course <strong>depends on the number of daily tests</strong>, that have soared since a few months.</p><p>Thats what several comments pinpoint:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y3UQ0r_p-jrLWB8tl95qdw.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xj6qNoG9oWVkdf3uNqlVYw.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZhYpdm8phpNuGM-hpdCCOg.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eIZp94QMhx8BgxrfZrocQw.png" /></figure><h3>Wait a second minute…</h3><p>What’s more the log scale of the graph (indeed a very good way to represent an exponential phenomenon) can be misleading, and hide the fact that the acceleration is not steady since months, contrary to what we can understand with the initial tweet.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AO5XfhsNOl535Htr0itIYQ.png" /></figure><p>Here is what would have looked the tweet with a linear scale (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-03-02..latest&amp;country=~FRA&amp;region=World&amp;casesMetric=true&amp;interval=daily&amp;hideControls=true&amp;smoothing=0&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;pickerSort=asc">source</a>)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7K9nNWtn5UsRp-5LH10JaQ.png" /></figure><h3>Wait a third minute…</h3><p>Whatever the representation (linear or log scale), at first glance it seems that things are looking like behaving as purely exponential — so predictable.</p><p>However it is not, as some comments point out.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Information Theory</h3><p>Between 1997 and 2000, I learned the fascinating domain of information theory and digital communications:</p><ul><li>source coding: entropy, compression, Huffman, …</li><li>noisy communication channels and their capacity: Shannon limit, …</li><li>error detection and correction codes: Hamming, Hadamard, BCH, convolutional, turbocodes, …</li><li>optimal receiving and decoding: sequential, Viterbi, …</li></ul><p>I applied this knowledge between 2000 and 2013, on applications that were at this time 2G/3G mobile networks, modems (V90, ADSL, …), satellite communications, digital microwave radio links, …</p><p>My reference book was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Communications-John-Proakis-Fourth/dp/B004IOVT9A"><strong>Digital Communications</strong></a>, by John G. Proakis.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/404/0*uBZfmhU5Lmh9sMJW.jpg" /></figure><h3>Machine Learning</h3><p>In 2013, I decided to radically change my field, and started to learn machine learning, and apply it to enterprise data.</p><p>My first source of inspiration has been <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning"><strong>Standford’s Andrew Ng course</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Inference-Prediction/dp/0387848576"><strong>Elements of Statistical Learning</strong></a>, by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/333/0*7xZazcMCnz5Xayqe.jpg" /></figure><h3>Bridging the gap</h3><p>In my mind, those two disciplines — information theory on one side, and machine learning on the other side — were two separated domains, corresponding to two distinct periods of my engineering career (2000–2013, and then 2014–2020+).</p><p>But I then recently discovered a new book: <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Information-Theory-Inference-Learning-Algorithms/dp/0521642981"><strong>Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms</strong></a>, by MacKay, and it made me change my mind.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*95OPJmz2Fyf05GKx.jpg" /></figure><p>This book first adresses information theory (data compression, noisy-channel coding, …), and then neural networks. And suddenly, Chapter 40 page 483, <strong>the two fields are reunified</strong>:</p><blockquote>Neural network models involve the adaptation of a set of weights <strong>w</strong> in response to a set of data points, for example a set DN of N target values t1, …tN at given locations <strong>x</strong>1, …<strong>x</strong>N. The adapted weights are then used to process subsequent data. This process can be viewed as a communication process, in which the sender examines the data DN and creates a message <strong>w</strong> that depends on those data. The receiver then uses <strong>w</strong>; for example, the receiver might use the weights to try to reconstruct what the DN was. This is using the neuron for ‘memory’ rather than for ‘generalization’, ie extrapolating from the the observed data to the value of tN+1 at some new location xN+1. The adapted network weights <strong>w</strong> therefore play the role of a communication channel, conveying information about the training data to a future user of that neural net. The question we now address is, ‘what is the capacity of this channel?’ — that is, ‘how much information can be stored by training a neural network?’</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iA4XKZte5Y_JgvKjPihBHg.jpeg" /></figure><p>How magic is it, to understand that two domains you love, and thought different, are in fact linked.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8bb8109db58d" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Countries which Primarily use Antimalarial Drugs as COVID-19 Treatment See the Same Dynamic of daily Deaths as Others</h3><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> — this article is an attempt to show that with the same data, and different analysis methods, a scientific paper can be summarized with different titles, revealing different angles of the results, and leading to different conclusions. It is based on a recent paper published under two different titles:</p><blockquote><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3575899">Countries which Primarily Use Antimalarial Drugs As COVID-19 Treatment See Slower Dynamic of Daily Deaths</a></blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.20063875v1">National Consumption of Antimalarial Drugs and COVID-19 Deaths Dynamics : an Ecological Study</a></blockquote><p>I here propose a third title, with its demonstration:</p><blockquote>Countries which Primarily use Antimalarial Drugs as COVID-19 Treatment See <strong>the Same</strong> Dynamic of daily Deaths as Others</blockquote><p>I don’t try to conclude anything here. I do that to raise citizens awareness on how the same data can be used to demonstrate different things.</p><p>COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is an international public health problem with a high rate of severe clinical cases. Several treatments are currently being tested worldwide. This paper focuses on anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, which have been currently reviewed by a systematic study as a good potential candidate and that has been reported as the most used treatment by a recent survey of physicians. We compare the dynamics of COVID-19 daily deaths in countries using anti-malaria drugs as a treatment from the start of the epidemic versus countries that do not, the day of the 3rd death and the following 10 days. <strong>We show that the first group have the same dynamic in daily deaths that the second group</strong>. This univariate analysis is of course only one additional piece of evidence in the debate regarding the efficiency of anti-malaria drugs, and it is also limited as the two groups certainly have other systemic differences in the way they responded to the pandemic, in the way they report death or in their population that better explain differences in dynamics (systematic differences that may also explain their choice to rely on anti- malaria drugs in the first place). Nevertheless, <strong>the similarity in dynamics of daily deaths is so striking that we believe that the urgency context commands presenting the univariate analysis before delving into further analysis</strong>.</p><h3>Method</h3><p>In this study, we set up two groups of countries and study the dynamics of the number of deaths between the day of the 3rd death and the following 10 days. The first group is made up of countries that we know use or produce chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine on a massive scale during this period. The second group consists of countries that did not use or produce chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in large quantities during the period under consideration. When we calculate the averages of each of the two groups,<strong> we find very marked similarities in their temporal dynamics</strong> (see results).</p><p>The 60 countries most affected by the epidemic (in terms of number of cases) were studied one by one in descending order to determine whether or not they were conducting a national strategy for the large-scale use or production of chloroquine at the beginning of the epidemic in the country (around the 3rd death). If there was no evidence of such a strategy, or even if sources indicated a strategy to the contrary, the country was classified in the “control group” group, until a panel of countries was obtained in order to have a large sample, provided that daily death data were available for the 10 days following the third death. The second group was constituted with the countries among the 60 most affected in terms of number of cases for which sources indicate the massive use or production of chloroquine at the beginning of the epidemic in the country (around the 3rd death), provided that they have daily death data for the 10 days following the 3rd death. The different groups of countries were constituted according to the information available in the international press on their use or mass production of such drugs over the period under consideration. Respectively 15 and 17 countries thus constitute each of the two groups</p><p>For each of the two groups, the number of daily deaths is noted each day from the 3rd death in the country and the following 10 days. Then, <strong>we normalize by the size of the population older than 65 in each country (the population that is the most vulnerable to COVID-19), to allow fair comparisons</strong>. Then the average of the normalized daily deaths is established for each day for each group of countries.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UqKGxeHbDXAgZKGIgbAxpg.png" /><figcaption>Number of normalized daily deaths after day with 3 deaths, “antimalarial drugs group”.</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aQwpnsGyas7VnTQnM1YVsA.png" /><figcaption>Number of normalized daily deaths after day with 3 deaths, “control group”.</figcaption></figure><h3>Results</h3><p>The graphical projection of the mean curves indicates <strong>a similarity</strong> in the dynamics of the daily death curves of the two groups of countries, which is very clear for the period studied (i.e. from the beginning of the epidemic).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*67K0yVgOSNpWkpu7XvjhLw.png" /><figcaption>Means of the number of normalized daily deaths for each group</figcaption></figure><h3>Limitations</h3><p>It should also be noted that while many sources exist to determine the health action of governments, including their use or mass production of chloroquine from the onset of the crisis, quantitative data are lacking and do not allow for more in-depth temporal analyses and causality tests. There also might be systematic differences between the two groups — in particular political differences, urban differences or differences in other strategy aspects such as testing. There is strong evidence for places like South Korea and Japan that mass testing is an effective strategy to control the epidemic, and our study might be a proxy for testing strategies. All these aspects should be examined in a late study.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p><strong>We find no difference in death rates, with countries using antimalarial drugs compared to those which do not</strong>. This univariate analysis is of course only one additional piece of evidence in the debate regarding the efficiency of anti-malaria drugs, and it is also limited as the two groups certainly have other systemic differences in the way they responded to the pandemic. Nevertheless, <strong>the similarity in dynamics is so striking that we believe that the urgency context commands presenting this analysis before delving into further analysis</strong>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=98c5fe9d4290" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

This goes beyond the simple <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/blog/2015/02/07/dashboards-versus-data-visualization/">data visualization or dashboard </a>— sometimes (severely) depicted as <a href="http://www.esourcingforum.com/archives/2016/05/11/dashboards-big-data-minitel-internet/">Minitels of Big Data</a> !</p><p>Difficulties to go to production can come from several factors :</p><ul><li>Data Scientists findings remain trapped into their computers, because their are not conceived to be shared in a compatible way with the enterprise IT, or not enough user friendly</li><li>End users are not involved early enough in the project — at the end the question of the <em>business alignment</em> is raised</li><li><a href="http://www.artefact.is/news/pourquoi-ce-dialogue-de-sourd-entre-si-et-m%C3%A9tiers">Organization is unsuitable</a> : silos between <a href="http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl/">the “thinkers” and the “doers”</a>, source of frustration</li><li>and so on …</li></ul><h4>The traditional way of doing things</h4><p>Kaggle, <a href="http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/why-we-need-methodology-data-science">internet</a>, MOOCs, … teach us how to drive a “Big Data” project : scoping, data gathering, cleaning, analysis (data visualization), modeling, reporting (dashboards), production.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CjA-6iNb49nJ-FF0B7IwPw.jpeg" /></figure><p>This approach is <em>firstly</em> focused on the <strong>technical</strong> aspects, to lead <em>secondly</em> to the <strong>application</strong>. It has been suitable during the last 3 years, while entry barriers were mainly technological.</p><p>But a <strong>breakthrough</strong> is happening : Data Science tools are now becoming<strong>mature</strong>, more and more easy to use, by an increasing number of collaborators. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fr/machine-learning/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/machine-learning/">Google</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/services/machine-learning/">Microsoft</a> launched their specialized data platforms, <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2016/05/11/apache-spark-2-0-technical-preview-easier-faster-and-smarter.html">Spark 2</a> will be launched, <a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/732225628628385794">deep learning</a> is going mainstream.</p><p>Let’s take an analogy : for a startup in the <em>digital economy</em>, in many cases <a href="https://salon.thefamily.co/french-engineers-and-entrepreneurship-its-complicated-340ff349db1#.hx9qp5bhy">it isn’t technology that makes the difference</a>. (but rather, it is a well-designed interface, an exceptional customer experience). This is the same for Data projects : usage, <a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2015/10/what-we-learned-at-wrangle-2015-data-science-is-about-people/">people</a> and design are the <strong>critical success factors</strong> — no more technical aspects only.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*L2wstsuklCvAcuqNJ43LTw.jpeg" /></figure><h4>Towards an new approach</h4><p>That’s why it’s time to change, and reverse the cycle of Data Science projects:</p><blockquote>No more starting from the Data Lake, to reach the application, but starting from the application and going back to the Data Lake</blockquote><p>In many cases, everybody can find satisfaction:</p><ul><li><strong>Business users</strong> can express their needs early in the project</li><li><strong>IT teams</strong> can anticipate production, and prepare the suitable environment</li><li><strong>Data Scientists</strong> finally know which precise problem they have to crack, and can concentrate their energy on it</li><li><strong>Software developers</strong> are involved early in the application development, which is favorable to agile increments, and a better engagement</li></ul><p>This <strong>innovative</strong> approach, breaking <a href="http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/the-poc-problem">the culture of the permanent POC</a>, is at the center of Zelros product value proposition. From day 1 of the project, a minimum viable <strong>Data Application</strong> is deployed : software still limited, but functional, prone to refinements. These Data Applications help our customers to <strong>incarnate</strong> their projects, and concentrate teams towards a<strong>common goal</strong>, reachable in a <strong>few weeks</strong> — and no more <strong>several months</strong>.</p><p>Try this recipe in you future project, we would love to hear about your feedbacks.

Data science is beautiful, but complicated, fragmented and changing fast. It’s a mess, and it’s going to be worse in the future.</p><p>As a data scientist, I was looking for a way to understand our data-centric era, both <em>simply </em>and <em>quickly</em>. I realized that the quote was the perfect solution for that.</p><h4>The unsuspected power of quotes</h4><p>As often in innovation, the idea of <a href="http://dataquo.net/">DataQuo.net</a> came from a personal experience. I’m an active user of Twitter, and I like to share readings about Data in general. Through successive observations over time, I noticed that when I quoted carefully chosen article excerpts, it had<strong> much more impact</strong> than just quoting the paper headline itself.</p><p>The reason is simple : by selecting a quote, you <strong>add value</strong>. It’s a proof that you have read, understood and analyzed the paper (8 out of 10 people read only the headline). It’s not an easy exercice to ask yourself : “what would be the best quote in this article (excluded it’s title), and why ?” If you find the answer, you allow the target audience to (<em>re)</em>-discover the reading, by offering a new understanding angle.</p><p>And the magic is that <strong>people love quotes</strong>, because they are short, intense, and self-explanatory. They are the beginning of a story, and the perfect entry point for a deeper dive into a subject.</p><h4>An exchange platform for the most surprising data quotes</h4><p>On DataQuo.net, data lovers meet each other. Everyday.</p><p>For the quote producer, the site is an opportunity to share its vision, to make the world discover its exciting findings, or to surface thoughts, that otherwise would have remained unnoticed.</p><p>For the quote consumer, it’s a chance to stimulate its reflexion, to discover good readings, or simply to find original material to illustrate a PowerPoint presentation.</p><p>In a nutshell, I want people to share the best data quotes on DataQuo.net, coming from all sorts of sources : academic papers, blog posts, talks, or presentations.</p><h4>A sober platform</h4><p>DataQuo.net uses a Hacker News-style interface. I discovered it from <a href="http://www.datatau.com">DataTau.com</a>, a data science forum. OK, its look and feel is a bit rude, but I like the sobriety of it’s design. It allows to focus on essence. And it has a cool usability, both on desktop and mobile devices.</p><p>What’s more, the integrated voting system allows to always have the best contents on the first page, and fresh material regularly.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/890/1*ZYYo3hcqO0fbk2PLZdHU5g.jpeg" /></figure><h4>The bottom line : my favorite quotes of the moment</h4><p>At the moment on the platform, I’m attracted by several quotes. I like the <strong>mind-blowing</strong> ones, like</p><blockquote>If people could see in high dimensions, machine learning would not be necessary.</blockquote><p>Or :</p><blockquote>The cost of a top, world-class deep learning expert is about the same as a top NFL quarterback prospect.</blockquote><p>I also like <strong>humoristic and sarcastic quotes</strong>, like</p><blockquote>A Data Scientist is a device for turning coffee and data into better decisions.</blockquote><p>Or :</p><blockquote>The ultimate insult in Data Science : “it explains everything, but predicts nothing”.</blockquote><p>and :</p><blockquote>Statisticians, like artists, have the bad habit of falling in love with their models</blockquote><p>And finally, I’m impressed by those quotes that are so ubiquitous and perpetual :</p><blockquote>Torture the data long enough, and it will confess to anything</blockquote><p>an finally,</p><blockquote>Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful</blockquote><p>I hope to see you soon on <a href="http://dataquo.net">DataQuo.net</a>. Discover and submit awesome data thoughts there !</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b3c49289cd3d" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the transcript of the “Data Scientist 2015” Paris conference opening keynote.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*x68X3v0nHDPIgN8LuJNTXQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>A Kudu</figcaption></figure><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I prepared this keynote by asking myself a question : <strong>what topic would I have mentioned, if I had to do the introduction talk of the last year edition ?</strong> Would it have been still relevant today ? Or already totally outdated ?</p><p>Last year, for instance, I definitely would have tried — yes, I say <em>tried</em> — to describe what is a data scientist. You know, this fictional role, half math nerd, half software geek, and half communication skilled. Three halves showing that it doesn’t really exists. Today, I’m still even more confused. <a href="http://businessoverbroadway.com/investigating-data-scientists-their-skills-and-team-makeup">A recent survey</a> depicted a data scientist as <strong>a spider with …. 25 feets</strong> ! Maybe after this conference day, we will know a bit more about this new role. And understand how broad it is.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SaqaUqPADs9chgxSMjyzhQ.png" /><figcaption><a href="http://businessoverbroadway.com/investigating-data-scientists-their-skills-and-team-makeup">Data Scientist, a spider with … 25 feets</a></figcaption></figure><p>However, compared to last year, we start having data about data scientists. After the quantified self, it’s time for <strong>the quantified data scientis</strong>t — data science on data scientists. Two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/2015-data-science-salary-survey">a linear model predicting the salary of data scientists was published</a>.</p><p>What is noticeable ? If you are a girl, unfortunately, you lose points. It won’t surprise anybody. Too bad, but even the data scientist job, like lot of technical positions, cannot escape this rule.</p><p>More funny, <strong>the more time spent in meetings, the more a data scientist (/analyst/engineer) earns</strong>. And if he spends too much time exploring data (4+ hours / day), he earns less ! That beats everything !</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CwDBcPij6TEEiylw2ufM1Q.png" /><figcaption>Data science on data scientists : <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/2015-data-science-salary-survey">a linear model to predict how much they earn</a></figcaption></figure><p>Some months ago, I would have been criticizing the lack of awareness of France, on what represents the data revolution. Let’s recognize that the landscape has changed. A new role has been created — the France’s Chief Data Officer, who recently also became the France’s Chief Information Officer, showing that <strong>public IT moves to a more data-centric approach</strong>. France now also has its own data science team, and <a href="http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000029388087&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id">a new word is born</a> : “mégadonnées” — “Big Data” in french.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/435/1*rwIkj_oG3xtPGczqM1S7jg.jpeg" /><figcaption>Henri Verdier, France’s CDO / CIO</figcaption></figure><p>Last year, I would have talked about pioneering companies, experimenting with data — doomed to a bright future. Today, I would be more nuanced. Data maturity of companies is very disparate, and the most advanced of them start doubting. <strong>75 % have invested in Big Data, but only 10% have projects in production</strong>. For the first time “machine learning”, one of the key component of data projects, is falling down in the last Gartner “Hype Cycle”.</p><p>Companies face disillusions. And ask themselves questions : I know how much it costs, but how much do I earn ? What is the ROI ?</p><p>Even projects with small data surface new problems — how do I use my data scientists discoveries ? This implies <strong>change management</strong>, modifying established business processes. One retailer, for example, learned that it could increase profits substantially by extending the time items were on the floor before and after discounting. But implementing that change would have required a complete redesign of the supply chain, which the retailer was reluctant to undertake</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*CZ1MayYRfYLMSiyWI2ULWA.png" /><figcaption>For the first time “machine learning” is falling down in the last Gartner “Hype Cycle”</figcaption></figure><p>On an other level, technological this time — and because data science is about a lot of technologies — I would probably have mentioned Map Reduce. An algorithm designed by Google about 10 years ago, to allow distributed processing of large volumes of data. A short time ago, it was a star. Today, it is <strong>outdated by a tsunami called : Spark</strong>.</p><h3>Chris. Bourguignat on Twitter</h3><p>Today I explained Map Reduce to my parents #BigData pic.twitter.com/uzPoN5dQxG</p><p>Lets’s take an other example. Two weeks ago, <a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2015/09/kudu-new-apache-hadoop-storage-for-fast-analytics-on-fast-data/">Cloudera announced Kudu</a>, a new columnstore bypassing entirely HDFS, the de-facto current big data storage technology. Aside from the fact that it helps data scientists improve their zoological knowledge (the Kudu is woodland antelope found throughout eastern and southern Africa), Kudu makes analysts wonder if <a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/merv-adrian/2015/10/04/strata-standards-stories-different-stores-for-different-chores/"><strong>HDFS joined MapReduce in the emerging “legacy Hadoop project” category</strong></a>…</p><p>On the other hand, I would undoubtedly not have talked about Deep Learning. A branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Neural networks, incredibly powerful, that learn from data like — and sometimes better than — humans. This domain made recently decisive advances. These algorithms showed how <strong>they were able to </strong><a href="http://www.boredpanda.com/computer-deep-learning-algorithm-painting-masters/"><strong>paint</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/"><strong>write</strong></a><strong>, or </strong><a href="http://theinquisitivists.com/2015/09/16/using-autoharp-and-a-character-based-rnn-to-create-midi-drum-loops"><strong>compose music</strong></a>. What’s next ?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/880/1*mVYWE1EPmnH7bLoNoLFw8w.jpeg" /><figcaption>Depp Learning Paintings</figcaption></figure><p>Neither would I have talked about ethics. <strong>Yes, ethics — who would have thought it comes to the debate</strong> ? A society where every single decision regarding citizens is driven by predictive models, <a href="https://medium.com/@chris_bour/ai-will-predictive-models-outliers-be-the-new-socially-excluded-bbcb6a7b16b1">raises concerns</a>.</p><p>That’s why data for good, <a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/aerosolve/">transparency in predictive algorithms</a>, and education about AI are currently growing topics.</p><h3>Elon Musk on Twitter</h3><p>Hope we&#39;re not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable</p><p>To conclude : don’t try to remember too much what I just exposed, <strong>it will be partially obsolete next year ! </strong>At least, it’s my prediction.</p><p>One thing, however, will remain. D.J. Patil, named recently by Barak Obama “US Chief Data Scientist”, wrote in 2012 in a famous and visionary Harvard Business Review article, that Data Scientist would become the <strong>“</strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/"><strong>Sexiest Job of the 21st Century</strong></a><strong>”</strong>. I’m also deeply convinced about that. Data Scientist is one of the most thrilling job of the world, and this will remain unchanged for a long time. We are a just at the beginning of the story.</p><p>I wish you an amazing day.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d888c3115c10" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>
