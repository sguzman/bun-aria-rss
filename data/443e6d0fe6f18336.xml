<p>Indeed, 2018 was the most volatile year since 2011. Relatively speaking however, the volatility is on the low end for a bear market, which <a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/2018/12/22/the-bear-is-here/">I believe started in late December</a>.</p>

   xx = ecdf(as.vector(djiVol))(as.numeric(tail(djiVol,1)))

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The selloff on Christmas eve was so bad it looked like a typical bear market capitulation. The following rally merely confirmed it.</p>
<p><span id="more-3376"></span></p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/2018/12/22/the-bear-is-here/">the last post</a>, at the time the correction reached 16%, at the close of December 21st, the oversold indicator was not lighted. What followed was the worst Christmas eve selloff ever. The selloff had two achievements. First, it took this bear market to a slightly deeper level than the 1998 bear market, which, <a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/2018/12/22/the-bear-is-here/">based on my previous analysis</a>, was the smallest bear market to date.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spbear-2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spbear-2.png" alt="" width="628" height="269" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3378" srcset="https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spbear-2.png 628w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spbear-2-240x103.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></a>
</div>
<p>The second accomplishment of the selloff was that it looked a lot like a capitulation typical of a bear market bottom or a reversal. Running the <em>capitulation</em> function from the previous post confirms. In other words, the seloff took the three relevant indexes 10% or more away from their 50 day exponential moving average.</p>
<pre class="brush: r; title: ; notranslate">
capitulation = function(spx=NULL, dji=NULL, nyse=NULL)

</pre>
<p>What&#8217;s next? No one knows. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It is a bear market until proven otherwise. In the distant pass, the capitulation indicator has been pretty reliable and less frequent. In the 2002 bear market, and especially in the 2008 there were more signals. The indicator gave a few signals way before the pain started to ease. In 2011, the indicator gave signal even without a bear market and was spot on &#8211; the bottom came a day later. Today&#8217;s rally certainly confirms the oversold theory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>October and December have been devastating for stocks. It wasn&#8217;t until Friday though that we officially reached the depths of a bear market.</p>
<p><span id="more-3368"></span></p>
<p>There are different theories what defines a bear market. The most common is 20% pullback in an index. As <a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/2018/03/24/the-bull-barely-survived-on-friday/">readers of this blog are aware</a>, I follow a slightly different definition, based on <a href="https://thedowtheory.com">Jack Schannep&#8217;s work</a>. Based on this definition, a bear market is official when two of the three major indexes (Dow Jones Industrial, S&#038;P 500 and Dow Jones Transportation) reach a 16% decline of the most recent high. For the mathematically inclined, the 16% is not random &#8211; simply it takes about 19% gain off the bottom of a 16% decline to reach the same level. Thus, a bear market is official at 16%, and a bull market &#8211; at 19%.</p>
<p>Friday was significant on these metrics. Here is the situation on the S&#038;P 500:</p>

<p>This has the following output:</p>

<p>The current pullback is the first 16+% correction since 2008. The story is the same on the Dow Jones Industrial:</p>

<p>This is certainly the most cherished bear market in US history, but that won&#8217;t make it less painful or less damaging. A recession does not always follow a bear market, but does quite often. How often &#8211; check Jack Schannep&#8217;s book. There are a few interesting statistics, like the average bear market decline and duration. Let&#8217;s take the S&#038;P 500 (history from 1950) and do the math:</p>
<pre class="brush: r; title: ; notranslate">
dd = table.Drawdowns(sp.ret, top=20)
print(dd)
# A visual inspection shows that we
# 11 previous bear markets 
mean(head(dd, 11)[,'Depth'])
# [1] -0.3288091 - 33%
median(head(dd, 11)[,'Depth'])
# [1] -0.2797 - 28%
max(head(dd, 11)[,'Depth'])
# [1] -0.1934 - 19%
</pre>
<p>A gloomy picture. The average bear market is 33%, the median bear market &#8211; 28% and the smallest &#8211; 19%. In other words, if history repeats itself, there is more pain to come. Significantly more on average.</p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle (mine puzzle, Jack Schannep has a lot more), is to check the market for oversold signs. For this, Schannep has proposed a simple, yet powerful, indicator to forecast market bottoms. <a href="https://theaverageinvestor.wordpress.com/2011/08/">It was extremely precise</a> in the 2011 pullback. Here is the code:</p>
<pre class="brush: r; title: ; notranslate">
capitulation = function(spx=NULL, dji=NULL, nyse=NULL)

  require(quantmod)

  spx = if(is.null(spx)) na.fill(Ad(getSymbols(&quot;^GSPC&quot;, from=&quot;1900-01-01&quot;, auto.assign=F)), &quot;extend&quot;)  else spx

<p>The above table shows that there is no extreme selling in the current recess. All in all &#8211; more troubles ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just finished the implementation of another approach to finding repetitive calendar behaviour, and was quite surprised that the only short period for stocks, has just began. What are the odds of this? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><span id="more-3357"></span></p>
<p>The calendar period I am talking about is the 21 day period from July 27th to August 17. I have been using the S&#038;P 500 index. Over the last 15 years the period has been negative 10 times (67% of the time), while on average a 21 day period is <b>positive</b> 60% of the time. If one is to use a 15 trial period as a sufficient sample, the deviation is significant.</p>
<p>The mean return for this period is -0.62% and the median is -0.89%. The full return data follows:</p>
<div>
<table class="whw">

<td style="color:#b51a28">-1.83%</td>

</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>The same pattern holds over a longer history. Over the last 30 years, the period has been negative 57% of the time, with mean return of -0.27% and a median return of -0.73%.</p>
<p>Notice, I didn&#8217;t say this was the worst period ever. It was the only one short period selected by my strategy, which tries to quantify and spread all biased periods over the year. Better periods have been excluded by other criteria. For instance, my strategy of choosing periods does not allow periods which are too close to each other. If that sounds murky, wait until I find the time to open source the code. Or think how you would have done it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Sell in May and go away</i>. Is there any truth to this? Did some work on seasonalities recently and applied it to the stock market to quantify the truthfulness of this statement.</p>
<p><span id="more-3351"></span></p>
<p>The video recording is available from <a href="https://youtu.be/6Ho88QvcLjs">my YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>First the methodology. To discover seasonalities, I decided to split each year in equal (or approximately equal) periods. The most natural period is a single month, and that&#8217;s what I started with. Later, I went a bit further by dividing each month into two. Thus, 24 periods per year, of approximately the same length.</p>
<p>Then, I run a python script to pull out some statistics for the various single periods (Dow Jones Industrial Average, 30 years of history):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30.png"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30-720x395.png" alt="" width="720" height="395" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3352" srcset="https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30-720x395.png 720w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30-240x132.png 240w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30-768x421.png 768w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30.png 1053w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a></p>
<p>Notice the highlighted unusual weakness during June and August. The statistics over 15 years of history are similar:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj15.png"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj15-720x395.png" alt="" width="720" height="395" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3353" srcset="https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj15-720x395.png 720w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj15-240x132.png 240w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj15-768x422.png 768w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj15.png 1051w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a></p>
<p>Thus, the summer months are often weak. Indeed, my script failed to find any multi-period sequences which has been strong historically including these months (June, July or August). The conclusion: the summer is indeed weak.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, based on similar analysis we are currently in a strong period for the stock market. Here is an example:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30strong.png"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30strong-720x150.png" alt="" width="720" height="150" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3354" srcset="https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30strong-720x150.png 720w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30strong-240x50.png 240w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30strong-768x160.png 768w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30strong.png 857w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a></p>
<p>Mid-March until end of April has been strong historically. Apparently what has been developing this year is a deviation, unless the market rallies into the end of the month.</p>
<p>All in all, the summer weakness is there, and if history is to repeat &#8211; there might be further troubles for the stock market. Combine that with <a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/2018/03/24/the-bull-barely-survived-on-friday/">the recent Dow Theory sell signal</a>, and the situation starts to look gloomy. At least for the near term future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, while working on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-u-sql-r-extensions">Azure Data Lake R extension</a>, I had to figure out a good way to create a zip file containing a package together with all its dependencies. This came down to understanding where does R store and search for packages. Despite the documentation, it did require additional reading and experimentation.</p>
<p><span id="more-3276"></span></p>
<p>First, the accompanying video:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9o7D_hFTMLc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Before getting into package search paths, let&#8217;s first figure out how does an R package look in the file system:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rsite.png"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rsite.png" alt="" width="171" height="118" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3298" /></a></p>
<p>An R package is a folder somewhere in the file system. Above <i>quantmod</i>, <i>TTR</i>, <i>xts</i> and <i>zoo</i> are all folders each containing the corresponding package. For these packages to be found by R, the <i>rsite</i> folder (its absolute path, for instance <i>c:/users/ivannp/rsite</i>) needs to be added to R&#8217;s search path.</p>
<p>R&#8217;s package search path is reported by the <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/libPaths.html">.libPaths() function</a> (invoked without arguments). The result is a vector of strings, each representing a path containing packages. When the user requests a package to be loaded (via <i>require</i> or via <i>library</i>), R searches for the package in each path of the list, starting with the first. If the package is found, it is loaded and the search finishes. Thus, it is important to understand how the vector of paths is build.</p>
<p>The last element of the path is R&#8217;s distribution <i>library</i> path. On Windows this could be:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
C:/Program Files/R/R-3.4.2/library
</pre>
<p>This path cannot be removed. Calling <i>.libPaths(&#8221;)</i> (with an empty string) will remove all other entries but the library sub-directory of the distribution.</p>
<p>There are three environment variables which control the content of the path vector:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>R_LIBS</b></li>
<li><b>R_LIBS_USER</b></li>
<li><b>R_LIBS_SITE</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The content of these environment variables is added to the package search path in the order listed. First <b>R_LIBS</b>, then <b>R_LIBS_USER</b> and finally <b>R_LIBS_SITE</b>.</p>
<p>If none of the three environment variables is defined, R will append a default path to the search list. This path is platform dependent. On Windows it is something like:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
C:/Users/user/Documents/R/win-library/3.4
</pre>
<p>To avoid depending on this behavior, I typically have <b>R_LIBS_USER</b> set. On Windows, make sure that the path doesn&#8217;t end with slash (&#8216;/&#8217; or &#8216;\&#8217;). According to <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/libPaths.html">.libPaths() documentation</a>, paths ending on a slash are invalid, and R silently ignores them.</p>
<p>Will all this knowledge, the solution to the original problem &#8211; how to create a zip containing a package together with all its dependencies, is clear:</p>
<pre class="brush: r; title: ; notranslate">
.libPaths('') # Cleanup any additional paths the user might have
dir.create('packages') # Create the directory
.libPaths('packages') # To add packages to the R search folders
install.packages('ggplot2') # Install all
zip('packages.zip', 'packages') # Create the zip
</pre>
<p>The above script create <i>packages.zip</i> containing <i>ggplot2</i> and all its dependencies. A local folder <i>packages</i> is used in the process. That&#8217;s assuming there are no additional packages in R&#8217;s root installation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are only a few well-known signals which I consider reliable. One of them is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_theory">Dow Theory</a>. According to it, or at least to some interpretations of it, the bull market cycle almost ended this Friday.</p>
<p><span id="more-3306"></span></p>
<p>This time I am adding something new. I recorded myself while doing some of the analysis:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gF5A596yAqk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Different people interpret the Dow Theory differently. My personal favorite is <a href="https://thedowtheory.com/">Jack Schannep&#8217;s interpretation</a>. I was introduced to it by his excellent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dow-Theory-21st-Century-Indicators/dp/0470240598">Dow Theory for the 21st Century</a> book. What really hit home with me, is that his approach is fully-quantified. The book also covers 60 years of history and provides detailed data on entry, exit, gains, etc. All in all, one of the best I have seen. I have been monitoring some of Schannep&#8217;s indicators in real life for quite a while now. The signals are rare, but for example take a look at my old blog posts <a href="https://theaverageinvestor.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/the-monthly-update/">around the European crisis of 2011</a>.</p>
<p>So what happened on Friday? Well, the indexes closed at levels very close to signal the end of the bull market. First, let&#8217;s take a look at the S&#038;P 500. The R code first:</p>
<pre class="brush: r; title: ; notranslate">
require(quantmod)
require(plotly)

pretty.plot = function(t, name, short.name, level) {
  df = data.frame(Date=index((t)), Close=as.numeric(t), row.names = NULL)
  hovertext = paste0(&quot;Date:  &lt;b&gt;&quot;, df$Date, &quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;, short.name, &quot;:  &lt;b&gt;&quot;, trunc(df$Close), &quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)
  p = plot_ly(data=df, x = ~Date, y = ~Close, mode=&quot;line&quot;)
  p = layout(p, title = name)
  p = add_lines(p, y = ~Close, line = list(color = &quot;#00526d&quot;, width = 4), hoverinfo = &quot;text&quot;, text = hovertext)
  p = add_trace(p, x = df[,'Date'], y = rep(level, NROW(df)), showlegend = FALSE, mode='line', hoverinfo = &quot;none&quot;, line=list(width=0.5))
  p
}

gspc = getSymbols(&quot;^GSPC&quot;, from=&quot;1900-01-01&quot;, auto.assign=F)
pretty.plot(Ad(gspc)[&quot;2017-09/&quot;], &quot;S&amp;P 500&quot;, &quot;S&amp;P 500&quot;, min(Ad(gspc)[&quot;2018&quot;])) 
</pre>
<p>The code uses plotly for charting. I got inspired <a href="https://moderndata.plot.ly/time-series-charts-by-the-economist-in-r-using-plotly/">by this link</a>.</p>
<p>This results in:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spx-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spx-1-720x405.png" alt="" width="720" height="405" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3335" srcset="https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spx-1-720x405.png 720w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spx-1-240x135.png 240w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spx-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spx-1.png 1248w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The critical level to watch is <b>$2,581</b>. The Friday close was <b>$2,588</b>. Still holding.</p>
<p>Next comes the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI):</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dji-2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dji-2-720x405.png" alt="" width="720" height="405" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3340" srcset="https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dji-2-720x405.png 720w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dji-2-240x135.png 240w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dji-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dji-2.png 1248w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The important level here was <b>$23,860</b>. It was breached on Friday, the close was <b>$23,533</b>.</p>
<p>So it comes down to the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJT):</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/djt-2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/djt-2-720x405.png" alt="" width="720" height="405" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3341" srcset="https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/djt-2-720x405.png 720w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/djt-2-240x135.png 240w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/djt-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/djt-2.png 1248w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The important level here was <b>$10,136</b>. Friday&#8217;s close was higher &#8211; <b>$10,163</b>. Still holding.</p>
<p>What does all this mean? If you are interested in history around similar events &#8211; check out the book. What it means to me is that the party can be over anytime now. Even a small down day will squeeze out a confirmation from the S&#038;P 500 or from the DJT, which combined with the signal from the DJI will put us in what I call the no man&#8217;s land. No bull, no bear &#8211; we will be waiting for further confirmation.</p>
<p>To make things bleaker, the Fed is tightening.</p>
<p>On the bright side, we haven&#8217;t reached a bear market definition yet. Here again I am a Schannep&#8217;s follower &#8211; a bear market is at least a 16% correction. On the DJI, the market currently measures an 11% correction. 16% is around $22,358 more than a 1,000 points lower. The skeptics will also point out that we haven&#8217;t crossed the 200-day moving average yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a person who doesn&#8217;t work in the financial industry, I write a lot of trading-related code. I also like automation. Despite all that, I still don&#8217;t automate my trading 100%. My trades are manual, but I do use a few fancy tricks possible on <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php">Interactive Brokers</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-3261"></span></p>
<p>There are two factors that define how I place orders: time and order type. The time dimension is extremely important to me &#8211; I&#8217;d like to spent as little time as possible in front of TWS. More importantly, since I am working full-time elsewhere, often I cannot show up at the precise time when I want to trade (often that&#8217;s 3:55-4pm EST, when the stock market closes). Fortunately, IB has the conditional orders, and time is one of the possible conditions:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/time.png"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/time.png" alt="" width="624" height="561" class="size-full wp-image-3262" srcset="https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/time.png 624w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/time-240x216.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a>
</div>
<p>The above screenshot shows how to add a time condition to execute the order only after 15:55 EST. For more details see TWS&#8217;s documentation.</p>
<p>Setting the time component is pretty much sufficient if trading highly liquid instruments. Set the order type to market and I am done.</p>
<p>For less liquid assets, I usually exploit the <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=5934">SNAP to MID order type</a>. These are amazing &#8211; they are pretty much what I would have done manually using TWS. I&#8217;d look at the bid and the ask, and kind of mentally determine the middle point. Then, I will put a limit order using either the middle point directly, or subtracting (adding) some amount to it. That&#8217;s exactly what the SNAP to MID implements, and, when combined with a conditional I can simulate the trading as I want it, without being present.</p>
<div align="center">

<p>Drastic moves (10% for a currency is <b>a lot</b>). The theme being the US dollar losing value.</p>

<h2>Grains</h2>
<p>Mostly red. Food for thought: wheat and corn getting cheaper by non-trivial amounts. To me that&#8217;s a testament of what technology does for our food supply.</p>
