Educating others about her condition, Chassidy uses social media to share her journey as is often subjected to negative comments/trolling.

KNOWN AS 'the Portah family' on social media, Alex, Shalaun, and Shantell, from Houston, Texas, have built an online following for their polyamory relationship. Alex and Shalaun were in a 20-year marriage before Alex was caught having an affair with Shantell, whom he met at work. After reassessing their relationship, the three of them started exploring the idea of polygamy. Over the past five years, they have learned to navigate the challenges that come with being a throuple. They are now working as relationship coaches, mentoring and supporting other throuples on their journeys. In 2021, the Portah family shared their story on My Extraordinary Family - and they're back on Truly to respond to some of the best and worst comments they've received.

AUSTIN, 24, from NYC has Moebius syndrome and says dating as a 'gay disabled man is hard' and wants people to know that he is just a normal person who wants companionship. Austin hopes that his blind date will ‘see past his disability’ and ‘love every part of him’. He hopes to educate them and teach them that ‘living with a disability is not scary’. The singer tells Truly that: &quot;It’s been really hard meeting new people with facial paralysis.&quot; Meanwhile, Nic is a dog sitter and a model, and also has no idea what to expect going into his first blind date. Will the two hit it off and will sparks fly?

SEDRICK, 29, from Columbus, Georgia has spent over $25,000 covering his entire body in tattoos. Sedrick's obsession with ink started when he was 13; he got his first tattoo which initially he regretted. However, this proved only to be the beginning as now Sedrick's goal is to become the youngest person with their body completely covered in ink. Today, Sedrick, who is a barber by trade, is going to do something he thought would never be possible... To see his face without tattoos. Sedrick told Truly: &quot;It's been about 14 years since I've seen myself without tattoos and I can't remember how that feels, I don't know how I'm going to recognise myself.&quot; After Sedrick's tattoo cover up is complete, he will be surprising his girlfriend and work colleagues at his barbershop with his new look. Will they all recognise him? Or will they mistake him for a total stranger?

Teri, who is 25 and lives in Newcastle, Australia, was born with a condition called Incontinentia pigmenti, which affects the skin, nails, teeth and eyes. At first, Teri experienced skin lesions, but then things took a drastic turn at the age of 16, as the retina in one of her eyes detached. Whilst going through an unspeakable amount of pain, it took over 10 years to get her eye removed and Teri claims it to be the “best thing” she ever did. After her procedure and with a new “twinkle” in her prosthetic eye, the high-spirited Aussi sought out others who had the same condition online and expressed how “amazing it feels to be different in a group.” This sense of community encouraged Teri to start posting about her condition on TikTok, with her very first post catching the attention of 10 million viewers. Although there are many incredible things she can do with her prosthetic eye, such as, mastering the art of doing her makeup with both eyes closed, she has also achieved her main goal of feeling more confident within herself whilst having IP.

LINSEY Donovan has some exciting news. The 23-year-old has been searching for her dream home for a couple of years now and today, she’s showing her mum, Mary, around a property that might just be the one. Will this $3 million, 4-bed, 7-bathroom house become home to Linsey and all her animals? Linsey has another surprise in store for her mum, who is incredibly proud of her daughter. Mary told Truly: “I think people underestimate my daughter because she’s so young - they have no idea how mature and smart she is. My daughter’s very persistent and because of that, she will get what she wants.” Linsey has a drive for success and is determined to reach her goals. She told Truly: “There’s people that work their whole lives and never get to live their dream out so I feel really lucky that I made my dreams actually come true and I get to share it with my family.”

24-YEAR-OLD Angela MacDonald has come under a flurry of criticism after sharing photos and videos of her with her husband, Ken, who is 30 years her senior. The two met three years ago on a dating website before they fell in love and quickly got engaged within months. Angela moved across the country to live with Ken in Vermont, where they welcomed their first child in 2019. The mum-of-one regularly receives negative comments online, with people accusing her of being a gold digger. When they go out, they said they get a lot of stares for their age difference as well as for being an interracial couple. Angela's parents have been supportive of their daughter's marriage, but Ken's family has a hard time approving the relationship. Despite the judgement, the couple appears to be happily in love as they declare to social media that to them, age is simply just a number.

SOUTH London based musician Lynks is one of a kind. Self described as a 'masked queer popstar', Lynks's identity remains anonymous to his fans. His look consists of quirky, hand-crafted outfits and masks and he describes his music as 'big, queer and angry dance/punk'. We see Lynks prepare his outfit for an upcoming performance at Standon Calling festival. Lynks has said that wearing his mask makes him feel invincible and &quot;I'd say to anyone that was being judgemental to me - you need to have a bit more fun.&quot;

ON A typical night after work, 20-year-old Joe DiMeo, from New Jersey, was driving back home from his shift when he fell asleep at the wheel. The accident in 2018 left Joe with third-degree burns over 80% of his body. As a result, his fingertips were amputated and he also lost his lips and eyelids. Joe spent months in a coma and had to undergo more than 20 reconstructive surgeries. After consulting with a leading surgeon at NYU Langone Health, Joe became the first person in the world to receive a full face and double hand transplant, which gave him a second chance at life. Four years after the car crash, Joe, who lives with his girlfriend Jessica, is continuing his rehabilitation and feels hopeful about the future. He now wants to inspire more people by sharing his journey on social media.

'BARBIE' lookalike Marcela Iglesias and 'human Ken doll' Garrett Rowland are no strangers to controversy and criticism. The friends have received their fair share of negative comments online, being self-confessed 'plastic surgery addicts'. However, in this episode of Hooked On The Look, the pair are given their turn to respond to some of their meanest, angriest and most downright bizarre social media DMs. When asked, 'how do you block out the negativity?' Garrett answered, &quot;botox!&quot; One commenter said: &quot;He spends $7000 a month to look like a college kid that wears sweats.&quot; Garrett clapped back - &quot;well I'm happy that they at least think that I can get into college, so that's good.&quot; Whereas Marcela was criticised for her lavish lifestyle, with the commenter asking: &quot;why the need for all this material stuff?&quot; The glam influencer retorted: &quot;the answer is because I can.&quot;

28-YEAR-OLD Lizzy is an OnlyFans creator from Cornwall. Lizzy is 6ft 3 inches tall and measures at 6ft 5&quot; in heels. Lizzy’s struggles with dating have not only been due to her height but also her job. As a top 1% OnlyFans creator, Lizzy has found that a lot of guys wanted to take advantage of her and her platform. Lizzy told Truly: “Dating is difficult in Cornwall because a lot of people already know who I am and it’s quite unusual for somebody to be of my height.&quot; Lizzy’s date is Andrew, a 38-year-old healthcare support worker. How will he react to her height and her job?

SARAH Sinclair, 27, turns heads wherever she goes thanks to her face tattoos. But while she'll get stared at in public, it's online where the judgement really amps up. Addicted to getting tattoos, the Essex mum told Truly: &quot;With a face like this, you get used to mean comments.&quot; In this episode of Hooked On The Look, we'll see Sarah responding to some of the harshest DMs and judgemental comments she receives about her inkings. Unfazed by the trolls, she says: &quot;No matter how much hate I get, I'm going to keep posting and getting tattoos. So, keep hating!&quot;

WHEN Lisa McAloon’s milk supply was running low, her sister-in-law, Janelle, stepped in to help feed her baby son. Lisa, 33, was initially apprehensive but absolutely trusted Janelle, 31, to do it. Janelle told Truly: “It wasn’t even a question, it was the first thing I wanted to do to help her.” The pair, from Seekonk, Massachusetts, then decided to post a video about it on TikTok as a way of challenging some of the taboos around breastfeeding. While they got a lot of love and positivity for it, they also received judgemental comments. People said it was ‘wrong’, ‘weird’ or that Lisa must be jealous. But Lisa and Janelle believe it’s brought them closer and want to continue to normalise taboos around breastfeeding. Lisa told Truly: “What does it matter? It’s my sister-in-law, it’s my baby and he’s getting fed and he’s happy and he’s healthy so it shouldn’t matter how he’s getting those nutrients.”
