    <title>Apple’s reportedly building an advertising network around its Major League Soccer deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mvgv5ibB2bsvhNqyueGGbb5n7TU=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71588871/Apple_MLS_partnership_June_2022.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XzIU8a"&gt;Apple’s building an advertising network for the Major League Soccer (MLS) games it’ll start streaming next year, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-04/apple-s-next-step-in-ads-will-be-built-around-new-soccer-deal?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sources familiar with the situation told the outlet that Apple’s in talks with advertisers and MLS sponsors to display ads during soccer games and “related shows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BFRCe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/14/23167555/apple-tv-mls-live-sports-streaming"&gt;Apple struck a 10-year deal with the MLS&lt;/a&gt; in June and will start streaming soccer games through its Apple TV app in February 2023. While the company plans on introducing a separate, &lt;a href="https://www.mlssoccer.com/apple/"&gt;Sunday Ticket-like subscription&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to streaming every MLS game, it says it’ll make a “broad selection” of MLS and Leagues Cup matches available to Apple TV Plus subscribers, with a “limited number” available for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wql8cD"&gt;There still isn’t any pricing information about the standalone subscription just yet, but, as noted by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Apple plans on including ads for all MLS viewers, including season pass holders, Apple TV Plus subscribers, and those watching for free. This expands on the commercials &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22967483/apple-tv-plus-friday-night-baseball"&gt;Apple already slips into its Friday Night Baseball games&lt;/a&gt;, and marks a continued push into advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYRVlo"&gt;In August, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-08-14/apple-aapl-set-to-expand-advertising-bringing-ads-to-maps-tv-and-books-apps-l6tdqqmg?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s advertising business rakes in about $4 billion in revenue annually, and that the company wants to get this number into the double digits. One solution the company’s reportedly considering is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/14/23305200/iphone-more-ads-advertising-apple-maps-podcasts-books-mark-gurman-rumors"&gt;placing ads in other areas on the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, such as in the Maps, Podcasts, and Books apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQa99u"&gt;It already brought more ads to the App Store, which now appear in the Today tab and “You Might Also Like” sections beneath app listings. The move drew criticism from developers, who quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23424316/app-store-gambling-ads-listings-apple-developers"&gt;noticed ads for gambling apps appearing on App Store&lt;/a&gt; product pages. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23425637/apple-pauses-gambling-ads-developer-outcry"&gt;Apple has since paused App Store ads related to gambling&lt;/a&gt; and “a few other categories,” but hasn’t come forward with a plan to address this issue just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s all-around excellent WF-1000XM4 earbuds are on sale for $100 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds and their charging case held in the palm of a hand." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2jHAS7Az0PXmB-_tOx2CJVDzVsc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71588384/DSCF4082_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best deal on the best earbuds is a hard combo to beat.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ve8j3"&gt;There’s no telling what another day might bring — especially if you too are glued to our coverage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/11/23019836/elon-musk-twitter-board-of-directors-news-updates"&gt;a certain social media hellscape&lt;/a&gt; — but you can rest assured that &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s deals team is always on the lookout for ways to help you save, both in the form of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23438688/black-friday-2022-best-early-deals-tech-tv-apple-smart-home"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; or whatever we can scrounge up for you on a random Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ju0vNz"&gt;And we’ve got some bangers for you this week because &lt;strong&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4 earbuds are on sale for an all-time low of around $178&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B094C4VDJZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsony-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-wf-1000xm4-black%2F-%2FA-82691015&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals110522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; until tomorrow. That’s around $100 off their regular price of $278, and much better than the typical $30 discount we see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8NhKL"&gt;The WF-1000XM4 frequently come up when we’re talking earbuds, namely because they’re just that good. The excellent all-rounders offer terrific sound quality, lengthy battery life, and some of the best noise cancellation you can get in a pair of wireless earbuds. They’ve remained our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best earbuds you can buy&lt;/a&gt; since their debut because of this, even if the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23353777/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-2-review"&gt;Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II&lt;/a&gt; recently edged them out in the ANC department. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OXyNkU"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848037"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ojVneq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony is bringing multipoint to its earbuds lineup including the WF-1000XM4","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/25/23423007/sony-multipoint-earbuds-bluetooth-announced-wf1000xm4-linkbuds"},{"title":"Now’s the time to buy last year’s iPad","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/4/23439082/ipad-apple-tablets-10th-gen-buy-last-years-instead-new"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P7coAr"&gt;There may be a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23427142/apple-ipad-pro-12-9-2022-tablet-ipados-apple-pencil-review"&gt;M2-powered iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; available, but I’m here to tell you, “no.” No, you should not pay $1,199 for the 12.9-inch configuration of the iPad Pro. Instead, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/4/23439082/ipad-apple-tablets-10th-gen-buy-last-years-instead-new"&gt;savvy move&lt;/a&gt; would be to pick up a last-gen iPad Pro with Apple’s M1 CPU while it’s still available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bIuc6"&gt;Fortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932BKSLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the &lt;strong&gt;12.9-inch M1 iPad Pro from 2021 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage for just $899.99&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($200 off). That’s as low a price as you’ll find on this very capable tablet, which offers a beautiful Mini LED screen and just about everything the newer model does, save for some small stuff like the second-gen Apple Pencil’s new “hover” mode. Simply put, the M2 model doesn’t do a whole lot more to justify its higher price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfURyr"&gt;With the M1 iPad Pro, you get the same Apple Pencil compatibility (sans hover), great battery life, Face ID, and — once again, because it bears repeating — that awesome 12.9-inch display. If you want a spacious iPad for doing laptop-like things, this is the one to get. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73P0w1"&gt;Oh. And if you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; do want the latest iPad Pro, you can currently get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B0BJLBKMV8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11-inch base version with Apple’s M2 chip at Amazon for $749&lt;/a&gt; ($50 off) — we’ll concede that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xqbioN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPad Pro on a person’s lap while they use an Apple Pencil to edit a photo on the tablet." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lF20kEwDsHsYdlIqMirweSX1rmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22524091/vpavic_210512_4592_0110.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Kayla Murkison / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bet you can’t tell if this is an M1 iPad Pro or an M2 iPad Pro. Don’t worry, nobody can.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IANosp"&gt;Here’s a unique deal just for our lovely &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers: &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fsegway%2Dninebot%2Dkickscooter%2Dmax&amp;amp;afftrack=vergedailydeals110522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots is knocking &lt;strong&gt;$150 off the Segway Ninebot KickScooter Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEMAX&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout (Pro-tip: if you subscribe to our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, you would have already had this deal delivered to your inbox — wink-wink, nudge-nudge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENrxmK"&gt;This promo drops the price of the 350W electric scooter from $899 to $749. Now, full disclosure, we have seen the KickScooter Max on sale for less before, but that was before Segway increased the price mere months into the pandemic. The current deal is just $50 shy of its all-time low, and definitely helps soften the blow of its inflated sticker price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vq2pVW"&gt;In terms of specs, the KickScooter Max can go up to 40 miles on a single charge, with a top speed of 18.6 mph. It also folds down for easier storage, so it’s great for short trips around a city or on a small commute. Just be careful out there if you’re surrounded by aggressive cagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B2SxU7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9570530"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SrbGfz"&gt;In case you missed it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/2/23432652/amazon-device-day-echo-show-kindle-fire-tv-blink-camera-deal-sale"&gt;a bunch of Amazon devices are currently on sale&lt;/a&gt; in celebration of Alexa’s birthday (because in addition to gendering the robots, we must apparently commemorate their “births”). These discounts apply to the &lt;strong&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max, which is on sale for just $39.99&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-4k-max-with-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B08MQZXN1X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-streaming-devicefire-tv-stick-4k-max-streaming-device-wi-fi-6-alexa-voice-remote-includes-tv-controls%2F-%2FA-82801903&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals110522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/ciqZdO2RsWG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s $15 off one of the best streaming devices you can get, one that supports HDR for better color and contrast as well as Wi-Fi 6, ensuring a more reliable connection with less risk of buffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raxq5M"&gt;You can spend a lot more to get a better streaming device, like the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23435393/apple-tv-4k-2022-third-gen-review-price-details" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s hard to beat the Max in terms of value at this price point. Just remember that while Amazon supports a wide variety of apps, it loves nothing more than feeding you ads for Amazon Prime shows on its dashboard. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LslPJs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:11172961"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QzEVpX"&gt;If you play games on PlayStation or Xbox consoles, you can grab some nice discounts on gift cards for either the PlayStation Store or the Xbox storefront. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=vergedailydeals110422&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-100-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba is offering a &lt;strong&gt;$100 PlayStation Store digital gift card for $82.44&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (about $18 off) when you use code &lt;strong&gt;PSNWknd&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=vergedailydeals110422&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-live-100-usd-xbox-live-key-north-america%2Fregentgames" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$100 Xbox gift card for $77.67&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (about $22 off) with offer code &lt;strong&gt;XboxWknd&lt;/strong&gt;. Both of these deals are good through November 7th at 7AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nf42rg"&gt;These gift cards are delivered digitally, and they make for an excellent value if you have a console without a disc drive or simply prefer digital media — especially since the digital versions of most games don’t go on sale as frequently as the physical ones. The prices on Eneba may fluctuate by as much as a dollar or a few cents, but that’s normal since the retailer is Europe-based and the conversion to USD can slightly change from moment to moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kRPfPe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:11301725"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="64iUih"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:11301689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O65dE2"&gt;The people, they demand more deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GggX6H"&gt;Want some premium noise-canceling earbuds for less than our lead deal? The &lt;strong&gt;Pixel Buds Pro are on sale again for $149.99 &lt;/strong&gt;($50 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-Headphones/dp/B0B1N7SGMZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dpixel%2Dbuds%2Dpro%2Dheadphones&amp;amp;afftrack=vergedailydeals110522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;. They may not sound quite as good as the WF-1000XM4, but they have a great mic, tight integration with Pixel phones, and come in an array of fun colors. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23281445/google-pixel-buds-pro-noise-canceling-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ympFaW"&gt;Alternatively, you can opt for a deep discount on a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergedailydeals110522&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F0TH-000U-00HJ0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;refurbished pair of Sony Linkbuds for $59.99&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($120 off the price of a new pair) from Newegg via Secondipity. That’s a great price for a comfy pair of wireless earbuds that let you hear your surroundings. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22933521/sony-linkbuds-earbuds-review-features-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4vQCjp"&gt;

That’s the lowest price yet on Nintendo’s soccer brawler, which recently received a free update with new characters and features. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/8/23158438/mario-strikers-battle-league-review-nintendo-switch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

That’s its lowest price to date and $10 cheaper than its price during Prime Day.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Matter is here, but it’s still a long road to the simple smart home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J3dsPXVXVdqsorjnKlnW9ddTLw0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71588234/226392_Matter_event_JTuohy_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Matter QR code on an Eve Energy smart plug. To pair a device to a Matter app, you’ll just need to scan this code.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7q16Ys"&gt;At the official &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23438304/matter-launch-event-smart-home-amsterdam-announcements"&gt;launch event for Matter this week&lt;/a&gt;, I saw a lot of exciting things: a Google Nest Hub controlling an Eve Energy smart plug; a Wiz light bulb working with Apple Home; a Yale smart lock talking to a SmartThings hub over Thread. None of these things were possible before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt;. And all of these things worked well in their demos using voice, app, and other smart home control interfaces — even in the interference hell of a mini-trade show floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJqjGN"&gt;But I also saw that Matter has a long way to go before it fully delivers on its promise of an interoperable and simple smart home. A phrase I heard a lot throughout the two-day event was, “Matter is a journey,” followed by, “This is just the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzOcUM"&gt;In the short term, don’t expect to be using Matter in your home reliably until early next year. Too many companies have yet to fully implement Matter support despite having had a lot of time to prepare. It’ll take even longer before you can just look for the Matter logo on a box and confidently manage it seamlessly in your smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I7e7falCt2I4ScuS1N-jZwWH5kY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24168431/226392_Matter_event_JTuohy_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This new Thread Netatmo Security Sensor — a motion and contact sensor — shown at the event is the first product we’ve seen with the Matter logo. But it won’t be available until next year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2retaQ"&gt;More Matter controllers please&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4xSXKM"&gt;The initial problem is Matter controllers. By my count we only have three that are certified and have been updated to support Matter. You need a Matter controller to pair devices to Matter and to control them over Matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsdWKg"&gt;Matter is an application layer standard, meaning it sits over an existing protocol. There are two protocols to start with: Matter-over-Wi-Fi and Matter-over-Thread. Plus, Matter-over-Ethernet/Bridge will bring devices attached to a bridge (like Philips Hue Zigbee bulbs) into Matter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbUm5h"&gt;A Matter controller can support one, two or all of these. Right now, Apple’s controllers (the HomePod Mini and some Apple TV models) can do all three, and Samsung’s SmartThings hub (v2 and v3) can do Matter-over-Wi-Fi and Matter-over-Thread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZzeOcN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"We’re getting our first look at Matter devices today, and here’s what’s coming next&amp;amp;nbsp;","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23438304/matter-launch-event-smart-home-amsterdam-announcements"},{"title":"Amazon announces a phased rollout of Matter to its Alexa smart home platform","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23438286/amazon-matter-support-alexa-echo-smart-home-platform"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A6Uv9t"&gt;Amazon says it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23438286/amazon-matter-support-alexa-echo-smart-home-platform"&gt;only be launching its Matter-over-Wi-Fi controllers&lt;/a&gt; this year, and Google hasn’t said anything about when it will update its Nest speakers, hubs and routers to be Matter controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xs4nV4"&gt;Additionally, the current Alexa, SmartThings, and Google Home apps on iOS do not work with Matter. And, based on the timelines the companies have given, they won’t until next year. So, if you have an iPhone, the only option you have for using Matter this year is the Apple Home app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5K_MBmsjUpRWcAYT_RzoIIHwnqw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24168433/226392_Matter_event_JTuohy_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matter device pairing screen on a Pixel smartphone. The process should be similar on the other platforms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CgU6AH"&gt;Without the basic controller and app infrastructure in place, Matter’s not really here yet. So what is the holdup? Twan Kamp, director of engineering at Signify, which owns Hue, put it best when I asked him why we have to wait until next year for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23438437/philips-hue-bridge-matter-certified-smart-home-update"&gt;newly Matter-certified Hue Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to work with Matter. “It’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem,” he said. “We’re waiting for them, and they’re waiting for us.” Platforms want to make sure devices work before they update their controllers, but devices need controllers to test on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8gFxd6"&gt;Thread routers aren’t ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Wi8MpC"&gt;In the near term, there are some problems around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/19/23269460/thread-1-3-0-matter-border-routers-homepod-mini-echo-nest"&gt;Thread border routers&lt;/a&gt; — the device that links a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23165855/thread-smart-home-protocol-matter-apple-google-interview"&gt;Thread network&lt;/a&gt; to the other IP-based networks that work with Matter, like Wi-Fi and Ethernet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDMFd9"&gt;There aren’t enough of them yet, and only Apple’s and SmartThings’ are Matter certified. Thread is a key part of Matter, and while there aren’t many Thread devices yet, they are coming. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23436125/nanoleaf-essentials-matter-over-thread-light-bulbs-price"&gt;Nanoleaf announced the first Thread-over-Matter lightbulbs&lt;/a&gt; this week, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23438752/level-locks-thread-matter-firmware-update-google-samsung"&gt;Level Home&lt;/a&gt; has said its locks will get updated to Thread).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;aside id="R30KIE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Thread is Matter’s secret sauce for a better&amp;amp;nbsp;smart home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23165855/thread-smart-home-protocol-matter-apple-google-interview"},{"title":"Matter: what you need to know ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23390726/matter-smart-home-faq-questions-answers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="537dcR"&gt;You need a Thread border router to use a Thread device. The big promise of Matter — that if you buy a device and plug it in, it will just work and work with everything in your home — will not be true if you don’t have a working Thread border router in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Rcqk2"&gt;The holdup is that Apple, Google, Samsung, and Amazon (who have all promised us border routers) need to share credentials with each other so that you only end up with one all-inclusive Thread network in your home and not two or three competing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FzU4WbkJu4DYQmKI63z0q1g6tLg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24168429/226392_Matter_event_JTuohy_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eve booth had four potential Thread border routers in action (the SmartThings hub was under the table). The Thread radios in the Nest Hub and Echo haven’t been turned on yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UoiwRC"&gt;So far, only Amazon and Samsung have announced that they’re working together on this (just working on it, not that it’s here). “We all want Thread to be an infrastructure in the home. It will happen,” Samsung SmartThings director of product Mark Tekippe told me when I asked about the delay. “It just takes time. There’s a lot of pieces to figure out.” It’s a long, winding road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dW54gt"&gt;Partners still need to play nice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TQgVAO"&gt;All this makes me feel like cracks are starting to appear in the united front we’ve seen from the big players up to this point. Now that they have to work directly with each other to make the user experience better, cabals are starting to form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhLxF6"&gt;Samsung and Google announced they’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/12/23398987/google-matter-samsung-smartthings-multi-admin-partnership"&gt;working together on a better form of multi-admin&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/all-about-choice-multi-admin-in-matter-gives-users-more-flexibility-and-unlocks-smart-home-innovation/"&gt;Multi-admin&lt;/a&gt; will let you operate any device with any voice assistant or smartphone app of your choice). Their “extra” features will let you add all your Matter devices to each platform simultaneously, rather than having to individually add them — as is the current flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTOq3S"&gt;Amazon and Samsung have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23438286/amazon-matter-support-alexa-echo-smart-home-platform"&gt;announced a similar partnership&lt;/a&gt;. But Amazon hasn’t said it's doing this with Google, and Apple doesn’t seem to be working with anyone on “better” multi-admin. At least not that the company’s revealed and when I asked, Apple wouldn’t provide anyone to speak on the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="32HRqe"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Matter Multi-Admin Apple Home|109597" data-volume-uuid="0330cb5f6" data-volume-id="109597" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="true" id="volume-placement-300" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A demo of Eve Energy working over Thread and how you will share a device from the Apple Home app to another Matter-enabled platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9m8aaC"&gt;We may also have to wait for these types of partnerships to get better experiences when using Matter devices. I was shown several demos of how you will share a Matter-enabled device to a platform after you’ve paired it with another. While it doesn’t seem to be a bad experience, there are times when it may involve cutting and pasting a code from one app to another. Somehow that feels wrong in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qM6ZlZ"&gt;What was also disappointing to see is that the device shows up in the new platform as if it had never been set up before. So, “Vanity” in “Bathroom” in Apple Home, for example, will show up as “Light Bulb 1” in the Amazon Alexa app, essentially making you set it up all over again (see the video below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="ua46Pn"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Matter Multi-Admin Google SmartThings Alexa|109598" data-volume-uuid="8d1ab3b06" data-volume-id="109598" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="true" id="volume-placement-674" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A video of sharing a device from SmartThings to Google Home using the basic multi-admin feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8TBARv"&gt;Plus, once it’s in the separate apps, if you change its name or location in one app, that won’t be reflected in the other app, according to Chris LaPré, head of technology at the CSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWXmga"&gt;He also told me that the CSA had wanted to add this type of functionality but the platform makers pushed back. What we have today “Is what the members agreed to,” he said. Back to that journey idea, though, LaPré says that doesn’t mean it won’t happen in a future update or with future cooperation between platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2t-iIJbIPvypLHSFZd3OlIB-99o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24168434/226392_Matter_event_JTuohy_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype of the new Thread-based Aqara P2 Door &amp;amp; Window Sensor was part of an NXP demo at the Matter event. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RdQkp_Yzp6IBGG-vt--GM57XQOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24168428/226392_Matter_event_JTuohy_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Nanoleaf Essentials Light Strip with Matter over Thread. It looks identical to the existing product but will work with Matter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Teft8i"&gt;More device categories may mean more problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ufXtKp"&gt;In the longer term, once (and if) these issues are ironed out, it’s clear more will crop up as we move beyond the fairly simple devices categories of light bulbs, switches, and door locks into more complicated categories like cameras, robot vacuums, home appliances, and Wi-Fi routers (part of the new device types coming next that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23438304/matter-launch-event-smart-home-amsterdam-announcements"&gt;were announced at the event&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cSxOCKL9iF6TAE0StcCEzhqq8qA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24168435/226392_Matter_event_JTuohy_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Schlage Encode Plus lock on display in the SI Labs booth. It was damaged in transit, so it wasn’t working, but it’s a sign that the Thread-enabled lock is getting Matter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Br9n2K"&gt;Additionally, I heard nothing about where audio-streaming from speaker companies like Sonos and Bose fits into the Matter roadmap. (There is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22824559/matter-tv-streaming-devices-smart-home-casting-protocol-support"&gt;Matter casting feature&lt;/a&gt; in the specification). While I was told the topic has been discussed within the Alliance, there’s no formal working group currently attempting to make it a part of the Matter specification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNMnlP"&gt;We are also not saying goodbye to bridges and hubs anytime soon. There may be a future where we no longer need to connect white boxes to our routers to make our smart homes work, but if you want to use the products already in your home, in most cases, a bridge or hub will be the way to bring it into Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OJjlX"&gt;Honestly, I don’t mind this. We need bridges in Matter to make it easy to bring your existing devices into this new smart home. Hue’s demo had a smart bulb from 2012 working with Matter through the Hue bridge, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23420136/ikeas-dirigera-smart-home-review-price-specs"&gt;Ikea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23436897/aqara-matter-dates-update-hub-m3-thread"&gt;Aqara&lt;/a&gt; announced that their hubs and bridges will bring existing products into Matter, too. Ten-year-old technology needs to be part of Matter just as much as the shiny new thing that will be released next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nVC5zy"&gt;Matter works and it works well&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gkbY8M"&gt;Speaking of shiny new things, while I was disappointed not to see a lot of new products at the event, it was encouraging to see plenty of existing products that will get Matter upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye8Wz6"&gt;Those included an Eve Energy smart plug, a Schlage Encode Plus lock, a TCL television, and an Echo speaker, all there to demo how they will work with Matter. I was able to use many of these devices — and more — in the demos. In large part, everything worked smoothly and very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rXo6U7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ten-year-old technology needs to be part of Matter just as much as the shiny new things.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTqS05"&gt;A Yale Assure Lock 2 unlocked within two seconds of tapping the Good Night routine icon on the Galaxy smartwatch. It was running on Thread over a SmartThings Aeotec hub. Raising the Eve blinds using a Hue Smart Dimmer Switch paired to a Matter-enabled Hue Bridge through a Thread border router (an Apple TV) was also super fast. And controlling three Wiz smart lights using the Apple Home app with Matter-over-Wi-Fi worked in under a second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Kpall"&gt;The slowest demo I saw was the Echo fourth-gen speaker controlling five different lights across different protocols using Matter over Wi-Fi. The lights popped on randomly over a few seconds. The Matter-over-Thread demo on an Echo fourth-gen with Thread enabled was much faster. But that integration won’t be live until next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtdU197-Gzdv30TW_sFGc1u43Wk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24168430/226392_Matter_event_JTuohy_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was able to control non-Apple Home compatible Wiz light bulbs with the Apple Home app using Matter-over-Wi-Fi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KVo4bm"&gt;The Wiz demo working with Apple Home and Google Assistant was one of the few examples of a completely new integration enabled by Matter. Most everything else I saw could already be done in some fashion — although it would involve more steps and possibly more hardware to get it set it up than it will with Matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4soE59"&gt;Wiz — &lt;a href="https://www.signify.com/global/our-company/news/press-releases/2022/20221103-wiz-smart-lighting-platform-first-support-matter-standard#:~:text=All%20new%20WiZ%20smart%20lighting,part%20of%20the%20Matter%20ecosystem."&gt;a smart lighting line owned by Signify&lt;/a&gt; — has never worked with Apple Home. But with Matter-over-Wi-Fi coming to its line with a firmware update by the end of the year, according to Danny Lousberg head of product management at Signify, these inexpensive, color-changing bulbs can be added to Apple Home through Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xke8E3"&gt;Matter does matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cPyvyi"&gt;It’s clear that Matter is not going to solve all the problems of the smart home in the next few years. It may not solve any in the next six months (the CSA said it’s targeting spring and fall updates annually). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JL2EvS"&gt;But it was also clear from this event that once the underlying infrastructure is fully in place, Matter will make it easier for manufacturers to build better smart home devices and for platforms to create better smart home experiences. And that is really what will put the industry on the right road to the simple, interoperable smart home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5zwkjb"&gt;It’s going to be a journey, folks. Let’s just hope it’s not too wild of a ride.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The most interesting EV concepts at the 2022 SEMA conference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nissan Sunny restomod truck" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m2iLifeDgsT4HwIVJTo-9KG3O7s=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71588105/Sunny_LEAF_Hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nissan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bpzOkD"&gt;The Specialty Equipment Market Association, or SEMA, held its annual conference in Las Vegas this week. Billed as one of the biggest car shows in the world, the event typically brings together more than 135,000 attendees in the automotive aftermarket industry to see the newest trends in vehicle repairs and modifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XIZ4p"&gt;And this year, EVs were a particular focus. The event featured a dedicated space for EVs, labeled “SEMA Electrified,” and according to the &lt;em&gt;Las Vegas Review-Journal, &lt;/em&gt;it was 740 percent larger compared to 2019, when it was first debuted. Several major automakers showed up with a bunch of unique EV concepts in tow. Here are some of the ones that stood out the most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dmj0PZ"&gt;Ford&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HLETXccfo-840oe18aAlagZdX28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24169298/cq5dam.web.951.535__4_.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ggUhDr"&gt;Ford brought 10 vehicles to SEMA this year, including three EVs based on the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHwxWR"&gt;First up is the &lt;strong&gt;Mustang Mach-E True Mustang Persona&lt;/strong&gt; built by Dom Tucci Design (Tucci Hot Rods) and Kay Automotive Graphics. The vehicle, which is based on a dual-motor 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E GT, features a muscular custom lift-gate spoiler, fender arches with 3D-printed fender flares, vacuum-formed transparent wheel covers, and a 3D-printed front lip. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kM6AG7"&gt;Up next is the &lt;strong&gt;Ford F-150 Lightning Race Support&lt;/strong&gt; built by Real Truck and Motor City Solutions. Equipped with an air compressor, leveling kit, off-road recovery boards, and Recaro seats along with a fully mobile toolbox and welding equipment, Ford says that this electric pickup is “equally at home on the road and at a Baja race as a support vehicle.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3bh2Lq"&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;F-150 Lightning Swiss Army Knife&lt;/strong&gt; is built by Tjin Edition and Thule. Ford calls it a “jack-of-all-trades” with its solar charging capability, portable air compressor, refrigerator, console vault, Recaro front and rear seats, and Thule cargo accessories. Two Super73 e-bikes mounted on the back of the truck offer some options for those who prefer two wheels to four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qx4rY9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/media-kits/2022/sema-2022.html"&gt;Ford says&lt;/a&gt; its personalization and accessories business has grown 40 percent in the last two years, with the Bronco being the most accessorized vehicle in the lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7TWpHI"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cIv3CvYVz_716iFfG2MIc_MZ7UI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24168481/16129_VolkswagenID.4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: VW&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HtJ7JA"&gt;VW was awarded SEMA’s first-ever Electric Vehicle of the Year prize for its ID.4 crossover. Show exhibitors selected the ID.4 for its potential for customization, its ability to handle a variety of terrain, and as a leading example of the possibilities in the electric vehicle market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uxP00q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:11603972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k8GQHH"&gt;The automaker brought out two ID.4-based concepts, including one it calls a &lt;strong&gt;Mobile Drone Response Vehicle&lt;/strong&gt; with a big roof rack designed to carry and launch large drones. The drone response vehicle will be put to use by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has the goal of operating a 100 percent electric fleet by the year 2030. The modified ID.4 is certainly eye-catching, featuring a custom storage unit for drone and field equipment and a portable power station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEuVBF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ID.4 Accessories concept&lt;/strong&gt; comes equipped with a Thule Canyon Basket to haul gear and an Apex XT 9025XT hitch-mounted bike rack. Splash guards protect the 18-inch wheels with H&amp;amp;R Trak Plus wheel spacers and 245/60R18 all-terrain tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rZKBxt"&gt;Nissan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AcxP8I"&gt;The Japanese automaker didn’t come to play. It brought two striking concepts to SEMA: a &lt;strong&gt;1987 Sunny restomod&lt;/strong&gt; running a Leaf engine as well as a pretty unusual looking &lt;strong&gt;Ariya Surfwagon woodie&lt;/strong&gt; with teal hubcaps and two surfboards on the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MftUaH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:11603875"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LNwJNU"&gt;The California-style wagon was created by South Carolina-based Tommy Pike Customs. With a custom vinyl wrap and chrome trim, the Surfwagon features “smoothie” 20-inch wheels with white-wall tires, a custom roof rack, and a custom lowered suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6sTL6j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:11603884"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XLqMk2"&gt;The Sunny truck will definitely put a smile on your face. The 1987-era truck has been converted to run on a Leaf battery, also by Tommy Pike Customs. Rated at 147 horsepower and 236 pound-feet of torque, the Leaf motor has around twice the power and more than three times the torque of the gasoline four-cylinder engine originally equipped in the Sunny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xpbE5W"&gt;Stellantis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="Qu68oE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:11603952"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aq26Yq"&gt;Mopar, Stellantis’ auto parts division, brought a bunch of concepts, including the &lt;strong&gt;Jeep CJ Surge&lt;/strong&gt;, an open-body, battery-powered vehicle that is meant to showcase the possibility of EV conversion kits for vintage Jeeps. The electromod is meant to give the automaker’s engineers a better understanding of EV parts kit applications, which could lead to a future product lineup for enthusiasts to convert their vintage vehicles to EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42LEBl"&gt;The Jeep CJ Surge is powered by a custom propulsion system. Under the hood, you’ll find a scalable 400-volt, 200kW motor mounted to the frame. Battery modules, of which there are 24, are enclosed in a custom shell mounted in the rear of the passenger cabin. The Jeep’s body is perched on 35-inch BFGoodrich all-terrain tires, paired with a two-inch lift kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVmTYJ"&gt;Jeep also fits a custom roll cage and bikini top, while the center console comes from a JK Wrangler (built from 2007 to 2017) and features a rotary shift knob in place of the stock lever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overwatch 2’s newest hero is the scary but sexy Ramattra</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Graphic from Overwatch 2’s new hero reveal trailer featuring a sentient robot holding a giant staff with robotic hair blowing in the breeze." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K2PqwwoXwnotXbHjhibJ29zL3K8=/209x0:974x510/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71587143/ezgif.com_gif_maker__2_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kiDgi1"&gt;In the perfect prelude to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/2/23437002/overwatch-league-grand-finals-how-to-watch-youtube"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch &lt;/em&gt;League&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;2022 grand finals&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard has revealed &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;’s newest character. Ramattra is the game’s 36th hero, and his abilities and story seem like they’ll make for the most interesting addition to the roster yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q73lZd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vd_SPOkaZZ4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cswizF"&gt;Ramattra is the leader of &lt;a href="https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Null_Sector"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;, a group of sentient robots called &lt;a href="https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Omnic"&gt;omnics&lt;/a&gt; committed to the liberation of their people by any means necessary. In &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s overarching story (yes, there is one) Null Sector is one of the biggest baddies, responsible for touching off the war between robots and humans that became the instigating event for the creation of the Overwatch task force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nop28W"&gt;Ramattra is a tank like you’ve never seen before. Rather than being the kind of tank that shields their team — like Sigma, Reinhardt, or D.Va — Ramattra’s ability to shape-shift between an omnic and nemesis form gives him offensive capabilities that allow him to attack enemies at range and burst into a team’s back line to wreak havoc on softer targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TsKwF"&gt;“I don’t think we can overestimate how scary Ramattra gets when he goes into nemesis form,” said lead narrative designer Gavin Jurgens-Fyhrie in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You will see him change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CQpYI"&gt;Jurgens-Fyhrie talked about how, in designing Ramattra, the team wanted to accentuate the fearsomeness of his transformation in order to strike terror into the hearts of players opposing a Ramattra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6N3283"&gt;From an aesthetic perspective, I will say that Blizzard kinda missed the mark in making Ramattra scary. When I look at his long techno braids and his robotic abs, and especially when I hear his digitized voice provided by Ramon Tikaram — the man who voiced &lt;a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/games/news/dragon-age-inquisition-romance-dorian-pavus/"&gt;Dorian “I’m too sexy for most of my shirt” Pavus of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age: Inquisition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — I don’t see the scary, &lt;a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/trending/a-letter-to-my-dragon-age-boyfriend-in-case-i-cant-send-it-later/"&gt;I see the &lt;em&gt;sexy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2g0LH6"&gt;More information on Ramattra and his abilities will be shared in the coming days, and we will get to play him when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/15/23354157/overwatch-2-heroes-battle-pass-progression"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;’s second season&lt;/a&gt; starts on December 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuGg7A"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyVMpT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple has finally approved a MagSafe car mount charger, and it only costs $99.95</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of an iPhone and the Belkin mount." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NoaJFkkvWCzmHj4qWYuT8JvpZ74=/0x153:2000x1486/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71587063/HQ6A2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine: mounting your phone with magnets, and charging it at 15W at the same time.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e8RLWV"&gt;A mere two years after Apple introduced MagSafe for iPhones, we're finally getting the accessory that probably should've launched with it: a magnetic car mount that's also capable of actually charging your phone. As &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/04/belkin-magsafe-car-charging-mount/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt;, Belkin has announced its Boost Charge Pro Wireless Car Charger With MagSafe, which is available for pre-order &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1504346/7613?subId1=VergeBelkinWirelessCarChargerNews110422&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHQ6A2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-boost%25E2%2586%2591charge%25E2%2584%25A2-pro-wireless-car-charger-with-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on the Apple store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDKvcf"&gt;I know what some of you may be thinking: “wait, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=magsafe+car+charger"&gt;flooded with MagSafe car chargers&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re nowhere even close to $100. What makes this one special?” The answer is that this one is actually MagSafe, where the rest are MagSafe &lt;em&gt;compatible. &lt;/em&gt;That&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;means that they use a ring of magnets to hold your phone, and standard Qi charging that can’t pump as much power into your phone — because Apple won’t let it. (Some really suspicious listings say they can do 15W charging, but it seems like they mean that the coil in it is technically capable of fast wireless charging for phones that aren’t iPhones.) But one that has the iPhone maker’s official blessing is finally here... and it seems a bit difficult to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of an iPhone mounted to the Belkin charger." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e9rg93kQ3fQkozzVjiqldVl5gzA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24170224/HQ6A2_AV4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of my colleagues said the part that grabs the vent looks a bit like Greedo, and now I can’t unsee it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lf1sPo"&gt;The Belkin’s extremely wordy name basically spells out exactly how it works: you clip it onto your car vent, and it holds your iPhone up so you can see whatever maps or music controls are on it (in theory, anyways — a lot of car vents struggle to stay in place under the weight of a phone and mount). It'll also provide 15W of charging power, more than iPhones can pull from standard Qi chargers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvr9hy"&gt;As I said before, this is a pretty obvious use for Apple's MagSafe tech. That’s why it was so surprising when Belkin basically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"&gt;announced this exact thing&lt;/a&gt; the day after the iPhone 12 introduced MagSafe — except it cost $40 and it bafflingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22387722/apple-magsafe-belkin-car-vent-mount-pro-review-no-charger"&gt;left off the ability to actually charge your phone&lt;/a&gt;. You know, the main thing you'd want it to do if you were trying to use a power-hungry navigation app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dzhly3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Six months later, there still isn’t a MagSafe car charger","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22387722/apple-magsafe-belkin-car-vent-mount-pro-review-no-charger"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FduIOk"&gt;Unlike that model, Belkin’s new accessory includes a built-in USB-C cable to get the power from your car to your phone. I was going to be mad about that, because most cars modern enough to have USB-C ports will probably come with CarPlay (though there are &lt;a href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/reason-why-no-apple-carplay.176336/"&gt;notable exceptions&lt;/a&gt;), making this accessory far less necessary. Thankfully, Belkin also includes a 12V car charger adapter for people whose cars come with USB-A ports or no phone charging capabilities to speak of.  That seems sensible enough, and I can't think of any situations where that would be a problem, though I might've preferred a removable cable on a product that'll probably be constantly exposed to sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of the Belkin charging pad, its integrated USB-C cable, and the car charger adapter." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SLc3YzKQvqBuI4HGpoE28tEe8kI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24170220/HQ6A2_AV6.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 12V charger is what makes USB-C make sense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TAGnXX"&gt;The mount can also swivel your phone from portrait to landscape, for however you like to see your directions. For the most part it, seems like a perfectly competent accessory —except that, again, it costs $99.95. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LycfDi"&gt;I do understand that MagSafe accessories generally don’t come cheap, but I think most people will probably want to at least consider other, less expensive options. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08S5WP4TN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Spigen makes a $21 version&lt;/a&gt; of this that acts as a receptacle for &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHXH3AM/A/magsafe-charger"&gt;a $39 MagSafe puck&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you splurge for a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-USB-C-Car-Charger/dp/B0843SCLYH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fancy $20 dual USB-C 12V adapter&lt;/a&gt; (because it doesn’t come with one), you’d still be saving a decent chunk of change. Plus, Spigen’s version comes in black, while Belkin’s version only comes in white, which will stand out like a sore thumb against most dashboards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDF1Te"&gt;You could also get Belkin’s $60 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fmagnetic-wireless-car-charger-10w%2FP-WIC004.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F11%2F4%2F23441336%2Fbelkin-boost-charge-pro-wireless-car-charger-with-magsafe-iphone-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BoostCharge Magnetic Wireless Car Charger&lt;/a&gt;, which is “MagSafe compatible,” meaning it holds your phone using magnets, but can only charge at 10W, instead of 15W. Given that I’d expect faster wireless charging to overheat my phone during the summer, I might gravitate towards that version over the MagSafe ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Me7z0f"&gt;If you don’t like either of those options, though, the Belkin Boost Charge Pro Wireless Car Charger with MagSafe &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1504346/7613?subId1=VergeBelkinWirelessCarChargerNews110422&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHQ6A2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-boost%25E2%2586%2591charge%25E2%2584%25A2-pro-wireless-car-charger-with-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starts shipping on November 14th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter cut 15 percent of its trust and safety staff but says it won’t impact moderation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of the Twitter logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rJoSoOWsKMhGHbavubuYsK5iFhU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71587035/acastro_STK050_06.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I guess we’ll see.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GR6Ed2"&gt;Twitter just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/4/23439790/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs-trust-and-safety-teams-severance"&gt;laid off about half of its workforce&lt;/a&gt;, but the company’s “core moderation capabilities” are still in place, the company’s head of safety and integrity Yoel Roth said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1588657227035918337"&gt;in a tweet thread Friday evening&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnAbjN"&gt;The layoffs affected “approximately” 15 percent of Twitter’s Trust and Safety group, “with our frontline moderation staff experiencing the least impact,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1588657228462317568"&gt;according to Roth&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1588657229628321792"&gt;restricted access&lt;/a&gt; to some internal tools last week for “security reasons” — Roth didn’t say exactly when, but that would put the timing around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23184519/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-deal-complete-agreement"&gt;when Elon Musk took over the company&lt;/a&gt; — but “most” content moderators who did frontline reviews weren’t impacted, and access to those tools will be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1588657229628321792"&gt;“fully restored in the coming days.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3YcHr"&gt;Daily volume of “moderation actions taken” has “stayed steady,” Roth said, though only supported that assertion &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1588657230836305920"&gt;with a vague chart&lt;/a&gt; showing the volume of tweets “reviewed and actioned, daily.” Musk made a content moderation assertion of his own Friday evening, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1588666105023041536"&gt;claiming that&lt;/a&gt; “we have actually seen hateful speech at times this week decline *below* our prior norms.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="KXrVQI"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;More than 80% of our incoming content moderation volume was completely unaffected by this access change. The daily volume of moderation actions we take stayed steady through this period. &lt;a href="https://t.co/rSGKtq0e3J"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rSGKtq0e3J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Yoel Roth (@yoyoel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1588657230836305920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M9DMFF"&gt;However, Twitter has had to “deprioritize a few workflows” like helping with lost password requests and “some” suspension appeals, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1588657233482895361"&gt;according to Roth&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter is “working to get these back online in the days to come.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsLXaB"&gt;Moderation on Twitter has been a concern in the leadup to next week’s US midterm elections, but election integrity remains a “top priority,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1588657232279130112"&gt;Roth said&lt;/a&gt;. Musk, who said last week that Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428792/elon-musk-twitter-content-moderation-council-trump"&gt;will implement a “content moderation council,”&lt;/a&gt; also underscored Twitter’s focus on moderation: “again, to be crystal clear, Twitter’s strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1588666105023041536"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Starlink is getting daytime data caps</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ijx8uQ"&gt;Starlink is about to feel a little more like other ISPs, with a new data policy that mimics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"&gt;Anytime Minutes&lt;/a&gt; from the bad old days of highly restricted cellphone service. The satellite internet division of SpaceX will start throttling home internet for customers who use more than 1TB of Priority Access data per month during peak hours beginning in December. The change is being rolled out as part of a new &lt;a href="https://www.starlink.com/legal/documents/DOC-1134-82708-70?regionCode=US"&gt;“Fair Use policy”&lt;/a&gt; in the US and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DP4nuW"&gt;Residential customers will now start each monthly billing cycle with an allocation of “Priority Access” data that tracks what you’re using from 7AM in the morning until 11PM at night. If you surpass that 1TB cap, which Starlink says less than 10 percent of users currently do, you’ll be moved to “Basic Access” data, or deprioritized data during heavy network congestion, for the rest of your billing cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWs9BS"&gt;If you want to buy more Priority Access data, you can, at the cost of 25 cents per GB, and any data used between 11PM and 7AM doesn’t count towards your Priority Access tally. (You may want to download new &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; updates or schedule device backups to run while everyone’s asleep, for example). RV and Portability satellite internet customers can’t get Priority Access at all, while there are different brackets for anyone with a Business account or who’s using Starlink at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmbpLh"&gt;You’ll be able to track your data usage and opt-in to buying Priority Access data from the Starlink app or your Starlink account webpage. As part of the new Fair Use policy, Starlink has also detailed data caps and Priority Access pricing for its business and mobility plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OPO38"&gt;Starlink claims that its internet is a “finite resource” (just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/15/23406268/elon-musk-starlink-keep-funding-ukraine-government-free-losing-money"&gt;ask the Ukrainian government&lt;/a&gt;) that will grow as it launches more satellites and says that it has to “manage the network to balance Starlink supply with user demand.” But the new data caps bring Starlink down to earth with other ISPs like Comcast, which currently has 1.2TB data caps for many customers (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840165/comcast-data-cap-delay-isp-dec-2021"&gt;has repeatedly delayed introducing them in Northeast states&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
