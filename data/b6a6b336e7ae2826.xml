Lightning Talk: Won’t Extend It One More Time! - Sandor Dargo - C++ on Sea 2022
Slides: https://github.com/philsquared/cpponsea-slides/tree/master/2022

I'd like to share a painfully fresh story about a bug hunt. After I went through the 5 phases of grief, I realised that it's about a lifetime extension issue.

LightningTalk: Using Clang Query to Isolate AST Elements - Kristen Shaker - C++ on Sea 2022
Slides: https://github.com/philsquared/cpponsea-slides/tree/master/2022

The talk will contain a quick explanation of the Lexing/Parsing phase of compilation. Then I will show how you can leverage compiler explorer and clang_query to identify and isolate specific elements of the Abstract Syntax Tree.

Lightning Talk: Playing Video Games is Too Difficult - Ólafur Waage - C++ on Sea 2022
Slides: https://github.com/philsquared/cpponsea-slides/tree/master/2022

Over the years I've made programs that play video games so I'm going to show a few of them off, the style of the talk is &quot;I'm too lazy, so I wrote programs to play the games for me.&quot; which often is way more work than playing them.

Lightning Talk: Embracing the Jank: Becoming a C++ Front-End Developer - Jacob Rice - C++ on Sea 2022
Slides: https://github.com/philsquared/cpponsea-slides/tree/master/2022

Finding just the right testing paradigm to perfectly capture your needs is a wonderful feeling. But if your needs are incredibly specific and crazy, sometimes the tests have to be, too. In this talk, I show a test suite that I recently used for exactly that reason. Only it's testing an entire GPU render pipeline. And the entire pipeline is running inside of a browser. And the test suite, console, and render canvas are also inside of a browser. How did I become a C++ front-end developer?

Lightning Talk: C++: Your Friendly Meta-Assembler - Or How to Beat `memcmp` - Oliver Schönrock - C++ on Sea 2022
Slides: https://github.com/philsquared/cpponsea-slides/tree/master/2022
Code: https://github.com/oschonrock/arrcmp


Using TMP with Intel intrinsics to generate hardware optimised assembly for a `memcpm` replacement. In the motivating example it produced a 2-3x speedup over glibc or asmlib.

What’s in a Bit – Peter Bindels - C++ on Sea 2022
Slides: https://github.com/philsquared/cpponsea-slides/tree/master/2022
 
Ever tried to create a .COM program by writing a text file and renaming it?
 
How does your computer remember that something is a PNG image if you remove the extension? And why can you unzip some file formats but not others?
 
How do you make a program use a dataset that is too big for memory, but that fits on your disk?
 
How do you store information compactly in a way that is quick to read?
 
Where do you begin to read a JPG file? And how do you read unknown binary files?
 
In this talk I will be explaining the history of binary file formats, the different styles of binary file formats that are in common use and give examples how to reverse engineer file formats. I will provide an intro into reading and designing binary file formats with the implied goal of efficiency and speed.

Contractual Disappointment in C++ - John McFarlane - C++ on Sea 2022
Slides: https://github.com/philsquared/cpponsea-slides/tree/master/2022

 
Writing robust software in C++ is challenging.
 
Effective use of modern tools and guidelines helps a great deal. And successive revisions of the language and the standard library add features which help the user prevent problems. But inevitably, upsets happen during program operation.
 
This talk discusses what program developers can do to help. Contracts and their implications are the main tool used to frame run-time failure. Through their lens I attempt to show that careful understanding of interfaces is the most effective way to ensure usability, efficiency and reliability.

How to Rangify Your Code - Tina Ulbrich - C++ on Sea 2022
Slides: https://github.com/philsquared/cpponsea-slides/tree/master/2022

By now you probably know about ranges in C++20. You may have also watched a talk or two about how to create your own view. But now, what do you do with that knowledge? How do you rangify your code? If you find yourself using pre C++20 code because you don't know where to start using ranges, this talk is for you. I'm going to rangify different code examples and try to show you how to think in ranges. I'm going to use the standard library and the range-v3 library.

Making C++ Fun, Safe, and Accessible – Jason Turner - C++ on Sea 2022
Slides: https://github.com/philsquared/cpponsea-slides/tree/master/2022 

C++ has a reputation for being hard to learn with annoying errors and easy to invoke memory errors that make it dangerous.
Can we make C++ fun and safe and accessible to a larger audience? 
We'll discuss some ideas for what &quot;fun, safe, and accessible&quot; means and how these goals might be accomplished.

Recipes for Reducing Allocations by C++ Containers - Lukas Böger - C++ on Sea 2022
Slides: https://github.com/philsquared/cpponsea-slides/tree/master/2022

It is well known that allocations can have a significant negative impact on the runtime performance of software. Frequently, these memory requests are made by containers (standard ones or otherwise). But the actual allocations might not be easily identifiable, and the options to avoid them aren't obvious.
In this talk, we will go through a number of comprehensible recipes to address these issues.
We will start with the most basic std::vector T ::reserve, cover container choices and using the right constructors. Then, different forms of scope promotion are discussed before we cover view types and two hands-on examples with pmr allocators. Recipes are presented with a discussion of up and downsides, benchmarks, and techniques to measure and diagnose allocation behaviour.
