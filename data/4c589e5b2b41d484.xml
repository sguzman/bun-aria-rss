    <title>Life is Short with Justin Long</title>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[<p>Is it just me or is time flying by? How do we make the most out of our short time here on Earth? That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here to find out. I‚Äôm Justin Long and I‚Äôve been an actor for most of my life, so I‚Äôm used to getting inside the heads of the characters I play. But now that I‚Äôm getting older (I‚Äôm 43 now, yikes), I want to peek inside the heads of real people to learn how they find meaning in life. I‚Äôm also very curious what their favorite snack food is, and what emoji they use most often ‚Äî ya know, the REALLY important stuff. Every episode I‚Äôll get personal with all kinds of people, from actors to musicians to deep thinkers who fascinate me. My brother Christian is on hand each episode to keep me honest, and occasionally remind me about some of the embarrassing things I‚Äôve done over the years. Join us, or if you have more important things to do, that‚Äôs okay too ‚Äî life is short!</p><p>Listen ad-free on Wondery+ or on Amazon Music with a Prime membership or Amazon Music Unlimited subscription.</p>]]>
