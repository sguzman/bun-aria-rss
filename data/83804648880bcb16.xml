	<title>Zero Trust and the Fallacy of Secure Networks</title>
	<description>Talking about secure networks is like talking about safe pools. A pool is just a body of water, and if it has enough water to swim in, then it has more than enough water to drown in. A pool is inherently unsafe. We, therefore, take care in how we use a pool: We don?t swim alone; we don?t run around the pool; we don?t dive in the shallow end; and we don?t swim less than 15 minutes after eating. (Is that 15-minute rule still a thing?) These pool-safety policies ensure that our use of the pool is as safe as possible, but they do not make the pool safe in and of itself.</description>

	<title>Reaching the Convergence of Security and Productivity</title>
	<description>It?s all too common that IT security tools and practices come at the cost of productivity. Even physical security has this trade-off. There would be no rush to arrive at the airport an hour early if it weren?t for the extensive security measures that flying entails. As a result of this trade-off, our concern often isn?t if we can increase security in our networks ? rather, it?s if the increased security is worth the impact on the business.</description>

For the workloads that can be moved, the results can lead to transformational digital experiences for users and developers alike.</description>

	<description>Cybersquatting, also known as domain squatting, is a type of scam that mimics a brand's domain to confuse potential victims and gain their trust. According to Revision Legal, ?Cybersquatting is prohibited in the U.S. by federal law under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA.)? These fake domains can be used in cyberattacks ? especially phishing attacks. </description>

	<title>Why You Shouldn't Tie IP Addresses to Tokens</title>
	<description>Locking tokens to the client IP address might seem like a good way to prevent content theft, such as sharing of authenticated URLs that include tokens. It might even appear to work in small-scale test environments. However, the internet has evolved to a point where it?s quite common for clients to use multiple source IP addresses. This is especially true when a token is created by a server on one hostname (such as a CMS) but then validated by a server on another hostname, such as an Akamai edge server, when serving content. </description>

	<title>Exceptional Brand Experiences Go Far Beyond the 30-Second Super Bowl Ad</title>
	<description>Super Bowl LVI is almost here, and with that comes one of my favorite pastimes: watching the commercials! And you know I?m not alone ? 30% of viewers tune in to the big game primarily to see the commercials, upping the pressure on CMOs to ?get it right.? But winning the hearts and minds of the more than 100 million anticipated viewers goes far beyond creating a captivating 30- or 60-second spot. In fact, the production, supporting digital assets, celebrity endorsements, talking animals, etc. just scratch the surface when it comes to delivering an exceptional brand experience. </description>

In other words, every host running the malware process becomes part of the network, and is capable of sending, receiving, and executing the commands to control machines in the network.</description>

	<description>A critical unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) has been reported in Log4j, an open-source logging library. Akamai has been working directly with customers to deploy WAF rules over the past 24 hours to mitigate the exposure. Log4j is incorporated into many popular frameworks, making the impact widespread.

	<title>Security's Role in Internet Resilience</title>
	<description>One aspect of resilience on the internet is that things ? notably servers and resources ? move around. Sometimes moves are legitimate, such as when a popular site evolves from hosting their own website to moving to a cloud provider to using a CDN to handle the ever-increasing traffic. Sometimes the moves are not legitimate, such as when an attacker pretends to be an ecommerce or banking site and steals a user?s credentials upon login. How can the end user tell the difference between legitimate and not-so-legitimate moves?</description>

	<title>2021 SOTI Security: Year End Review</title>
	<description>What a year 2021 has been. Even as the world continues to re-open to various degrees, we?re still feeling the impact from 2020?s move to an almost completely virtual world. Many large companies are shifting to a hybrid model, mixing the ability to work from home with working in the office. Some are even offering their employees the opportunity to work remotely indefinitely. There is no denying that the way we work, bank, play, and relax has been impacted by COVID-19. Shouting ?pivot? may have shot into popular culture in the TV show Friends, but it?s a rallying cry that?s been revived in the 2020s by businesses, individuals, and criminals alike. </description>

	<title>Getting Ready for Some Holiday Shopping? So Are the Bots.</title>
	<description>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are just around the corner, and if India?s Diwali festival and China?s Singles Day are any indication, U.S. retailers could be bombarded with bad bots, aimed at competing with real shoppers this holiday season. And the stakes are high. Global supply chain issues, skyrocketing shipping costs, inflation, and domestic labor shortages have rapidly compounded problems within a sector already slammed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumers have been repeatedly warned that hot items on holiday shopping lists will be hard to secure and may not arrive in time for Christmas. According to a recent report, 42% of holiday shoppers should expect to find more out-of-stock items this year than in the past. </description>

	<title>Digging Deeper ? An In-Depth Analysis of a Fast Flux Network</title>
	<description>Fast Flux is a DNS technique used by botnets to hide various types of malicious activities, such as phishing, web proxying, malware delivery, and malware communication, behind an ever-changing network of compromised hosts acting as proxies. The Fast Flux network concept was first introduced in 2006, with the emergence of Storm Worm malware variants. The Fast Flux network is typically used to make the communication between malware and its command and control (C2) server more resistant to discovery. Akamai?s research team has analyzed sophisticated botnet infrastructure that leverages Fast Flux techniques including domains, nameservers, and IP address changes. Figure 1 shows an overview of such a network, which can also be referred to as a form of bulletproof hosting, that hosts various malicious services. These networks empower threat actors to execute attack campaigns by utilizing network capabilities to host malware binaries, proxy communication to C2 servers, phishing websites, or proxy attacks on websites across the internet.</description>

	<title>Redefining Security at the Mobile Edge</title>
	<description>During the pandemic, organizations became more geographically dispersed, even if that only means people working from home instead of the office. As businesses begin to open up again, the trend is leaning toward mobility as a means to support a hybrid working environment, in which employees have more flexibility to work wherever it suits them best. The remote user, who was once the exception, has become the norm.</description>

	<title>Keeping Up with Biden Administration Cybersecurity Mandates</title>
	<description>With Wednesday?s sweeping cybersecurity mandates issued by the Biden administration, patching Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) are top of mind ? for both federal and private-sector companies alike ? to help prevent damaging intrusions. Intensifying the pressure surrounding the latest round of mandates, federal agencies are required to address high-risk vulnerabilities discovered in 2021 within two weeks. However, for the vast majority of organizations and their security teams, addressing every critical vulnerability at the software or infrastructure level quickly is not feasible. Instead, many enterprise defenders look to virtual patching via solutions like WAF policy updates and rule changes as a quick fix to help reduce immediate risk, while longer-term software updates are issued.</description>

	<title>Akamai MFA in Action: Single Sign-On is Phish-Proof and Simple to Use </title>
	<description>Breaking news: we just completed an 850-user pilot with Akamai MFA. In this blog, the first in a series, I?ll explain why we switched to Akamai MFA, how we ran our pilot, and employee feedback so far. Check back for my next blog, when we?re midway through our global deployment.

A burglar checks for open windows. Neglecting to lock just one is like leaving the door wide open. In the same way, cyber attackers look for the easiest user accounts to take over ? whether that?s network access credentials, email, on-premise applications, or cloud/SaaS applications. If they?re lucky, they can also use the stolen credentials to breach other systems, an action known as lateral movement.</description>

	<description>Every day, Akamai?s Threat Research team tracks and mitigates phishing attack campaigns to help keep our customers ? and their reputations ? protected. Recently, they tracked an orchestrated attack campaign comprising more than 9,000 domains and subdomains, mainly targeting victims located in China. The phishing scam was abusing more than 15 high-profile and trusted brands spanning ecommerce, travel, and food &amp; beverage industries. By using well-known brand names, the threat actors attempted to engage victims to participate in a quiz that, once completed, would result in winning an attractive prize. Akamai refers to this malicious modus operandi as a ?question quiz? phishing attack campaign.</description>

	<title>Three Surefire Ways to Boost the Digital Banking Experience</title>
	<description>The year 2020 disrupted just about every industry, including retail banking. Locked down at home, consumers were abruptly forced to do all their banking over the internet. The sudden transition profoundly impacted banks and created unprecedented demands on online infrastructure. Some banking sites were overwhelmed by traffic and slowed to a crawl. Some sites crashed altogether.</description>

	<title>Gaming Industry Paves the Way</title>
	<description>Currently at $200 billion per year and growing, the gaming industry has grown from humble beginnings in the 1930s (during which games like Baffle Ball and pinball were considered a degenerate form of leisure that would lead young men into lives of sin) into a massive global phenomenon widely seen as the savior of parents? sanity during a global pandemic.</description>

	<title>Capoae Malware Ramps Up: Uses Multiple Vulnerabilities and Tactics to Spread</title>
	<description>Recently, there has been a plethora of UPX packed crypto-mining malware written in Golang targeting Linux systems and web applications popping up in the news. The malware?s primary tactic is to spread by taking advantage of vulnerable systems and weak administrative credentials. Once they?ve been infected, these systems are then used to mine cryptocurrency.  I?ve named the sample I examined for this post ?Capoae,? based on the code?s output to my terminal. </description>

	<title>Jest Mocks?Unit Testing for EdgeWorkers</title>
	<description>In case you haven?t already been working with EdgeWorkers, it allows you to run JavaScript code across more than 4,200 locations for proximity to users and fast application response times. 
With more and more application functionality moving to the edge, it?s increasingly important to ensure that each function is doing what it needs to do. A unit test runs code over each segment of your program, checking the input and output. These tests allow developers to check individual areas of a program to see where (and why) errors are occurring. Several frameworks allow you to easily run your tests, including popular frameworks like Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, and Cypress.

	<title>UPX Packed Headaches</title>
	<description>Researching malware has many challenges.  One of those challenges is obfuscated code and intentionally corrupted binaries. To address challenges like this, we've written a small tool in C that could fix intentionally corrupted binaries automatically. We also plan to open-source the project so other researchers could use it too, and perhaps improve and expand upon the tool's capabilities as needed.</description>

	<title>Dogged Persistence?The Name of the Game for One DDoS Attacker</title>
	<description>With DDoS, we typically observe a moderate degree of attacker persistence. DDoS attacks are relatively easy to launch from a number of online booter services, and the availability of cryptocurrencies for payment has made it easy to remain anonymous. Attackers can try their hand at DDoS for little effort and money, and in relative safety. They give it a go, try a few things (vector, endpoint, and scale changes), and for those with effective defenses, the attacker eventually burns out. </description>

His 2019 Blackhat presentation on HTTP Desync attacks exposed vulnerabilities with different implementations of the HTTP Standards, particularly within proxy servers and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).These implementation differences with regard to how proxy servers interpret the construction of web requests have led to new request smuggling vulnerabilities.

	<title>All Access Is (or Should Be) Remote Access</title>
	<description>With the transition to remote work, we often hear the term remote access used in unison. Typically, remote work application access is facilitated via a remote access mechanism and, presumably, local work application access is facilitated via a local access mechanism. But I argue that this connection does not really hold true. Sure, remote work does require the use of a remote access mechanism, but the mechanism can and should also be used for local work. There's really no such thing as local access.

	<title>Why Zero Trust Needs the Edge</title>
	<description>Backhauling traffic destroys performance, and backhauling attack traffic can destroy even more. Nevertheless, in a traditional security deployment model, we are faced with the lose-lose options of either backhauling all traffic to the security stack or allowing some accesses to not go through the security stack. Of course, in the modern world where cyberattacks can cause enormous damage, the latter option is not really an option at all. All traffic must route through a robust security stack. So how do we accomplish this goal without backhauling? The answer is Zero Trust security deployed and delivered as an edge service.

	<title>Akamai Summarizes Service Disruption (RESOLVED)</title>
	<description>At 15:45 UTC on July 22, 2021, a software configuration update triggered a bug in our Secure Edge Content Delivery Network impacting that network's domain name service (DNS) system (the system that directs browsers to websites for that specific service). This caused a disruption impacting availability of some customer websites. The disruption lasted up to an hour. Upon rolling back the software configuration update, the services resumed normal operations.

	<title>Zero Trust Network Access Is an Oxymoron</title>
	<description>Though Zero Trust is really quite simple and should be viewed as a very strong form of the age-old principle of least privilege, that does not mean that it is the same thing. In fact, one of the most significant differences from what came before is that when it comes to access, Zero Trust is based on application access, not network access. I was surprised, then, when Gartner's new SASE (secure access service edge) model included something called Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA). This term is an oxymoron, and I make this point because it matters. The distinction between network access and application access is important.

In this and subsequent blog posts, I want to make the case that, in fact, Zero Trust is all about simplicity, and that at its core, Zero Trust is a strong form of the age-old principle of least privilege.</description>

	<title>Kaseya Supply Chain Ransomware Attack</title>
	<description>On July 2, 2021, Kaseya disclosed an active attack against customers using its VSA product, and urged all on-premise customers to switch-off Kaseya VSA. Shortly before this alert, users on Reddit started describing ransomware incidents against managed security providers (MSPs), and the common thread among them was on-premise VSA deployments. In the hours to follow, several indicators of compromise (IOCs) were released, and Akamai was able to observe some of that traffic. A patch for the VSA product was released by Kaseya on July 11.

	<title>Streaming Numbers Jump for European Football Tournament Delivered by Akamai</title>
	<description>The video streaming traffic that Akamai delivered for more than 30 rights-holding customers during the July 11 Italy-England football (soccer) final as part of the delayed-to-2021European soccer tournament peaked at 34.9 Tbps on the Akamai edge platform. The traffic peak during the final match was the highest that Akamai reached for the tournament and was nearly 5x greater than the 7.3 Tbps peak of the 2016 Portugal-France championship match. Traffic during the June 29, 2021, round-of-16 match between Germany and England was the second-highest peak for the tournament, reaching 33.9 Tbps; third-highest was the July 6 Italy-Spain semi-final at 32.6 Tbps.

	<title>Location-and Device-agnostic Security for the Mobile Workforce</title>
	<description>I've spent my entire career in technology and can still recall the time when a desktop PC was the only way to work. (Truth be told, I'm also old enough to remember dumb terminals.) I also remember my first company laptop -- a beast of a thing with a monochrome display so thick it came with an integrated 2.5" floppy drive and a battery life that made it barely usable. My first mobile phone was a Motorola Timeport, the first tri-band mobile phone that could work in Europe and North America.

	<title>Zero Trust: The Protection Model for the Post-Pandemic World</title>
	<description>One year and a half following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we're seeing most companies either maintaining their remote work policies or slowly moving to a hybrid model. In fact, an estimated 36.2 million Americans will be working remotely by 2025, which is nearly double pre-pandemic levels.

	<title>Your Employees Want Passwordless. Isn't It Time You Gave It to Them?</title>
	<description>I hate passwords. There, I said it. I dread getting an email from Akamai IT telling me it will soon be time to update my password. I procrastinate until the last possible moment instead of immediately doing what is actually a trivial process. I suspect I'm not alone in my dislike for passwords.

	<title>The Countdown Has Started - The Move Toward Zero Trust and MFA</title>
	<description>In early May 2021, the President of the United States issued an executive order on cybersecurity, and though it will take some time for executive branch agencies to develop formal rules, the order itself includes a lot of what I consider to be best practice in cybersecurity, including the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and Zero Trust, mentioned by name.

	<title>The Threat That Never Went Away Is Back (with a Vengeance)</title>
	<description>What is your recollection of May 2017? Emmanuel Macron won the French election. The Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus gave its final performance after a 146-year run. The U.S. FCC voted to overturn net neutrality rules. And the National Health Service in the United Kingdom was crippled by a massive ransomware attack that ended up costing over $120 million.

	<title>Why FIDO2 is the Answer to Better Security </title>
	<description>A groundbreaking increase in security incidents is affecting governments around the world. In light of this, the United States issued a formal order to implement a robust set of security measures designed to improve the security of federal systems. In his most recent executive order, President Biden acknowledged that the United States and many other governments around the world are facing increasing malicious cyberattacks. In order to prevent,  and recover from security incidents, the President is pushing to significantly improve the government's security stack, including the implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA). In this post, I'll discuss how the government's plan to leverage MFA could be even better. </description>

	<title>Finding the Cracks in the Wall - How Modern Scams Bypass MFA</title>
	<description>In my previous blog, I discussed the important role multi-factor authentication (MFA) plays in further securing access to enterprise and consumer services. We also established the fact that although MFA increases authentication security and decreases the risk of account takeover, MFA can, and is, being bypassed in the wild.</description>

	<description>The use of authentication factors, one of the most fundamental and well understood concepts in information security, enables secure access to applications, services, and networks. It can affect an enterprise's security posture, however, as the drastic increase in data breaches and system attacks are largely based on compromised authentication.

	<title>Another Golang Crypto Miner On the Loose</title>
	<description>There are many crypto mining malware variants infecting systems on the internet. On Friday, March 4, 2021, I noticed an interesting hit in my honeypot logs.  The binary it captured stood out, as it was rather large at 4MB.  I immediately thought it would be a crypto miner written in the Go language. I was correct. This one however, has some newer exploits it's using for proliferation.</description>

	<title>Out of My Depth (Where I Belong)</title>
	<description>I remember well my first day as a member of Akamai's InfoSec department.

The Friday prior, I'd just completed the Akamai Technical Academy, a five-month crash-course in all things tech, and was now, on a cold but sunny Monday morning, joining InfoSec for their weekly staff meeting.  Eager to make a good first impression, I took a seat at the large, crowded conference table, opened my notebook, and started to take notes.</description>

	<title>SolarWinds Hack and the Case of DNS Security</title>
	<description>It's not news that some of the top government agencies and companies in the world were victims of the SolarWinds attack. At this point, I can say it's the reason I didn't have a smoother transition back into work-life following a long vacation. As I understand it, the breaches happened after malicious code was inserted into a software patch that was downloaded by the companies and agencies. The installation of the patch executed malicious code, called SUNBURST, which created an entry point for other malicious codes (TEARDROP/RAINDROP). These additional codes were used to allow attackers to move laterally within the network and exfiltrate sensitive customer information to a public command and control server.</description>

	<title>Credential Stuffing and Account Takeover -- The Business View</title>
	<description>Account takeovers (ATOs), in which criminals impersonate legitimate account owners in order to take control of an account, cause tremendous pain for businesses in all industries. This pain may be monetary, such as losses from stolen accounts, but may also include a number of related problems, like regulatory and legal issues, lost customers, and the inability to gain new consumers due to a lack of trust. Losses from ATOs and new account fraud are estimated at more than $10 billion annually in the United States alone.</description>

	<title>Akamai's Internship Program in Krakow</title>
	<description>The beginning of a new year is a time to look back and reflect on the previous one. December 31st is also the end date of our annual Krakow Internship Program. Last year's intake was very unique due to the pandemic and the shift towards a remote work environment. Akamai was fortunate to be able to adjust our internship program to be fully virtual and provide this opportunity to students who look forward to this experience. </description>

	<title>Holiday Season Phishing Attacks on the Rise</title>
	<description>Phishing continues to be a major attack vector, and it's surprising just how many security incidents and breaches start with an employee clicking on a link in a carefully crafted phishing email (and sometimes doing the same with a not-so-well crafted phishing email -- see this example).</description>

	<title>Inspiring the Next Generation with DigiGirlz</title>
	<description>DigiGirlz is an initiative organized by Microsoft to engage girls in technological education and careers. The initiative, which launched in 2000, consists of two main programs: DigiGirlz Day and High Tech Camp. This program has been a cornerstone of Microsoft's community engagement for more than 20 years, but this year the events were in jeopardy of being cancelled because of the pandemic. So, what do you do when your passion for helping others meets a challenge? You do what Microsoft does so well -- you innovate!</description>

	<title>Edge Redirector Cloudlet Gets Faster</title>
	<description>Cloudlets Policy Manager often takes a long time to load, which is a by-product of its original design where every policy activation is an individual file. These files must be moved around the network, and as you might imagine, transferring thousands of files in a multi-tenant network can take a very long time. Add a synchronous API to this problem, and we quickly get into a situation where the Policy Manager UI can freeze until a back-end transfer operation times out.</description>

	<title>Maintaining an Energy-Efficient Edge Platform</title>
	<description>Over the past 20 years, we've seen a lot of growth at Akamai. When I started at Akamai, we used to have traffic peaks of almost 200 Mbps. From that fledgling startup, Akamai has now grown to such a scale that we almost doubled network capacity in 2020 and were able to serve peaks of almost 200 Tbps. In short, just like the internet, Akamai has undergone quite the evolution. But as we've grown, so have our environmental impacts. In fact, the internet as a whole is responsible for more than 2% of global emissions, having the same impact as the airline industry. Our online streaming, learning, working, shopping, and playing habits have all started to add up. </description>

	<title>Stacking CDNs for Improved Performance and Security</title>
	<description>I recently worked with a client whose large e-commerce site was hosted with a popular cloud-based commerce solution. Its business was growing rapidly into new geographic markets, and it was not satisfied with the embedded content delivery network (eCDN) that was bundled with the cloud solution. We demonstrated that stacking CDNs -- adding Akamai's Ion solution on top of the eCDN -- could significantly improve performance as well as provide the client with much greater control over its delivery configuration</description>

	<title>Retrospective 2020: DDoS Risk Higher Than Ever</title>
	<description>Never before has the risk of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack been higher. In 2020, we saw record-breaking attacks, a DDoS extortion campaign impacting thousands of organizations globally, more emergency customer turnups, and more Akamai customers attacked than any year on record -- and we've been successfully fighting DDoS attacks since 2003! We also saw a big increase in attacks targeting verticals that haven't seen as much activity of late, with 7 of 11 of the industries we track seeing peak attack counts in 2020.</description>

And while we're tired of hearing this term, it's true amid the pandemic, U.S. presidential election, social justice movements, finalization of Brexit, and many other new and life-changing events that took place this past year.

	<title>Streaming Traffic Peaks During Biden Inauguration</title>
	<description>Live news streaming traffic during the Biden inauguration ceremony on January 20 peaked at 12 Tbps on the Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform. The peak, which occurred as now-President Biden was taking the oath of office just before 12 PM ET, is roughly 8x higher than what we typically see for mid-day traffic on a weekday. However, it's still less than the 18 Tbps we observed during 2020 election night on November 3.</description>

Around 20 acres of our land consists of dense, mature hardwood of oak, maple, and beech, and we were able to contract to sell 65 maple and 25 oak trees to a logging company. I won't be retiring from Akamai any time soon from our logging windfall, but it's nice to see some revenue from our land, and clearing mature trees is a part of good responsible forest management. </description>

	<title>Keeping Emissions in Check During Unprecedented Internet Use</title>
	<description>As I reflect on 2020 and the way in which the pandemic affected the business world, what stands out to me is the incredible increase in streaming content consumed on the internet. We've seen launches of some of the highest-profile streaming services to date between late 2019 and 2020. People are continuously streaming content and we need to consider the impact that increased viewership is having on the world. When you sit down to catch a movie or binge watch that latest series, do you consider the effect that streamed content has on the rest of the world? We will continue to see an uptick in carbon emissions from the power required to serve online content: servers, network hardware, and the energy needed to keep it all cool. </description>

	<title>Launching a New Game Studio and Planning for Growth</title>
	<description>So, you're starting your own game studio. This is an incredible opportunity! You and your team get to start fresh and build the game of your dreams! But, let's be honest, if you have just founded your own game studio, odds are that you're not a technical architect. You may have some technical know-how, but studio founders typically come from the creative side. </description>

	<title>How the Edge Improves Microservices</title>
	<description>Microservice architecture has transformed the way we develop and operate our applications. Microservices aren't a technology or a programming language. Instead, they create a structure for designing and building applications based on the idea that the individual functions of a website should operate independently. From this simple concept comes a multitude of benefits including:</description>

	<title>Smart DNS for the New Network: Optimizing Content Delivery</title>
	<description>The presence of public "over the top" DNS resolution alternatives is a strong motivator for ISPs to invest in making their DNS resolution infrastructure the best that it can be. Resolvers are the glue that binds subscribers to their fixed and mobile broadband services. Operators of public DNS services will play a significant role in controlling the user experience and gain goodwill if they succeed in persuading subscribers to use their resolvers. Worse, when public DNS services fail, it's probable that subscribers will blame their service provider because they may not understand the critical role DNS plays, or may not even remember they switched their DNS settings!

	<title>Stopping Active Attacks with Penalty Box</title>
	<description>Unfortunately, today's sophisticated web application threats have gained some advantages over typical WAFs: Favorable odds -- WAFs must correctly identify attacks 100% of the time, whereas attackers have the luxury of only needing to find a single bypass or evasion Temporary fixes -- Many WAFs use a "whack-a-mole" response tactic by only denying the individual attack request, allowing the attacker to make repeated attempts Persistence -- If left unimpeded, attackers may eventually find some type of payload obfuscation that minimizes detection effectiveness
The confluence of these advantages should concern WAF customers. Let's take a closer look at the typical web attacker methodology to see why.</description>

	<description>In part 1 of this series, I drew the architectural distinction between a centralized cloud platform and a distributed edge network. This is an important foundation upon which to explain the difference between cloud computing and edge computing. The two serve very different and complementary purposes. However, in my experience, business leaders, product owners, and application developers often mistake them as competitive.</description>

	<title> Using LL-HLS with Byte-Range Addressing to Achieve Interoperability in Low Latency Streaming</title>
	<description>HTTP Adaptive Segmented (HAS) streaming began to be used at scale from 2008 to 2012, with the advent of Move Networks, Microsoft Smooth Streaming, Apple HLS, Adobe HDS, and MPEG DASH. With the typical 10s segment durations of the day, livestream latencies (measuring latency as the time from an action being filmed to that same action being displayed on a device's screen) remained in the 30s to 60s range, trailing broadcast by a significant degree.</description>

	<title>Don't Let DDoS Extortionists Deliver a KO Punch</title>
	<description>Since mid-August, a variety of threat actors (and copycats alike) have been targeting organizations across all industries globally, threatening impending DDoS attacks unless Bitcoin is paid out. It's apparent, as the campaign rages on, that some businesses must be paying the extortion demands, -- incentivizing the criminal activity. Others are procuring emergency DDoS defenses in order to withstand bandwidth-busting attacks and keep internet-facing infrastructure protected. As highlighted in our last blog, we've been busy ramping customers on to our DDoS mitigation platforms for rapid protection before the threat actors strike again. And based on recent activity, they desire a rematch.</description>

	<title>Redundant, Secure, and Open Short Domains: A Vision for Multi-Provider Apex Domain Aliases to Enable DNS Diversity</title>
	<description>Human nature is to seek simpler and convenient ways to do things. One example is the sometimes onerous task of typing a URL into a web browser's address bar. Since users prefer short, easy-to-remember URLs, an internet trend is to use short domains for websites (e.g., edgedns.zone). With short website names, users benefit from the convenience of fewer characters to remember and type.</description>

	<title>Why Take It to the Edge</title>
	<description>Edge computing is the next natural paradigm shift in IT, bringing a new wave of decentralization. Over the past decade, IT has embraced two seemingly juxtaposed trends: the consolidation of infrastructure and data in private, public, or hybrid clouds, and the growing distribution and diversity of devices that access them. How can these trends continue to coexist? The answer is at the edge.</description>

	<title>Preparing the Edge for a Big Year in Live Streaming</title>
	<description>Next year is shaping up to be a big one for live streaming. Typically characteristic of even years, when many major international sporting events take place, 2021 looks like it could defy the trend. Akamai is predicting an unprecedented surge in live streaming that will start in late 2020 and continue throughout 2021. During this stretch, we could realistically see 50 million people concurrently streaming a single live event. That's roughly double the largest number of viewers we've seen during a single event in the past. With this in mind, Akamai has used much of 2020 to prepare new capabilities included in the Akamai Platform Update that will help customers prepare for this surge in live streaming.</description>

	<description>Welcome to day two of the Akamai Platform Update! 
Today, we're focusing on Akamai's edge delivery products as well as other complimentary products that help drive great digital experiences.

Regardless of the type of content, be it websites, apps, APIs, video, software, or smaller objects, Akamai's comprehensive set of content delivery products -- including Ion, Adaptive Media Delivery, and Download Delivery -- are designed to deliver great digital experiences for every user, regardless of location, device, or network.</description>

	<title>Edgeworkers Use Story: Creating High-Performing, Individualized Campaign Responses in Online Retail</title>
	<description>As campaigns and digital experiences become more individualized, they can create a challenge for delivering content to consumers at the highest velocity. Having each paid search, social media, and email marketing campaign add unique query string parameters to requests is critical for tracking the ROI of a company's marketing spend. This pursuit of granular user data can place a stubborn limit on the ability of B2C companies to maximize the benefits of cached content -- particularly in terms of maximizing offload of content delivery.</description>

	<description>At Akamai, we talk a lot about DDoS attacks. It's because we're pretty good at handling them. We've stopped many of the world's biggest attacks. And, while less common, they get a lot of attention. But we can also stop the world's smallest attacks. And we stop lots of them. It's these smaller attacks that we're talking about today.</description>

	<title>My Journey to Akamai and Back</title>
	<description>As a region, it's very diverse and dynamic, with a lot to experience. Although I'm based in the Beijing office, I have opportunities to collaborate closely with my colleagues in Japan, India, Singapore and Australia. We find synergies and uniqueness in each market, and constantly share ideas and best practices. It's fun, but it's also an enriching learning experience to live and work in such an exciting region.

	<description>People depend on the internet for just about everything: interacting, learning, transacting, traveling, working, and more. At the same time, the wireless evolution to 4G -- and soon 5G and Wi-Fi everywhere -- has given birth to an era of connected cars, smart sensors, and a multitude of other "things" that are growing rapidly and expanding in utility and scope. Leading network providers see new market opportunities with new business models to monetize new services that combine networks and commerce, including:</description>

	<title>How to Start Growing and Never Stop</title>
	<description>My heritage is Sri Lankan. But, at the age of 15 I moved to France as a refugee, fleeing a civil war. Starting a new life from scratch in France, without speaking French, was certainly an interesting journey. But I was lucky enough to have support from my parents. They lived by the mantra of "when there's a will, there's a way". And that helped get me into the French education system, where I completed high school and University, before moving to the UK to start my professional career in IT.

	<title>Headwinds and Tailwinds - Cycling For Climate Awareness in a Global Pandemic</title>
	<description>If you told me at the beginning of 2020 that I'd be cycling 250 miles in the remote Upper Peninsula of Michigan, fundraising for an organization called "Climate Ride", and wearing a face mask to go grocery shopping - I would not have believed you.  Yet, since March 2020, we've all been living the reality of the Covid-19 pandemic. Social distancing, total lock-down for some, living and working from home, and dealing with a narrowed life experience. </description>

	<title>Every Application Should Be Behind a WAF</title>
	<description>It's no secret that security threats continue to expand in volume and variety, making headlines on virtually a daily basis. From nation-state attacks, corporate espionage, and data exfiltration campaigns to all-in-one and sneaker bot campaigns, businesses across the globe find themselves dealing with a deluge of inbound threats. The increased amount and variation of threats, and the proliferation of apps being deployed and managed by teams and individuals across the enterprise, can make securing apps and data feel like trying to keep water out of a submerged sieve.</description>

But in your daily interactions, think about how many "things" you interact with where you expect the response to be instantaneous -- tapping on mobile apps; logging in and transacting with a retailer or a bank; selecting and viewing content on a streaming media device; interacting with a connected device like a light, doorbell, or even a car; or checking in for a train or flight.</description>

	<title>Large, Complex DDoS Attacks on the Rise in 2020</title>
	<description>While we've highlighted both record PPS and BPS attacks mitigated on the Akamai Prolexic Platform over the past few weeks, these attacks are part of a broader trend of increasingly large and complex DDoS activity. We have seen clear indications across the industry of high-water mark DDoS attacks being publicized by multiple vendors. 

The sheer number of large attacks has been unprecedented. The attacks are also noteworthy for their increasing complexity, illustrated in the number and combinations of different attack vectors. The tenacity of attackers is also increasing -- one Akamai customer experienced 14 separate 100+ Gbps attacks in just the first half of 2020. 

"What's new is the concept of campaigns. We go back a couple of years, and 'attack' was the right word to use. There were many attacks every single day, but they weren't, in my opinion, campaign-oriented. Some of our more recent ones are campaign-oriented, where the attacker is working in a coordinated way over an extended period of time." -- Roger Barranco, Vice President, Global Security Operations, Akamai

Some likely reasons for the rise in attacks are a combination of:

The proliferation of DDoS-for-hire tools
Emerging botnets (enterprise DVRs, IoT, etc.) entering the scene
Plenty of motivating factors across social, geopolitical, and online unrest
Quarantine and boredom -- what's a malicious actor supposed to do?
Whatever the unique reason of each attack, the result is the same: a security and IT team needs an effective defense.  </description>

	<title> Taking a Human Approach to a Global Crisis</title>
	<description>Since March, the COVID crisis has caused massive disruption to every area of life and work. It has tested us, as individuals and as a business. Akamai has taken a very human-centric approach during the pandemic. Our guiding principle has been to do what is right for the health and safety of employees, customers and partners. I feel proud of this, because when I think about what I'm grateful for, it really does come down to people. I'm grateful to be working for a company that is keeping people connected to the world through technology. I'm grateful to be among smart, immensely resilient colleagues. And I'm grateful to have friends and family who are sticking together. Ultimately, it's the humanity that matters. </description>

	<title>Akamai Mitigates Sophisticated 1.44 Tbps and 385 Mpps DDoS Attack</title>
	<description> always surprises me how easily a community can adapt to a new situation or reality. What was once considered an outlier or even an unimaginable situation can quickly become our new normal.

For those of us focused on protecting enterprises from threats, that also couldn't be more accurate. Specifically for the Akamai team working on our Prolexic platform in our Security Operations Command Center (SOCC), mitigating many distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks a day has resulted in increasingly sophisticated automated tooling and expert-level know-how through mitigating these constant attacks.</description>

The popularity and appeal of ZAM do, however, prompt a number of questions about the technical specifics, such as: Is ZAM interoperable with DNSSEC?</description>

	<title>Deployment Diversity for DNS Resiliency</title>
	<description>Similar to diverse workforces performing at a higher level, diverse network service deployments perform at a higher level that is increasingly important as the Internet continues to augment our reality. Akamai has 20 years of edge service deployment experience. Akamai's Intelligent Edge has proven that the "edge" requires more than "servers" on the edge.

	<title>Global Traffic Management for Cloud, Data Centers, and CDNs</title>
	<description>Twenty years ago it would be common to have multiple data centers load balanced with specialized devices. The applications in multiple data centers would use the Domain Name System (DNS) to look up the application destination. The DNS system would be set up to with multiple data center locations. This would "round robin" the results between the data centers. If you have four data centers, the customers would get "round-robined" between each data center.</description>

	<title>Protecting your Domain Names: Taking the First Steps</title>
	<description>Everyone and everything on the Internet depends on the Domain Name System (DNS) being functional. The DNS has been a common vector for attacks in recent years, and 2019 seems to be no different. Many of these attacks have goals far more sinister than simply taking a company offline or defacing a website; reported attacks include redirecting some or all of an organization's domain to gain access to protected resources, intercept traffic, and even obtain TLS certificates for that domain.  Organizations should perform regular DNS reviews and audits. The following guidelines provide a starting point for your review.</description>

	<description>Over the past year, Akamai Enterprise Threat Research team monitored the usage of one particular phishing toolkit in the wild. We previously wrote about this phishing toolkit  as "Three Questions Quiz". The "Quiz" toolkit is not new to the threat landscape, as its been used in many phishing campaigns in recent years. Our goal here is to present new insights on the evolution and scale of usage of the toolkit in the wild. The most surprising insight was the variety of commercial brands being abused as part of these phishing scams that were  all using the same toolkit, but wearing a different face.</description>

	<title>Introducing New WhoAmI Tool DNS Resolver Information</title>
	<description>The Domain Name System (DNS) tools ?whoami.akamai.net? and its alias ?whoami.akamai.com? have been used for many years, often as a step in the process for diagnosing how a content delivery network (CDN) is directing traffic, locality, and network reachability issues. Whoami was originally introduced as a quick solution that, as often happens, ended up sticking around for far longer than expected.

	<title>Introducing Web Security Analytics</title>
	<description>Every security team knows that the success of any security product relies heavily on the ability to maintain an optimal security configuration. Any misconfiguration can result in malicious or undesired traffic reaching the application, or worse - legitimate traffic being blocked. In addition, it can result in noisy false positive security events, which can eventually mask real attacks from being detected and blocked. What is Web Security Analytics? Akamai's new Web Security Analytics tool provides a single unified and efficient interface to assess a wide range of security events, perform analysis of events, and evaluate any needed changes in order to maintain an optimal security configuration. For example, customers can use this tool to better:</description>

	<description>On February 28, Akamai recorded a 1.35 Tbps DDoS attack against one of our customers. The attack was driven by a relatively new vector, memcached reflection. Possibly the largest publicly disclosed DDoS attack to date, the memcached attack was more than twice the size of the largest DDoS attacks that were launched against an Akamai customer by the operators of the Mirai botnet in September of 2016.</description>

	<title>Launching Forward with IPv6</title>
	<description>With the era of freely available IPv4 addresses nearing its end, I'm pleased to see that 2012 appears to be the year when the IPv6 Internet will finally reach maturity and launch into wide-scale commercial use.  For over a decade, the groundwork for the migration to version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6) has been built, with changes to operating systems, client and server software, routers, and Internet backbone networks.  To-date, however, the availability of IPv6 content and end-users has remained slim with few Web sites being available over IPv6 and with just over 0.5% of global Internet users having IPv6 connectivity that their machines will elect to use.  </description>
