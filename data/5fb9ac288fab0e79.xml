But she can’t hide for the rest of her life; they both need to get on with things.  When Ben says he doesn’t know how to, Chelsea says he could start by going back to uni.
David worries to Leonard about who now knows about Ben and Chelsea.  He doesn’t know what makes him angrier – Vince threatening Ben or that he’s made a very private matter, public knowledge.  Leonard and David agree that Jill should know before she hears it from someone else, to Ben’s chagrin.  Later Leonard says Jill took the news surprisingly well, although she was horrified by Vince’s outburst.  
Elizabeth’s furious when Chelsea reveals that Vince told the whole village that she’s had an abortion.  Elizabeth offers Chelsea some behind the scenes work, rather than having to face customers in the Orangery.  Later Vince tries to apologise to Elizabeth, but she tells him it’s Chelsea who needs the apology. Vince tells Chelsea he was angry with Ben, not her, and he hopes his actions haven’t caused her extra heartache.  Chelsea says they have.  Vince says he’s truly sorry and asks if there’s anything he can do to make it up to her, but Chelsea leaves before he can say anything more.  Elizabeth tells him he also needs to resolve things with David and Ruth. But Vince sees red at Brookfield later when David comments on the way Vince behaved. Vince withdraws his investment in the solar panels.</description><itunes:subtitle>Is someone out for revenge?</itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary>Chelsea tells Ben that when she heard what Vince said she wanted to crawl into a hole.

Lilian admits it was hard reading that Tony wished their parents would stop arguing.  It reminded her how unsafe she felt at home as a child.  When Lynda points out that she and her siblings have all made a success of their lives, Lilian agrees.  But she can’t remember if Tony ever got his wish of a guitar for Christmas.  She’ll investigate and if there’s a chance of granting Tony’s wish, then she wants to try.

They tease out the paper inside it. There’s writing on it. It’s an affecting letter from a child to Father Christmas, asking for a guitar, and for their parents to stop arguing all the time. It’s signed, but they can’t make it out. Lynda is inspired. She’ll get out all the old Christmas cards and try and match the handwriting.

Natasha bumps into Chelsea on the Green. Chelsea’s having some time away from Tracy, who’s hugging her every five minutes. Natasha finds out that Chelsea has had a termination, and she can see that she’s vulnerable. She has an idea. Thinking they need to cheer each other up, she invites Chelsea to April Cottage. She’ll do Chelsea’s makeup, and Chelsea can do her hair.
Chelsea wonders how it could have taken her so long to decide what to do. Natasha tells her she was juggling two different futures. Chelsea describes how she’s been, saying she woke up very relieved, but felt bad about that. Natasha tells her firmly that she didn’t plan to get pregnant, and she didn’t want to have a baby. Which means she made the right choice. Then she’s amazed by what Chelsea has done with her hair.

Alistair thinks Paul’s withholding of his identity as Denise’s son was deliberate, to get one over on them. Jakob disagrees; maybe it was so that he could be judged on his own merits. Later Paul does well with a sick dog, and Alistair relents. He apologises for being overly formal, and the two seem to reach concord.

She blames George. Clarrie reckons kids like George can be full of themselves but might be hiding insecurities. She takes Mia to the Stables to distract her. Mia’s not keen, but Alice shows her how well treated the horses are, and how good they are to be around. Afterwards Clarrie thanks Alice – she doesn’t know what she said to Mia but it’s really cheered her up. Alice comments Mia’s a nice kid: bright, interested and highly principled. Alice takes the opportunity to apologise to Clarrie for her behaviour at Nic’s funeral. Clarrie concedes this is hard for Alice to say, and thanks her for her effort. It means a lot that’s she’s tried.

Helen and Lee are looking after Ena the cat for Joy in return for unlimited use of her hot tub. They’ve banned the children from using it so it’s just the two of them.

When Lee talks to Mick about the hot tub, Mick explains Joy’s reaction to sell it was because Helen, Lee and the boys are like family to her and she can’t forgive herself for offending them.  When Lee says he and Helen feel terrible, Mick gets an idea. He tells Joy that Lee and Helen would love a go in the hot tub and were wondering if they could use it one evening when Mick and Joy are out.  Later Helen tells Lee she’s up for it, and reluctant Lee agrees.  Mick offers them the chance tonight, as he and Joy are out.  Later as Helen and Lee start to relax into the hot tub experience, Joy arrives home early in her swimming costume and gets in next to them.
