   <media:description>Uthman ibn Farroq  told us all he got stabbed and then reported it to the police and they took his report, the weapon and even got the fingerprints of the person. This all turned out to be a huge lie! Watch this video to see the truth about what really happened. The police confirmed that he never filed a report, there were no police called to the scene of the crime, no detectives assigned and no arrest made (as he claimed)!
