      <title>357 - Ya' Mon!</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/357</link>
      <description>In this “live from Jamaica” episode, the guys discuss how vital it is to be exposed to life-changing information and environments, staying focused on the goal, the importance of persistence in your pursuit of excellence. 


13:09 - What are you investing for? Is it to be a burden or blessing to somebody?

14:45 - “Exposure can change the way you view money.” Is your source of information contributing to or stunting your growth? 

16:12 - “The best way to prove it is to prove it.” Few people will believe in your story or journey, especially if you’re the first in your family to do so. 


20:04 - “Your level of exposure will determine your level of success.”

23:51 - “Information without the desire to use it is a recipe for failure.”


30:03 - “When you believe as a leader, that focus can be transferred to your team.”



Questions 

What culture are you trying to create?

What’s yours? Why?

What area of your life needs a faith muscle?


Takeaways

If people don’t think your dream is crazy, your dream isn’t big enough. 

Show support towards one another. It’s better to say “I don’t understand” versus saying negative remarks that can tear someone down. 

Reflect on the decisions made by others for opportunities in your life.

Have the heart to break free from bad habits and walk in greatness. 


Immerse yourself in the community, learn everything you can and put that effort to work. 


Don't worry about what others think.


Find ways to keep your hunger &amp; drive for success active. Never deviate from the path that made you successful. 


Enjoy the fruits of your labor.




Questions 

What are you indulging in that prohibits your success?

      <title>352 - 10 Virgins</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/352</link>
      <description>Picking it up where they left off last week, the guys discuss the necessity of developing patience, the value of helping people in practical ways, and putting forth the type of effort that allows you to obtain things in life for yourself. 

“One man’s obedience, disobedience, and health are connected to others people's destinies.”

10:15 - Are you healthy enough emotionally, spiritually, and financially to handle what’s coming your way? Don’t skip the steps of preparation.

17:05 - Follow what God wants you to do more than following the trends of what people want you to do. Stay true to yourself throughout the process without fearing other people's opinions. 

20:51 - “Don’t second guess yourself. Trust the decisions you’ve made to get here.” Have confidence in your ability to get the job done. Don’t be afraid of mistakes because they’re a healthy part of every journey.

40:50 - “Don’t bypass the process for people.” We don’t have the authority to help others as God helps us. Direct people to the ultimate source in God!

Takeaways
Keeping Moving Forward! Don’t let anything keep you from moving forward.

Help people help themselves instead of enabling them. Help them realize their persistence and drive in the face of their challenges is the key to their success.

Questions

What areas of your life do you need to obtain oil in?

Have you found yourself attempting to play the role of God in other people's lives?

      <title>350 - We 50 Now</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/350</link>
      <description>In this episode, the guys discuss the difference between earning, creating, elevating, and “giving” opportunities in your field of interest. The Secret To Success Mindset is also unveiled to being prepared to achieve &amp; sustain success

8:33 - “Stay ready so that when an opportunity comes, you can kill it.” - Jemal

14:05 - “There are opportunities within the opportunity.” Look for ways to improve &amp; elevate the environments you’re placed in. 

15:15 - “Opportunities aren’t about money.” Your confidence, individualism, and professionalism can grow in environments. Discern your surroundings for opportunities to grow. 

20:21 - “If you don’t know what to work on, work on yourself.” Moose

28:21 - “You can’t lose anything you’re working on.” 

31:26 - “Don’t let the present picture distort where you ultimately want to be.”

Turnaround Takeaways


If you want an opportunity, work on yourself until it presents itself. 

Hold your weight! Be specific and confident with what you do when speaking to people about opportunities. 

Giving opportunities should be mutual. Stray away from presenting one-sided ideas or opportunities. People will be more inclined to help when it benefits both parties. 


Questions
What are you doing when the opportunity has not presented itself yet? How persistent are you when working on your craft?

      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/349</link>
      <description>In this episode, Mark Edmond, Charles Alexander &amp; Jemel Lewis from the Black Bread Company share the story behind creating the first black-owned bread company amidst a global pandemic. 

“If a dream has been placed in your heart, You Owe You to see that dream to fruition!” Preorder your copy today! https://etinspires.com/you-owe-you

      <title>348 - A Happy Package</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/348</link>
      <description>Adversity will strike us all at some point in our lives. A productive mindset will prepare us to be steadfast during “troubled” times. Listen closely as the guys share their testimonies and insights on the blessings adversity can bring.

26:45 - “If you can only win during the happy and good times, it’ll be hard to win when adversity strikes.” 

27:25 - “Growth is the biggest separator of change.”

35:40 - “What you go through strengthens your faith muscle!” Don’t be premature by walking away from pressure of your current situation. There’s a lesson to be learned in those moments. James 1:2-4

Questions
Do you abandon trials in life that will elevate you to the next level?

Takeaways 
Hustle &amp; grind no matter what your current level of success.

Success does not exclude you from having problems in your life. 

Break the cycle of thinking when something bad happens, good can’t be produced from it.

      <title>347 - F***** The GPS</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/347</link>
      <description>Everyone wants to be successful until it’s time to navigate unknown and uncomfortable transitions. In this episode, the guys discuss how you can identify lessons, strengths, and resources that’ll help you break out of familiar patterns. 

10:20 - “Keep pushing through the anxiety of the unknown.”

26:45 - What process have you tried your way that hasn’t yielded the desired results? Have you tried someone else’s approach to obtain a different perspective? 

41:55 - “Don’t make the fear your focus.”

48:02 - ET breaks down the gathering of different GPS systems along the journey. 

54:08 - Anxiety can come from making your journey and destination about you. Think about the people who you’re helping along the way with your testimony. 

57:18 - Start working before people help you. People are more inclined to help when they see you putting in the effort first. 

GPS - Don’t Aimlessly Drive
1.	Know where you are going. Set the vision. 
2.	Know how long it’ll take. Understand stuff happens along the way. 
3.	Motion is not progress. 

Takeaways 
Don’t immerse yourself in two different programs with different philosophies. Pick one and stay consistent. 

When you know what you want, following blueprints will become easier. 

Take the risk!

      <title>346 - Boo-Boo Bandit</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/346</link>
      <description>Having, obtaining, and keeping leverage can promote you to new heights an experiences in your life. Listen closely as the guys discuss what true leverage is, how to work it successfully, and how to maintain it for the rest of your life. 

“If a dream has been placed in your heart, You Owe You to see that dream to fruition!” Preorder your copy today! https://etinspires.com/you-owe-you 

11:45 - “As you go up in life, your lifestyle changes.” Perspectives constantly change as your exposure goes up. Don’t shoot down someone’s views if you’ve never experienced it before. Remain positive!

16:50 - Can you produce more from your life but remain stagnant from negative thinking? Be able to recognize the difference of not being able and preferring not to attempt something.  

25:32 - “Stop letting people push their agendas on you. Stop being obedient to the views that culture &amp; systems push.”

29:45 - What have you accepted as somebody’s truth for your life? Has their views stopped you from executing the best way you can?

45:26 - “You retain leverage when you have ownership of your brand and product.”

49:34 - “Don’t abandon the responsibilities God has asked you to do.” There is a reward from God for  remaining faithful &amp; not getting weary in well doing. Money shouldn’t be a factor in whether you’ll remain faithful to God’s request for you. 

Takeaways

Can you not actually get it done, or are you not trying? 

What looks excessive to you might look minimal to other people.

Are you giving yourself a fair chance to obtain what you desire?

What do you have to do to accomplish your goal?

Don’t let people talk you out of what God gave you. All you need is one opportunity!

Leverage your relationship into future opportunities versus looking at money every time.

49:34 - “Don’t abandon the responsibilities God has asked you to do.” There is a reward from God for  remaining faithful &amp; not getting weary in well doing. Money shouldn’t be a factor in whether you’ll remain faithful to God’s request for you. 

Takeaways

Can you not actually get it done, or are you not trying? 

What looks excessive to you might look minimal to other people.

Are you giving yourself a fair chance to obtain what you desire?

What do you have to do to accomplish your goal?

Don’t let people talk you out of what God gave you. All you need is one opportunity!

Leverage your relationship into future opportunities versus looking at money every time.

      <title>345 - Washed Up</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/345</link>
      <description>In this episode; the guys discuss what leverage is and how to build it successfully. Listen closely as each member gives tangible examples to develop a winning mindset moving forward. 

31:22 - Are you executing on what you said you would accomplish? Are you holding yourself accountable to the standards you've set? 

37:30 - "Do what you're supposed to do to walk in freedom." Don't wait until a problem occurs to start executing the right way. You owe it to yourself to live successfully every day. 

39:30 - "Seek victory and not fairness." Life will deal you a hand full of out-of-control situations, and all you can do to manage that chaos is to control your focus, attitude, and actions despite everything going on around you. 

49:15 - "Don't wait for big leverage opportunities to move forward in productivity." Don't despise small beginnings in your journey. Doing things from a pure and genuine heart will never go unnoticed. 

1:00:05 - Part one teaser about spending your leverage away. "Obtained leverage comes from sacrifice."

How To Build Leverage
•	Leverage - Having something that people need. 
•	Provide a Valuable product. 
•	Being available when people inquire about your services.
•	Focusing on the value you can bring to people. 
•	Don't become comfortable when your success is obtained.

      <title>341 - The Hopers</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/341</link>
      <description>EPS 341

“If a dream has been placed in your heart, You Owe You to see that dream to fruition!”

In this episode, the guys discuss the right mindset that’s needed to obtain &amp; sustain success. They share principles about learning the process, being comfortable in dark moments of your life, and turning your hope into reality. 

“You are one process away from being the best creator you can be.”

10:45 - You may experience darkness because of your vision not matching where you’re currently. Those moments are temporary but provide great insight along the journey. Keep the vision alive and consistently work towards the goal!

20:17 - “Accept where you are but have hope to where you want to be.”

26:01 - Having hope originates from having a vision that’s constant on the mind. Putting yourself in environments to nourish your hope is vital in progressing forward.


Takeaways 

Improve your quality of life by living in the current moment of today. Enjoy the blessings that God has given you. Take time to reflect on what those blessings are. 

There are blessings in the dark moments of your life. It’s hard to understand the reason for experiencing it, but in due time it’ll  be revealed. God slows us down for our protection or growth that is needed to sustain the success at the end of your hope.

      <title>340 - Two-A-Days</title>
      <link>https://s2spodcast.com/340</link>
      <description>In this workshop &amp; self reflective episode, the guys share personal testimonies showing how to work on &amp; sustain successful relationships and marriages. They focus on taking accountability, having a vision, and having faith that doesn’t waver during tough times.

Do you get frustrated that people don’t change the way you want them to?

31:09 - “Be intentionally deliberate on making something work in your life.” 

38:43 - “Find a way to grow together with your spouse so you don’t grow apart.” Converse openly with each other &amp; address potential issues that can cause separation. 

39:15 - “It’s easier to start over than to push through tough times. Find a hunt within a hunt. Hunters look for the recession within the recession.” Create a reason to keep going when environments around you encourage ceasing progress. 

53:15 - Apoc Sermon reference link. https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apoc-ministry/id1448489948?i=1000568628189 

1:05:32 - “Look in the mirror and realize what you have to change to start living the life you desire.” You can’t demand change from others when you aren’t willing to. Work to become whole in all areas of your life. 

1:09:13 - Are you and your spouse on one accord with the vision that’s provided? The clearer the vision, the more fluent an effectively you can move forward as one. 


Turnaround Takeaways

Don’t let insecure tendencies ruin what you have in front of you. 

Keep God in the plans he has given you when storms approach. He will see you through it successfully.

      <title>339 - Big Brother Tip-Toe</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/339</link>
      <description>In this episode, the guys discuss how going against the grain is necessary for success despite what the community, culture or the closest people to you have contradicting opinions or perspectives about it. 

28:10 - Are you willing to go against people you respect opinions to be more of what God called you to be? 

30:38 - “Celebration doesn’t happen until the vision is fulfilled. You don’t become until you go against the grain.” 

33:28 - Has your thinking shifted to peoples perspective of your journey?

38:26 - If people shut down your thoughts, that’s an indicator to stop sharing news or look for different circles to be around. Who you hang with on a daily basis will become a direct result of failure or success. 

50:28 - “Stick with your vision.” Stay with people who support and speak life into your dreams. Sometimes that comes from people you least expect it that will help you sustain the right mindset to success. 

1:00:33 - Plunge into your success! Saying you’ll fail before executing an opportunity gives reasons to live with excuses. Don’t be afraid to look crazy going after the life you want to obtain! Every great will convey they went through the same process. You can’t lose something if you don’t risk nothing.”

Takeaways 

Who in your life is limiting you? Family, friends, mentors or coaches?

You can dream and visualize more than what your mentors have previously done. Don’t become discouraged if they make comments regarding the success you can achieve. That is the moment you must lock in on your vision even more to avoid regressing along the journey.

      <title>337 - Don’t Spend Your Freedom</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/337</link>
      <description>The decisions you make today shapes your current situation, future, &amp; other peoples destiny that are directly connected to you. Making good decisions comes at a cost of sacrificing your wants in order to fulfill the needs of the goal. While making bad decisions births consequences that can prolong the process. Listen closely as the guys discuss the mindset, clarity, and focus level needed to obtain &amp; sustain success.

      <title>336 - A Good Biscuit </title>
      <description>People often want you to be involved with the bad decisions that they make consistently. Immersing yourself in their way of thinking can ultimately diminish your future. In this episode, the guys talk about making decisions to sustain the heights of success from making good decisions. 

18:41 - “Don’t ever think something is to big or small to pray about. Don’t play Gods role trying to dictate what he will or won’t do.”

34:12 - “You made decisions that will not support growth in your personal or financial statues.” Jemal explains that making bad decisions will lead to more bad opportunities. We have the power of choice to make great decisions. If you’re struggling to do so, surround yourself with people who produce in their life. 

43:12 - “Can’t be sympathetic towards others who want your blessings but not the system to help the situation their in.” It can be challenging not feeling guilty about  helping people who need it. Fight the feelings of unfortunateness for it can hold you back from reaching greatness. 

Takeaways

You attract people who make good decisions when your consistent in making them. 

More good than bad opportunities avail themselves personally &amp; financially when you focus more. 

Just because something is given to you, the work still needs to be done to be successful. If someone blesses you with an opportunity to grow personally or financially, don’t take it for granted.

      <title>335 - The Dopamine Hit</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/335</link>
      <description>The guys pick up from last week's episode on making decisions. They continue to provide more insight into keeping your desires from overriding excellence, effectiveness, and quality in your execution.

“You can do things that are not right and not feel good doing so.”

19:30 - “Don’t skip over doing the real work that will bring success to you.” Cj emphasizes there are no shortcuts on the way to sustainable success.

34:47 - Are you engaging in activities that could tear down what you’ve built up? The more work you put into your craft, family, or self-development, the more costly consequences will be when mistakes are made.

58:01 - “Find a healthy way to receive dopamine.” There are healthy alternatives to receiving those feelings that aren’t destructive to your body or mind.

Discussion Questions
    1.   What’s your primary reason for making better decisions for your life?
    2.   Pray to overcome the strength of desires. Having a sinful nature is costly. Not addressing it and doing what it takes to make better life choices directly affect others connected to you.
    3.   Do you give up the practical for what’s desired in the current moment?

      <title>332 - The Warranty</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/332</link>
      <description>Responsibility and accountability are the two front runners that breed success. It can become easy to lose sight of that and only want the end goal in a capitalistic world. In this episode, the guys discuss the reality of taking responsibility and how that fuels financial, health, and relationship success. 

18:56 - Don’t focus on the money; focus on the responsibilities needed to make money. Responsibility sustains your ability to be successful. 

29:20 - How willing are you to critique your work? Are you brave enough to assess what needs improvement in your life? Faith, fitness, health, &amp; relationships?

Takeaways

Pray in times when needed. Pray for maturity and growth, whether for yourself or someone you love. 

Being around people that execute at a high level can naturally attract you to their habits.

      <itunes:summary>Responsibility and accountability are the two front runners that breed success. It can become easy to lose sight of that and only want the end goal in a capitalistic world. In this episode, the guys discuss the reality of taking responsibility and how that fuels financial, health, and relationship success. 

18:56 - Don’t focus on the money; focus on the responsibilities needed to make money. Responsibility sustains your ability to be successful. 

29:20 - How willing are you to critique your work? Are you brave enough to assess what needs improvement in your life? Faith, fitness, health, &amp; relationships?

Takeaways

Pray in times when needed. Pray for maturity and growth, whether for yourself or someone you love. 

Being around people that execute at a high level can naturally attract you to their habits.

      <title>324 - Executionism</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/324</link>
      <description>In this episode, the guys alongside Jemal “The 9 To 5 King Millionaire” and guest Samantha Lorey, discuss the importance of execution while providing how God favors you because of it. Listen carefully to how Jemal breaks down his work ethic on his dream while working his other unfulfilling job. 

“It’s not always going to be like that. Execution breeds favoritism. God shows favor when you execute an indulge in obedience.”

22:53 - The mindset is imperative in the vision you broadcast to yourself. You may not be there physically yet, but with consistent actions the goal will be reached. Patience and Trust are needed along the way. 

36:33 - Jemal talks about having a long term execution plan for your life. Examine where you want to be 5 years from now, then develop a strategy to get there. Quick success does not mean sustained success. Build your endurance up so that you will lack nothing. James 1:4

39:54 - “Doing what you love gives you energy.” - ET

47:25 - “Excellence doesn’t have an age on it.” Don’t count yourself out from an age perspective. If you can produce at a high level, your gift will make room you regardless of age. 

55:44 - Find time in your schedule where you can separate yourself from others. Success is for everyone &amp; is built over time, not overnight. 

Three Things Needed For Successful Planning

Have a Vision. 

Count your blessings. 

Look at your current situations in a positive way.

      <title>322 - Undesirable</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/322</link>
      <description>In this episode, the guys alongside Jemal “The 9 To 5 King Millionaire”, discuss the dangers of listening to opinions from people who offer no value to you or where you’re desiring to be for the future.

Intro - The guys talk about childhood and current celebrity admirations. Which celebrity would leave you shell shocked if you were to meet them?

26:06 - Do the people you interact with have enough value to keep in contact with them? Evaluate how you feel when you converse or are around certain people. That will dictate how you should move forward. 

33:12 - “Don’t put too much stock into peoples opinion. It can cause you to be stagnant and have constant worry about how someone views you personally.” - ET

38:13 - Do you value the opinions and values from the people around you? 

42:15 - “Everybody has an opinion but that doesn’t mean it’s law or factual. When you come up with a plan for your own life, nobody else sees that plan and vision. If you don’t now ego you are, you’ll find yourself trying to find your keel in their opinions.” - Jemal 

49:09 - Do you value conformation over correction?  - CJ

      <title>321 - Karl vs Mal</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/321</link>
      <description>In this episode, the guys alongside Jemal “The 9 To 5 King Millionaire”, discuss the mindset , information, &amp; decision making tactics that teach you how to manage and make money consistently. 

The financial position you’re in may not be favorable,  but that doesn’t give reasons to splurge uncontrollably. There’s no excuse for not getting educated to make healthier decisions with managing money. 

36:11 - Jemal stresses the importance of living your life when budgeting your current expenses. Having a healthy balance is vital to living a good one. Find a system that works for situation and stick to it. 

43:40 - Your spending habits should not reflect what others will think about you. Instead it should reflect what’s important to you &amp; what needs to be done. The biblical story of Joseph is a prime example putting away parts of your money. Diligence and mindfulness are keys to growing,saving, and managing your money. 

50:25 - “Are you spending money loosely? Or does it have value behind it?” -Jemal

56:50 - What system do you have in place to live life while having the vision to go where you want to be? 

1:14:38 - “Sacrifice the thought process you currently have about money to learn the system about gaining money.” -ET

      <title>310 - Man Power</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/310</link>
      <description>"Life will be a lot better if you executed instead of tried."
﻿In this episode, the guys alongside Jemal, the 9to5 Millionaire, discuss not giving all of your energy and time into things or people that don't, in some way, benefit you.

3:02 - Dubai recap experience. 

22:05 - Don't throw your pearls before swine. Not everyone will understand or appreciate your story.

31:50 - Focus mode. Remain focused, and don't let anything make you lose track of your purpose. Distractions are just that. Side-step them and keep moving forward.

35:02 - The quality of the company you keep is important. Just because you have a shared background with someone is no reason to hang around people that aren't getting the job done. Spend time with people who are driven to succeed and can help you develop that same drive to reach your fullest potential.

40:40 - Just show up. Being in the right place at the right time and in the right spirit is an invaluable experience. Always go where you're celebrated.

47:24 - Put some respect on your circle and never force your way in anywhere. Take the hint. Learn the language and build your own environment.

54:25- Make sure what you do moves the needle toward positive development and supports a healthy, thriving environment for yourself and your family.

      <title>309 - Du-Bye</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/309</link>
      <description>In this episode, the guys talk about how Executing to the fullest can change based upon the exposure you've received. Be aware of the moments you're in and what can be learned while experiencing those moments.

2:08- Are mashed potatoes considered good food? Join the Great Mashed Potato Debate of 2021 as the guys discuss the importance of prioritizing family time and "acceptable" Thanksgiving meal items.

30:28- Mindset or Environment? Which one dictates your behavior? Your mentality, how you think about everything is important no matter where you are. Embrace the space you're in and get all the exposure you can but, never let your environment overrule your mindset.

35:17- Recap of experiences had while on vacation in Dubai. 

37:05- Connect with execution. Seeing how people/companies execute at differing levels can have a positive effect on your mindset. It can genuinely change how you execute personally and professionally in the future. Always demand excellence from yourself and those around you. Never settle. 

39:15- "if you're going to do something, go get the full experience from it." Value your family to the fullest. How much you value them is a driving factor for excellence in personal execution. Take ownership and leadership in that area.

      <title>304 - Stray Dogs</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/304</link>
      <description>"Entrepreneurship is filling the void in the marketplace that the marketplace is calling for consciously or subconsciously. Entrepreneurs look and listen to what is happening in the marketplace and they respond. They also look and listen to what's not happening in the marketplace and they respond as well."
These are the words and entrepreneurial philosophy of entrepreneur, radio host, speaker, and owner of The Breakfast Klub, Marcus Davis. Marcus is the epitome of what African-American entrepreneurship can and should look like. Marcus candidly shares his journey toward 20 years of sustained business. Marcus had a vision of being an example of what African-American restaurants can do in the marketplace and he is killing the game. Listen intently, take notes, and be inspired to take your entrepreneurial goals to the next level.

      <title>303 - Blow it up</title>
      <link>https://www.s2spodcast.com/303</link>
      <description>Blow It Up
Each one of us has a mission in life and we spend time meticulously constructing a plan to fulfill this mission. However, did you know that it's highly likely for our plans to fail? In this episode, the guys talk about the importance of focusing on the mission and never losing sight of it even if our plans fail.
“There is the mission and then there’s the plan. Many of us get paralyzed because we focus on the plan. The plan paralyzes you. The mission moves you. The mission has momentum. As long as you are about the mission, you will keep moving forward whether or not the plans change.”

      <description>Do you know what you are capable of? You likely know what you are capable of but you tend to focus on what could go wrong. Instead, you need to focus on what is going to go right when you do what you are supposed to do because you are capable of doing it. Stop overthinking!

      <title>300 - The 120 Experience</title>
      <link>https://s2spodcast.com/</link>
      <description>It’s episode 300!!!! Can you believe it? Our 120 LIVE podcast episode is our 300th episode! As we reflect on the last 5 and half years, we want to thank each of our listeners for rocking with us each week. You guys have been with us not only through the evolution of S2S, but also through the ups and downs of our personal and professional lives. Thank you so much!

In this 120 LIVE episode, the guys discuss how it’s impossible to grow in your comfort zone. We only make moves when we are uncomfortable. Many of us are not growing because we are comfortable in our current situations. In order to get to the next level, you have to be okay with feeling uncomfortable. Success is the greatest enemy to success. Feeling as if you have arrived is a dangerous place to be because it leads to complacency and decline. Always seek to grow, push yourself, identify blindspots, and learn something new.

      <title>299 - The Wrong Tribe</title>
      <link>https://s2spodcast.com/</link>
      <description>Do you mismanage what has been given to you or do you take your time and money and give it to individuals that are not good stewards of what has been given to them? In this episode, the guys share candidly that in order to get to the next level of success, you have to be willing to do some things differently. You can’t get anywhere new if you don’t do something new and sometimes that means divorcing yourself from things and people that are holding you back.

      <title>293 - Artificial Confidence</title>
      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/293-artificial-confidence</link>
      <description>Do you consider yourself to be a confident person? In this episode, the guys discuss how to differentiate between natural and artificial confidence. True confidence comes from knowing who you are (your traits) and whose you are (a child of a loving God). Once you are confident in who you are in the spirit realm and you can activate that confidence in your daily life. When you depend on people liking what you have or getting caught up on what they say, you shift to operating with artificial confidence. Your confidence must always come from within.

Thriving in life and being successful is more than just your business or your career. You can’t execute to your greatest potential if you’re sick, unhealthy, and tired.

      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/284-karate-karl</link>
      <description>Do you see the value in every opportunity that comes into your life, even if it's not something that was expected or even desired? Do you complain about where you are in life and then not explore the opportunities are presented to you that could possibly begin the process of moving you toward the life you want because they aren't quite what you were hoping for? 
 In this episode, the guys discuss respecting unexpected  opportunities and speaking well of them even if they’re not the ones you want. You never know; maybe this opportunity can be the bridge or stepping stone to the  one you want. Like the Good Book says, "Despise not small beginnings."

      <description>Are you a producer or a consumer? In this episode, the guys discuss what it means to have a “Producing” mindset vs. A “Consuming” mindset. The reality is that in order to be successful, you have to produce more than you consume. Jemal shared that “The real value in life is the unseen work being done,” while ET added that “You take the rich (resources) that are around you, and produce wealth with them.” This episode really shows the value of putting in the work, because producing equals longevity.</description>

      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/273-man-on-fire</link>
      <description>Do you believe favor and favoritism have a place in the workplace? In this episode, the guys discuss favoritism in the workplace and what that really means. When you produce, execute, and don't need to be "managed" at work, favoritism naturally occurs. When execution is worshipped, those who regularly execute at the highest levels become the "favorites" by default. If you're not a "work favorite," there's probably a reason why.

      <title>270 - 17,500</title>
      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/270-17500</link>
      <description>In this episode, the guys, alongside guest motivational speaker Inky Johnson, discuss how to change the preset narratives about race &amp; money by operating in facts versus feelings. When it comes to past events, it's essential to have accurate information that promotes a genuine reaction rather than reacting the way someone thinks you should. We should always seek to work and move on principle, never emotion. We should value facts over feelings, always.

      <title>269 - Moaning and Groaning</title>
      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/269-moaning-and-groaning</link>
      <description>As you go through your life's journey, you will be presented with opportunities to work with, invest in, and support others. It is a Biblical standard for you to teach others what you know. However, there is a right way and a wrong way to share your knowledge and wisdom with others.
 In this episode, the guys discuss how to be strategic in providing information to others while planting the seeds, allowing you to control your life. They share words of wisdom and caution such as:
  Don't throw pearls before swine. By all means, help people develop but, don't just give stuff away. People respect what they have to earn. When they don't earn it, they don't value it as much.
 Make sure when you're negotiating with others that the outcome is win-win.

      <description>As we embark on the New Year, the guys take some time to wrestle with an internal crisis that many of us struggle with at one time or another. There are some situations that warrant having crazy faith. This is where you believe in a positive or promised end, that is not currently visible. This standpoint is contrasted with circumstances in which you are so blinded by what you want, that you are unable to see it for what it is, despite all the contextual clues. </description>

This one is real, raw, and gives you a much-needed dose of reality to embrace the urgency of this moment and do what it takes to execute on the commitments you've made to better yourself, your family, and your community.]]>

      <title>253 - Sight Fight</title>
      <link>http://hyperurl.co/cbsqx8</link>
      <description>CJ is heated. That's how Karl and ET describe the seriousness of today's topic. Many aspiring entrepreneurs look for guidance and assistance while building their dreams. But on today's podcast, CJ talks about the people who put their success and dreams into others' hands. Do we need coaches to guide us..yes? Do we need people to bounce ideas off of..sure? But CJ's frustration boils over when people depend on others to make things happen. ET, Jemal, and Karl chime in and discuss how and why people create this false expectation when they're in close quarters with successful people.
 The Secret to Success Topics:
  [03:29] - Trey’s Comedy Corner
 [08:44] - You Can’t See
 [17:45] - CJ Heated
 [25:00] - Ideas
 [40:00] - Emotional Wiring

      <link>http://hyperurl.co/cbsqx8</link>
      <description>Please go and get a pen and pad!  You need to copy and remember every word ET starts this podcast with as he explains his frustration with contradictions. The contradictions of people who say they want success, they’re in the right place to obtain success, have every opportunity to make it happen, but they don’t want to do it what it takes. ET is convinced that the core problem with people who aren’t where they want to be is because they continue to contradict themselves. CJ, Karl, and Jemal chime in, and all the guys self-assess to see where and if they’re contradicting themselves in any area of life.

      <title>251 - Capture The Flag</title>
      <link>http://hyperurl.co/cbsqx8</link>
      <description>Just like on ZOOM calls and face time all across the country, the Lebron discussion is still going on in today’s podcast. With his most recent championship win with the Lakers, the BIG debate has been where Lebron ranks with the well-established GOATS of basketball. Today, ET and the guys talk about how Lebron has captured and planted his flag and, comparatively, how the guys are planting their flags. Naturally, the question to you, the listening/watching audience, is, ”are you planting your flag?”  if you’ve tuned in for at least one of our earlier podcasts, you already know the guys are BIG on self-assessment. Today’s episode will put that ball squarely in your court, again.
 The Secret to Success Topics:
  [06:00] - Break The Bank
 [11:00] - Fair or Foul
 [19:00] - Back to Lebron
 [31:00] - It’s Personal
 [46:00] - The Hardest Championship
 [58:00] - Numbers Don’t Lie

      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/250-the-story-of-a-king</link>
      <description>Do you find yourself always giving out discounts to keep or attract new clients? When explaining your services to a prospective client, do you become nervous about sharing your services' costs because you're afraid of their response? Today on the podcast, the guys talk about how to get over the pricing hump and charge what you're worth. At the beginning of E's career, he wasn't getting 5-6 figures a speech. So,  there were a few things the guys did to get him there. 
 For today's listeners battling pricing concerns and apprehensions, do you think your anxiety has more to do with self-esteem or, is it a quality of work issue, i.e., you don't believe you're worth what you're asking?  How do you stop giving discounts and stick to your price? The guys dig deep and answer these questions for the entrepreneur who's good at what they do but always finds themselves shrinking to please the customer
 The Secret to Success Topics:
  [06:32] - Be Like Mike
 [12:28] - Things Happen
 [17:54] - Discount Double Check

      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/249-common-law-engagement</link>
      <description>This week on the podcast, the guys continue discussing accountability versus bullying and the very fine line between them. The guys go back to when they started to work together and discuss how their relationships and roles developed over the years. In those early days, their relationships were different and, so were the levels of accountability between them. But, once the vision became clear, the levels of accountability clearly shifted. How did ET deal with it? Was it bullying at the beginning? The guys tell all as they reflect on where they started, where they are and, how they got there.  The Secret to Success Topics:
  [05:41] - Trey’s Comedy Corner
 [10:23] - Karl’s Story
 [20:53] - It’s Not Easy
 [30:00] - The 1st
 [41:00] - During COVID
 [52:00] - Creating Wealth
 [1:02:00] - Reapply

      <title>248 - Emergency Wedding</title>
      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/248-emergency-wedding</link>
      <description>Accountability versus bullying. Two terms that most people don't use in the same sentence. Accountability is the obligation to explain, justify, and take responsibility for one's actions. Bullying is someone who intimidates or selfishly coerces people into doing things they don't want to do. Earlier this week, ET discovered that many people live a "bullied life," they've been coerced into, and they're confusing it for accountability. If you're not happy with your life and you find yourself saying yes when you want to say no, then you may be getting bullied. On today's podcast, the guys breakdown the following:
  When is it okay for someone to hold you accountable? 
 When does accountability turn into bullying?
 How do you even know when someone is bullying you as an adult? 
  Grab your pen and pad; this is an episode all adults can relate to.
 The Secret to Success Topics:
  [05:00] - Lebron James
 [23:00] - Bullying
 [31:00] - It’s Dangerous
 [41:00] - Afraid To Be Wrong
 [51:27] - The Game
 [1:10:00] - You Can’t Dictate
  The Secrets to Success:
  You’re afraid to say yes to yourself.
 If you don’t make a decision the bully will make a decision for you.

Today's Podcast begins with ET admitting that he's had to lower expectations for people because, from his experience,  people want the rewards without putting in the work. People will say they want things with their mouths, but their work ethic and efforts speak differently. After today's Podcast,  take some time to evaluate your life's expectations and ask yourself if your expectations match your efforts.

After today's Podcast,  take some time to evaluate your life's expectations and ask yourself if your expectations match your efforts.</p> <p>The Secret to Success Topics:</p> <ul> <li>[04:30] - Trey’s Comedy Corner</li> <li>[10:49] - Karl in Cali</li> <li>[18:42] - Tik Tok Night</li> <li>[26:17] - Strawberry or Grape</li> <li>[30:05] - Expectations</li> <li>[44:09] - Clinging</li> <li>[1:08:00] - Do Something Different</li> </ul> <p>Listener Perks:</p> <ul> <li>Make Real Estate Real <a href="http://www.makerealestatereal.com/">www.makerealestatereal.com</a>

      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/240-the-deep-end</link>
      <description>When someone is drowning, is that the best time to teach them how to swim? On today’s podcast, the guys talk about the unique position you’re in when you’re the ”go-to” person in your family. You’re the one that everyone calls when they’re in a bind or when they need money. How do you determine when you’re truly helping someone versus hurting them? How do you determine how much to give and how often to give? When are you helping versus enabling? The guys review and explain their process of helping those who are truly in need vs. letting others dig themselves out of holes they continue to dig for themselves.

      <description>One thing that the guys feel strongly about is healthy relationships. It Doesn't matter if it's friends, family, or business; interpersonal relationships play a big part in each of the guy's daily lives. On today's podcast, CJ starts the conversation off talking about two good friends who are at odds with each other, and he's found himself in the middle. From the outside looking in, he realizes both parties are highlighting the other's faults that they could each clearly see before the beef kicked off and chose to say nothing about. Now, because they're fighting one another, those problems have taken center stage.   Have you ever had a situation where you were at odds with someone and didn't know how to fix it? ET and the guys give practical advice on keeping and sustaining healthy relationships in all areas of your life.

      <title>236 - Pass The Joystick</title>
      <link>http://hyperurl.co/cbsqx8</link>
      <description>Self-discipline is a much more reliable predictor of one’s future success than an IQ score. There are a lot of smart people. They score highly on tests, their comprehension is off the charts, and they always do well in school. But there aren’t a lot of disciplined people. They can’t make or keep commitments; they allow things to distract them when they need to be doing something else. Most importantly, that inability to discipline themselves keeps them from accomplishing their dreams and goals. This week, the guys break down how your approach to self-discipline is the anchor that either keeps you tethered to or away from living the life you’ve always wanted.
 The Secret to Success Topics:
  [08:08] - Don’t Ask My Opinion
 [12:07] - ET &amp; The NBA
 [17:40] - Fight For Your Spot
 [30:50] - Which One?
 [41:00] - Worship The Commitment
 [1:00:00] - The Reminder
  The Secrets 2 Success:
  Self discipline is a much stronger predictor of one’s future success than IQ.
 When you’re average when the resources run low you’re the first to go.
 When times get tough you have to be in producer mode not consumer mode.
 The true dog is not letting yourself stay in the same spot.
 Find your triggers of things that get you undisciplined.
  Listener Perks:
  Organifi is giving our listeners 20% off of their order just go to www.organifi.com/success. Their superfood green juice powder allows you to get your greens anytime anywhere while on the go.

      <title>235 - Two Kittens</title>
      <link>http://hyperurl.co/cbsqx8</link>
      <description>Have you ever hired a coach or taken advice from someone you trusted and didn't get the results you wanted? You did everything they told you to do; you took the course, read the book, yet you're still in the same place. On today's podcast, the guys talk about what it takes to get real sustained, permanent change in your life—a change in behavior, and your mindset will lead to the results you want.
 The Secret to Success Topics:
  [04:00] - Trey’s Comedy Corner
 [07:00] - West Coast E
 [23:30] - Results
 [30:40] - The Big Gig
 [40:00] - Perspective Shift
 [51:28] - Guard The Mind
 [1:13:00] - Windows Closing
  The Secrets 2 Success:
  You can’t talk yourself into something you behaved yourself into.
 Talking doesn’t change it, you have to work on your behavior.
 Change your perspective on things so you can do them better.
 It’s not who you are that holds you back, it's who you think you’re not.
  Listener Perks:
  Organifi is giving our listeners 20% off of their order just go to www.organifi.com/success. Their superfood green juice powder allows you to get your greens anytime anywhere while on the go.

      <description>One of ET's favorite quotes and one he lives by is, "Where your focus goes, your energy flows." On today's podcast, CJ plays a clip of a viral ET moment where E calls out multiple excuses given for why he can't be successful. These excuses are all based on emotion instead of rational thought. Right now, across the country and the world, emotions are running higher than usual and, given current events, this is understandable and, expected. But, we know from experience that decisions and actions taken based on emotion instead of facts and principles don't always give us the outcomes we've sought. Today, ET and the guys offer tangible, strategic steps to creating real and, sustainable change whose roots are anchored in facts, not feelings.

      <description>Last week's podcast was heavy, with the guys being painfully transparent about their experiences with racism. This week the conversation focuses on solutions with honorary 5th member of the podcast squad, Josh Hatch, joining the discussion.  What are the next steps to educating White people on the realities of systemic racism? How do we make permanent changes in the hearts and minds of the people that will shut down systemic racism and allow equity for everyone? The American Dream should be available to everyone, regardless of skin color, and today, we're going to look at building the blocks to make that happen.

      <title>231 - Pick A Side</title>
      <link>http://hyperurl.co/cbsqx8</link>
      <description>Today's Podcast is being released during one of the most tumultuous and tragic periods in our country's recent history. The past several weeks have seen the murders of innocent Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement-Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.  And, the revelation that earlier this year, Ahmaud Arbery, a young Black man out for a run in rural Georgia, had been hunted down and murdered by a band of emboldened and empowered racists. His crime, jogging in a neighborhood they felt he had no business.     In the face of these excruciating losses, and after hearing the same bigoted arguments made in justification of their deaths,  our country and, the world screamed in unison, "ENOUGH!"  We've all had enough. We're fed up with Bigotry, fed up with our communities being underserved and underrepresented and blamed for the ills that lack of support has nurtured, fed up with institutionalized, systemic racism, fed up with blatant in your face racism, inequality and injustice.   Collectively, we are tired.    Sadly, but not surprisingly, each of the guys has experienced racism and knows it's as American as Apple Pie and Baseball. Today, they've brought their perspectives and experiences to the Podcast. Jemal King, a former police officer, CJ, a bi-racial man, Karl, a native of Barbados, and ET, who grew up in the inner cities of Chicago and Detroit, who's seen it all. Rich or poor, educated or not, racism considers none of that. It discriminates equally and plays itself out in the daily lives of people of color worldwide. Today's Podcast will shed some light on what that continues to look like for this fantastic foursome.     The Secret to Success Topics:   [01:45] - Trey’s Comedy Corner
 [07:21] - George Floyd 
 [14:00] - Forever Ago
 [28:00] - It Ain’t For Them
 [40:00] - Walk With Us
 [48:25] - As A Officer
 [1:03:00] - The Disconnect
 [1:20:00] - Where Do You Stand?

      <itunes:summary>Today's Podcast is being released during one of the most tumultuous and tragic periods in our country's recent history. The past several weeks have seen the murders of innocent Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement-Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.  And, the revelation that earlier this year, Ahmaud Arbery, a young Black man out for a run in rural Georgia, had been hunted down and murdered by a band of emboldened and empowered racists. His crime, jogging in a neighborhood they felt he had no business.     In the face of these excruciating losses, and after hearing the same bigoted arguments made in justification of their deaths,  our country and, the world screamed in unison, "ENOUGH!"  We've all had enough. We're fed up with Bigotry, fed up with our communities being underserved and underrepresented and blamed for the ills that lack of support has nurtured, fed up with institutionalized, systemic racism, fed up with blatant in your face racism, inequality and injustice.   Collectively, we are tired.    Sadly, but not surprisingly, each of the guys has experienced racism and knows it's as American as Apple Pie and Baseball. Today, they've brought their perspectives and experiences to the Podcast. Jemal King, a former police officer, CJ, a bi-racial man, Karl, a native of Barbados, and ET, who grew up in the inner cities of Chicago and Detroit, who's seen it all. Rich or poor, educated or not, racism considers none of that. It discriminates equally and plays itself out in the daily lives of people of color worldwide. Today's Podcast will shed some light on what that continues to look like for this fantastic foursome.     The Secret to Success Topics:   [01:45] - Trey’s Comedy Corner

      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/230-youve-got-mail</link>
      <description>The topic of money is one that most people shy away from. Like, politics,  religion, and sex,  money is a subject so taboo it's never to be discussed casually, among strangers or, at Holiday, family functions. At least that's what we've always heard.  On today's podcast, ET recalls a segment from a recent 1% Conference, where he told attendees to change the way they think about money. Did you know that there are 10 myths about money that are keeping people from being wealthy and prosperous? It's true. Today,  ET tears down a few of these myths and shows how holding onto these limiting beliefs about money is holding you back from living your best life.

      <description>Problem-solving is the process of finding solutions to difficult or complex issues. In today's podcast, the guys talk about two types of individuals—there's the one who wants to solve the problem when it arises, and then there's the one who avoids solving the problem but finds time to blame others, and vent to anyone who will listen. ET breaks down how to go from being the complainer to the solver through understanding and applying the principle of FACTS over FEELINGS.

ET ties it all together at the close by focusing on how MJ's Vocabulary set him apart. Words are important. The words we say, we hear and, we manifest our realities through the houses we build with the words we choose. Developing and using a great vocabulary is one of the foundational pillars you'll need to become truly great.

  Secrets 2 Success:
  I’m not afraid to fail but I am afraid to NOT try.
 If people talk to you in a way that makes you feel defeated you need to remove yourself.
 Great people have a very distinct vocabulary.
 The next level of success is moving past what you’re physically capable of doing.
 Stop speaking death and doubt into your life.

 If people talk to you in a way that makes you feel defeated you need to remove yourself.
 Great people have a very distinct vocabulary.
 The next level of success is moving past what you’re physically capable of doing.

        <![CDATA[<p>As the Michael Jordan Documentary, <em>The Last Dance</em>, continues, the guys continue digging deeper into the Winner's Mentality of Michael Jordan. This week the guys each focus on a moment in the documentary that blew them away. Karl speaks on Mike's drive, Jemal is intrigued by Mike's fearlessness, never being afraid to fail and always ready to try. ET ties it all together at the close by focusing on how MJ's Vocabulary set him apart. Words are important. The words we say, we hear and, we manifest our realities through the houses we build with the words we choose. Developing and using a great vocabulary is one of the foundational pillars you'll need to become truly great.</p> <p>The Secret to Success Topics:</p> <ul> <li>[05:00] - Trey’s Comedy Corner</li> <li>[7:00] - Drums over Flats</li> <li>[17:20] - Drive vs Dad</li> <li>[25:40] - What Do You Say?</li> <li>[40:00] - The Difference </li> <li>[51:00] - The Edge </li> <li>[1:02:20] - Real Help</li> </ul> <p>Listener Perks:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://makerealestatereal.com/letsgo">Make Real Estate Real Course</a></li> <li>Organifi is giving our listeners <strong>20% off</strong> of their order just go to <a href="http://www.organifi.com/success">www.organifi.com/success</a>.

      <title>227 - Load Management</title>
      <link>http://hyperurl.co/cbsqx8</link>
      <description>You're not winning because you're not carrying your load correctly! Effective load management is the difference maker between success and failure in both business and private life. These statements set the tone for today's podcast. Many of you want to be successful, and a part of the 1%, but you're holding yourselves back by carrying a load that's not yours to carry or,  carrying what is yours, incorrectly. Some of that weight looks like the opinions of parents, siblings, and others who have everything to say about how and what you're doing but aren't doing any of the work.  The most critical step to take in effective load management is ignoring the comments and opinions of those whose opinions don't matter. If you're wondering whose opinions "don't matter," and why, here's a clue; if they aren't pulling alongside you, grinding it out with you day in and day out, their opinions don't matter. Period.  This week, ET breaks down the three things you're doing that are standing in the way of your success.  Effective Load management is the name of the game, and the guys break down what that looks like while offering great insights on how to identify your load limits and apply effective load management in your life and business immediately. 
 The Secret to Success Topics:
  [03:48] - Trey’s Comedy Corner
 [10:14] - Fair or Foul
 [19:30] - Load Management
 [30:25] - Doing Too Much
 [43:20] - I Don’t Care
 [1:05:45] - Ask ET

  Secrets 2 Success:
  You’re not winning because you don’t have load management.
 You will never be successful if you care TOO much about what others think.
 You have too much on your mind and it’s preventing you from executing.
 When you learn to do one thing well all the other things will come.
 Do what you can do and don’t worry about what you can’t do.
 If you want my help then help me build the wall.

      <title>225 - One Pack, One Goal</title>
      <link>http://hyperurl.co/cbsqx8</link>
      <description>Last week the guys took a moment to watch the first installment of "The Last Dance," A documentary focusing on not just the final season but the length and breadth of Michael Jordan's professional basketball career. The guys agreed that although Jordan made it all look so easy and effortless,  the levels of adversity, personal trauma, and pain he endured WHILE killing the game was unbelievable. Life happens, and if you didn't know it before COVID-19 straight stopped the entire world in its tracks, you certainly know it now.  As the podcast continues, they transition from discussing MJ to discussing the importance of having and maintaining provisions. For those who don't know, provisions are things we stock up on in preparation for times like these, namely, canned goods and other non-perishable items. Essentially, provisions are things that will keep you alive. Like all of you, each of the guys has had a crisis period where they relied on their emotional, spiritual and physical "provisions" to get through the doubt, the pain, and REAL life-altering adversity each one faced. The provisions they stocked up on allowed them to emerge on the other side, better than when they went in. They'll share these stories and more on today's Secret to Success Podcast. The Secret to Success Topics:
  [03:47] - Trey’s Comedy Corner
 [14:05] - The Last Dance
 [26:20] - Execute
 [35:03] - No Wiggle Room
 [42:26] - Her Check to Her Check
 [54:00] - PTSD
 [1:07:00] - The Feds
 [1:18:20] - Scared
 [1:32:00] - Control

  Secrets 2 Success:
  Mike had an off and on switch and he never turned it off.
 Executing is at an all time for people who execute, it’s at an all time low for those who don’t.
 You got dreams in one corner and COVID in another corner, don’t let COVID win.
 MJ was confident in the game because of what he did BEFORE the game.
 Stop cutting it off and cutting it on.

      <description>Who's your Mattie Moss Clark? Dr. Mattie Moss Clark was the mother and motivation behind the birth and success of the iconic Gospel Group, The Clark Sisters. ET had a chance to watch the biopic and was inspired by Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who pushed her girls to greatness in an industry that's full of excellence that doesn't always rise to the top.  While studying Dr. Clark's moves and directions, he realized that to be successful at the levels most think they want to be, most people need a Dr. Mattie Moss Clark driving them toward their full potential. Can you push yourself to greatness? Or, do you get upset when other people push you? On today's podcast, the guys discuss how being pushed for the right reasons, and by the right person can lead to outstanding success! The Secret to Success Topics:
  [02:51] - Trey’s Comedy Corner
 [08:40] - Pushed Hard

      <description>Cause and effect. When you do something it has an effect on something else. The other side is when you don’t do something it still affects something. Last week CJ talked about the difficulties of not having the same routine that he’s had over the last few years. Because he hasn’t had the same routine it was affecting how he went about his day. Today he starts the conversation with somewhat of an epiphany and how although he’s not able to have his normal routine, he still has an opportunity to fix his gaps and increase his strengths. ET rounds out the conversation on what you can do to regain your confidence and how to take advantage of this time instead of letting it pass by.

      <itunes:summary>The guys are back this week looking to offer some reassurance and calm amid the chaos that the world is currently experiencing. The Coronavirus has everyone on edge, and this week, Karl, CJ, ET and Jemal chop it up on surviving and thriving during the Covid-19 crisis. In all things, it’s important to ”stay ahead of the curve.”  Doubly so when it comes to disaster preparedness, and that means exercising ”forward-thinking” regarding personal and professional finances, family, and life in general. The Coronavirus crisis will pass, and today’s podcast is designed to offer you the best footing for rebuilding once this crisis has ended.

Not showing up in their business, in their marriage, and they wonder why they’re still average. Take notes from today’s episode on the process and importance of showing up consistently.

      <title>217 - What Happened To Your Hearts</title>
      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/217-what-happened-to-your-hearts</link>
      <description>"Of all the things you can be, why be a taker?  I've never understood that mindset. I mean, how do you decide to take something and give nothing in return? " -ET.
 Today's podcast is a hot one and the issue of "Takers Vs. Givers" is just one of the several points covered in today's session. Success is an incredible attraction, and, as everyone on the squad continues their elevation in both business and private life, more and more people want in on the circle.  The problem is, some but not all of these "new people" have brought with them three particularly nasty spirits. Complaining, manipulation, and taking. If you know anything about E, C, Karl, Mal &amp; the Squad, then you already know, these are 3 Things that the squad doesn’t tolerate. 
 As ever, ETA's very own "Quincy Jones" AKA CJ, plays devil’s advocate when the conversation shifts to the topic of how and when to charge for your services. Today's show covers a myriad of relevant topics and the passion from the guys and their special in-studio guests will have you glued to your headphones!  
 Trust me; if you're in the process of building anything, a business, personal, and professional relationships, or anything else,  you'll need to hear what's about to go down today! Grab a friend, grab a pen, and settle in. Today's the day we make it plain!

      <description>It’s better to give than receive. One of the golden rules in life that so many forget about. Today on the podcast ET brings up the topic of having a giving versus receiving mentality. How it actually blesses you to put the needs of others before your own. How to make it a habit in your life even when you may be around people who aren’t reciprocating the concept. CJ rounds out the conversation on how being selfless is what led E to building the all-star cast he has around him. Take notes on how and why you should live with the mentality of wanting to give before you receive. 
 The Secret to Success Topics:
  [04:55] - Popeye’s Sandwich
 [13:20] - The Ultimate Sacrifice
 [22:00] - Don’t Kill the Flock

 [42:20] - TEAM
 [56:00] - Who is Eric Thomas?

      <description>The guys are back this week with a continuation of last week’s conversation. The have’s vs the have nots.

  [03:14] - Fair or Foul 
 [12:00] - The Have’s
 [21:00] - 1% Needs
 [38:20] - The Right Circle

      <title>197 - Deep Practice</title>
      <link>http://hyperurl.co/cbsqx8</link>
      <description>Who likes to be wrong? No one. Who enjoys making mistakes? Not one person on this Earth. But how many of you take ownership when you’re wrong or when you make a mistake. On today’s show, the guys talk about how to properly take ownership when you find yourself in a situation that’s your fault. Most people blame someone else or make an excuse when the proper thing to do is to take ownership and find a real solution to the problem. Take some time after listening to today’s podcast and ask yourself do you take ownership or do you play the blame game.
 The Secret to Success Topics:
  [03:20] - Am I Tripping Or?
 [11:11] - Accountability
 [23:40] - The Talent Code
 [36:30] - Time With Your Gift
 [49:00] - How To Get To Mastery
 [1:05:10] - Ask ET
 [1:26:00] - Nugget Of The Day
  Listener Perks:
  Organifi is giving our listeners 20% off of their order just go to www.organifi.com/success. Their superfood green juice powder allows you to get your greens anytime anywhere while on the go.

  Secrets 2 Success:
  When you don’t take ownership you don’t fix the problem.
 When you don’t take responsibility you lose all problem.
 A part of deep practice is not doing what you’re NOT supposed to do.
 One real encounter is more valuable than several hundred observations.

The system of having a 9-5 you hate, the system of being in a relationship you know you don’t want to be in. Whatever your system is are you happy in that system? The challenge you to identify, assess, and then make a decision on whether or not you’re in the right system. Grab your pen and paper, you will need to take notes.

      <title>192 - The Failure Plan</title>
      <link>http://hyperurl.co/cbsqx8</link>
      <description>As an owner, there’s an all or nothing attitude that goes into your effort. An employee mindset warrants an “I tried” mindset. On today’s podcast, the guys discuss the difference between individuals who “try” and individuals who flat out get it done. People who “try” often want credit for the effort and the guys talk about how trying means nothing if you don’t secure the bag. This podcast will make you stop and think about the mentality you’ve adopted. Is it an ownership mindset or an employee mindset? The difference between the two will determine the level of your success.
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [04:50]  - Happy Birthday E!
 [14:07] - Working on Mastery
 [24:34] - Tobe on 2K
 [39:00] - Staff Meeting
 [50:40] - Partial Credit
 [1:01:20] - The Danger
 [1:07:00] - Karl’s Ownership
 [1:13:00] - Next Level Ownership
 [1:25:00] - Nugget of The Day
  Listener Perks:
  Organifi is giving our listeners 20% off of their order just go to www.organifi.com/success. Their superfood green juice powder allows you to get your greens anytime anywhere while on the go.
  Secrets 2 Success:
  Securing the bag and making sure the money is in the account is the only thing that matters.
 Almost getting something means NOTHING.
 A fool takes no pleasure in understanding.
 Win and lose based on your OWN efforts.
 How you do anything is how you do EVERYTHING.
 You can’t put your happiness and success is someone else’s hands and get mad if it doesn’t work out.
 You should be working towards ownership in EVERY part of your life.

      <link>http://hyperurl.co/cbsqx8</link>
      <description>When you have a goal to lose weight before you start working out or hire a trainer what’s the first thing you do? Normally it’s stepping on the scale to get a starting point. After that, you set a goal weight. From that moment forward you continue to get on the scale to measure your progress to make sure you stay on track. This is the process for losing weight and it should also be the process when you’re going after any other dream or goal. Today the guys discuss the importance of understanding where you are and being honest about it so that you can move towards where you want to be.

      <title>Eps. 183 - Mile High Club</title>
      <link>http://hyperurl.co/cbsqx8</link>
      <description>Negativity. It’s something that we can’t get away from. But how do you handle it? How do you deal with people saying your product isn’t good enough? How do you deal with people telling you you’re not doing a good job? Do you let it affect you in a manner that makes you want to quit? On today’s podcast, the guys talk about the impact of negativity. They give insight on how they deal with it now and how they’ve dealt with it in the past before success. None of us are exempt from hearing negative comments and criticism but we all have to learn how to react to it. 
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [02:24] - Trey’s Comedy Corner
 [06:54] - Negative Feedback
 [23:35] - Comparison Theory
 [39:50] - Managing Negativity
 [50:00] - Getting Under ET’s Skin
 [53:00] - Tobe Get’s Trolled
 [1:04:22] - Ask ET
 [1:38:42] - Nugget of The Day

  The Secrets to Success:
  @S2SPodcast on IG
 You have to have a stronger voice than the voice in your head.
 Keeping the vision of what’s ahead of you will cost you your next opportunity.
 The impact of finishing is greater than the excitement of starting.
 There’s a group of people that need you more than you need to listen to negative comments. 
 You’ll get more accomplished living out your purpose than being allured by someone’s negative comments.

      <description>If you’ve tried to improve any aspect of your life you’ve encountered failure. Some of you have experienced failure more than others and because of that, you’ve given up completely. On today’s podcast, ET talks about the mindset it takes to experience failure and make the decision to not give up. Often people are concerned with what you have to do to become successful but ET explains why it’s more important to understand what it takes mentally.

 The Secrets to Success:
  @S2SPodcast on IG
 A lot of you are getting beat because you’re letting people tell you what you can and can’t do.
 Lead with the mindset, not the behavior.
 Stop worrying about immediate results and remember how life works.
 You can’t decrease your intensity because you’re not seeing the results.
 There is pain associated with your goals that may never go away.

 The Secrets to Success:
  @S2SPodcast on IG
 A lot of you are getting beat because you’re letting people tell you what you can and can’t do.
 Lead with the mindset, not the behavior.
 Stop worrying about immediate results and remember how life works.
 You can’t decrease your intensity because you’re not seeing the results.
 There is pain associated with your goals that may never go away.

      <title>Eps. 177 - Ugly Instagram</title>
      <link>https://www.etinspires.com/eps177</link>
      <description>Doing the work vs looking like you’re doing the work. Today’s podcast talks about the difference between the two. In today’s world of social media, it’s easier to LOOK like you’re doing the working instead of actually doing the work. In order to be successful, you have to actually do the work as well as go through a process. The guys discuss the importance of not being influenced or discouraged by what you see on social media and instead focus on the work. Obtaining real success requires REAL work in the lab and not LIKES on Instagram.

 You aren’t growing because you’re worried about what the wrong people think.
 The beautiful thing about discipline is that you choose what to sacrifice.
 Don’t allow people to give you second-hand fear.

      <link>https://www.etinspires.com/blog/eps171</link>
      <description>Can you bounce back? On today’s podcast, the guys hone in on the Virginia  Men’ Basketball Team who recently won the National Championship. A year prior they were the laughing stock of the NCAA as they lost to a 16 seed while being the number 1 seed. To translate this into real life think about a year or an instance where you felt like you messed up so bad that you couldn’t bounce back. You’re embarrassed, people are talking about it, what did you do? Did you fold or did you get ready for the next season? Listen to hear what ET says you should after experiencing a BIG Loss.
  Time Stamped Topics:
  [03:00] - NCAA Update
 [06:38] - Fair or Foul
 [22:00] - ET No Phone!
 [41:21] - ET Go Off!
 [54:30] - Virginia
 [1:08:00] - Confidence factor
 [1:19:40] - Ask ET

  The Secrets to Success:
  The Passport Personality Assessment www.etinspires.com/assessment

 When you’re down you can either make it your reality or you can say you’re in transition.
 If you make a decision NOT to quit you will begin to experience favor in a way you’ve never experienced before.
 We must prove to ourselves that we are who we say we are.
 The full circle of life is to know what it’s like to lose and to know what it’s like to win.
 You will never be a winner if you quit and give up.

      <link>https://www.etinspires.com/blog/eps170</link>
      <description>How much do you believe in yourself? Like really believe in yourself. Or do you think once you get another degree you’ll be good, or another certification or a co-sign that makes you believe in yourself? On today’s podcast, ET asks listeners what’s your road to the Final Four? Sometimes we think because we don’t have the ideal circumstances that we can’t beat the odds and come out on top. The road to the Final Four will not be paved straight but the guys talk about why you can still win a championship, despite what number seed you’re given.

 [17:30] - When To Splurge

 [41:00] - Everyone is A Business Owner
 [55:26] - I’m Doing Well

 Money is the second most important thing in your life.

 Most people when left to your own devices will not make good choices for themselves.
 Everywhere has problems but everywhere doesn’t have the same opportunities.

 Comparison is the thief of joy.

      <link>https://www.etinspires.com/blog/eps159</link>
      <description>At one point do you keep trying something and give up on it?  That’s the question that ET poses on today’s podcast. We all have areas in our life where we want to give up on something, or we have already given up. Relationships, business ventures, maybe even certain career choices. The guys carefully dissect how you should assess whether or not you should give up on anything that you’re seeking out. While listening to today’s podcast be sure to keep your current situation in perspective before you make a final decision to give up or keep going.
  Time Stamped Topics:
  [05:48] - Don’t switch what works
 [15:40] - Mr. Quinney update
 [20:00] - Family Matters
 [30:00] - When do you stop trying?
 [44:33] - Reprogram your thinking
 [53:00] - Why they didn’t quit
 [1:08:45] - Ask ET
 [1:23:00] - Nugget of the day
  Listener Perks:
  Organifi is giving our listeners 20% off of their order just go to www.organifi.com/success. Their superfood green juice powder allows you to get your greens anytime anywhere while on the go.
  The Secrets to Success:
  The Passport Personality Assessment www.etinspires.com/assessment

  Plan 2 Prosper Journal
 Don’t switch up what works.
 Pay attention to your indicators to decide whether or not you should move forward.
 The process is what’s deep not the goal.
 We look back at things with reverence but we look to the future with fear.

      <title>Eps. 158 - AirPod-Cast</title>
      <link>https://www.etinspires.com/blog/eps158</link>
      <description>This week the guys are back from their holiday vacation and are pumped up for 2019. The topic for today is what does it take to go from good to great?  What are the systems and routines that take a person to the next level? ET goes over the importance of studying oneself and how that is the best tool to help you get to the next level.
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [02:48] - Christmas Recap
 [18:00] - CJ at Target
 [29:00] - Getting Momentum
 [41:00] - The Systems
 [59:13] - Modify the Routine
 [1:05:00] - Money Changed Them
 [1:12:00] - Nugget of The Day
  Listener Perks:
  Organifi is giving our listeners 20% off of their order just go to www.organifi.com/success. Their superfood green juice powder allows you to get your greens anytime anywhere while on the go.
  The Secrets to Success:
  The Passport Personality Assessment www.etinspires.com/assessment

  Plan 2 Prosper Journal
 Don’t change your prices in 2019 if you’re not increasing your value.
 If your routine is off your results are off.
 Sometimes you’re scared to lose something when on the other side there is something greater.
 The success is in your daily routine and the 5 people closest to you routine.
 Momentum can swing either way, towards the negative or the positive.

 Success is not keeping up with the jones it’s living your life on your own terms.
 When you’re in the natural you’re the best person you can be.
 What you need to get to the next level is just a belief in yourself.
 Perfection is not going to happen overnight.

      <title>Eps. 154 - You Say He's Just A Friend</title>
      <link>https://www.etinspires.com/blog/eps154</link>
      <description>If you’ve been listening to this podcast for a while then you’ve heard the guys talk about the inability to self-assess. A concept that they’ve taught and drilled into the heads of listeners and fans over the years. CJ realized that while they’ve been teaching others how to self-assess, they haven’t quite taught people how to fix things once they’ve done the self-assessment. The guys, along with Josh Hatch, give some very transparent personal examples on how they executed after self-assessing.
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [10:00] - Kids In The Real World
 [21:29] - Fair or Foul
 [25:00] - Fixing Yourself
 [36:00] - Accepting No Change
 [42:10] - Main Frame
 [52:00] - Who Are You ?
 [1:12:00] - Hatch’s Corner
 [1:28:06] - Christmas Nugget of The Day

      <description>While on the road to success we often have a hard time balancing things. In particular the balance between being grateful for what you have and what you’ve accomplished you also desire and want more. This week on the podcast the guys talk about how to walk that fine line of being grateful yet not being satisfied. ET breaks down how he’s been able to stay focused on his original goal and not get caught up in wanting more for the wrong reasons.
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [03:50] - Tis The Season
 [11:40] - Petty Parent
 [18:40] - Balancing Act
 [38:00] - Set The Precedent
 [54:00] - Shifting Gears
 [1:15:50] - Ask ET
 [1:34:09] - Nugget of The Day

  The Secrets To Success:
  Your growth should be your own growth and not society’s growth.
 Your wants should only change in the scope of your own goals and dreams.
 The goal of going to the next level should not involve losing yourself.
 Don’t get to a point where you have your freedom yet you are a slave to what people think.
 Don’t live someone else’s dream because it may become a nightmare.

ET gives listeners information on how to do business the right way by practicing mutualism and being honest and upfront in the beginning.

      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/eps-147-ms-weed</link>
      <description>Pride and ego. Two characteristics that can hurt us and help us if used in the correct manner. On today’s podcast CJ brings an interesting experience with someone who asked for his opinion. The end resulted in the individual getting upset and letting their ego get in the way of not getting the coaching they needed. Has your ego ever prevented you from getting the information that you needed ? ET breaks down the difference between having pride and ego as well as how to, and who to, get input from.

 [26:50] - Ego
 [31:40] - Pride vs Ego

      <title>Eps. 142 - In Loving Memory of Chris Daniel</title>
      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/eps-142-in-loving-memory-of-chris-daniel</link>
      <description>In life, there will always be people with their hands out looking for what they can get.  What they can take for themselves without a thought for someone else.  And, there are others who live their lives working to make the lives of others, better.  Chris Daniel was that guy.  When I tell you that Chris changed my life, E’s life, Karl’s life and everybody at ETA, Breathe University, Gamechangers and beyond, believe me, Chris’s life and example, made a difference! When Chris came onboard and introduced us all to his 4Animals personality assessment, he turned everything we thought we knew about ourselves upside down. Professionally, Chris was in a class all by himself.  He was honestly,  the best of the best of the best.  Personally, he was no different. Chris was my dude. Just a solid human being, he went through enormous personal tragedy but bounced back,  spending the rest of his life pouring into everyone he met and worked with. Chris believed in us, showed us, mad love, and by just being around him, hearing his critiques, watching him teach, seeing the passion he poured into every exchange whether he was in front of an audience or those moments backstage, or privately,  he made us all stand up a little taller in everything we do.  Chris was a friend who became my brother, and I am going to miss him terribly. That having been said, I will live the rest of my life in a way that best mirrors the life Chris taught me to live, and I would encourage you to do the same.  Take inventory of your life. Make it right with whomever you have beef with.  Don't waste another day building someone else's future without laying away things for the legacy you wish to leave behind. Be honest and live and love fully. Good night my friend.  I'll see you in the morning. -CJ</description>

 If you want to see momentum in your life you have to be intentional and deliberate.
 The dangerous thing about losing momentum is that it kills your confidence.
 Sometimes you have to use old momentum to kickstart the new momentum.

      <title>Eps. 136 - The Humble Preacher </title>
      <link>https://www.etinspires.com/blog/Eps-136-The-Humble-Preacher/65986</link>
      <description>This week on the podcast ET talks about an experience he had over the weekend while traveling and speaking. The experience gave The Hip-Hop Preacher somewhat of a push and made me realize that no matter what you still have work to do. There is never a time where you don’t have to prove yourself and after you master one level there’s still another level to conquer. Listen as the guys talk about how these experiences keep him humble and how you should continue to improve your craft no matter what.

  The Secrets to Success:
  Don’t talk championship talk without reinforcing everything in your environment to make sure it’s on a championship level.
 If you don’t learn how master you, you will have someone else mastering over you.

      <description>Is the goal to win or to look like you’re winning ? On today’s podcast the guys talk about the effects of people displaying their “highlight reel” without putting in any real work behind it. We all know that social media plays a huge role in business and building a brand. The guys discuss the side effects of portraying like you’re doing something when you’re really not doing anything. Do yourself a favor and self assess what you’re posting and why you’re posting on social media. Are you posting it because it's really happening ? Or are you posting it to act like it's happening ?
  Time Stamped Topics:
  [08:13] - Karl’s Condition

 [33:00] - Fair or Foul

Grab a pen and paper as you listen to today’s podcast and learn how to conquer the triple double life.

      <link>http://etinspires.com/blog/Eps-124-You-Not-My-Mama/62278</link>
      <description>This week on the podcast ET takes over the discussion and talks about living for other people. People doing things based on what they think someone else will think or how they will feel. CJ elaborates on the dangers of living with this mindset and how you can start to depend on other people to cosign for you and everything you do. They go on to talk about how this also creates a fixed mindset. This mindset  will keep you from trying anything and eventually will keep you from growing and becoming the best version of yourself.

  [03:00] - Fair or Foul Recap
 [07:40] - Dede’s Fair or Foul

  The Secrets To Success:
  “Do not be weary in doing well.”
 “The worst thing in life to do is to go back and forth.”
 “It’s best to make a bad mistake than to not make a mistake at all.”
 “If you need a cheerleader or a co-signer for everything you’ll always be at the mercy of other people.”

Despite what you may believe the opportunities here in American are more abundant than anywhere else in the world. ET is convinced that the majority of people are going to work but they do not want to work. The guys go over several different scenarios as to why and how people get this attitude. They also talk about how you can change your mindset and habits to become someone who performs at a high level in all opportunities.

      <link>http://etinspires.com/blog/Eps-120-You-Can-39-t-Have-My-Check/60812</link>

      <title>EPS. 117 - Reverse Layup</title>
      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/eps-117-reverse-layup</link>
      <description>By the time you hear this I’m sure you’ll know that Loyola has made it to the Final Four. Loyola is a college basketball team that ET has been working with all year. The guys talk extensively on what it took for them to get there. The mindset, the work ethic, and the amount of faith they have in themselves. Although all three of those things were important CJ pointed out that one thing these guys did consistently, in every game, was make their reverse layups. It’s what they are good at, it’s their super power if you will. Karl then poses the question “What’s your reverse lay up ?” Hopefully after today’s episode you’ll figure yours out.
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [02:17] - Fair or Foul
 [06:15] - The Underdogs
 [21:20] - The Special Ingredient
 [36:45] - ETA Is Still A Underdog
 [56:00] - Ask ET
 [1:20:00] - Nugget of The Day
  Listener Perks:
  Organifi is giving our listeners 20% off of their order just use the promo code “SUCCESS”. Their superfood green juice powder allows you to get your greens anytime anywhere while on the go.
 Health IQ is an insurance agency for the healthy conscious individual. To see if you qualify for up to 25.5% off of your life insurance visit www.healthiq.com/success.
  Gems From The Podcast:
  “Don’t look at an opportunity based on size.”
 “Sometimes the blessings you’re looking for aren’t coming from where you think they’re coming from.”
 “You need every personality around you to be great.”
 “Don’t scout your identity out of the process.”

      <title>Eps. 114 - The Rabbit Hole </title>
      <link>http://etinspires.com/blog/Eps-114-The-Rabbit-Hole/57981</link>
      <description>This week’s podcast was live from the Phenomenal Life Cruise. ET kicks off the conversation by asking a question about balance. How do you find the balance between family responsibilities and going after a dream ? The guys talk extensively about why balance is so important while chasing a dream and having a family and how they deal with it.
 Well into the podcast the conversation transitions the difference between being a giver and a taker. The guys distinguish the difference between being a giver and a taker as well as the science behind being a TRUE giver.
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [07:00] - The Family Man
 [16:12] - What is the balance ?
 [34:20] - Order of operations
 [54:30] - It’s Levels
 [1:05:00] - Ask ET
 [1:13:00] - Nugget of the day

  Things To Think About:
  “Why are people in your circle if you’re not going to listen to them.”
 “If it’s not a check at the end of it or a friendship then you shouldn’t be on the phone.”
 “You grinding at your job and you’re bankrupt at home.”
 “Don’t do business with broke people and not just money.”

      <link>http://etinspires.com/blog/Eps-108-You-Dip-I-Dip-We-Dip/55085</link>
      <description>On this week’s podcast the 4th Amigo Josh Hatch joins the guys again and it doesn’t take long for the guy’s to go deep. We all know the Patriots are returning to the Super Bowl but what is it about this organization that makes them so special. How do they take players that nobody wants and turn them into champions ? Josh calls it the underdog culture. The culture and attitude of believing that no matter what you always have something to prove.
 The second half of the show ET talks about encountering what he calls a pack of gazelle’s. Listen closely to the lessons that ET gives based off of his experience with two people who were not ready for an opportunity of a lifetime.
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [02:00] - Am I Tripping Or ?
 [05:15] - Patriots Win Again
 [30:00] - The Difference
 [36:44] - A Pack of Gazelle’s
 [54:12] - You Can’t Deposit Likes

  Listener Perks:
  Organifi is giving our listeners 20% off of their order just use the promo code “SUCCESS”. Their superfood green juice powder allows you to get your greens anytime anywhere while on the go.
  Things To Think About:
  “The hand you get, you gotta play that hand and better hand will come to you at some point.”
 “Stop looking for the system and become the person that someone wants to recruit.”
 “If you can’t get yourself going in a good routine you can’t get to the next level.”
 “Why have a craft if you’re not going to give it 120%.”

The culture and attitude of believing that no matter what you always have something to prove.</p> <p>The second half of the show ET talks about encountering what he calls a pack of gazelle’s.

      <title>Eps. 103 - Dirty Santa </title>
      <link>http://etinspires.com/blog/Eps-103-Dirty-Santa/53145</link>
      <description>At some point in life we all face an adversity. Whether it’s at home, school, or work you’ve ran into an adverse situation. Now think about that moment and how you reacted to it. Were you calm or were you angry ? Have you ever noticed yourself going off in situations where it wasn’t necessary ?
 In today’s podcast the guys discuss the difference between people who handle adverse situations differently. The people who go off in situations instead of people who stay calm. ET talks about how he discovered his triggers when he does go off. He gives tips on how to find your own triggers. One of the most important tips ET gives is asking yourself “What’s the goal”. As you run into adverse situations today, tomorrow, and for the rest of your life, stop and ask yourself “What is the goal”.
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [09:54] - Fair or Foul
 [18:40] - CJ Almost Ruined Christmas
 [26:40] - Handling Adverse Situations
 [41:00] - ET Says No to A Picture
 [1:08:50] - Ask ET
 [1:33:22] - Nugget of The Day
  Things To Think About:
  “If you’re going to get different outcomes you have to do something different.”
 “The way some people respond to situations is cultural.”
 “Immediately before going off ask yourself what’s the goal.”

      <link>http://etinspires.com/blog/Eps-95-A-King-39-s-Return/49481</link>
      <description>Sometimes in life you get treated unfairly and people will spit venom on your name. The natural reaction would be to retaliate. In today’s episode you will learn why retaliation is in fact not the best option. Last week ET returned back to his alma mater Oakwood University to speak. ET has written and spoken about Oakwood in many books and speeches but he’s never mentioned that he was banned from speaking on campus. That is until last week when he returned. In this episode you will learn why handling things with dignity is the absolute best thing to do no matter how bad a situation is.
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [10:06] - What Would You Do ?
 [18:20] - Fair or Foul ?
 [24:15] - Challenge With the 100 Day Challenge
 [31:38] - ET Goes Back To Oakwood
 [1:00:00] - Old Regime Meets New Regime
 [1:19:35] - Ask ET
 [1:30:00] - Nugget Of The Day
  Things To Think About:
  “Anything you get locked in on will require sacrifice.”
 “You can’t justify retaliation.”
 “If you think you can’t do it it’s probably because you’re doing it alone.”
 “Don’t become the thing you hate”

      <itunes:summary>Sometimes in life you get treated unfairly and people will spit venom on your name. The natural reaction would be to retaliate. In today’s episode you will learn why retaliation is in fact not the best option. Last week ET returned back to his alma mater Oakwood University to speak. ET has written and spoken about Oakwood in many books and speeches but he’s never mentioned that he was banned from speaking on campus. That is until last week when he returned. In this episode you will learn why handling things with dignity is the absolute best thing to do no matter how bad a situation is.
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [10:06] - What Would You Do ?
 [18:20] - Fair or Foul ?
 [24:15] - Challenge With the 100 Day Challenge
 [31:38] - ET Goes Back To Oakwood
 [1:00:00] - Old Regime Meets New Regime
 [1:19:35] - Ask ET
 [1:30:00] - Nugget Of The Day
  Things To Think About:
  “Anything you get locked in on will require sacrifice.”
 “You can’t justify retaliation.”
 “If you think you can’t do it it’s probably because you’re doing it alone.”
 “Don’t become the thing you hate”
 "Nothing is permanent but change."

      <title>Tuesday Power Up / Best or Nothing </title>
      <link>http://etinspires.com/blog/Best-or-Nothing/48185</link>
      <description>There are those of you who out there who only give your best when it seems likes the “right opportunity”. You continue to only give 70% or 80% and you never go 120 all the time. I need you to stop that today and make a choice to be excellent everyday in all that you do. What you fail to realize is there is no other way to greatness except giving 120% effort at all times. From this day forward I need you to give your best or nothing !!
 “Whatever your hand find to do, do with ALL your might.”

      <title>Tuesday Power Up | Realistic Plans</title>
      <link>http://etinspires.com/blog/Realistic-Plans/47008</link>
      <description>When setting goals we often set large goals or make plans that can be somewhat unrealistic. They may not be unrealistic as far as your ability but unrealistic when it comes to other factors that play a part in you making it happen. In order to avoid being disappointed by not doing what you said you were going to do, you have to learn what things will keep you from making it happen. Are there certain emotions that keep you distracted from the goal or the plan ? Are there certain environments that will keep you from achieving the goal or keeping the plan ? These are just two of many questions you need to ask yourself in order for you to set realistic plans. Be honest with yourself so that you can begin to set plans and goals that you can always execute and follow-through on.
  “Don’t plan to do things that are not realistic.”

      <title>Tuesday Power Up | PLAN </title>
      <link>http://www.etinspires.com/blog/Plan/46570</link>
      <description>Everybody has a dream and everybody has a goal. The problem is that no one has the proper plan to make the dream or goal happen. In order to achieve that thing you’re going after you have to put a strategic step by step plan together. You have to make the choice to wake up every day and work on that plan. The dream is great but the plan is what makes it happen and you have what it takes to get it done.
  “I will take control of my dream by planning.”

      <title>Expansion </title>
      <link>http://etinspires.com/blog/Expansion/45668</link>
      <description>It’s time to expand your territory. Expand means to become or make larger, or more extensive. Often times in life things seem to be good or even great and we don’t look for the opportunities to expand. You need to expand your territory and in order to do so you have to make that choice !! Make yourself aware of the fact that there are better things and opportunities available to you. Realize that expanding is something you can do be aware of what you need to do to make that happen.
  “Choose today to expand you and take you to the next level.”

      <title>Eps. 87 - Risky Business </title>
      <link>http://etinspires.com/blog/Eps-87-Risky-Business/45447</link>
      <description>As entrepreneurs it could be very tempting to take shortcuts and cut corners to get ahead. In business we learn that ethics and integrity are very important but we see a lot of individuals get ahead by cheating. CJ asks ET to explain how to avoid the temptation of cutting corners to get ahead. As complex as the question is ET gives us 2 great things to remember when doing business or when doing things for other people in general. Do things as if you’re doing it for yourself. Never build your house on sand because when the storm comes it will not last.
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [02:39] - Am I Tripping Or ?
 [11:00] - Integrity in Business
 [31:00] - ET Can’t Answer
 [43:46] - Explicit Knowledge
 [56:00] - Go Get The Blessing
 [1:10:11] - PTI ETA Style
 [1:18:20] - Ask ET
 [1:25:30] - Houston Nugget of The Day 
  Things To Think About:
  “There are certain things you have to earn for yourself.”
 “When you give 120% the right way you will always have a job.”
 "When you cut corners you're killing something else that's inside of you."
 "Don't let your frustration make you stop, allow the frustration to help you keep going."

      <title>Own It!</title>
      <link>http://etinspires.com/blog/Own-It/45110</link>
      <description>Opportunities will not come your way every single day. For some of you when the opportunities present themselves you get scared or you get nervous. You allow the lack of courage to sabotage the opportunity you have. When that opportunity comes you have to own it !! In order to do this you have to think differently about yourself. Listen to the affirmation at the end of this Power Up and repeat it daily in front of a mirror. It’s time for you to make the rest of your life the best of your life.
  “It’s time to become the person you’ve been destined to be and  called to be.”
  Thank you so much for listening to this episode of Tuesday's Power Up episode. If you haven’t done so already, please take a minute and leave a quick rating and review of the show in  iTunes .

      <link>http://etinspires.com/blog/Eps-85-The-Sweatpants-Life/44464</link>
      <description>How often do you start something and not put 120% into it ? Have you ever experienced having days, weeks, or months where you just weren’t performing at the level that you should be ? Then something happens that just restarts your ignition. In today’s podcast the guys discuss the importance of taking advantage of your life and the opportunities you currently have. ET explains that you shouldn’t wait until something bad happens in your life to start going 120. You should wake up every single day and give 120 to everything you’re doing.
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [08:20] - ET &amp; The NBA
 [10:30] - What problems do you solve ?
 [29:40] - Humans are lazy
 [50:22] - Embrace the opportunity of life
 [1:06:00] - One Gotta Go
 [1:16:00] - Ask ET
 [1:23:50] - Nugget of the Day
  Things To Think About:
 “Stay in your circle of competence”
 “What tangible value do you bring ?”
 “What problems can you solve ?”
 “What job would you do if you didn’t need a job ?”
 “If you lick the opportunity in front of you that’s what opens the door to the next one.”

      <title>Embrace Your Transition </title>
      <link>http://www.etinspires.com/blog/Embrace-Your-Transition/44263</link>
      <description>There comes a time in our lives where we have to transition. What gets us to one level of success will not alway help us get to the next level of success that includes dominance. You have to learn to transition and not hold onto things because it worked before. If you’re currently feeling stuck or feeling like you need to do something different it may be time for you to transition. Take action by reading books, going to conferences, and getting around those who are already on the next level. Let’s take action and do what it takes to get to the next level !!
  “I am responsible for learning whatever it takes to get from one level to the next.”

      <title>Eps. 82 - Optical Illusion</title>
      <link>https://secrettosuccess.libsyn.com/optical-illusion</link>
      <description>Today’s show is dedicated to Bryant Kilgo whose life was impacted greatly by ET. ET had an opportunity to meet his mother who informed him that Bryant passed away in June. ET and the entire ETA squad would like to send our condolences.
 Is the term fake it till you make it still valid ? Should current or future entrepreneurs still live with this mindset ? CJ poses this question as he talks about an encounter with someone he’s been helping out. The gentlemen was making things in his life look better than they were and CJ confronted him about it. The gentlemen then explains that he was doing what he thought the squad had to do to get on and then the lightbulb in CJ’s brain turned on.
 Did they fake it till they made it ? CJ talks about some things they did to make things seem better than they were. Several questions are posed. Were they guilty of doing something that they don’t like others doing ? What are the limits to faking it till you make it ? How long do you fake it till you make it? As you find out the answers to these questions in this episode keep in mind one thing. The biggest problem with faking like you have things together is that you could repel the real help you need. The person who could help you get to the next level could be watching you live your fake lifestyle.

      <title>Eps. 81 - Jerk On A Plane </title>
      <link>http://etinspires.com/eps-81-jerk-on-a-plane/</link>
      <description>The guys have an eventful fun filled weekend. Karl and his family took a trip up north for the first time, CJ and his family hung out in Michigan for a family reunion, and ET and his church family holds their first annual kick ball game.
 Have you ever been on a flight with a jerk ? CJ had the experience over the week and he admits to almost losing control and possibly getting into a fight with another passenger. CJ explains the situation and then poses the question to Karl and E and asks them what would they have done if they were in the same situation. ET explains how he’s been able to set boundaries to prevent situations from getting out of hand since he’s been baptized again. Every misunderstanding doesn’t have to turn into a full blown argument or even a fight.
 If you’re struggling with anger issues ET explains that you need to self-assess and figure out what’s really making you angry. Most of the things you blow up over aren’t as serious as you make it but you have to self-assess and see where the anger is really coming from. Listen to how CJ actually handled the situation and how ET and Karl would have handled it.
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [03:25] - Weekend Recap
 [14:40] - Has ET gone vegan ?
 [30:00] - CJ gets heated
 [50:30] - ET Loses Control

      <itunes:summary>The guys have an eventful fun filled weekend. Karl and his family took a trip up north for the first time, CJ and his family hung out in Michigan for a family reunion, and ET and his church family holds their first annual kick ball game.
 Have you ever been on a flight with a jerk ? CJ had the experience over the week and he admits to almost losing control and possibly getting into a fight with another passenger. CJ explains the situation and then poses the question to Karl and E and asks them what would they have done if they were in the same situation. ET explains how he’s been able to set boundaries to prevent situations from getting out of hand since he’s been baptized again. Every misunderstanding doesn’t have to turn into a full blown argument or even a fight.
 If you’re struggling with anger issues ET explains that you need to self-assess and figure out what’s really making you angry. Most of the things you blow up over aren’t as serious as you make it but you have to self-assess and see where the anger is really coming from. Listen to how CJ actually handled the situation and how ET and Karl would have handled it.

      <title>Eps. 80 - I Don't Sell Weed </title>
      <link>http://etinspires.com/i-dont-sell-weed/</link>
      <description>The guys are still in Houston after the Stay Ready conference and their experiences are the subject of this week’s podcast episode. After meeting gazelle’s on two occasions the guys dive deep into the difference of an owner’s mentality and a worker’s mentality. Essentially when you’re operating like a gazelle in the workplace it’s because of this mentality. After discussing the difference CJ asks the guys what do you do when you’re doing something you’re not passionate about for a living and it’s hard to give 120.
 There are many people who fall into that category and ET gives some practical tangible advice on how to overcome this mentality. The key principle to it all is, “Whatever your hand find to do, do it with ALL your might.”
 Time Stamped Topics:
  [03:49] - Am I Tripping Or ?
 [06:21] - Stay Ready Houston Recap
 [12:32] - Lion of The Week
 [18:35] - Owner Mentality/Worker Mentality
 [31:00] - Do it with ALL your might
 [50:00] - What does it feel like being ET ?
 [58:39] - Ask ET
 [1:14:20] - Nugget of The Day (You have enough)
   
 Things to Think About:
 “Your next BIG opportunity relies on what you’re doing now.”
 “Whatever your hand find to do, do with ALL your might.”
 “Act like your normal doing something you don’t want to do and you’ll be doing it the rest of your life.”
 “You can’t compartmentalize greatness.”
 “You can not, not afford to invest in yourself.”
 “You’re already in pain get a reward for it.”

      <title>Eps.79 - My Secret Super Power </title>
      <link>http://etinspires.com/eps-79-my-secret-super-power/</link>
      <description>The guys recorded their first live podcast in front of an audience last week and it’s probably the best podcast episode ever. Karl kicks off the episode with the introduction of ETA’s first children’s publication. My Secret Super Power: Trey’s Jungle Adventure . CJ talks about the process of writing the book and gives some advice on how to handle unexpected setbacks while working on projects. After writing the book CJ discovered that although it’s a children’s book many adults can benefit from the message.
 The main focus of the episode is the importance of shifting from a consumer mindset to a producer mindset. The guys explain how we are conditioned to consume as much as possible and that stops most people from actually producing anything. After listening to this episode you should walk away with a few key nuggets of information that involve going from a consumer to a producer, how fake confidence doesn’t work, and how to understand and adjust your view of the world.

After listening to this episode you should walk away with a few key nuggets of information that involve going from a consumer to a producer, how fake confidence doesn’t work, and how to understand and adjust your view of the world.</p> <p> </p> <p>     Time Stamped Show Notes</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>[03:00] - Fair or Foul Segment</li> <li>[14:00] - My Secret Super Power</li> <li>[26:33] - It's time to start producing</li> <li>[38:00] - ET goes off</li> <li>[51:22] - You can’t fake confidence</li> <li>[58:22] - Live Q&amp;A</li> <li>[1:05:00] - Understanding your world</li> <li>[1:15:55] - Nugget of the day</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Things Mentioned:</p> <p><a href="http://etinspires.com/page/kids">My Secret Super Power: Trey’s Jungle Adventure</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Thank you so much for listening to this episode of the Secret 2 Success podcast.

      <title>Eps. 78 - First The Fat Boys Break Up...</title>
      <link>cfc707b21ce6876fa9cd40ce4de88c09</link>
      <description>We’ve seen some of the best dynamic duos create history in their fields and ultimately break up. The most recent break up is with ESPN’s Mike &amp; Mike who have worked together for 18 years and are now calling it quits. This caused CJ to think about the possibility of the squad breaking up. Could it happen ?
 CJ challenges the guys and ask them have they ever thought of the squad possibly breaking up.The guys all explain how they safeguard those thoughts and keep their ego in check so that it doesn’t happen. ET makes a very important point that in order to keep things like this from happening he makes sure that the guys understand and know how much he appreciates them. CJ talks about his real reason for not having his own social media pages as it could possibly cause a distraction to what his role is.
 No one wants to see great duos or trios that make history break up but it’s a strong possibility in the world we live in today. You'll learn in this episode that as long as everyone stays in their lane it's hard for that to happen.
 Time Stamped Show Notes:
  [03:16] - CJ Gets In a Police chase
 [17:17] - Mike &amp; Mike
 [24:00] - Can the squad break up ?
 [40:00] - Stay In Your Lane
 [52:00 ] - The Money Talk
 [1:07:00 ] - Ask ET
 [1:27:27 ] - The Nugget of The Day

      <title>Eps.77 - Good Morning Mr. Bill</title>
      <link>http://etinspires.com/eps-75-waiting-to-blow/</link>
      <description>The guys are back this week and they kick off today’s episode with a weekend recap. Baby Avery turned one, the guys in Lansing did more demolition on the ETA compound, and Josh’s son Hudson won the state championship in golf.
 CJ starts off the conversation by asking the guys a question that he was asked by a listener. What do you do while you’re waiting to blow up ? You’re applying the principles you’re learning, you’re studying your craft, but things just aren’t moving as fast as you want them to. So what do you do ? ET explains that at one point in time he actually stopped speaking and found other ways to serve and add to his craft. When he stepped away is when he, CJ, &amp; Karl started working together at MSU. Karl discovers that even back then the squad was doing the same thing that they are doing now.
 The key principle in this episode is to stay in go mode and master your craft. Even while waiting to blow up you should be working on your craft. ET says that for many aspiring speakers, they only speak when they speak. This statement can be used for more than speakers. No matter what level you’re on in your journey make sure that you are always working on your craft.
  Time Stamped Show Notes:
  [09:30] - Avery turns 1 years old
 [13:00] - Father’s Day Weekend
 [21:00] - ET stepped away from speaking
 [33:00] - Karl steps into unfamiliar territory
 [41:55] - CJ finds the gaps
 [52:40] - Fair or Foul
 [1:07:15] - Ask ET
 [1:30:12] - The Nugget of the Day
