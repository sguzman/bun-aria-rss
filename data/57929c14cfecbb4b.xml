      <title>Ep 576 | How Phil Survived the Ice Age of 1969</title>
      <description>Phil recalls reading an article about the looming ice age that would blanket the earth in snow and how people on the news were talking about building igloos. Jase says Phil has planted so many trees that he has offset the carbon for himself and all his sons! Phil tells the story of a 1000-year-old tree that was burned down by the government — and he shed a tear because it represented the end of an era for him. And Jase jokes about his research into animals licking their wounds.

      <title>Ep 570 | Jase &amp; Missy Welcomed 30 Families for the Mia Moo FUNDay &amp; Why Miss Kay Kicked Phil Out</title>
      <description>Jase, Missy, and Mia hosted dozens of families for the Mia Moo FUNDay, and the weekend even included a poolside service at the local hotel. Jase shares how families can get beyond the "Why me?" questions when they face adversity in their lives and the hardest part of helping a child — or teenager — going through what Mia has faced in her young life. Phil gripes at being kicked out of the house so Miss Kay could teach some college kids how to make chicken and dumplings. Phil and Jase have the same alarm system for unannounced visitors. Jase's frog hunt adventure led him to wonder why the first reaction to danger is to pull out a camera, rather than deal with the dangerous situation?

      <title>Ep 566 | Phil Hoodwinks Jase &amp; Willie on His Ultimate Redneck Investment </title>
      <description>Phil surprises Jase with his unusual new investment — and Jase calls Phil a "faith investor." Phil has only one phrase that comes to mind when he hears the name "Joe Biden." Jase calls for Christians to show grace to one another if they disagree, as long as they're all united on who Jesus is. Phil takes a fresh look at the Old Testament story of Naaman, and Jase applies it to a predicament he found himself in at a gas station. Phil believes storms — and definitely hurricanes — can be used to test people's faith, much like how the disciples in the boat with Jesus were tested and terrified. Plus, if these guys had been in the boat with Jesus, how would they have reacted? Al recalls fishing with Phil in the middle of a storm. Jase wants all unbelievers to read Mark 1-4. Zach cautions against the biggest threat to the kingdom of God. Jase reminds us that our anchor MUST be to Jesus and why "just believe in yourself" is terrible advice.

      <title>Ep 565 | Jase Has Another Gas Station Encounter &amp; What Will Happen in the End Times? </title>
      <description>Jase describes his most recent gas station encounter with a fan. Jase and Zach get into the usage of words like "eschatology" and "syntax." Phil says Jase's poker playing is definitely gambling. Al's injured finger gives him trouble when he's preaching. What will happen in the end times — and what does that even mean? What is the "rapture?" And will it actually happen? Jase believes it's okay for Christians to disagree about the end times — it's not a factor in salvation, so it's okay if we don't all agree about the "how."

      <title>Ep 564 | Jase Calls Out the Worst Sin of All &amp; Are Unbelievers Willfully Ignorant?</title>
      <description>Jase wishes people believed that God is the one who makes the seeds grow — not "Mother Nature" — and Phil points out that God is also the one who can prevent things from growing. Zach says people who don't believe are willfully ignorant. Jase highlights how different Jesus was than the messiah the Jews expected — they were awaiting a messiah who would conquer Rome and bring an end to wars, but Jesus ate with tax collectors, healed people, raised people from the dead, and challenged the Pharisees. Zach says our problems in the world do not need a political fix. Jase warns us all to remain open-minded and to stay away from any traditions or groups of people who don't focus on Jesus and his grace. And Phil and Jase compete over who had the lowest grades.

      <title>Ep 562 | Jase Has Multiple Birthdays Because the Internet Lies &amp; Phil Hates the Rising Crime</title>
      <description>Jase says the truth is a difficult thing to know, especially for famous people. Just take the fact that, according to the internet, he has one birthday, but it's different from his ACTUAL birthday. So every year, he has birthday messages on both days. Jase tells Al he should just cut off his injured finger — and what a great sermon illustration that would be, right?  
Phil is sure he's never seen this much crime, not just in the country, but in the world — and Jase says this is because the population is the highest it's ever been. Al says the unforgivable sin is to deny that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are one. You can't separate Jesus from good. You can't separate Satan from evil. Jase cautions against anyone calling something that is obviously sinful behavior "justified" and "good" — that's a dangerous place to be!

      <title>Ep 561 | Jep's Son Plays His First Football Game &amp; Why Jesus Had to Be Betrayed</title>
      <description>Jase talks about Jep's son getting to play his very first football game and how he could barely hold back his excitement to do the touchdown dance! Phil discusses the crowd that acknowledged Jesus' power when he performed miracles, but did not acknowledge who he was. Al discusses the requirement for Jesus to be betrayed in order for God's plan to be fulfilled. And Jase explains why he thinks it's interesting that Jesus chose to use the disciple who betrayed him instead of the other 11 who did not.

      <title>Ep 558 | Jase's Zoning Out Explained &amp; What Do We Do When God Doesn't Give Us What We Want?</title>
      <description>Jase says he's built for the outdoors, so being in a windowless room is really tough for him. And he explains why, yes, he sometimes DOES zone out during the podcast recording and why retreating to the outdoors is even biblical, following the example of Jesus. Zach says we've separated the secular from the sacred, so why is anyone wondering why the secular hasn't been transformed by the sacred? Jase points out that every human is possessed by something — whether it be sin or the Holy Spirit. Al shares about an event he attended where 46 Louisiana legislators were given awards based on the bills they brought forward that rely on biblical values. Jase explores what we do when God doesn't give us what we want.

      <title>Ep 557 | Jase's 3-Hour Tire Repair Turned Into a Bible Study with 20 People</title>
      <description>Jase tells the story of a routine tire fix — while he was waiting in a crowded room, a man started asking him about the Gospel, so Jase ended up holding an impromptu Bible study for 20 people! Phil's excited about another "no pulpit required" moment. Al and Jase discover why Baton Rouge is called "The Red Stick." Zach describes what boomerang evangelism is and why you never know what seeds are being planted or when they might turn into someone giving their life to Christ. Jase recounts a particular scene from a chick flick. Phil shares the most exciting thing he's ever been a part of in his life.

Jase discusses the purpose and classification of the miraculous, and Al questions the purpose of banning food that God said was clean. </p><p><br></p><p>Watch the Unashamed overtime show, only on BlazeTV: <a href="https://blazetv.com/unashamed">https://BlazeTV.com/Unashamed</a></p><p><br></p><p>Visit <a href="https://OmegaXL.com/PHIL">https://OmegaXL.com/PHIL</a> and buy one bottle and get a second bottle free</p><p><br></p><p>Visit <a href="https://40DaysForLife.com">https://40DaysForLife.com</a> to get the free quarterly magazine, podcast, and updates from 40 Days for Life</p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Ep 552 | How God's Timing Shocks Jase, Men Who Cook &amp; How the Apostles Would Have Used Hot Spots</title>
      <description>Jase can't believe God chose to reveal the message of Jesus by word of mouth, knowing that a technological boom was right around the corner! Al talks about how many more men are becoming great cooks in our culture. Phil discusses the hot spot technology that the apostles would definitely have taken advantage of if they had it. Jase is joined in the studio by Ryan Lee and Gary Witherall to talk about the incredible weight and power of forgiveness and the rarely known joy that can be found in suffering.

      <description>Al accuses Jase of having hoarding tendencies, just like Miss Kay, but Jase builds a solid case for why he might need any of the things he keeps in his truck, especially when he is in town! Jase remembers Missy's first time at a Robertson family game night and why she walked away concerned for Phil and Miss Kay's marriage. Jase and Al discuss the tendency people have to separate emotions from worshipping in song. And Phil explores the purpose of multiple eyewitness accounts recorded of Jesus's ministry. Plus, how is realistic leadership similar to eating a fish?

      <title>Ep 540 | Missy Can't Believe the Baby Formula Shortage, Robertson Food Fights, &amp; Pro-Life DNA</title>
      <description>Missy and Phil discuss the "strange" baby formula shortage, the lack of baby formula companies in the United States, and the lack of concern from the government. Jase recalls the early years when he and his brothers had to fight dirty to get their fair share of supper, and Al recalls his dinnertime recipes when he would cook for his younger brothers.

      <title>Ep 536 | Phil Warns Against Man-eating Swamp Creature &amp; Jase Matches Politicians with Biblical Kings</title>
      <description>Jase introduces various hypothetical situations involving life or death and the human responses to them. Phil joins in with a story about the most unlikely man-eater of the swamp and how to avoid it. Al discusses desperate faith and how difficult it must have been for the Israelites to trust the plan and flee from an army toward a sea with no boats for passage! Al points out that only six of 39 biblical kings were considered good kings, and Jase says modern politicians probably have a similar percentage. And Phil tells a funny story about a puppy that survived for two months trapped inside a cave!

      <description>Jase attends a conference with Missy — and discovers he is the only man in the crowd. Missy may have left out a detail or two!

      <title>Ep 531 | Jase Reveals the Opposite of Doubt &amp; Phil Sums Up What Technology Does to the Human Heart</title>
      <description>Jase explains how we have entered God's grace because of our faith, which does not come from ourselves but is a gift from God! Larry Bowles joins Zach and discusses how faith is not the absence of sin. Phil shares his view of how technology has probably inflicted more pain and trouble upon the human heart than it has helped. And Jase explains the ability to approach the throne of God with confidence.

      <title>Ep 529 | Jase Tries for Baby Smiles with Different Songs &amp; Missy's On-the-Nose Signs</title>
      <description>Jase jokes about Missy buying signs with obvious sayings on them, like "Home." Zach laughs about his wife's pillows that can't be touched or slept on, and Al says he has thrown away a pillow collection before. Jase goes through a playlist of songs to see what the baby enjoys, and he finally finds the unlikely song that brought hours of smiles. Zach discusses the meta-narrative of two worlds bridged together by the book of Hebrews, and Al challenges the audience to start reading Bible verses.

      <title>Ep 528 | Sadie Robertson Huff's New Album Is Fire &amp; Phil Wants This on a T-Shirt</title>
      <description>Phil tells of the startling time somebody gave him a piece of his mind. Jase talks about how young people will have "Noah" moments. Al talks about what young people are tempted to be concerned about in their daily lives and how God is fully aware when bad things happen to His creation. Jase is back on a movie kick, and he reveals which mission is truly impossible for humanity to carry out. Sadie's new worship EP "Steady Light" is out, and Zach's daughter sings on it! And Phil approves a great new T-shirt idea.

      <title>Ep 522 | Jase Calls Out Hollywood &amp; Phil Recalls Robertson Domino Games</title>
      <description>Jase points out the one huge movie trait that shows Hollywood filmmakers are unable to create what they do not already know. Al finds an old table that reminds him of Robertson family domino nights, and Phil explains the different rules for trash-talking your brother and your uncle. Jase jokes that he represents the most "non-educated" person in the family. Al laughs at Jase's stories about growing up in a different era from today's kids.

      <title>Ep 514 | Phil Nails Down the Difference Between Saving the Planet and Stewarding It </title>
      <description>Zach explains the entropy and its relationship to Romans 8. All creation wants to be liberated from its bondage to decay, and Jesus made this possible for all of humanity. Phil says the ones who want to save the planet will have to settle for stewarding it, as God told us to, and that there is an indestructible Kingdom already available. And Jase warns that heaven is not heaven because of golden streets, but because of the presence of God!

Zach shares what happens when you give glory to God.

      <title>Ep 508 | Jase Finds a Scripture That Really Makes People Uncomfortable &amp; Phil Calls Jase a Raggedy Priest</title>
      <description>Jase explains how a high priest used to be a bridge between man and God for attempted atonement, but now we have the ultimate high priest in Jesus Christ. Phil calls Jase a raggedy-looking priest — and flawed too! Jase shares a Bible verse about Jesus that really makes a lot of people uncomfortable, and Zach makes the point that we often mistakenly — and dangerously — view God as our own cosmic bellhop.

      <description>Phil finally gets to meet his new puppies, BoBo and BeBe, and he gets to enjoy sharing them with his grandchildren. Jase addresses the problem with those who feel compelled to compare moralities as an attempt to contribute to their own salvation. Jase says the problem with performance-based salvation is that when you outperform others, it crushes them, and when you fail to perform, it crushes you. And Zach shares his favorite Phil quote of all time: "Peace of mind is the rarest commodity of all time."

      <title>Ep 502 | Phil &amp; Jep Robertson Examine the Bigness of God &amp; How Much Sin Really Weighs</title>
      <description>Jase and Phil are joined by Jep Robertson in the studio to discuss the bigness of God and to ask why Jesus really had to die. Zach discusses the movie being filmed about Phil's life and his hopes that people will look at Phil and realize that you can never be too far gone to be saved by God. Jase and Jep exult in how no sin can outweigh the infinite blood of Christ. Jase examines the problem of pouring new wine into old wineskins. Zach tells the story of a friend of his who was a heroin addict who felt he needed to get his life straight before he decided to follow Jesus Christ, in order to be worthy of the calling. Phil explains how God is the one who sanctifies us, not that we practice the process of sanctification in order to be saved.

      <title>Ep 501 | Phil Believes Jesus Became a Human &amp; How Power Without Love Equals Tyranny</title>
      <description>Phil discusses the power of Jesus becoming flesh and bone and why his sharing in our humanity is a big deal. Jase discusses atonement and how humans cannot achieve it, but it can be obtained. Al talks about how power without matching love will cause division or tyranny, and Jase discusses the temptation that Jesus Christ struggled with, while remaining without sin. Al explains how anger is not a sin, and Jase explains why it is difficult to wrap your head around Jesus being the son of God, yet still God in human form.

      <title>Ep 498 | Phil Teaches How to Know if a Spirit Is from God &amp; Why You Can Never Be Too Far Gone</title>
      <description>Phil and Al are joined by Zach Dasher to discuss discernment, and Phil reveals how to really know whether a spirit is from God or not. Al points out that because of God's omnipresence and the grace of Jesus Christ, a human can never be too far gone to be redeemed by salvation that is not earned, but freely given. Al begins a discussion on the superiority of Jesus Christ that will continue through several chapters of Hebrews. Phil points out that humans want to be under a law and a system no matter what. And Zach brings up an idea explored by T.S. Eliot: that man dreams of systems so perfect that nobody will have to be good.

      <title>Ep 496 | Miss Kay Surprises Phil with a New Bobo &amp; Jase's Nickname Sticks</title>
      <description>Miss Kay tells Phil that his new dogs are on the way, after the recent passing of Bobo. Phil says he will name them Bobo and Bebe — Bobo wasn't the first Bobo, and he won't be the last! Jase explores the book of Hebrews with Al and Phil and how interesting it is that we are told to set our eyes on Jesus when we have believed but not yet seen. Al makes a point about blood health being used in the modern world to gauge how safe you are when it was Jesus' blood that was shed to save. And Jase's grandkids' new nickname for Jase finally sticks.

      <title>Ep 495 | Why Jase Was Told Not to Pray in School &amp; Why God Is Three Persons</title>
      <description>Larry Bowles is back in the studio to discuss the Holy Trinity and details what exactly Jesus brings to the Trinity and why we should care. Jase recalls being told not to pray in school because God would not hear his prayers. Larry goes into depth discussing the attributes of God: omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience. Jase breaks down why Jesus chose Judas, already knowing that he would soon betray him. And Larry paints a picture of the throne room, revealed in the book of Revelation, and how we will one day be in complete awe of God's glory.

      <title>Ep 491 | Jase Speaks Out on Struggles with Anxiety &amp; One Big Truth Atheists &amp; Agnostics Don't Get</title>
      <description>Phil names the rarest commodity, the most difficult to obtain, that anyone could ever hope for — then he tells you how to get it. Zach asks the question, "Who is He?" and looks at the terms diversity and unity, then asks what they have in common with submission to God. Jase says that the people who aren't even sure about God's existence don't realize that the Lord is near. Al explains how those who are trying to find the limits of their freedom have missed the point of being content in Christ. And Jase talks about those who struggle with anxiety and the decisions they have to make to experience peace of mind.

      <title>Ep 490 | Zach Questions Jase’s DIY Haircut &amp; Phil Redefines a Vacation</title>
      <description>The Robertson family is on vacation, and Phil is glad they got away! Zach thinks Jase's new DIY haircut is hilarious, but Jase was thrilled with the outcome. Jase discusses the mystery of godliness and tackles the difficulty of keeping yourself pure while dating before marriage. Zach details how your walk with Christ should be liberating, not binding you to a lifetime commitment of dodging sins. Zach explains how man is tempted to find a system so perfect that we will no longer have to be good. Phil goes into depth about laws having no impact on the crime rates, and Zach reveals the solution to sin ... yes, really.

      <title>Ep 483 | Willie Robertson Steals the Show &amp; Jesus Doesn’t Live Inside Your Church Building</title>
      <description>Phil is joined in the studio by three of his sons to discuss their ministries, and Willie tells a hilarious story of when he cast a large shadow on a stage where a man was attempting to speak to an audience ... and what he did next. Al explains that Phil never would have walked into a church building had a Christian not ventured outside the church walls to find him. Willie asks what God's ambassadors are doing if we cannot interact with the world and instead hide behind the structures we confuse for the church. Phil encourages those who speak about Jesus to the world to be patient and reminds them that the power is in the message they speak and not in their own strength. And Willie tells about a girl he encouraged to speak on Jesus and share the fruit that came from her desire to know God.

      <title>Ep 482 | Phil Warns Against Counterfeit Miracles &amp; How to Remove the Curse on America</title>
      <description>Phil says the Founding Fathers probably never even considered that modern-day Americans would argue over slaughtering their own little ones. Jase talks about the lie that was told to the beginning of humanity, that we could be like God ... without God. Phil warns against the counterfeit miracles that work to conceal evil so that mankind may be deceived and confuse the good for evil and the evil for good. Al and Jase discuss the "curse" that clings to America because it is a land that allowed for the killing of innocents through the practice of abortion.

      <title>Ep 481 | Phil Drops Wisdom on Nature Conservationists &amp; Jase Guesses Why Northerners Are Grumpy</title>
      <description>Jase discusses Louisiana history, zydeco music, southern culture, and the origin of the delicious Opelousas catfish. Phil has planted thousands of bald cypress trees and aided in wetland conservation in Louisiana, but he still has a message for some of nature's biggest fans. Jase explores the interesting traits and characteristics of catfish skins correlating to their location in the river, and the guys remember Si's ultimate basketball trick shot: "The Crane." Phil talks about his 30-foot-tall willows that were planted by wild blue heron, and Jase guesses that people up North are grumpy because they don't season the food up there.

      <title>EP 480 | Phil Issues Dire Warning About American Schools &amp; Miss Kay's Beater Had a Crazy Quirk</title>
      <description>Jase realizes how difficult it is to entertain today's youth, because they have an entire world of entertainment in their cell phones and nothing seems to impress them. Phil says it is time for Americans to consider homeschooling their children, and Al takes a look at the etymology of the word "ambassador." Phil reflects on the past, from his favorite old fishing reel brands to party line telephones and the mean old women who would hog the line. And Al remembers Miss Kay's old car that had a rusted-out floor that let you watch the road pass by or, as Jase put it, "the open floor spitoon."

      <description>Phil receives a gift from an "Unashamed" listener, and Jase can't wait to break out the hot sauce, crackers, and mustard. Phil provides some advice for people who like to prep by stockpiling food with a long shelf life for times of need. Jase discusses dying to one's own self both physically and emotionally every day as part of his spiritual discipline and daily worship of God. Al takes a look at our foreign brothers and sisters in Christ and the persecution they endure and provides a glimpse of the suffering even Paul experienced for God's name. Phil shares his insight concerning the quest for God's will in your own life, and he's got it boiled down to this: Whatever you do daily, bring Jesus with you. And Jase talks about how Jesus never seemed to be in a hurry, regardless of his earthly circumstances.

      <title>Ep 478 | Phil Takes On a Miserable Bathtub Experience &amp; Why Believers Shouldn’t Be Called Christians</title>
      <description>Phil shares a laughter-filled story about attempting to bathe in Miss Kay's new bathtub, when he left feeling clean but dissatisfied at best. Jase takes a look at the term "Christian" and explains why it's not quite what Jesus called his followers. Al makes a point about the scriptural difference between a "saint" and the word "holy," and Phil goes into detail about why it's dangerous to be an out-of-touch, bombastic type of person. He shares advice on how to maintain an even keel in your life and having a deep conviction about who Jesus really is. And Jase shares what he always tells his kids: Hope is not a plan when it comes to worldly endeavors.

      <title>Ep 476 | Jase Faces Disaster in an Electric Vehicle &amp; Phil Warns About Earthly Treasures</title>
      <description>Jase finds himself in an electric vehicle, struggling to climb a hill, and sliding into a dangerous situation, and Al talks about the problem with green energy getting its fuel from burning coal. Phil warns against earthly possessions and points toward the realm where nothing passes away. Jase reflects on the stock markets crashing and calls the earthly treasures of this world a distraction. Jase brags about his sons both shooting a 74 in a game of golf together and tells a story about his son's first time cooking crawfish for a dinner with his neighbors. And Al talks about learning contentment and what successful people have in common with each other: Once they reach their goal, they can't help but ask what is next.

      <title>Ep 474 | Jase Runs Straight Into Toddler Chaos, Uncle Si's Ball of Socks &amp; the Curse on America</title>
      <description>Jase learns about the sport of wee ball and the fun or chaos that comes with toddlers. Phil remembers his old coach, Scotty Robertson, and tells how he first got introduced to the game and where he got his first football, which replaced the ball of socks he and Si were playing with. Al laments the curse that is on America because of the millions of abortions that were allowed to take place over the past decades. Jase discusses people's tendency to associate their circumstance with God, either favorably or angrily. And Phil says people forget that the book of Revelation is a stack of seven letters written to seven churches, and he reminds us that God spits lukewarm Christians out of his mouth.

      <title>Ep 473 | Disrespecting Miss Kay, Phil's Outdated Views &amp; Why the Devil Targets American Masculinity</title>
      <description>Jase appoints Missy as the cloud in their relationship, because he relies on her for technology and her organizational skills. Al and Jase reflect on Phil's only rule growing up: "Don't you ever disrespect your mother." Phil asks why the devil would specifically target masculinity in America, and Jase recalls Phil's younger days, when his philosophy was centered on being physically tough and running barefoot through trees and rocks without showing pain. Phil called the practice, "Who's a man?" And the guys are joined by guest Jarrett Samuels, host of "The Pursuit of Manliness" podcast, to vigorously equip men for the pursuit of biblical manliness.

      <title>Ep 448 | Jase Describes Joy in Salvation &amp; Phil Explains Why Submitting to God Isn't 'All Rules'</title>
      <description>Jase describes feeling like an older brother to a group of people he was speaking to and how he was moved by the crowd's joy for their salvation. Phil explains that in order to truly change and experience the peace that comes with a repentant heart, there is a certain sobriety of mind that comes before any celebration. Jase shares a new riddle about treasure-seeking, and Phil shines light on why people have a misguided understanding about what submitting to God really is — and how it doesn't mean "all rules and no fun." And Al challenges us to find a place in scripture that requires people to forgive themselves.

      <title>Ep 443 | Phil Names the Title That All Believers Have &amp; Why Jase Is Not a Professional Speaker</title>
      <description>Phil explains how all believers share an innate title given to them by God and how it’s also a call to action that is still relevant today. Jase shares what he tells anyone who asks him to speak publicly at events, and Al asks Phil to share what was on his mind after he made his rapid life change at 28 years old. Jase tells a story about cooking fish for Missy and how it relates to a healthy marriage. And Phil teaches on 1 Corinthians 15 and the letters written to the churches of that time period.

      <title>Ep 442 | Jase Wrestles with the Animal Kingdom &amp; Phil Feels Strange Visiting Town</title>
      <description>Phil explains how strange it feels to go to town every four or five years when you make your home in ... the woods. Jase shares a hilarious story about the ebb and flow of the animal kingdom amid suburban living, and Al reminds us that we were sent as humans by God to rule over the Earth, including all the animals that roam it. Phil discusses unity in society and how bizarre it is to have a desire for justice against evil, yet completely disregard the possibility that the devil or even evil exist. And Jase explains how love is actually a daily choice rather than something we do when we feel like we love someone.

      <title>Ep 441 | Jase Tells How To Stop Sinful Family Cycles &amp; Phil Looks at the Relevance of God to America</title>
      <description>Jase takes a look at families and how the current generation has the ability to break family cycles of sin through the power of Jesus Christ to begin a bright and clean legacy. Al discusses the balance between order and chaos and what it has to do with real love. Phil reviews an old survey on religion in America from 1965 and compares it to a recent survey to illustrate the relevance of God in American eyes, and Jase shows how it's hard to really love people when you only see them once a week inside the walls of a church building. And Al makes a great point about how the scriptures that people choose to quarrel over are the very ones that urge believers to be united in Christ.

      <title>Ep 440 | Phil and Jase Disagree About Earth &amp; Phil Connects News of Jesus with the Gift of Tongues</title>
      <description>Phil explains why he believes the Earth is roughly 7,000 years old, while Al and Jase share a much different opinion on Earth's age. Phil makes a great point about how news of Jesus was rapidly spread across multiple regions with different languages around the same time that the Bible mentions the spiritual gift of tongues. Al discusses the theory of evolution and how it was used to strengthen his faith in the Lord. And Jase describes love and how its attributes are usually perceived by non-believers as signs of weakness, when they are actually incredibly strong and desirable characteristics.

      <title>Ep 433 | Jase Took a Plane Held Together with Duct Tape &amp; Phil Remembers Respecting His Elders</title>
      <description>Jase tells about the time that he took a special flight to Idaho in a rickety plane and his assistant declined to board. Phil recalls a time when men stood up for women, offered their seats to the elderly, and listened to what their elders had to say about life. Jase and Al discuss the nightmare that is commercial flights since all the rules and regulations have been implemented, and Phil tells of the progress in his and Miss Kay's ministry, where the smell of alcohol has slowly disappeared!

      <title>Ep  432 | Phil Rants About Humanity Gone Rogue &amp; Jase Shares a Biblical Guideline for Judgment</title>
      <description>Phil lets out a rant about the state of the modern world, comparing it to the rogue humanity of biblical times. Jase defines love in action for believers and shines some light on the topic of judgment against your brothers and sisters in Christ. Phil calls the inspired word of God a light that shines in darkest places, and Jase explains why love is never self-seeking. Phil and Al discuss how love can never delight in evil, and Jase describes the differences between worldly behavior and grace-motivated behavior.

      <title>Ep 430 | Phil Notices a Lack of Love in America &amp; Jase Reminds Us That What We Are Is Plain to God</title>
      <description>Jase reflects on one of his favorite scriptures in the book of 2 Corinthians and how man cannot be misunderstood by God. Phil has noticed that love for your fellow man has fallen far from what it once was in the past, even among some of the churches in America. Jase explains why he refuses to be paid for doing ministry work, and Al reflects on a time when he was a paid preacher himself and the effects it had on his life. Al tells about when Phil stepped in on his behalf during a difficult time, and Jase advises people to plant your seeds wherever there is an ear to listen, rather than traveling far and wide to do God's work.

      <title>Ep 429 | Phil Landed on a Cruise Ship &amp; Jase and Willie's Value Menu Adventure</title>
      <description>Al tells a funny story about one boat Phil did not want to be on, but he took the opportunity of a captive audience to preach the gospel. Jase shares a memory of a time he and Willie were boys and how they would pool their money to get the most bang for their buck out of a fast food value menu. Jase calls out churches for claiming their buildings are the "house of the Lord" and recalls a note left on a bathroom mirror from a young podcast fan named Jonathan. And Al talks about the fear of public speaking.

      <title>Ep 428 | Jase Loses an Ice Chest on the Highway &amp; Phil Warns Against Idolatry</title>
      <description>Jase shares a very funny story about his ice chest falling out of his truck bed on the freeway. Al recalls miscalculating a road trip by a great distance. Jase reminds people that we rely on God's faithfulness instead of ourselves so that we do not have to carry the burdens of worry. Phil defines idolatry and warns against the ways we may worship an idol without realizing it. Jase reviews the way people who witnessed miracles still struggle with faith, and Phil gives Miss Kay's quail sandwiches high marks!

      <title> Ep 427 | Why Jase Refuses Paid Ministry &amp; 'Extra Grace Required'</title>
      <description>Al lists the top 10 things he wishes he had known when he started ministry, and Jase reveals why religion is not a puzzle to be solved. Jase tells a story about why he avoids paid ministry positions, and Al discusses popular culture and how values are determined by an unchanging standard, which is something pop culture lacks. Al relates his time being a preacher to the things taught by the Bible's speakers and teachers. And Jase disagrees with the view of "extra grace required" that is often found among believers when judging others.

Guest Bob DeMoss brings Phil a special gift and talks about collaborating with Phil and Al on the "Duck Commander Bible."

      <title>Ep 374 | Jase Won’t Stop Interrupting HIMSELF &amp; the Misery of Zuck's Creepy, Dystopian Metaverse</title>
      <description>Jase, Al, and Zach find Mark Zuckerberg and his "metaverse" creepy and disturbing, and Al suspects we'll be even more disturbed when we find out who "the android" running Facebook really is. Jase is so rude he interrupts himself — repeatedly. Phil offers up a little philosophy inspired by Chicago lyrics. Zach points out that today's disconnected, superficial culture presents a prime opportunity for the Gospel to flourish. Al dubs Jase the "world’s greatest garbage man." Phil explains why many people are called to do things for God but few are chosen. And Zach argues that technology isn't the real problem — it's the isolation of living your life virtually and worshipping created things instead of the Creator.

Jase describes his experience with the “Chosen Army” and says its members are “high on Jesus.” Ryan Lee, director of One Kingdom, drops by. Larry Bowles recaps the sermon he delivered on Romans 7 at WFR Church on Sunday. And Phil and Jase discuss how much power Satan has.

      <title>Ep 300 | Jase Gets a Black Eye Without Leaving the House &amp; What NOT to Do When Someone Is in Pain </title>
      <description>Jase walks through a closed door, and Missy didn't quite have the reaction he was hoping for. That leads to a discussion on marriage, people who choose not to marry, and temptation before marriage. Al admits he moved his wedding date up because biology was about to take over theology. Jase learned the hard way that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Phil doesn't believe Jase's story about a girl who came on to him in high school. The guys discuss what people miss about predestination, why Jase believes in God-orchestrated encounters, and remembering to look at things from God's perspective, not yours. Al closes with the best advice you'll ever hear about how to help people who are hurting and what kind of help they DON'T need.

      <description>Jase takes on more than a dozen bats in an epic 48-hour battle, but a tennis racket, Google, a phone call to Missy, and a sheet are no match for the creepy invaders squatting in his house.

And Phil, Jase, and Zach dig into what "the obedience of faith" means, what Jesus' death started, what the Gospel is, and the difference between how humans and God approach power.

      <title>Ep 264 | When Phil Met Steven Tyler, Willie's Diet Competition, and Churches and Gender Pronouns</title>
      <description>Phil rocks out to Alice Cooper, and he and Al remember the time Aerosmith's Steven Tyler approached them in a hotel lobby. Jase has another close encounter of the convenience store kind when someone yells at him to put a mask on. He also has a run-in with a couple of guys who don't take kindly to his kind at the golf course. Al and Jase tell the story of how competitive (and MEAN) Willie got when he made a weight-loss bet. Phil reveals what helped his faith more than anything, and it never would have happened without "Duck Dynasty." Al talks about engaging on gender pronouns and other cultural issues when even churches try to muzzle us. And the guys discuss spiritual decapitation, whether or not it's biblical for women to be ambassadors of the church, and stuffy church rules that burn bridges instead of bringing people closer to Jesus.

      <title>Ep 259 | Jase's Circumcision Question, It's Hard to Love Judgmental People, and an R-Rated Verse</title>
      <description>Mia is headed back to school less than a month after major surgery. Phil, Jase, and Al love how unifying it was to hold the Masters in Georgia amid all the controversy and boycotts — even if Phil does find golf stressful and embarrassing. In another chapter of "Jase's Grocery Store Chronicles," someone grills Jase about how Jesus could be a plan. Jase has been in plenty of men's rooms, and there's something in the Bible he just can't figure out about circumcision. And the guys talk about why it's much harder to show grace to people who are legalistic, the R-rated verse you don't hear in many sermons, and how changed lives become evidence of God's grace.

      <description>Phil, Jase, and Al laugh their way through solving the mysterious case of the missing Wisconsin cheese. They're not exactly sure how 100 pounds of Phil's cheese made its way to Al's house, but they're delighted (and relieved) to discover that yes, eating cheese is biblical! Jase heads out to do some metal detecting and comes back with an eight-legged passenger in his navel. And the guys discuss the idea of original sin and answer an audience question about what age children first become accountable for sin.

      <title>Ep 255 | Phil Uses a Fake Name, Baptizes a Preacher, and Makes Off with Jase's King Cake</title>
      <description>Phil gives a fake name to two women who got lost and ended up at his church building on Easter, and Jase can't quite figure out why. Phil just seems to attract unusual people to his unusual church plant, including a preacher who wants to be baptized. The guys get into what the Bible says about dressing up for church services, the kickoff of crawfish season, and weird preacher fashion trends. And Jase eats the greatest king cake he's ever had, but it disappears. It looks like Phil is the culprit, but that's not the only mystery surrounding this dessert.

      <title>Ep 247 | An Update on Mia Robertson's Extensive Surgery and the Difficult Recovery Ahead</title>
      <description>Jase is back with an update on how his daughter, Mia, is doing after her longest, most extensive craniofacial surgery yet. He describes many of the challenges ahead, including swelling that will last 12 months. Phil marvels that he's never heard a word of complaint from Mia. Jase is nearly defeated by NASCAR-like driving conditions in Dallas and has to play the "I have a gun" card at his hotel, but an encounter with a young couple at the hospital fills him with encouragement. And Phil opens it up with a story about netting a big (and nasty) surprise. Thanks for your prayers and support!

      <description>Phil, Al, and One Kingdom's Mike Kellett talk favoritism, why the self-segregation spreading on college campuses and beyond is so unbiblical, and why violence always follows prejudice.

And Phil offers a reminder that God doesn't live in church buildings.

      <title>Ep 219 | Jase's Spiritual Stocks, the Bible on Investing and Tattoos, and Lying to the Holy Spirit</title>
      <description>Jase says more power to the retail investors who went up against hedge funds shorting GameStop, but he's sticking with long-term investments. Phil, Jase, and Al look at what the Bible says about investing and acquiring wealth, and Jase finds a parable in Luke that makes for a good stock market analogy. The guys also discuss what the Bible tells Christians about tattoos, why you don't want to mess around with the Holy Spirit, hypocrisy in those who represent heaven, the stock market in your heart, and whether you can make the argument that scaring the hell out of people is biblical.

        <![CDATA[<p>Jase says more power to the retail investors who went up against hedge funds shorting GameStop, but he's sticking with long-term investments. Phil, Jase, and Al look at what the Bible says about investing and acquiring wealth, and Jase finds a parable in Luke that makes for a good stock market analogy. The guys also discuss what the Bible tells Christians about tattoos, why you don't want to mess around with the Holy Spirit, hypocrisy in those who represent heaven, the stock market in your heart, and whether you can make the argument that scaring the hell out of people is biblical.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Ep 217 | Phil Checks Out Fireball Videos, Why There Are Atheists, and Do You Need to Be Rebaptized?</title>
      <description>Phil doesn't remember ever running out of gas, but Jase sure does, and it reminds him of how he used to siphon gas for Phil. Al recalls the last time he burned an egg carton. And speaking of burning things, for a guy who doesn't own a cellphone, Phil knows a lot about viral explosion videos. Jase is not a fan of churches that will only baptize you if you "join." The guys also talk about the world's sorriest gas cans, and they answer two audience questions: Why did God put atheists on the Earth, and do you need to be baptized again if you fall away from your walk with God?

      <description>Phil, Jase, and Al have a whole lot to say about persecuting believers, those who look down on Christians, and the spirit of boldness that emerges when the culture tries to shut you down and shut you up. Al says they're coming for us, and they want to redefine misinformation and stop "this thing" from spreading. Would Martin Luther King Jr.'s message be tolerated in today's culture? Jase finds a blueprint in Acts 4 for how to respond to persecution, and he shares a recent deli encounter that drew an unexpected crowd.

      <description>Phil unveils his theory on why we still can't get enough toilet paper and paper towels. Jase finally finds his favorite brand of paper towels, but there's a twist he didn't see coming. The guys dive into Acts 2 and how the disciples were given the ability to be heard in all languages. Jase offers his response to "What would Jesus do?" Phil makes a pitch for what to put on church signs. And Zach and Jase discuss the dangers of making a name for yourself. God often uses the last person you'd expect, in a way you'd never choose. But if people speaking different languages can't stop the spread of the Gospel, censorship can't stop it either.

Jase has a theory about why the scam artists picked Phil's face for the CBD hoax. Phil considers the influence of the Father of Lies, Al talks about the Parler shutdown and where we're headed, and Zach points out the kingdom work being done online. Jase has been censored for "sensitive" content before, but he's pumped about his Jesus ground game. And the guys discuss the Holy Spirit as the ultimate ace card, why Judas betrayed Jesus, and why seeing miracles isn't enough to save someone.

      <title>Ep 195 | When Phil Kicked Miss Kay Out, How Lisa Told Al the Truth, Double Lives, and Desperation | Ep 195</title>
      <description>Miss Kay and Lisa Robertson sit down in the Unashamed Lair with Phil and Al. After roasting Jase in his absence, the ladies open up about what it's really like to be a Robertson woman. Miss Kay reveals what attracted her to Phil, what she had against nice boys, how their first date went, and why Phil dumped her when they were teenagers. Lisa explains how she and Al got together, what their relationship was like when she just thought she was a Christian, and how she told Al the truth about her affair. This sets the stage for a candid discussion of the ways we justify sin, living a double life, and the desperate moments that lead to healing when we cry out for God.

      <title>Ep 194 | When Phil Thought He Met an Angel, Jesus' Last Words From the Cross, and How to Forgive</title>
      <description>Phil remembers thinking Dan's dad might be an angel, so of course he had to ask. Al recalls driving his cheap car 3 miles in reverse.

      <description>Si Robertson grabs a seat in the Unashamed Lair to share the big news about the debut of his new podcast, Duck Call Room, on Thursday, Dec. 3.

      <title>Ep 182 | Phil Rips Thanksgiving Lockdowns, Biden's 'Unity' &amp; Morrissey vs. the Duckmen</title>
      <description>Jase finds the authoritarian Thanksgiving restrictions in California and Oregon absurd, and Phil has a pretty good idea where the rules are coming from and where they're headed. Al is sick of the mask hypocrisy from the "orange man bad" crowd. The guys are fed up with coronavirus restrictions being used to go after believers, and they're not expecting Joe Biden to keep any of his "kumbaya" promises. But first, Phil, Jase, and Al are unashamed to hunt and eat game despite Morrissey's refusal to do a TV appearance with them. The guys drool over Phil's hamburger recipe, but Jase has one good reason he likes vegetarians. And with duck season about to start, Phil and Jase have never seen this many ducks.

      <title>Ep 180 | Phil Learns About Email, Jase's Fried Deer Recipe, and Who Do You Think You Are?</title>
      <description>Phil and Jase talk about creative (and delicious!) ways to cook deer, why eating game is biblical, and why young deer are way better than big bucks. Phil likes to eat wild game, but mounting it on the wall isn't really his thing. Jase explains the concept of email to Phil. The guys respond to a question that comes up when we go public about the Gospel: "Who do you think you are?" And Phil laments that in today's culture, the "truth" doesn't include Jesus.

And Jase has Al in stitches as he moves the conversation from John 9 to the purpose of saliva to breaking wind and how we know God has a sense of humor.</p><p><br></p><p>Get Jesus Politics by Phil Robertson, available now: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Politics-Back-Soul-America/dp/1400210062/">https://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Politics-Back-Soul-America/dp/1400210062/</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Ep 123 | Jase Attempts a Bathroom MacGyver, Spitting in the South &amp; Why Bad Things Happen (Part 2) </title>
      <description>Phil, Jase, and Al discuss the many reasons why bad things happen to good people and how Jesus heals. This requires an unexpected detour into spitting as a southern cultural phenomenon, spitting in baseball, and spitting in the Bible. The guys also discuss the tree of life, sin, and restoration. But first, Jase tries to MacGyver the drain in his bubbling, gurgling bathroom, and his hairball fishing expedition doesn't quite cut it.

      <title>Ep 122 | Phil Robertson Is Cut Deep by Thomas Jefferson, Schooling Don Lemon &amp; Why Bad Things Happen</title>
      <description>Phil, Jase, and Al tackle amateur theologian Don Lemon's ignorance about Jesus and begin a discussion of why God allows bad things to happen to people. But first, Jase talks about the death of Missy's grandmother and why believers can find solace when a loved one dies. Al and Phil talk about Phyllis' inspiring blog. Jase has a bone to pick with how some people interpret the end of "The Outlaw Josey Wales," and he expresses his annoyance with mask manufacturers. And Phil is devastated by one of Thomas Jefferson's failures.

      <title>Ep 121 | Phil Proves Self-Defense Is Biblical, Jase's Scary Supper, and Animal Control Visits Willie</title>
      <description>Phil, Jase, and Al explain why Jesus wasn't a pacifist and lay down biblical defenses of the right to protect yourself and others. But first, it might be time for Phil to patent his tried-and-true technique for amplifying his hearing. Jase strikes fear in his teenage houseguests with his "terrifying" supper and gives Missy a scare when he discovers a critter on his property. And animal control pays a visit to Willie's place after an unusual deer incident.

      <title>Ep 120 | The Two Things Phil Robertson Won't Do, Calamity Jase, and Trying to Find a Church</title>
      <description>Phil has two things he definitely won't do, and he thinks it's about time for Jase to follow suit. Jase's first frog hunt of the season is full of calamities, and he plays a really bad game of golf. Phil encounters a heckler who accuses him of white supremacy. Al and Phil have a strong dislike of church pews. And the guys talk about what a redneck really is, choosing a church, picking a denomination, and why the whole idea of trying to find a church doesn't make much sense.

      <title>Ep 119 | How Phil Started His Podcast and Why You Have Hope Even if You Don't Know It Yet</title>
      <description>Phil shares the surprising request that led him to launch the Unashamed podcast and tries to figure out the difference between uploads and downloads. And Zach joins Phil and Jase to discuss all things hope: the Scriptures you'll want to read, the biblical definition of hope, loneliness and boredom, living hope, a story about dead carcasses, and why you all have hope even if you don't realize it yet.

      <title>Ep 118 | Phil's Most Unusual and Creative Baptisms, Offensive Jesus, and Slaves to Sin </title>
      <description>Phil gets plenty of unusual baptism requests, but wheelchairs, tracheotomies, and fighting dogs are no match for him. Jase shares the story of baptizing a woman who suffered from a crippling fear of water. And Phil, Al, Jase, and Zach discuss urban flight, why Jesus was offensive to so many people, the difference between believing in God and believing God, the truth about freedom and slavery, and the line only God could deliver.

      <title>Ep 117 | How Many Rednecks Does It Take to Change a Light Bulb? </title>
      <description>Jase kicks this one off with an embarrassing story about changing a bathroom light bulb for Missy. He also shares his household beverage problem and describes how a gaggle of surprise house guests reacted to his cellphone rules. Phil talks about what it means to live as children of the light and admits he has a cellphone exception. Phil, Al, Jase, and Zach take a deep dive into John 8:12. And Jase gets a kick out of googling "eternal light" and "biophotons."

And the guys discuss adultery, forgiveness, mobs, and rioters who cast stones.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://TommyJohn.com/PHIL">https://TommyJohn.com/PHIL</a> </p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://Adjace.com">https://Adjace.com</a> </p><p><br></p><p>Yo Mama Wasn’t A Monkey by Tex Cyrus <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Momma-Wasnt-Monkey-Tex-Cyrus/dp/B0863V2HHS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=34LXMDZ3JFX8U&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=yo+mama+wasnt+a+monkey&amp;qid=1594824611&amp;sprefix=yo+mama+wa%2Caps%2C203&amp;sr=8-1">https://www.amazon.com/Momma-Wasnt-Monkey-Tex-Cyrus/dp/B0863V2HHS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=34LXMDZ3JFX8U&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=yo+mama+wasnt+a+monkey&amp;qid=1594824611&amp;sprefix=yo+mama+wa%2Caps%2C203&amp;sr=8-1</a></p><p><br></p><p>Pre-order Jesus Politics by Phil Robertson: <a href="http://jesuspoliticsbook.com">http://jesuspoliticsbook.com</a></p><p><br></p><p>See episodes of "Unashamed with Phil Robertson": <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=b56SDQ5Xq8A-hWX65gsaT2uJ-W18MTU1NzIzMjIxOUAxNTU3MTQ1ODE5&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2J4XsiX&amp;v=SO3j3UWDTjA">https://bit.ly/2J4XsiX</a></p><p> </p><p>See clips from Phil's TV show "In the Woods with Phil": <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=b56SDQ5Xq8A-hWX65gsaT2uJ-W18MTU1NzIzMjIxOUAxNTU3MTQ1ODE5&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2PNM6k1&amp;v=SO3j3UWDTjA">https://bit.ly/2PNM6k1</a></p><p> </p><p>To take a FREE 30 Day Trial of Phil's TV show and the rest of BlazeTV: <a href="https://www.BlazeTV.com/Phil">https://www.BlazeTV.com/Phil</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>In this hairy episode, Phil, Jase, and Al reveal what happened when they saw Willie's new haircut, Jase recalls how it felt when he shaved his beard, and Phil is reminded that the last time he shaved his beard was after a bet 30 years ago. The guys discuss the hilarious way they got into doing TV, which shotgun they'd hunt with if they could only have one, God's promises, and how Christ fulfilled the law. And don't miss Phil's mic-drop moment on why you never rule out the Italians.

      <title>Ep 110 | Phil Breaks Quarantine, the Guy Who Kept Cursing God, and Jase Shares Jesus with a Nurse</title>
      <description>After quarantining for months, Phil finally heads back to town. Phil is also dealing with beavers, bears, and gators, and he comes up with another good reason to avoid the beach. Jase has a curious experience at a traffic roundabout and finds a way to share Jesus during an insurance appointment. Phil tells the story of what happened to the customer who called him and cursed God over and over. And Jase has a strong reaction to PC culture.

      <description>Phil prays for a mass awakening in America, and Jase explains why everything going on these days makes this an epic time for Jesus. But first, Phil reads from his new book, "Jesus Politics," and says people at the New York Times will wince when they see how well it's doing. Phil, Al, Jase, and Zach also discuss the narrow road to the kingdom of God, the King of kings, Marxism, justice, and the isolation of the internet. And is Jase the bad boy of the podcast?

      <title>Ep 106 | Phil Robertson vs. the Damming Evidence and a Culture That Forgot Jesus</title>
      <description>Phil may not be a ninja, but he knows what it takes to win a fight against the local beavers: It's time for Operation Mother of All Commode Flushes. Phil's dangerous plan from episode 101 gets a reboot, and Phil tells Jase and Al why their advice on beaver dam removal leaves something to be desired. Jase brings up a question about who gets saved and explains why Jesus is so loved and so hated. And Phil looks at our culture and doesn't find a whole lot of Jesus, especially in the schools.

      <description>Phil, Jase, and Al reminisce about the greatest weenies, honey buns, and donuts ever made and try to figure out why the best foods get discontinued. Phil recommends his favorite sardines, discusses how to break a cursing habit, and recalls the times Mark Zuckerberg censored him. The guys discuss the importance of nourishing and training ourselves spiritually, not just physically. And they tackle a question from the audience about why God would allow someone to be born if he knows they're going to hell.

      <title>Ep 103 | Phil Robertson Takes on Our Culture of Overreaction, Lying &amp; Why Self-Control Is Underrated </title>
      <description>Phil is NOT a fan of how much people overreact these days, especially when it leads to lost jobs and being "canceled." Jase and Al tell the story of a young family member who caused an explosive incident on their vacation and how he came clean about it. Jase identifies the most underrated quality of the Holy Spirit and explains why the Bible isn't like a college course.

And the guys answer an audience question: How can you work a full-time job and still be happy?

      <title>Ep 73 | Socialists' Pandemic Power-Grab, Phil's Selfie Discovery, and the Kingdom of God Is Here! </title>
      <description>The coronavirus pandemic has taken dependence on government to a whole new level, and Phil says the socialist agenda right now is the scariest thing he's ever seen. Phil discovers selfies, and the look on his face as Jase fills him in is as funny as you'd think. And a lot of religious people are waiting for the Kingdom of God, but Phil, Jase, and Al make a rock-solid case that the Kingdom is here and we're a part of it.

      <title>Ep 66 | Coronavirus PANIC: Fear of the Unknown, Fear of God, and Fear of the Zombie Apocalypse</title>
      <description>Phil, Jase, and Al wonder if the media is overstating the coronavirus panic. That leads to a discussion about fear of the virus, fear of the unknown, fear of God, and of course, fear of the zombie apocalypse. The Robertsons also explain the key to being free of anxiety when everyone else is falling apart and ponder why some people's minds go blank when they try to picture God.
