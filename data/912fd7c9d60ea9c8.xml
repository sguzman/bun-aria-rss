   <media:description>Today I will unveil my haplogroup map of the world. Haplogroups are genetic markers that reveal many interesting facts and clues about historical interactions between different populations and in today's video I will be showing my map of the various paternal haplogroups that I have chosen to represent on this map. More to come. Thanks for watching!

   <media:description>Today let's take a look at arguably one of America's strangest religions, the bearded men of the Amish and Anabaptists faiths. We will be going over the origins of the Amish, Mennonites and other Anabaptists in the European continent and their journey from Siberia, to the American frontier and even to the depths of the Amazon rainforest. From Pennsylvania to Bolivia, the Anabaptists continue their unusual luddite form of Christianity that prohibits them from using many forms of modern technology and the ramifications for this cultural microcosm in the future of the US, Latin America and elsewhere.

   <media:description>Well kids, I finally came back out with the milk. Thank you all for your glorious patience and fortitude during these tough times and let's take a look at the Masamap for Eastern Asia and Oceania, 2 geographically close, but demographically diverse regions that stretches from Mongolia to New Zealand.

There are thousands of different people groups throughout this region, but I did my best to map them out in a way that made sense for the various demographic parameters of each country. More improvements will be made before the release of the final map. Thanks for watching!</media:description>

   <media:description>What are the most extreme cases of human depopulation for a given region in history? Although it has long been thought by sociologists that the human population of the planet is in dire straits of growing exponentially to the point of mass overpopulation, demographic analysis has proven this beyond a shadow of a doubt to be false. Although many areas are still growing, other nations and regions have a depopulation crisis currently brewing and only expected to get worse in the future.

Today, we will be looking at some cases of historic and future depopulation, wherein humans either stop having children, or participate in mass migration to a foreign land (either willingly or unwillingly). This video is not meant to offend anyone from any given country but simply to discuss the reality of the situation for many regions in the past, present and future. Thanks for watching!

   <media:description>Who exactly is an immigrant? Immigration is a hot topic of discussion in many countries, although it's interesting to think that when you go back far enough, literally every single person on Earth is descended from immigrants at one point in time.

In today's video, we're going to be setting parameters for just who constitutes an &quot;immigrant&quot; in the modern age and looking at countries and territories around the world that have large immigrant-descended populations, many of which you would not have expected. Thanks for watching!

   <media:description>Today I will be unveiling part 3 of my series showcasing the ethno-racial map of South-Central Asia aka the Middle East, India and Central Asia. This is by far one of the most diverse regions of human habitation on Earth, from a genetic, linguistic, cultural, religious and phenotypic standpoint and hence is of great interest to many around the world, including myself.

Apologies for the delays. I lost a lot of progress due to my crappy computer, but thank you so much for waiting and being patient! Stay tuned, the rest is coming, I've been working on so many projects lately that I'm getting side-tracked and struggling with finishing any of them, but needless to say, they are all awesome and you will not be disappointed. Thank you so much for watching!</media:description>

   <media:description>Here is the latest installment in the 2021 Masamap series chronicling the distinct ethno-racial-religious-linguistic groups of the world, this time focused on the European continent. With over 700 million people, Europe is certainly a hardy task to pinpoint the different ethnic and cultural identities that transcend borders and modern nations, but I feel I have created a good representation of not only the historic ethnic groups of the continent, but also some of the more contentious nuances surrounding the linguistic and religious makeup of some of these groups.

Part 3 will be out shortly, followed by an eventual release of the full map, but keep in mind, some of the areas may change, as I reserve the right to revise and edit my work. Thank you all so much for the encouragement and patience you've shown over the years and thanks for watching!</media:description>

   <media:description>The beginning of the Masaman 2021 ethno-racial map of the world is here.

Well, it took almost 2 years, but my final map of humanity is almost at an end. It's been a wild ride and this journey has taught me more than I ever thought possible about fascinating ethnic, racial and religious groups across the world from far and wide. In today's video we'll be doing a brief overview of some of my work so far, particularly on the continent of Africa, which was probably the most difficult and time-consuming out of any region, but one of the most fun as well.

I'll be releasing the full map and all iterations of it in the upcoming weeks, and will include all of the sources I used as well. Thank you for your patience and thank you all so much for watching!</media:description>

   <media:description>What would the world look like if I could redraw the countries? Ever since I was a young boy, I dreamed of reshaping the nations of the Earth for my own amusement. What if this country existed? What about that? Little did I know that the alternate history genre was already well under way.

In today's video, I will be discussing some potential countries that I would create if I had the power to redraw the world's borders (without cutting through existing nations). I will be going over the reasons why I think a union or unification would be beneficial to the various territories and the demographic ramifications of such countries existing. This is 100% for fun and some minor education as well, so please don't take anything here personally. Happy New Year and thanks for watching!</media:description>

   <media:description>Who were the Mughals exactly and what on Earth happened to this civilization and empire? The Mughals were one of the biggest empires to ever encompass South Asia, at one point nearly spanning the entirety of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. Islam has a long history in India and South Asia that can be tied to many different empires and dynasties, although the Mughals are probably the most well known.

Procrastination sucks doesn't it? In today's video we're going to be taking a brief look at the rise and fall of the Mughal Empire and discuss just where they came from and where they went since very few to none identify as Mughals in the present day. Yes, I realize a lot of Indians really don't like the Mughals, just chill out for a minute. Thanks for watching!</media:description>

   <media:description>What on Earth happened to the Circassians? The Caucasus is an interesting region with a load of many diverse and unique peoples such as the Armenians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis, but what about the groups that you probably haven't heard of? Thousands of years before the present day, different peoples inhabited parts of Europe and the Near East who, linguistically-speaking, are entirely unrelated to the groups we see there today. The Circassians are an example of such an ancient people.

In today's video we're going to be looking at the history and culture of the Circassians and some of the surrounding Caucasian natives like the Abkhaz, Chechens, Ingush and Dagestanis. Thanks for watching!

The Tatars are arguably Europe's oldest remaining Islamic community, stretching back many hundreds (possibly over a thousand) years and today number in the tens of millions. Scattered over many parts of Eastern Europe, the Tatars are divided between a multitude of different groups with very diverse origins and histories.

The different Tatar groups, which includes those with a range of phenotypes and cultures; from more East Asian, European or Middle Eastern-looking individuals as well as those belonging to traditional Islamic, Christian, pagan and even Jewish communities. Thanks for watching!

   <media:description>What are the origins and genetic makeup of the Vietnamese, Cambodians and other Austroasiatic people? Vietnam and Cambodia have a very ancient history that is linked to many major civilizations of East, South and Southeast Asia, and today, we're going to see how they have impacted and been impacted by these groups in the past several thousand years. We're also going to be taking a look at some of the smaller Austroasiatic groups related to the larger Kinh and Khmer that you've probably never heard of such as the Mon, Nicobarese, Orang Asli and Munda, who are all scattered far and wide.

In today's video, we're going to be discussing just how and why they got there and why they all have such a diverse array of appearance, culture and genetics. Thanks for watching!

   <media:description>What on Earth happened to the Arab Christians? Christianity has been in the Middle East for 20 centuries now, but just what does it mean to be an &quot;Arab Christian&quot; or &quot;Christian Arab&quot;? Does such a designation even exist? In today's video, we'll be discussing some of the history of Islamization and Arabization in the regions of the Levant, Egypt and the Maghreb and how this has affected the demographics and identities of their indigenous Christian population.

The complex ethno-religious and political situation of the Middle East has been shaped by generations and generations of migrations, conflicts, assimilation and cultural shifts. Arabic-speaking Christians are an often glossed over demographic in the minds of many Americans and Westerners, but they are an important part of the historical and current situation in the region. Thanks for watching!

   <media:description>The countries and people of the Middle East/West Asia and North Africa are very often group together from a cultural, genetic, linguistic and religious point of view, but are Middle Easterners and North Africans the same race? There are many different interesting people groups and cultures originating from Southwest Eurasia and they have influenced and been influenced by almost every region on Earth, despite what many may think.

In today's video we're going to be looking at the history and pre-history of the Greater Middle Eastern region and see where they line up from a genetic standpoint and how religion, language and different historical events have shaped the modern people groups across this mega-region.
