Patricia worked for many years in the US Foreign Service. Before this time, she was with a non-profit organization and met nine women who fought against the French and the Americans in the Vietnam War.

We spoke about the book, Saigon Sisters, these women, and the Indochina and Vietnam Wars.<br />
(THE AUDIO PLAYER IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POST.)<br />
Editor’s note: Patricia Norland sent an email clarifying a statement she made during the Interview: “Separately, I should clarify my statement about &#8220;managing&#8221; the Fulbright program while serving in HCMC; my job was to manage exchange programs, but Fulbright, wisely, establishes a Commission in each country (with ED) that &#8212; while coordinating with others&#8211; runs the program.&#8221;<br />
0:42 &#8211; Patricia talks about why she wrote this book and how she met the women she wrote about.<br />

16:59 &#8211; Patricia shares some of the revolutionary poems that these fighters wrote.<br />
19:51 &#8211; Patricia talks about how these teenagers were recruited into the revolution.<br />
23:39 &#8211; Patricia reads a passage regarding the Japanese occupation of Vietnam and their misuse of rice by troops.<br />
25:59 &#8211; Patricia talks about where these women ended up once they joined up with the revolution.<br />
30:42 &#8211; Patricia reads a passage from the first woman in the group who joined the Vietnamese Maquis.<br />
33:14 &#8211; Patricia talks about the research she did for the book and the interviews she did.<br />
38:19 &#8211; Patricia talks about the personal items from the war that these women showed her.<br />
41:41 &#8211; Patricia talks about how these women could have had much easier lives if they had turned away from the war. She also addresses how there is disappointment about what happened after 1975.<br />
44:06 &#8211; Patricia talks more about the disillusionment of their struggle.<br />
46:21 &#8211; Patricia talks about the American presence in Vietnam.<br />
49:53 &#8211; Patricia talks about how these women continued fighting against the Americans once they replaced the French.<br />
