      <title>Lauren Shares Her Magical Birthday, and Sheena Melwani Brings Pure Joy</title>
      <description>Lauren is back to catch you up on her amazing birthday weekend! She talks about seeing Harry Potter on the Broadway stage, while reminding us not to be during a live performance.
And later, Lauren talks with Sheena Melwani, singer/songwriter, TikTok superstar and creator of the "Real Indian Dad" series. Sheena talks about her path to finding success in a way she never saw coming, and eventually revealing the identity of Real Indian Dad (who for the record is her husband, not her father).

Lauren also designates the "Chic of the Week" (the movie ‘Dune’) and "Shit of the Week" (where is our Fall-iday?!?). Plus, Adele -- please, just drop the album already.

As a correspondent for Entertainment Tonight, Lauren is plugged into the world of Hollywood, and whether she's reviewing the newest binge-worthy television, dissecting Hollywood gossip and pop culture news, debating fashion trends or even diving into self-improvement, she is serving you a big glass of Chic. Shit. Only. Every week she’ll examine what’s chic and what’s just shit these days, chat with carefully chosen guests about the chic shit they're into, and answer your questions on life, love (p.s. yes, she's the Lauren who comes home to Chris Harrison every night) and careers too. If you know and love Lauren from her 'The Bachelor' recap show Roses and Rose, know that now she's here to be your best babe, make you laugh and help clear the shit out of your life! This is Chic Shit Only. </p><p><em>Watch the podcast on YouTube: https://bit.ly/ChicShitOnlyYT</em></p><p><em>Watch the podcast on IG: https://bit.ly/ChicShitOnlyIG</em></p><p><em>Don’t forget to subscribe to the podcast for free wherever you're listening or by using this link: </em><a href="https://bit.ly/ChicShitOnlyPodcast">https://bit.ly/ChicShitOnlyPodcast</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/laurenzima/?hl=en"><em>Follow Lauren on IG</em></a></p><p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@laurenzima?"><em>Follow Lauren TikTok</em></a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/laurenzima"><em>Follow Lauren on Twitter</em></a> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.
