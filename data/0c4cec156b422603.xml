      <title>Still Watching: Mosquito Coast with Melissa George</title>
      <description>On this special episode of the Still Watching podcast, presented by Apple TV+ and Vanity Fair, hosts Preeti Chhibber and Chris Feil discuss the latest episode, set at the elaborate Mexican hacienda where the Fox family takes refuge after a harrowing journey through the desert. What seems initially to be an oasis, with fancy bedrooms and even an in-house mezcal distillery, quickly turns sinister, particularly with the arrival of family matriarch Lucrecia (Ofelia Medina). By episode's end it's the Fox family matriarch Margot (Melissa George) who has taken control, shepherding her children to safety and wielding a gun in a way that seems to reveal plenty about her and Allie's mysterious past. 

After discussing the show thus far and how it's telling the story of an American family on the run, Preeti talks to Melissa George about how she came on board the project, how she's playing Margot as a woman born of privilege who decided to go on the run with her eccentric husband, and what might come next in the remaining episodes of Mosquito Coast's seven-part season.

        <![CDATA[<p>On this special episode of the <em>Still Watching</em> podcast, presented by Apple TV+ and <em>Vanity Fair</em>, hosts Preeti Chhibber and Chris Feil discuss the latest episode, set at the elaborate Mexican hacienda where the Fox family takes refuge after a harrowing journey through the desert. What seems initially to be an oasis, with fancy bedrooms and even an in-house mezcal distillery, quickly turns sinister, particularly with the arrival of family matriarch Lucrecia (Ofelia Medina). By episode's end it's the Fox family matriarch Margot (Melissa George) who has taken control, shepherding her children to safety and wielding a gun in a way that seems to reveal plenty about her and Allie's mysterious past. </p><p><br></p><p>After discussing the show thus far and how it's telling the story of an American family on the run, Preeti talks to Melissa George about how she came on board the project, how she's playing Margot as a woman born of privilege who decided to go on the run with her eccentric husband, and what might come next in the remaining episodes of <em>Mosquito Coast</em>'s seven-part season. </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Special Presentation of In VOGUE: The 1990s -- It Bags and It Girls</title>
      <link>https://vogue.com/podcast</link>
      <description>We’re excited to bring you a new series from Vogue -- In Vogue: The 1990s. If you miss the 90s for all its nostalgia, fashion, and culture, you're going to love this episode on the fusion of fashion and celebrity culture.

By the mid 90’s, fashion had ceased to be an insular, self-sustaining industry. The fashion ecosystem expanded rapidly to include celebrities as aspirational symbols of fashion and status in popular culture. We chronicle the era when pop culture became the vehicle for a mass education in high fashion.

Voices featured, in order of appearance: Kristin Davis, Fran Drescher and Brenda Cooper for the Nanny, Donatella Versace, Vera Wang, Andie MacDowell, Melissa Joan Hart, Jennie Garth, Debra Messing, Melissa Rivers, Victoria Beckham, Meg Ryan, Angela Bassett, Claire Danes, Sharon Stone and stylist Paris Libby, Sofia Coppola, Elizabeth Hurley, Kristen Johnston, Raven Symone, Julia Stiles, Karyn Parsons, Tatyana Ali, Tamera Mowry, Nia Long, Tonne Goodman, Plum Sykes, Mark Holgate, Laird, Darnell-Jamal Lisby
