      <title>Dan Tomasulo || Psychodrama &amp; Learned Hopefulness</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Dan Tomasulo who is a counseling psychologist, professor, and the Academic Director at the Spirituality Mind Body Institute (SMBI), Teachers College, Columbia University. He holds a Ph.D. in psychology, an MFA in writing, and a Masters of Applied Positive Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania. Dan is also the author of several books, including <i>American Snake Pit</i> and <i>Confessions of a Former Child: A Therapist's Memoir</i>. His latest book is called <i>Learned Hopefulness</i>.</p><p>In this episode, I talk to Dan Tomasulo about psychodrama and learned hopefulness. Interventions have always focused on helping people recover from trauma but Dan believes we can do more than that through psychodrama. When we re-enact difficult experiences, we can process and integrate trauma in a way that facilitates growth. It also teaches us to perceive obstacles differently, which is integral to learning hopefulness. </p><p>Website: <a href="https://www.dantomasulo.com/">www.dantomasulo.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/drdantomasulo">@drdantomasulo</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>01:27 Dan as a stand-up comedian</p><p>04:58 Meeting Andy Kaufman</p><p>08:33 Dan’s interest in psychology</p><p>14:36 American Snake Pit </p><p>21:35 Interactive Behavioral Therapy (IBT)</p><p>27:10 What is psychodrama?</p><p>34:15 Learned Hopefulness</p><p>41:00 Hope activating exercises</p><p>45:49 Spiritual psychology</p><p>51:55 Hope, optimism, faith</p>

      <title>Jim Fadiman || Orchestrating Your Symphony of Selves</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Dr. Jim Fadiman. Jim is a psychologist, writer, and lecturer who has been pioneering psychedelic research since the 1960s. He is recognized as “America’s wisest and most respected authority on psychedelics and their use.” Jim received his bachelor and doctorate degrees from Harvard and Stanford respectively. Apart from psychedelics, he has also been involved in researching healthy multiplicity for over 20 years. His newest book with Jordan Gruber is called <i>Your Symphony of Selves: Discover and Understand More of Who We Are.</i></p><p>In this episode, I talk to Dr. Jim Fadiman about multiple selves. The DSM says that having multiple personalities is a disorder, but Dr. Fadiman challenges this notion. In fact, he believes that the opposite is true: the multiplicity of selves is both normal and healthy. It’s not about having one “super self”, but unifying the different parts of who we are. We also discuss psychedelics, its effects on mental health, and how Abraham Maslow would have viewed these mind-altering substances.</p><p>Website: <a href="https://jamesfadiman.com/">jamesfadiman.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/jfadiman">@jfadiman</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>04:54 Modern microdosing</p><p>06:49 Microdosing for physical and mental health </p><p>10:00 Healthy vs pathological multiplicity</p><p>14:14 What would Maslow think of psychedelics?</p><p>23:24 No single self </p><p>26:42 Taking responsibility for all yourselves</p><p>30:13 Harmonizing selves</p><p>34:28 Is it possible to create a super self?</p><p>37:58 All your parts are you</p><p>42:07 Unified self is healthy </p><p>44:08 Being in the right mind at the right time</p><p>51:17 Practice selves work</p>

      <title>Gabor Maté || The Myth of Normal</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Dr. Gabor Maté. A physician, renowned speaker, and bestselling author, Gabor is highly sought after for his expertise on addiction, stress, and childhood development. For his groundbreaking medical work and writing, he has been awarded the Order of Canada, his country’s highest civilian distinction. He is also a co-developer of Compassionate Inquiry, a therapeutic approach for deep healing and transformation. His newest book is called <i>The Myth of Normal: Trauma, Illness & Healing in a Toxic Culture.</i></p><p>In this episode, I talk to Gabor Maté about The Myth of Normal. Healthcare in Western societies tend to focus on physical health, without accounting for an individual’s lived experience. The tension between authenticity and attachment and the pressures of a capitalist culture puts undue stress on our minds and bodies. Dr. Maté invites us to rethink trauma and disease, by emphasizing holistic well-being and the role of agency. We also touch on the topics of early childhood, epigenetics, and self-improvement. </p><p>Website: <a href="https://drgabormate.com/">drgabormate.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/drgabormate">@drgabormate</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>02:36 The Myth of Normal</p><p>06:14 Maslow’s Metagrumbles</p><p>10:25 From individual to global well-being</p><p>13:25 Authenticity vs attachment</p><p>20:48 No separation of psyche and soma</p><p>28:05 Trauma is what happens inside you</p><p>33:34 Dr. Gabor Maté’s early childhood </p><p>37:20 Trauma denial and victimhood mentality</p><p>41:05 Disease is a long term process</p><p>45:21 Epigenetics and the role of environment</p><p>50:24 Screening for special and gifted education</p><p>52:45 Pathways to wholeness</p><p>58:01 The four A’s of healing </p><p>1:06:44 Compassionate Inquiry</p><p>1:10:16 Authentic satisfaction</p>

      <title>Eric Barker || Plays Well With Others</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Eric Barker, the author of The Wall Street Journal bestseller <i>Barking Up the Wrong Tree</i>. His book has sold over half a million copies and has been translated into 19 languages. It was even the subject of a question on “Jeopardy!” Eric is also a sought-after speaker, having given talks at MIT, the Aspen Ideas Festival, Google, the United States Military Central Command (CENTCOM), and the Olympic Training Center.

      <title>Skye Cleary || Simone de Beauvoir and the Quest for Authentic Living</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome philosopher Skye Cleary. She is a lecturer at Columbia University and the City College of New York. Skye is the author of Existentialism and Romantic Love and co-editor of How to Live a Good Life. Her writing has appeared in The Paris Review, Aeon, Business Insider, TED-Ed, and The Los Angeles Review of Books, among other outlets.</p><p>In 2021, she was a MacDowell Fellow and In 2017, she won the New Philosopher Writers’ Award. Her latest book is called How to Be Authentic. </p><p>In this episode, I talk to Skye Cleary about Simone de Beauvoir’s life and how it has informed her existentialist philosophy. As a feminist during the forties, Simone was passionate about freedom of choice. It's not a surprise then that her definition of authenticity also revolves around self-determination. Authenticity is not about finding a true self, but rather a process of creating who we want to be. We also touch on the topics of gender, power, social justice, narcissism, and fulfillment.</p><p>Website: <a href="https://skyecleary.com/">skyecleary.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Skye_Cleary">@Skye_Cleary</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>01:54 French existentialist philosophy</p><p>04:05 “One is not born, but rather becomes, woman”</p><p>09:58 Creating our essence</p><p>12:46 Transcending our impulses</p><p>18:01 Creative rebellion</p><p>22:19 Skye’s Critique of Simone de Beauvoir</p><p>24:03 Authenticity is responsible freedom</p><p>27:33 Power and freedom</p><p>32:00 Skye’s background in philosophy</p><p>33:15 Intersubjectivity: the foundation of ethical relations</p><p>34:48 Inauthenticity, social media, narcissism</p><p>38:37 Windows of freedom, genetics, motherhood</p><p>41:38 Fulfillment is embracing life </p>

      <title>Colin Seale || Tangible Equity in Education</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Colin Seale, the founder and CEO of thinkLaw. Colin was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, where his struggles gave birth to his passion for educational equity. Using lessons from his experience as a math teacher, attorney, and keynote speaker, he helps educators teach critical thinking to all students, regardless of race or achievement through his award-winning organization thinkLaw. Colin is also the author of Thinking Like a Lawyer. His latest book is called Tangible Equity. </p><p>In this episode, I talk to Colin Seale about tangible equity in education. For Colin, real equity work should help reduce the predictive power of demographics on outcomes. In order to do that, we need to teach kids how to think for themselves, so they learn to question instead of comply with unfair systems. Colin shares concrete actions that educators can take to contribute towards tangible equity.

      <title>Kristi Nelson || Wake Up Grateful</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Kristi Nelson, the executive director of A Network for Grateful Living. Her life’s work in the non-profit sector has focused on leading, inspiring, and strengthening organizations committed to progressive social and spiritual change. Being a long-time stage IV cancer survivor moves her every day to support others in living and loving with great fullness of heart. She is the author of <i>Wake Up Grateful: The Transformative Practice of Taking Nothing for Granted. </i></p><p>In this episode, I talk to Kristi Nelson about gratefulness.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome three-time #1 New York Times bestselling author Mark Manson. Before becoming an author, he was a blogger. His blog started in 2007 and within a few years it was being read by more than a million people each month. Today, his site is read by more than 15 million people each year. Mark’s books have sold over 14 million copies worldwide and have been translated into more than 65 languages.

      <title>Christine Robinson || Community Psychology</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Christine Robinson who is an executive coach, consultant, facilitator, and strategist whose expertise lies in building pathways to policy and systems change. She has worked as a consultant to the White House, the Ford Foundation, Harvard Medical School, the Lumina Foundation and other notable organizations. Christine studied at Vassar College, Brandeis University, and the University of Pennsylvania, and is trained as a developmental and community psychologist.</p><p>In this episode, I talk to Christine Robinson about community psychology.

      <title>Frans de Waal || Gender Through the Eyes of a Primatologist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Dr. Frans de Waal, a Dutch American biologist and primatologist known for his work on the behavior and social intelligence of primates. He is a professor in Emory University's psychology department and the Director of the Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. Chimpanzee Politics, The Age of Empathy, The Bonobo and the Atheist, and Mama's Last Hug are among his most popular books that have been translated in over 20 languages. His latest book is called <i>Different: Gender Through the Eyes of a Primatologist.</i></p><p>In this episode, I talk to Frans de Waal about sex and gender. As a primatologist, he shares his research findings on the biological differences between male and female primates.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Dr. Frans de Waal, a Dutch American biologist and primatologist known for his work on the behavior and social intelligence of primates. He is a professor in Emory University's psychology department and the Director of the Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. Chimpanzee Politics, The Age of Empathy, The Bonobo and the Atheist, and Mama's Last Hug are among his most popular books that have been translated in over 20 languages. His latest book is called <i>Different: Gender Through the Eyes of a Primatologist.</i></p><p>In this episode, I talk to Frans de Waal about sex and gender. As a primatologist, he shares his research findings on the biological differences between male and female primates. Despite obvious distinctions between masculine and feminine behavior, great apes have no trouble accepting non-binary individuals—a behavior we humans need to practice more of. Dr. Frans clears up what alpha male really means and debunks the “natural order” of male supremacy.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Todd Rose, the co-founder and president of Populace, a nonprofit think tank that works to find solutions to redistribute opportunity, so all people have the chance to live fulfilling lives in a thriving society. Prior to Populace, he was a faculty member at Harvard University where he founded the Laboratory for the Science of Individuality and directed the Mind, Brain, and Education program. Todd is the best-selling author of Dark Horse and The End of Average. and his most recent book is called Collective Illusions.</p><p>For part two of our interview, I talk to Todd Rose about collective illusions. Humans are a tribal species, prone to conformity. In a lot of instances, we will act according to what our in-group wants rather than what we want as individuals. Ironically, Todd's research shows that we make poor inferences about the majority consensus. Failing to recognize collective illusions can have negative consequences on our identities, relationships, values, and society.

      <title>Carl Hart || Drug Use for Grown-Ups</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Carl Hart. He is the Ziff Professor of Psychology in the Departments of Psychology and Psychiatry at Columbia University. He is known for his research on neuropsychopharmacology and his advocacy for the decriminalization of recreational drugs. Carl is the author of High Price and has co-authored the introductory textbook Drugs, Society, and Human Behavior with Charles Ksir. His most recent book is called Drug Use for Grown-Ups.</p><p>In this episode, I talk to Carl Hart about drug use and addiction.

      <title>Tim Urban ||  Climbing the Thinking Ladder</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Tim Urban. He is the writer and illustrator of the blog Wait But Why, which he co-founded with Andrew Finn in 2013. With wry stick-figure illustrations and occasionally epic prose, Wait But Why has garnered millions of unique page views, thousands of patrons and famous fans like Elon Musk. His long-form blog covers a range of subjects including artificial intelligence, outer space, and procrastination. Tim earned his A.B. from Harvard University, graduating cum laude with a major in Government. </p><p>In this episode, I talk to Tim Urban about the complex relationship between identity and critical thinking. Tim cautions against blind loyalty to specific ideologies for it can lead to an echo chamber of tribal minds. Instead of dogmatic maxims, he suggests we uphold basic core principles that guide our thoughts and behavior. In this way, Tim believes we engage in high rung thinking all the while cultivating “idea labs” within our culture. We also touch on the topics of dating, education, politics, writing, morality, and tech.  </p><p>Website: <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/">waitbutwhy.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy">@waitbutwhy</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>02:21 Intellectual ADHD</p><p>06:14 Detached truth seeking </p><p>08:40 Pitfalls of low rung thinking</p><p>16:15 Tim’s upbringing and education</p><p>21:01 Dating is kind of like Grand Theft Auto</p><p>37:50 “Your ego is a backpack”</p><p>44:35 The world needs your spaghetti brain</p><p>51:38 Idea labs and echo chambers</p><p>57:42 The spectrum of opposing views</p><p>1:01:13 Repressing science for ideology</p><p>1:09:24 Life, death, and cryonics</p><p>1:25:05 Learning in analogies and metaphors</p><p>1:29:44 Evaluating high quality ideas</p><p>1:36:23 Choosing what to read</p><p>1:39:35 Tim’s life altering idea</p><p>1:42:28 Mars, capitalism, neurolinks </p><p>1:47:02 Lightning round</p><p>1:53:07 But why wait?</p>

      <title>Antonio Damasio || Inside Consciousness</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome Dr. Antonio Damasio. He is an internationally recognized neuroscientist whose extensive research has shaped the understanding of neural systems and consciousness. With over a hundred journal articles and book chapters, he has earned many prestigious awards throughout his career. Currently, he serves as University Professor, the David Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Philosophy, and director of the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California. His books <i>Descartes’ Error, Looking for Spinoza, Self Comes to Mind, The Strange Order of Things, and Feeling & Knowing</i>, have been published in translation and are taught in universities throughout the world.</p><p>In this episode, I talk to Antonio Damasio about consciousness. People often think that the mind and consciousness are the same thing, but Dr. Damasio disputes this notion. He argues that it’s the complex relationship of both our brains and bodies that makes sentient thought possible.

      <title>Charles Koch || Believe in People</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, my guest is Charles Koch. Charles G. Koch is chairman and CEO of Koch Industries, one of the largest privately held American companies. During his tenure with the company, the estimated value has grown from $21 million to more than $100 billion. Charles has published several books detailing his business philosophy: The Science of Success, Good Profit, and Believe in People.</p><p>As an influential philanthropist, he supports education, a community of organizations addressing persistent poverty, and public-policy research focused on developing effective solutions to societal problems. He has founded numerous organizations, including Stand Together and the Cato Institute. He holds two master’s degrees in nuclear and chemical engineering from MIT and lives in Wichita, Kansas, with his wife, Liz.</p><p>In this episode, I talk to Charles Koch about his bottom-up approach to social change. Charles recognizes that each individual has a gift; schools and organizations should cultivate these unique strengths instead of trying to force people into molds. Charles asserts that institutions can create more meaningful value this way, by truly believing in people. We also touch on the topics of multiple intelligences, self-actualization, education, innovation, and philanthropy.</p><p>Website: <a href="https://charleskoch.com/">charleskoch.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/KochIndustries">@KochIndustries</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>04:02 Multiple intelligence theories</p><p>07:44 Finding consistent principles of human progress</p><p>10:08 Transforming Koch Industries</p><p>14:38 Virtuous Cycles of Mutual Benefit</p><p>20:07 Bottom-Up Solutions for a Top-Down World</p><p>23:51 Empowering contribution-motivated individuals</p><p>31:27 Supervisors as self-actualization coaches</p><p>37:16 From partisanship to partnership</p><p>42:35 Charles’ vision for a self-actualizing society</p><p>44:18 Eupsychian Management by Maslow</p><p>47:50 Frederick Douglass and Viktok Frankl</p><p>51:41 #GiveTogetherNow </p><p>53:00 A society that rewards synergy</p>

      <title>Daniel Schmachtenberger || Towards a Radical Cultural Enlightenment</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to social philosopher Daniel Schmachtenberger about exponential technology and its effects on our current world. According to Daniel, organizations that harness the power of modern tech rarely use it for good–like how social media companies boost polarizing content to maximize user engagement–leading to a distrust of science and destabilized democracies. To overcome humanity’s current existential threat, Daniel argues we all need to work towards a radical cultural enlightenment.

      <title>Todd Kashdan || The Art of Insubordination</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to esteemed psychologist Todd Kashdan about the art of insubordination. As creatures of habit, humans seek familiarity in thoughts, behaviors, and interactions. But Todd argues that deviating from norms isn’t always a bad thing—especially if it’s in pursuit of positive change. To enact principled dissent effectively, Todd teaches us how to persuade the majority and how to embrace unconventional solutions. We also touch on the topics of conformity, intimacy, influence, victimhood, and curiosity.</p><p><strong>Bio</strong></p><p>Todd Kashdan is among the world’s top experts on the psychology of well-being, psychological strengths, mental agility, and social relationships.

      <title>Eric Topol || Public Service Announcement: Separating Facts from Myths in the Pandemic</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's important to recognize that when we're dealing with a very new or rapidly changing phenomenon, like we have been with the pandemic, even the "scientific consensus" can easily be wrong because there's not been much time for the rigorous replicability studies to be conducted or even sometimes to accurately measure the proper effect sizes. </p><p>However, I also believe it's important that we don't create a false equivalency between very fringe ideas that are unsupported by the current evidence base and a scientific consensus that is grounded in rigorous methodology. </p><p>This is why I sought out the counsel of Dr. Eric Topol on today's show. Despite being one of the top 10 most cited researchers in medicine and being extremely well regarded in his field of cardiology, he's also been a bright light on social media, shining a light on the best available evidence in the pandemic. He thoughtfully considered all my questions and was very careful to make clear what the current evidence base says without ruling out alternative possibilities in the future in light of new evidence. </p><p>In this episode, we cover a number of hot button issues surrounding the pandemic including the potential use of ivermectin to end the pandemic, the potential for increased risk of myocarditis among certain populations after vaccination. We even discuss the role human psychology and human behavior have played in this pandemic. Ultimately, Dr. Topol is optimistic about the future of the pandemic and outlines things coming down the horizon that should give us hope. But as we discussed, the major problems tend to be human problems. </p><p><strong>Bio</strong></p><p>Eric Topol is a cardiologist, scientist, and author. He is the Founder and Director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, Professor of Molecular Medicine, and Executive Vice-President of Scripps Research.</p><p>As a researcher, he has published over 1200 peer-reviewed articles, with more than 290,000 citations, elected to the National Academy of Medicine, and is one of the top 10 most cited researchers in medicine. Dr. Topol has been voted as the #1 most Influential physician leader in the United States in a national poll conducted by Modern Healthcare. Besides editing several textbooks, he has published 3 bestseller books on the future of medicine: The Creative Destruction of Medicine, The Patient Will See You Now, and Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again.</p><p>Website: <a href="https://drerictopol.com/">drerictopol.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/EricTopol">@EricTopol</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>05:51 What is Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?</p><p>08:21 COVID-19 vaccines are humanity’s greatest medical achievement</p><p>12:05 Infection acquired immunity</p><p>13:47 Vaccine and COVID induced myocarditis </p><p>16:56 The efficacy of booster shots </p><p>20:20 Ivermectin studies: what does the data say? </p><p>25:15 How to improve pandemic response</p><p>30:02 Hope for the future of the pandemic</p><p> </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to prolific author and social scientist Arthur Brooks about finding meaning in the second curve of life. According to Arthur, the world and our biology urge us to relentlessly chase after the next win. This flawed formula for satisfaction ultimately leaves us unfulfilled. To find true purpose, we must break our addiction to success and confront life’s hard truths. We also touch on the topics of motivation, relationships, aging, transcendence, and love.</p><p><strong>Bio</strong></p><p>Arthur C. Brooks is the Professor of the Practice of Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School and Professor of Management Practice at the Harvard Business School. Before joining the Harvard faculty in July of 2019, he served for ten years as president of the Washington, D.C.-based American Enterprise Institute (AEI), one of the world’s leading think tanks.</p><p>He is also a columnist for The Atlantic, host of the podcast “How to Build a Happy Life with Arthur Brooks,” and subject of the 2019 documentary film “The Pursuit”. Arthur has written 12 books, including the national bestsellers “Love Your Enemies” and “The Conservative Heart”.

      <title>Andrew Yang || The Future of American Democracy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to Forward Party’s founder Andrew Yang about the future of American democracy. Andrew shares the insights he’s learned from his presidential and mayoral campaigns. His major realization is that America’s two-party system is designed for polarization and dysfunction. With the media and the internet further inciting division, polarization may eventually escalate into violence. In order to shift towards a human-centered economy, Andrew believes we need to change our political dynamics and incentives. We also touch on the topics of tribalism, rationality, automation, education, leadership, and governance. </p><p><strong>Bio</strong></p><p>Andrew Yang is an entrepreneur, attorney, and political candidate. He was a candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries and the 2021 New York City Democratic mayoral primary. His signature policy was a universal basic income of $1,000 a month as a response to job displacement by automation. After his campaigns ended, he left the Democratic Party and founded Forward Party, a political action committee that seeks to alleviate political polarization and reform the U.S. political and economic systems.</p><p>Andrew is also an author and has published several books including Smart People Should Build Things, The War on Normal People, and most recently, Forward: Notes on the Future of Our Democracy. </p><p>Website: <a href="https://www.andrewyang.com/">www.andrewyang.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYang">@AndrewYang</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>01:34 Andrew’s childhood and early ventures </p><p>09:04 Andrew’s desire to humanize the economy </p><p>11:28 The presidential and mayoral candidacy experience</p><p>19:51 Society’s current incentive structures</p><p>22:57 “The duopoly is designed for polarization”</p><p>29:49 How do we reward grace and tolerance in politics?</p><p>33:18 Fact-based governance and a shared objective reality</p><p>39:59 New measures for well-being</p><p>46:26 Politics is tribal</p><p>51:44 United by universal human values</p><p>55:28 Fulfilling the need to matter</p><p>1:00:36 Human-centered education</p>

      <title>Ayelet Fishbach || How to Motivate Yourself</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to award-winning psychologist Ayelet Fishbach about the science of motivation. How do we motivate ourselves to do anything? From her extensive research, Ayelet shares with us four crucial strategies for successful behavior change: identify the right goals, avoid the “middle”, resist temptations, and seek social support.

      <title>Oliver Burkeman || Time Management for Mortals</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to bestselling author Oliver Burkeman about his latest book Four Thousand Weeks. On the surface, it’s easy to mistake it for another self-help book on time management. But instead of enthusing about productivity hacks, Oliver challenges his readers to confront the finite nature of humanity. By doing so, he argues  we can live fuller lives—without having to always carry the fear of missing out. We also touch on the topics of procrastination, positive psychology, flow, realism, deep time, and patience.</p><p><strong>Bio</strong></p><p>Oliver Burkeman is a journalist for The Guardian. From 2006 to 2020, he wrote the popular weekly column on psychology called “This Column Will Change Your Life”. He is the author of The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking and Help! How to Become Slightly Happier and Get a Bit More Done. In 2015, he won the Foreign Press Association’s Young Journalist of the Year award, and has been short-listed for the Orwell Prize.

      <title>Robert Greene || Strategy, Seduction, and the Sublime</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to international bestselling author Robert Greene about strategy, seduction, and the sublime. Robert implores us to get comfortable with the dark side of human nature and society. He argues that by acknowledging the reality of human interactions, we can use certain strategies to help us effectively navigate the workplace, our relationships, and daily life. We also touch on the topics of empathy, imagination, charisma, power, and his upcoming book on transcendence and the sublime.</p><p>Chatting with Robert is always such a delight as we have many mutual areas of interest. I have been a long-time admirer of his books, and remember reading them in college and thinking that he seems to just get it. I hope you enjoyed this high-level discussion as much as I did.</p><p><strong>Bio</strong></p><p>Robert Greene is an author and speaker known for his books on strategy, power and seduction. He graduated from U.C. Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin at Madison with a degree in classical studies. He has written six international bestsellers: The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, The 33 Strategies of War, The 50th Law, Mastery, and The Laws of Human Nature. Recently, he published <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Laws-Meditations-Seduction-Strategy/dp/0593299213">The Daily Laws: 366 Meditations on Power, Seduction, Mastery</a>.

      <title>Amanda Knox || The Real Amanda Knox</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to The Psychology Podcast! In this episode, I talk to Amanda Knox about her wrongful conviction for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Her experience revealed dark truths about the media’s inclination to over sensationalize stories about young women and the glaring human errors in the criminal justice system. We also touch on the topics of trauma, cancel culture, cognitive biases, law, and forensic science. Throughout this episode, I try my best to show the audience the real Amanda Knox, not the version of her that the media has depicted. Along those lines, I give her some of my psychological tests to take, including my test on self-actualization as well as my psychopath test! You won't want to miss this episode.</p><p><strong>Bio</strong></p><p>Amanda Knox is a journalist, public speaker, and podcaster.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to The Psychology Podcast! In this episode, I talk to Amanda Knox about her wrongful conviction for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Her experience revealed dark truths about the media’s inclination to over sensationalize stories about young women and the glaring human errors in the criminal justice system. We also touch on the topics of trauma, cancel culture, cognitive biases, law, and forensic science. Throughout this episode, I try my best to show the audience the real Amanda Knox, not the version of her that the media has depicted. Along those lines, I give her some of my psychological tests to take, including my test on self-actualization as well as my psychopath test! You won't want to miss this episode.</p><p><strong>Bio</strong></p><p>Amanda Knox is a journalist, public speaker, and podcaster.

      <title>Lisa Feldman Barrett || Surprising Truths about the Human Brain</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to renowned neuroscientist Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett about emotions and the brain.

Further into our discussion, Dr. Lisa challenges the traditionally held view that emotions are universal.

      <title>Paul Bloom || The Pleasures of Suffering</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to renowned developmental psychologist Paul Bloom about the pleasures of suffering. We start by discussing the value of suffering in pursuit of meaning and make the distinction between unforeseen tragedy and chosen suffering.

We also touch on the topics of meditation, Buddhism, attachment, parenting, and empathy.</p><p><strong>Bio</strong><br />Paul Bloom is professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and the Brooks and Suzanne Ragen professor emeritus of psychology at Yale University.

Jacobs Research Prize. He has written for scientific journals such as Nature and Science and for the New York Times, The New Yorker, and Atlantic Monthly.

      <title>Esther Perel || Love, Eros, and Infidelity</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to renowned psychotherapist and author Esther Perel about love and relationships. We tackle the true essence of the word “eros” and “freedom” in the context of romantic relationships. Esther offers her perspective on marriage and affairs, getting to the root cause of why people cheat. With the redefinition of fidelity and sexuality, our current society is still learning how to navigate new patterns of relationships.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to renowned psychotherapist and author Esther Perel about love and relationships. We tackle the true essence of the word “eros” and “freedom” in the context of romantic relationships. Esther offers her perspective on marriage and affairs, getting to the root cause of why people cheat. With the redefinition of fidelity and sexuality, our current society is still learning how to navigate new patterns of relationships. We also touch on the topics of soulmates, masculinity, how to keep passion alive during a global pandemic, and Esther’s practice as a cross-cultural therapist. </p><p><strong>Bio</strong></p><p>Esther Perel is a psychotherapist and a New York Times bestselling author, recognized as one of today’s most insightful and original voices on modern relationships.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to Richard Tedeschi about post-traumatic growth (PTG). We dive into how Richard became interested in PTG and the findings from his many years of research.

      <title>Aaron Beck || Humanizing Psychiatry</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone, today is a very special episode of <i>The Psychology Podcast</i>. A few nights ago, the legendary psychiatrist Dr. Aaron Temkin Beck passed away peacefully in his sleep at the age of 100. Tim, as his friends and family affectionally called him, lived an exemplary, full life well lived. Personally, he was a dear mentor and friend of mine. I used to live in the building next door to him in Philadelphia and we'd have tuna sandwiches together on Sundays at his place and discuss humanistic psychology and how to treat patients as humans first. He was always so encouraging of my work, and I enjoyed our discussions about his life and work immensely. I will miss his bow tie, fist bumps, and a sharp mind, which lasted all the way until the end. In my last in-person meeting with him just before the pandemic hit, I handed him a microphone and asked if he would talk about what research he was most excited about these days and whether he could give any advice to young psychologists. That recording is what you will hear today on the podcast.</p><p>Remarkably, Tim worked all the way up until his death. To many, he is most known for his work in Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), which is a time-sensitive, structured, present-oriented psychotherapy that has been scientifically tested and found to be effective in more than 2,000 studies for the treatment of many different health and mental health conditions. When implemented correctly, CBT can help individuals get better and stay better.</p><p>However, not many people know this, but Tim’s work was much more than the seminal work he did pioneering CBT. Tim was recently working on a new form of psychotherapy with his colleagues Ellen Inverso and Paul Grant called "Recovery-Oriented Cognitive Therapy”, which deeply humanizes psychiatric patients. </p><p>Guided by Tim’s cognitive model, Recovery-Oriented Cognitive Therapy (CT-R) is an evidence-based practice that provides concrete, actionable steps to promote recovery and resiliency. Originally developed to empower individuals given a diagnosis of schizophrenia, Recovery-Oriented Cognitive Therapy applies broadly to individuals experiencing extensive behavioral, social, and physical health challenges. It is a highly collaborative, person-centered, and strengths-based approach, as it is focused on developing and strengthening positive beliefs of purpose, hope, efficacy, empowerment and belonging. The approach is specially formulated and effective for individuals (i) who have a history of feeling disconnected and distrustful of service providers, (ii) who are not help-seeking, or (iii) who experience challenges that impede action towards aspirations. The reach of Recovery-Oriented Cognitive Therapy extends to mental health professionals across all disciplines, families and loved ones, and peers with lived experience.</p><p>One other thing I’d like to mention before we get to today’s episode is the Beck Institute. In 1994, Tim and his daughter, Dr. Judith S. Beck, founded Beck Institute as a 501(c)3 nonprofit with the mission of improving lives worldwide through excellence and innovation in Cognitive Behavior Therapy training, practice, and research. In 2019, Beck Institute opened the Beck Institute Center for Recovery-Oriented Cognitive Therapy to train professionals and staff who work with individuals given a diagnosis of a serious mental health condition, such as schizophrenia. </p><p>Beck Institute honors the legacy of Dr. Aaron Beck by providing training and resources in both CBT and CT-R to people around the world. In the nonprofit’s 27-year history, over 28,000 health and mental health professionals have received training in CBT or CT-R through a variety of programs. </p><p>You can help honor Dr. Aaron Beck’s legacy by making a gift to the Aaron T. Beck Fund at Beck Institute. This enables the organization to continue Dr. Beck’s latest work with the Center for CT-R at Beck Institute, develop programs, fund scholarships for trainees, and everything in between. The Beck Institute website can be found at beckinstitute.org. </p><p>OK, now without further ado, I bring you our guest today, Dr. Aaron Beck.</p><p> </p><p>RIP,  Tim.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

      <title>George Bonanno || The New Science of Resilience</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to George Bonanno about trauma and resiliency. We start off by discussing what people get wrong about trauma and how this led to the invention of the PTSD diagnosis. George defines what resilience is, how it’s different from growth, and its paradoxical correlation to individual differences.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I talk to George Bonanno about trauma and resiliency. We start off by discussing what people get wrong about trauma and how this led to the invention of the PTSD diagnosis. George defines what resilience is, how it’s different from growth, and its paradoxical correlation to individual differences. Finally, he elaborates on how the flexibility mindset and sequence help us get through personal traumatic events or global tragedies like 9/11 or the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p><strong>Bio</strong> </p><p>Dr. George Bonanno is a professor of psychology, chair of the department of counseling in clinical psychology, and director of the Loss, Trauma, and Emotion Lab at Teachers College Columbia University.

      <title>Steven Pinker || Why Rationality Matters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today it’s great to have Steven Pinker on the podcast. Dr. Pinker is the Johnstone professor of psychology at Harvard University. A two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist and the winner of many awards for his research, teaching, and books. He’s been elected to the National Academy of Science, and named as one of Time’s “100 Most Influential People”, and one of Foreign Policy’s “100 Leading Global Thinkers”. His books include How the Mind Works, The Blank State, The Stuff of Thought, The Better Angels of Our Nature, The Sense of Style, Enlightenment Now, and most recently, Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters.  In this episode, I talk to Steven about the definition of rationality, how it relates to truth, and how it’s different from logic. We also discuss the trade-offs in decision making, the limited usefulness of strategic irrationality, the boundaries of socially acceptable fiction, and why people have weird beliefs among other things.</p><p>Website: <a href="http://stevenpinker.com/" target="_blank">stevenpinker.com</a><br />Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker" target="_blank">@sapinker</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>01:02 Must we always follow reason? </p><p>03:34 Steven’s definition of rationality </p><p>05:24 Tension between conflicting goals </p><p>08:31 What is truth? </p><p>13:12 When to apply logic or rationality </p><p>23:14 There can be no trade-off between rationality and justice </p><p>25:35 Politicizing knowledge and research </p><p>29:24 Strategic irrationality has limits </p><p>36:13 Taboo trade-offs, heretical counterfactuals, and forbidden base rates </p><p>42:04 The changing norms of acceptable fiction </p><p>45:56 Why rationality is cool </p><p>49:39 The costs of decision making </p><p>55:54 Progress came from utilitarian reasoning </p><p>57:52 "The pandemic of poppycock" </p><p>01:01:23 Expressive rationality: morally empowering beliefs </p><p>01:05:26 Bayesian reasoning <br /> </p>

      <title>Andrew Yang || Humanizing Education</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today the tables are turned on The Psychology Podcast as Andrew Yang interviews Scott Barry Kaufman! This is a really meaningful episode for Scott, as he was a big supporter of Andrew's presidential campaign, and is now a big supporter of his Mayoral NYC campaign. Andrew and Scott share a humanistic viewpoint, and it was great to finally get them together in a discussion.</p>
<p><br />
Andrew is the founder of Venture for America, a non-profit organization aiming to create economic opportunities in American cities. He is a former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and is currently running for mayor of New York City on a Democrat ticket. In 2012, the Obama administration selected Andrew as a "Champion for Change" and later as a "Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship" in 2015. This episode originally appeared on Andrew's podcast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnJAu7VPqcA&t=621s" target="_blank">Yang Speaks</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In this eagerly anticipated episode, Andrew and Scott discuss:</strong></p>
<p>[02:48] Scott’s journey into and out of special-education</p>
<p>[05:45] Why Scott signed up for dance classes in college</p>
<p>[06:30] How Scott accidentally discovered his singing talents</p>
<p>[08:10] Why Scott decided to pursue psychology</p>
<p>[15:30] The worrying trend of schools rewarding behavioral conformity and performance on thinly disguised intelligence tests</p>
<p>[17:29] Scott’s "Dual-Process Theory of Human Intelligence"</p>
<p>[20:23] Why academic psychologists are under pressure to come up with novel ideas</p>
<p>[21:02] Scott’s encounter with creativity research</p>
<p>[24:39] How Scott’s research on human intelligence opened doors for studying other research topics</p>
<p>[26:31] Examples of human-centered schools</p>
<p>[30:41] Andrew Yang’s take on humanistic and positive education</p>
<p>[33:20] Why Americans need to incorporate humanity into their everyday lives</p>
<p>[36:04] The difference between narcissism and healthy self-esteem</p>
<p>[39:20] Scott’s revised hierarchy of needs</p>
<p>[42:17] The distinction between deficiency motivation and growth motivation</p>
<p>[48:04] The reception of Scott’s latest book Transcend: The New Science of Self-Actualization among psychologist</p>
<p><em>My friend Andrew Yang is running for New York City Mayor, and he needs our help! Andrew maintains a huge lead in the polls and is dominating press coverage, and together, we can push him into first place in the fundraising race, too. This week, let's make sure Andrew receives more contributions than any other candidate. What's more: any New York City resident who contributes will get their contribution matched 8 to 1 by the City!

      <title>Jennifer Aaker &amp; Naomi Bagdonas || How Humor Can Save The World</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today it’s great to chat with Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas on the podcast. Dr. Jennifer Aaker is the General Atlantic Professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a leading expert on how purpose and meaning shape individual choices and how technology can positively impact both human well-being and company growth. Her work has been widely published in lead in scientific journals and featured in The Economist, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, and Science. A recipient of the Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award and the MBA Professor of the Year, Aaker counts winning a dance-off in the early 1980s among her greatest feats.</p>
<p>Naomi Bagdonas is a Lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and an Executive Coach. She helps leaders be more creative, flexible and resilient in the face of change by facilitating interactive sessions for Fortune 100 companies and coaching executives and celebrities for appearances ranging from Saturday Night Live to the Today Show. Formally trained at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, Bagdonas performs at comedy venues and teaches improv in San Francisco’s county jail. Her constant stream of foster dogs describe her as gullible and full of treats.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we have Bret Weinstein on the podcast. Bret has spent two decades advancing the field of evolutionary biology, earning his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan before teaching at the Evergreen State College for fourteen years. He has developed a new Darwinian framework based on design tradeoffs and made important discoveries regarding the evolution of cancer, senescence, and the adaptive significance of moral self-sacrifice. He is currently working to uncover the evolutionary meaning of large-scale patterns in human history and seeking a game theoretically stable path forward for humanity. With his wife Heather Heying, he is co-writing <em>A Hunter Gatherer’s Guide to the Twenty-First Century</em> and is the host of Bret Weinstein’s <em>Dark Horse Podcast</em>.<br />

      <description><![CDATA[<pre><code>Today it’s great to have Cory Muscara on the podcast. Cory is an international speaker and teacher on the topics of presence and well-being. He believes that when people are deeply fulfilled, they are a better force in the world for other beings, the environment, and their communities.

She is best known for her work in the areas of memory and criminal psychology. In 2017 Dr. Shaw co-founded the memory science and artificial intelligence start-up Spot. Spot helps employees report workplace harassment and discrimination, and empowers organizations to build a more inclusive and respectful work environment. In 2016 she published her bestselling debut book &quot;The Memory Illusion&quot;, which has appeared in 20 languages and in 2019 she published her second international bestseller &quot;Evil: The Science Behind Humanity&apos;s Dark Side&quot;. Note: This episode goes down a lot of taboo alleys. The dark side of human nature  is a fascinating topic, but there may be some issues that you&apos;d rather not hear about. Please review the list of topics before listening to this episode. In this episode we discuss:  How Julia got into criminal psychology How we all do “reality crafting” The depths of human hypocrisy Why we don’t always act in accord with our own morality Julia Shaw’s criticism of the label “evil” The neuroscience of “evil” and Hitler’s brain Your brain on porn How kink is stigmatized in our society Can you be a feminist and engage in BDSM? The “deviant sexual interests” scale The prevalence of rape fantasies Pedophiles vs. ephebophiles Why “curiosity shaming” limits discussion and understanding The science of beastiality and what makes one animal sexier than another animal Why we shame vegans Rape culture and how systems fail and lead to harm What we can do to reduce sexual violence in society The bright side of your dark side How we can use the dark side to be a hero (the heroic imagination)

Roughly 20% of the population can be classified as highly sensitive, so all of us likely know someone (or are someone) with this trait.

      <title>[Rerun] Kristin Neff on The Healing Power of Self-Compassion</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>A pioneering researcher in the psychology of self-compassion, Dr. Kristin Neff provides deep insight into the incredible healing power of being your own ally. In this episode, we cover some immediately useful ways to practice self-compassion and gain its many benefits. Self-compassion has been linked to reductions in anxiety, physical pain, depression and the stress hormone cortisol. It’s been shown to increase motivation, improve a mastery mindset, and enhance well-being.

      <title>[Rerun] Brené Brown on Creativity, Courageous Vulnerability and Wholehearted Living</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We are especially grateful (and giddy) to be sharing this episode with our listeners! Brene Brown’s work really gels with our core interests here on The Psychology Podcast, and the resulting conversation contains some enthusiastic and empirically informed banter that is sure to inform and delight. We geek out over some counter-intuitive findings, like how incredibly compassionate people have a tendency to set the most boundaries and say “no.” We discuss the power of being vulnerable and how the data suggests that it is one of the best predictors of courage. We chat about how trying to be cool is the enemy of truly being cool, how we can enrich future generation’s learning with wholehearted living, and how ignoring our creativity defies our essential nature. It’s ~45 minutes of two experts in the field sharing data, and themselves, and it’s one of our favorite episodes yet.</p>

Kuhn is now a Reader at Goldsmiths University of London, and director of the MAGIC-Lab (Mind Attention &amp; General Illusory Cognition).  He is one of the pioneering researchers in the Science of Magic and he is one of the founding members and president of the Science of Magic Association. His latest book is called “Experiencing the Impossible: The Science of Magic”.  What is the link between psychology and magic? The link between perception and magic What is magic? What is not magic? The link between magic and well-being Early childhood experiences of magicians The link between magic and creativity The role of misdirection in magic The neural basis of magic Do we all experience the same magic? The “magician’s force” The potential for using magic for bad ends Will magicians ever become obsolete in the age of machines? The link between magic and human-machine interaction How we can use science to enhance the magic endeavor

Hayes has received several awards, including the Impact of Science on Application Award from the Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT). Together, they edited the recent book, “Evolution and Contextual Behavioral Science: An Integrated Framework for Understanding, Predicting, and Influencing Human Behavior.” In this episode we cover a lot of ground, including:  Steven’s perspective on language and cognition The difference between evolutionary science and evolutionary psychology How Skinner thought of himself as an evolutionary psychologist How evolutionary theory needs to take a step back and taken into account variation selection How evolutionary science need to be an applied discipline How evolutionary psychology done right acknowledges both an innate and adaptive component Why Steven Hayes thinks that 98% of the research we’re doing in psychology might be wrong Steven’s criticism of psychometric research (he thinks it’s “going down”!) The first time Steven encountered David’s work and how it made him cry Steven’s criticism of how the term “genetic” is used in the psychological literature Separating “pop evolutionary psychology” from good evolutionary science Renee Duckworth’s skeleton metaphor The tension between evolutionary change and stability Why we need to look at function, context, and longitudinal development in order to really balance flexibility and structure,  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) as managing the evolutionary process How multidimensionality and multi-level thinking allows us to manage evolutionary processes like never before Their upcoming book on prosociality

      <itunes:summary>Today it’s a pleasure to have Molly Crockett on the podcast. Dr. Crockett is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Yale University and a Distinguished Research Fellow at the Oxford Centre for Neuroethics. Prior to joining Yale, Dr Crockett was a faculty member at the University of Oxford’s Department of Experimental Psychology and a Fellow of Jesus College. She holds a BSc in Neuroscience from UCLA and a PhD in Experimental Psychology from the University of Cambridge, and completed a Wellcome Trust Postdoctoral Fellowship with economists and neuroscientists at the University of Zürich and University College London. In this episode we discuss:  The discrepancy between outrage in real life vs. online outrage Cultural evolution and the selection and amplification of online content How basic reinforcement learning principles drive the design of online systems to maximize the amount of time we spend on the platforms Is the “habitual online shamer” addicted to outrage? Habitual behavior vs. addiction Is “outrage fatigue” happening en masse? Should we be thinking about rationing our outrage (reserving it for issues we find most important)? The costs and benefits of outrage Why people punish and the discrepancy between the actual reasons why we punish (inferred from behavior) vs. self-reported motives The difficulty doing science on topics that are incredibly heated in public social discourse The intractably intertwined nature of science and social justice What technologies might be doing to the way that young people construe the social world The human capacity for forgiveness Twitter Q &amp; A

Dr. Martin’s latest book is called “Untrue: Why Nearly Everything We Believe About Women, Lust, and Infidelity Is Wrong and How the New Science Can Set Us Free.” In this episode we discuss:  How Wednesday tries to make the sex research “delicious and fun” How female infidelity is mired in so much misunderstanding How Millenial women are more sexually adventurous compared to Millennial men What’s the consensual non-monogamy movement? How we evolved to be “cooperative breeders” What is “female flexuality”? Why we need to stop pathologizing those who embrace non-monogamy How women are driving the polyamory movement The good reasons why monogamy is hard and the other options that exist How your attachment style and sociosexuality are linked to consensual non-monogamy Disagreeable women and sociosexuality Rethinking sex differences in the drive for sexual novelty Pornography viewing differences between men and women Common triggers of violence in relationships Rethinking the motivations underlying sex differences in cheating How better science can help us all have hotter sex

Dr. Martin’s latest book is called “Untrue: Why Nearly Everything We Believe About Women, Lust, and Infidelity Is Wrong and How the New Science Can Set Us Free.” In this episode we discuss:  How Wednesday tries to make the sex research “delicious and fun” How female infidelity is mired in so much misunderstanding How Millenial women are more sexually adventurous compared to Millennial men What’s the consensual non-monogamy movement? How we evolved to be “cooperative breeders” What is “female flexuality”? Why we need to stop pathologizing those who embrace non-monogamy How women are driving the polyamory movement The good reasons why monogamy is hard and the other options that exist How your attachment style and sociosexuality are linked to consensual non-monogamy Disagreeable women and sociosexuality Rethinking sex differences in the drive for sexual novelty Pornography viewing differences between men and women Common triggers of violence in relationships Rethinking the motivations underlying sex differences in cheating How better science can help us all have hotter sex

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today it’s an honor to have Dr. Sean Carroll on the podcast. Dr. Carroll is a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology. Recently, Carroll has worked on the foundation of quantum mechanics, the arrow of time, and the emergence of complexity. He has been awarded prizes and fellowships by the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, among others. Dr. Carroll has given a TED talk on the multiverse that has more than 1.5 million views, and he has participated in a number of well-attended public debates concerning material in his latest book, which is entitled “The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself.”   - The meaning of “post-existentialism”   - What is “poetic naturalism”?   - What is the fundamental nature of reality?   - Do “tables” and “chairs” really exist?   - The difference between rich ontology and sparse ontology   - The Bayesian probability of the existence of God   - How the universe evolved   - The analogy between psychological entropy and naturalistic entropy   - Can we think about the brain in useful terms entropically?   - In what sense do we have free will?   - How hard is the hard problem of consciousness?   - The importance of “existential gratitude”   - The link between quantum mechanics and consciousness   - Is there life (consciousness) after death?   - How can we create purpose, meaningfulness, mattering, morality, and ethics in a natural world?</p>

Panpsychism as a scientific alternative for explaining consciousness The latest neuroscience of consciousness and its implications for understanding the hard problem of consciousness The insights that can be gleaned through understanding subjective experience Will we ever discover if free will exists? To what extent can our understanding of cognitive neuroscience and genetics can elucidate the extent of our free will?

      <title>Jonathan Haidt || The Coddling of the American Mind</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<blockquote> <p><em>“There are two ideas about safe spaces. One is a very good idea, and one is a terrible idea. The idea of being physically safe on a campus, not being subjected to sexual harassment and physical abuse, or being targeted for something specifically for some sort of hate speech… I’m perfectly fine with that. But there’s another that is now ascendent, which I just think is a horrible view, which is ‘I need to be safe ideologically, I need to be safe emotionally, I just need to feel good all the time. And if someone says something that I don’t like, that is a problem for everyone else, including the administration.’ I think that is a terrible idea for the following reason: I don’t want you to be safe ideologically. I don’t want you to be safe emotionally. I want you to be strong. That’s different. I’m not going to pave the jungle for you. Put on some boots, and learn how to deal with adversity. I’m not going to take all the weights out of the gym. That’s the whole point of the gym. This is the gym.”</em></p> <p>— Anthony Van Jones</p> </blockquote> <p>Today we have Jonathan Haidt on the podcast. Dr. Haidt is a social psychologist at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Dr. Haidt’s research examines the intuitive foundations of morality, and how morality varies across cultures— including the cultures of American progressive, conservatives, and libertarians. Haidt is the author of <em>The Happiness Hypothesis</em>, and of The New York Times bestseller The<em> Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion</em>. His third book, co-authored with Greg Lukianoff, is called <em>The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas are Setting up a Generation for Failure</em>.</p> <p>In this episode we discuss:</p> <ul> <li> “The tumultuous years” on college campuses from 2015-2017</li> <li>Wisdom and its opposite</li> <li>The three great untruths</li> <li>The main aims of Heterodox Academy</li> <li>The importance of exposing students to opposing views on campus</li> <li>The detrimental effects of moral amplification</li> <li>How moral foundations theory helps explain political divides</li> <li>The common humanity of liberals and conservatives</li> <li>The psychological function of having a common enemy</li> <li>How social media amplifies tribalism</li> <li>The rise of antifragility</li> <li>The net effect of “callout culture”</li> <li>The importance of play in early childhood</li> <li>The importance of cognitive behavioral therapy and sharpening your intuitions</li> <li>The importance of both racial/ethnic minority diversity and viewpoint diversity</li> <li>How to help young people flourish in college</li> </ul> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <p><a href="https://heterodoxacademy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Heterodox Academy</a></p> <p><a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/kramer2000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Wisdom as a classical source of human strength: Conceptualization and empirical inquiry</a></p> <p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30821130/Jeff_Greenberg_Handbook_of_Experimental_Exist.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1535901850&Signature=JzFVEnoPHv%2F7BeDFmM75t3h5AsY%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_terror_of_death_and_the_quest_for_lo.pdf#page=345" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>https://anchor.fm/the-psychology-podcast/support</p>

      <title>Carl Zimmer || The New Science of Heredity</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we have Carl Zimmer on the podcast. Zimmer reports from the frontiers of biology, where scientists are expanding our understanding of life. Since 2004 he was written about science for the <em>New York Times</em>, where his column “Matter” has appeared weekly since 2013.

      <title>Steven Pinker || Humanism, Enlightenment and Progress</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today it’s a great honor to have Steven Pinker on the podcast. Dr. Pinker is an experimental psychologist who conducts research in visual cognition, psycholinguistics, and social relations. He grew up in Montreal and earned his BA from McGill and his PhD from Harvard. Currently Johnstone Professor of Psychology at Harvard, Pinker has also taught at Stanford and MIT. He has won numerous prizes for his research, his teaching, and his ten books, including <em>The Language Instinct</em>, <em>How the Mind Works, The Blank Slate, The Better Angels of Our Nature, The Sense of Style</em>, and most recently, <em>Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress. </em>Pinker is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, a two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist, a Humanist of the Year, a recipient of nine honorary doctorates, and one of <em>Foreign Policy</em>’s “World’s Top 100 Public Intellectuals” and <em>Time</em>’s “100 Most Influential People in the World Today.” He is Chair of the Usage Panel of the <em>American Heritage Dictionary</em>, and writes frequently for <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Guardian, </em>and other publications. </p>
<p>In this episode we discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The main thread that runs through all of Pinker’s work</li>
 <li>Does reducing economic inequality increase happiness?</li>
  <li>Does increased autonomy lead to increased happiness?</li>
  <li>How humanism is compatible with spirituality</li>
  <li>Why we should not confuse evolutionary adaptation (in Darwin’s sense) with human worth</li>
  <li>The difference between the ultimate and proximal levels of analysis</li>
  <li>Why Evolutionary Psychology is often so misunderstood</li>
  <li>Why human nature isn’t necessarily conductive to human flourishing</li>
  <li>How the laws of the universe don’t care about you</li>
  <li>Why do intellectuals hate progress so much?</li>
  <li>What are some indicators of human progress?</li>
  <li>Why should people care about human progress over the course of history?</li>
  <li>The myth of the suicide and loneliness “epidemics”</li>
  <li>Why we enjoy and care more about food and children than oxygen</li>
  <li>Rates of sexual assault and mental health on campus</li>
  <li>The increasing divisiveness and irrationality of politics</li>
  <li>How the recent presidential election was a “carnival of irrationality”</li>
  <li>Humanistic ethics</li>
  <li>Can we have a good without a God?</li>
  <li>The possibility of the unification of knowledge across the arts, humanities, and sciences</li>

      <itunes:summary>Today it’s a great honor to have Steven Pinker on the podcast. Dr. Pinker is an experimental psychologist who conducts research in visual cognition, psycholinguistics, and social relations. He grew up in Montreal and earned his BA from McGill and his PhD from Harvard. Currently Johnstone Professor of Psychology at Harvard, Pinker has also taught at Stanford and MIT. He has won numerous prizes for his research, his teaching, and his ten books, including The Language Instinct, How the Mind Works, The Blank Slate, The Better Angels of Our Nature, The Sense of Style, and most recently, Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress. Pinker is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, a two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist, a Humanist of the Year, a recipient of nine honorary doctorates, and one of Foreign Policy’s “World’s Top 100 Public Intellectuals” and Time’s “100 Most Influential People in the World Today.” He is Chair of the Usage Panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and writes frequently for The New York Times, The Guardian, and other publications. 
In this episode we discuss the following topics:

 The main thread that runs through all of Pinker’s work
 Does reducing economic inequality increase happiness?
  Does increased autonomy lead to increased happiness?
  How humanism is compatible with spirituality
  Why we should not confuse evolutionary adaptation (in Darwin’s sense) with human worth
  The difference between the ultimate and proximal levels of analysis
  Why Evolutionary Psychology is often so misunderstood
  Why human nature isn’t necessarily conductive to human flourishing
  How the laws of the universe don’t care about you
  Why do intellectuals hate progress so much?
  What are some indicators of human progress?
  Why should people care about human progress over the course of history?
  The myth of the suicide and loneliness “epidemics”
  Why we enjoy and care more about food and children than oxygen
  Rates of sexual assault and mental health on campus
  The increasing divisiveness and irrationality of politics
  How the recent presidential election was a “carnival of irrationality”
  Humanistic ethics
  Can we have a good without a God?
  The possibility of the unification of knowledge across the arts, humanities, and sciences
  Toward a third culture

      <title>Katherine MacLean || Open Wide and Say Awe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>“How can we use these peak experiences to help people create community that is healthy and to be better human beings?” -- Katherine MacLean</em></p>
<p>Katherine MacLean, PhD is a research scientist, teacher and meditator. In her academic research (2004-2013) at UC Davis and Johns Hopkins University, she studied how psychedelics and mindfulness meditation can promote beneficial, long-lasting changes in personality, well-being and brain function. In the fall of 2015, she co-founded and began directing the Psychedelic Education & Continuing Care Program in New York (<a href="http://www.psychedelicprogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.psychedelicprogram.com</a>), where she has facilitated monthly integration groups for psychedelic users and training workshops for both clinicians and the public. She currently lives on an organic farm and is preparing to be a study therapist on the upcoming Phase 3 trial of MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder. Learn more: <a href="http://katherinemaclean.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">katherinemaclean.org</a></p>
<p>In this wide-ranging discussion, we cover the following topics:</p>
<p>- What happened after Katherine “died” in 2012</p>
<p>- Discovery oriented research vs. practical research on psychedelics</p>
<p>- Effects of psychedelics on “existential distress”</p>
<p>- Potential benefits of psychedelics on end-of-life care and terminal cancer patients</p>
<p>- Potential benefits of MDMA for PTSD</p>
<p>- The existence of “enlightened assholes”</p>
<p>- Skepticism about brain research on psychedelics</p>
<p>- The role of the default network in "ego dissolution"</p>
<p>- Misrepresentation of the default network in the psychedelic and meditation literatures</p>
<p>- Benefits of psychedelics and meditation in combination</p>
<p>- Psychedelics and openness to experience</p>
<p>- From anxiety attack to “beauty attack” </p>
<p>- The potential for healthy psychedelic integration and increased community</p>

      <title>Amy Wrzesniewski || Finding Your Calling at Work</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we have Dr. Amy Wrzesniewski on the podcast. Dr. Wrzesniewski is a professor of organizational behavior at the Yale School of Management. Her research focuses on how people make meaning of their work in difficult contexts, such as stigmatized occupations, virtual work, or absence of work, and the experience of work as a job, career, or calling. Her current research involves studying how employees shape their interactions and relationships with others in the workplace to change both their work identity and the meaning of the job.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Topics incude:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- The definition of meaning</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- The four main sources of meaning</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Spirituality as a potential source of meaning at work</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- The way work allows us to transcend the self</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- The definition of calling</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- How to find your most meaningful calling</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- The importance of “self-resonance”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- The difference between consequences and motives</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- What is job crafting and how can it help you increase your calling?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Is job crafting contagious?</p>

      <title>Alice Dreger || Fuzzy Categories</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“<em>Nature doesn’t care about our desire to have these clean political categories for legal purposes.</em>” — Alice Dreger</p>
<p>Today I’m really excited to have Dr. Alice Dreger on the podcast. Dr. Dreger is a historian, bioethicist, author, and former professor of clinical medical humanities and bioethics at the Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University. Dreger is widely known for her academic work and activism in support of people at the edge of anatomy, such as conjoined twins and those with atypical sex characteristics. In her observations, it’s often a fuzzy line between “male” and “female”, among other anatomical distinctions. A key question guiding a lot of Dr. Dreger’s work (and which was the topic of her TEDx talk) is “<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/alice_dreger_is_anatomy_destiny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why do we let our anatomy determine our fate?</a>” Dr. Dreger is the author of multiple books, including “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Us-Conjoined-Future-Normal/dp/0674018257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One of Us: Conjoined Twins and the Future of Normal</a>” and “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Galileos-Middle-Finger-Heretics-Activists/dp/0143108115/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1526325635&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=Galieleo%E2%80%99s+Middle+Finger+Heretics%2C+activists%2C+and+the+search+for+justice+in+science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galieleo’s Middle Finger Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science</a>.”</p>
<p>In this episode, we discuss a wide range of topics, including:</p>
<ul>
 <li>How Dr. Dreger got involved in the “Intersex Rights Movement” in the mid-90s</li>
 <li>The difference between anatomy and gender identity</li>
  <li>The relationship between our bodies and our personal and social identities and the role of science and medicine in determining this relationship</li>
  <li>Who gets to tell your body what it means</li>
  <li>How the mind isn’t the only place where identity exists, and how our identities also exist in the minds of others</li>
  <li>The future of gender pronouns</li>
  <li>How we should treat those who do not fit traditional notions of sex, such as the fascinating cases of “androgen sensitivity syndrome” and “congenital adrenal hyperplasia”</li>
  <li>How we can see more value in variation in anatomy</li>
  <li>The need for a more reality-based government</li>
  <li>Why the phrase “identity politics” is distracting and only part of a larger problem</li>
  <li>The benefits and disadvantages of the “Intellectual Dark Web”</li>
  <li>The increasing difficulty of being able to tell what is true and what is false in the media</li>
  <li>Why we spend so much of our energy on tribal politics and avoid the real humanitarian problems in the world</li>
  <li>Why tribal life is so compelling</li>
  <li>The need to balance male and female ways of being</li>
  <li>What an “Intellectual Light Web” might look like</li>
</ul>

      <title>Jordan Peterson || Wonder, Creativity, and the Personality of Political Correctness</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we have Dr. Jordan Peterson on the podcast. Dr. Peterson has taught mythology to lawyers, doctors and business people, consulted for the UN Secretary General, helped his clinical clients manage depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and schizophrenia, served as an adviser to senior partners of major Canadian law firms, and lectured extensively in North America and Europe. With his students and colleagues at Harvard and the University of Toronto, Dr. Peterson has published over a hundred scientific papers. Dr. Peterson is also author of two books: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Maps-Meaning-Architecture-Jordan-Peterson/dp/0415922224" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief </em></a>and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1522119412&sr=8-1&keywords=12+Rules+for+Life%3A+An+Antidote+to+Chaos%2C&dpID=41Z06PJRlZL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos</em>,</a> which is a #1 bestseller.</p>
<p>In this wide-ranging conversation we discuss the following topics:</p>
<p>– Why “learned irrelevance” is incredibly important</p>
<p>– Why creativity requires keeping a childlike wonder</p>
<p>– How hallucinogens clear the “doors of perception”</p>
<p>– The “shared vulnerability” model of the creativity-mental illness connection</p>
<p>– The neuroscience of openness to experience</p>
<p>– The personality of personal correctness</p>
<p>– The practical implications of gender differences</p>
<p>– The function of the state in helping to make sure there is equality of individual expression</p>
<p>– How agreeableness and conscientiousness orient us differently in the social world</p>
<p>– The difference between pathological altruism and genuine compassion</p>
<p>– The link between pathological altruism and vulnerable narcissism</p>
<p>– The difference between responsibility and culpability</p>
<p>– How to help people take responsibility and make their lives better</p>

      <title>Kathryn Prescott || The Devastating Opioid Epidemic</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I’m delighted to have actress Kathryn Prescott on the podcast! Kathryn is an actor and photographer, originally from London. Ms. Prescott got her first big break when she was 17 playing Emily, a young lesbian with a homophobic twin sister, in the cult UK TV show “Skins”. A few years later she moved to the US to play the lead role in the MTV teen drama “Finding Carter” and has since appeared in various other projects including ‘To The Bone’, ‘Reign’ and ’24: Legacy’. Ms. Prescott is currently shooting her second season of AMC’s ‘The Son’ and has a movie coming out on Netflix in April called “Dude”.</p>
<p>After joining up with <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Big Issue Foundation</a> and <a href="https://centrepoint.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centrepoint</a> in the UK for a photography exhibition to raise money for both organizations, she wanted to do something similar in the US, so she got in touch with <a href="https://www.hhcla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homeless Health Care Los Angeles</a> but decided to do something a little different. Her film explores the cyclical nature of pain and isolation when it comes to addiction while highlighting the devastating effect that the opioid epidemic is having on America’s youth. Mrs. Prescott has been surrounded by addiction throughout her life and people’s reactions to it have always fascinated her.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In our conversation, Melissa shares with us:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- How awkwardness comes from self-consciousness and uncertainty</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- How doing improv can help you become less awkward</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- How we create more drama with ourselves than necessary</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- What we can do to become more one with our awkwardness</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Why the “irreconcilable gap” can lead to awkwardness</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- How to find the “growing edge” and challenge yourself to have more awkward conversations</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This episode may be the most awkward episode of <em>The Psychology Podcast</em> yet (and that’s saying a lot!). So you won’t want to miss it! :)</p>

      <title>Jessica Tracy || Shades of Pride</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>“What is it in the human psyche that allows us to achieve, create, discover, and invent in ways that no other species can?”</blockquote>
<p>This is a question Jessica Tracy explores in her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Take-Pride-Deadliest-Secret-Success/dp/0544273176" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Take Pride: Why the Deadliest Sin Holds the Secret to Human Success</em></a>. Tracy is a professor of psychology, an emotion researcher, and a social-personality psychologist at the University of British Columbia. In our conversation we discuss the established and emerging research on:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The 2 distinct expressions of pride (hubristic and authentic), and how they relate to the routes to power (dominance and prestige),</li>
 <li>The experience and expressions of shame, and how the emotion has made its way into the research on everything from narcissism to addiction,</li>
  <li>The moral and self-conscious emotions, and the roles they play in decision making.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to Jessica for coming on the podcast and discussing these fascinating and important lines of research!</p>

      <itunes:summary>“What is it in the human psyche that allows us to achieve, create, discover, and invent in ways that no other species can?”
This is a question Jessica Tracy explores in her book Take Pride: Why the Deadliest Sin Holds the Secret to Human Success. Tracy is a professor of psychology, an emotion researcher, and a social-personality psychologist at the University of British Columbia. In our conversation we discuss the established and emerging research on:

 The 2 distinct expressions of pride (hubristic and authentic), and how they relate to the routes to power (dominance and prestige),
 The experience and expressions of shame, and how the emotion has made its way into the research on everything from narcissism to addiction,
  The moral and self-conscious emotions, and the roles they play in decision making.

Thanks to Jessica for coming on the podcast and discussing these fascinating and important lines of research!

      <title>Kirk Schneider || Existential-Humanistic Therapy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“<em>Adventure and awe are key to the perpetuation of vibrant, evolving lives, and in combination with technological advances may bring marvels to our emerging repertoires.</em>” — Kirk Schneider</p>
<p>Kirk Schneider is a psychotherapist who has taken a leading role in the advancement of existential-humanistic therapy and existential-integrative therapy. He has authored or coauthored ten books, including <em>The Paradoxical Self</em>, <em>Humanity’s Dark Side</em>, <em>Existential-Integrative Psychotherapy</em>, <em>The Psychology of Existence</em> (with Rollo May), <em>The Polarized Mind</em>, <em>The Handbook of Humanistic Psychology</em>, and <em>Awakening to Awe</em>. Dr. Schneider is the 2004 recipient of the Rollo May award for “outstanding and independent pursuit of new frontiers in humanistic psychology” from the Humanistic Psychology Division of the American Psychological Association.</p>
<p>In this episode, Kirk teaches us how we can connect with the mystery and discovery in our daily lives in a way that allows us to feel, sense, imagine, create, wonder, and to feel the dysphoric feelings as well, the poignancy of sadness of hurt or anger, and in essence, experience a larger sense of life and of creative work. Kirk's seminal work in existential-humanistic therapy has helped many people be more open to new possibilities and sensitivities to oneself as well as other people, other species, and have a more profound appreciation of our fleeting time in space. Among these topics, we also discuss the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>What is existential-humanistic therapy?</li>
 <li>Kirk’s kinship with Rollo May</li>
  <li>Kirk's debate with Ken Wilbur about "ultimate consciousness"</li>
  <li>Kirk's vision of an awe-based era in the age of roboticism</li>
  <li>Kirk's vision of "depth healers"</li>
  <li>How to preserve the core of humanity in this brave new world</li>

Dr. Schneider is the 2004 recipient of the Rollo May award for “outstanding and independent pursuit of new frontiers in humanistic psychology” from the Humanistic Psychology Division of the American Psychological Association.</p>
<p>In this episode, Kirk teaches us how we can connect with the mystery and discovery in our daily lives in a way that allows us to feel, sense, imagine, create, wonder, and to feel the dysphoric feelings as well, the poignancy of sadness of hurt or anger, and in essence, experience a larger sense of life and of creative work. Kirk's seminal work in existential-humanistic therapy has helped many people be more open to new possibilities and sensitivities to oneself as well as other people, other species, and have a more profound appreciation of our fleeting time in space. Among these topics, we also discuss the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>What is existential-humanistic therapy?</li>
 <li>Kirk’s kinship with Rollo May</li>
  <li>Kirk's debate with Ken Wilbur about "ultimate consciousness"</li>
  <li>Kirk's vision of an awe-based era in the age of roboticism</li>
  <li>Kirk's vision of "depth healers"</li>
  <li>How to preserve the core of humanity in this brave new world</li>

      <title>Dan Ariely || Spending Smarter</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>“Money is incredible, but some of the things that make it incredible make it difficult to use.”</em></p>
<p><em>—</em> Dan Ariely</p>
<p>Today I’m excited to welcome Dan Ariely to <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>. Dan is a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University and a founding member of the Center for Advanced Hindsight. Through his research and his (often unorthodox) experiments, he questions the forces that influence human behavior and the irrational ways in which we often all behave. He is author of the bestsellers <a href="http://geni.us/predictablyirrational" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Predictably Irrational</a>, <a href="http://geni.us/upsideofirrationality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Upside of Irrationality</a>, and several others, and his latest book is <em>Dollars and Sense: How We Misthink Money and How to Spend Smarter</em>.</p>
<p>In our conversation we cover:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Why he decided to dedicate a whole book to money</li>
 <li>How the “pain of paying” affects how much we spend</li>
  <li>Why we tend to undervalue saving</li>
  <li>How fairness impacts our perception of value</li>
  <li>Why bad spending becomes a habit</li>
</ul>
<p>In this episode you’ll learn how to think about money and spend it in smarter ways. It was great getting to chat with Dan, and interesting to see the overlap between his research in Behavioral Economics and the research coming out of Positive Psychology. Enjoy!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>The process of being happy has become painfully comically neurotic"</em> - Ruth Whippman</p>
<p>This week I am delighted to welcome Ruth Whippman to <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>.

The book has been covered by <em>New York Magazine</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The New York Post</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, and <em>VICE,</em> among others.</p>
<p>Today we bring to you spirited discussion topics such as:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The cultural differences between America and Britain regarding attitudes about happiness (Ruth moved from London to California 6 years ago with her husband and 2 young sons).</li>
 <li>Dosage effects of positive interventions—<em>Is it useful to try to feel good all the time?</em></li>
  <li>The standards to which we hold motivational speakers, popular science writers, and scientists themselves—<em>Is it okay for standards to differ?</em></li>
  <li>The rampant promotion of  "pseudo-growth" among corporate flourishing initiatives.</li>
  <li>The parenting "happiness rat race".</li>

      <title>Elliot Aronson || Not by Chance Alone</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>"Life is full of lessons, and 'playing the hand you're dealt as well as you can play it' is a good one." -- Elliot Aronson</em></p>
<p>Today I'm incredibly excited to welcome the legendary Elliot Aronson to <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>. Aronson is an eminent social psychologist who is best known for his groundbreaking experiments on the theory of cognitive dissonance and for his invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_Classroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jigsaw Classroom</a>, a highly effective cooperative teaching technique which facilitates learning while reducing interethnic hostility and prejudice. He is the only person in the 120-year history of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychological_Association" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Psychological Association</a> to have won all three of its major awards: for writing, for teaching, and for research, and in 2007 he received the William James Award for Lifetime Achievement from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Psychological_Science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Association for Psychological Science</a>, in which he was cited as the scientist who "fundamentally changed the way we look at everyday life.”</p>
<p>Over the course of our in-depth and wide-ranging discussion, Aronson:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Shares stories and key lessons from his famous mentors–Abraham Maslow and Leon Festinger–and how each of the two altered the course of his life,</li>
 <li>Illuminates with examples some of his most fascinating findings in the field of Social Psychology,</li>
  <li>Offers his take on the replication crisis and on what he calls the "TED-ification" of Psychology,</li>
  <li>Imparts on us wisdom he's gathered not just as a researcher and psychologist but also as a father and brother.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a pleasure to have a legend in the field on the show for such a comprehensive conversation, filled with stories and lessons. Enjoy!</p>

      <title>Lewis Howes || The Mask of Masculinity</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I look at a man as a symbol of inspiration.<br />
Someone who looks to be of service along his journey.<br />
Someone who experiences fears but has the courage to face them and move forward anyway. Someone who’s loving to all people and creatures in world, including himself.<br />
Someone who can take care of his basic needs and teach others how to live in abundance. Someone who doesn’t judge people but looks for ways to lift others up.<br />
Someone who leaves this place better than the way he found it.<br />
That, to me, is a man.</p>
<p>— Lewis Howes</p>
<p>Today it’s great to have Lewis Howes on The Psychology Podcast! Lewis is a lifestyle entrepreneur, high-performance business coach, author and keynote speaker. A former professional football player and 2-sport All American, Lewis hosts The School of Greatness Podcast, which has received millions of downloads since it was launched in 2013. Howes is also an advisory board member of Pencils of Promise. His latest book is The Mask of Masculinity: How Men Can Embrace Vulnerability, Create Strong Relationships, and Live Their Fullest Lives.</p>
<p>Our conversation covers a few key themes such as:</p>
<p>The power of vulnerability and the role it’s played in Lewis’ life<br />
The masks men wear to hide who they truly are and the benefits of taking off these masks<br />
The male role models Lewis personally looks to for inspiration, and what he admires about them<br />
Hope you enjoy my conversation with Lewis, and if you want to learn more about each of the masks mentioned, be sure to check out his new book The Mask of Masculinity: How Men Can Embrace Vulnerability, Create Strong Relationships, and Live Their Fullest Lives.</p>

      <title>Cheryl Einhorn || Making Good Decisions</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I'm glad to welcome Cheryl Einhorn to <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>! Cheryl is the creator of the AREA Method, a decision making system for individuals and companies to solve complex problems. She is also the founder of CSE Consulting and the author of the book <em>Problem Solved, a Powerful System for Making Complex Decisions with Confidence & Conviction</em>. Cheryl teaches as an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and has won several journalism awards for her investigative stories about international political, business and economic topics.</p>
<p>In our conversation she takes us through the philosophy behind her unique perspective taking process for making better decisions as well as through each of the steps:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The AREA Method gets its name from the perspectives that it addresses: Absolute, Relative, Exploration & Exploitation and Analysis:
   <ul>
      <li>A, or Absolute, refers to the perspective of the research target. It is primary, uninfluenced information from the source itself.</li>
      <li>R, or Relative, refers to the perspective of outsiders around the target. It is secondary information, or information that has been filtered through sources connected to the target.</li>
      <li>E, or Exploration and Exploitation, are really about the human mind. Exploration is about listening to what other people think and believe. Exploitation is about listening to yourself and examining your own assumptions and judgment.</li>
      <li>The second A, or Analysis, synthesizes all of these perspectives, processing and interpreting the information you’ve collected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Cheryl also shares stories of the people she encountered along her journey of researching the book and explains a variety of applications of this method. We hope you enjoy this actionable episode, and if you're interested to applying this method to a decision you're struggling with right now, be sure to check out Cheryl's free resources!</p>

      <title>Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness || Peak Performance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week I’m excited to welcome Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness to <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>. Brad writes for <em>Outside</em>, <em>Runner’s World</em>, <em>NPR</em> and has a column in the <em>Huffington Post</em> about health and the science of human performance. Steve Magness coaches Olympians and marathoners, lectures at St. Mary’s University on Exercise Science, and writes for numerous publications including <em>Wired</em>, <em>Sports Illustrated</em> and <em>NY Magazine</em> on the science of performance.</p>
<p>Together they are partners in peak performance, in research, and in writing their latest book <em>Peak Performance: Elevate Your Game, Avoid Burnout, and Thrive with the New Science of Success</em>.</p>
<p>In this conversation, Brad and Steve teach us:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Why the word “performance” can be deceiving and how those of us focused on creative endeavors, who may not think of “performance” as an end goal, can benefit from their research,</li>
 <li>Why both physical and cognitive rest are crucial for world-class performance in our pursuits, in what’s known as the Paradox of Rest (some of you probably know how much I love a good paradox!),</li>
  <li>How harmonious passion maps onto their ideas about burnout, and how to identify whether a pursuit is rooted in harmonious or obsessive passion,</li>
  <li>Why Brad and Steve limit themselves to 24-48 hours of celebration or wallowing after identity-validating or identity-challenging events,</li>
  <li>How to optimize our routines to achieve peak performance,</li>
  <li>Why transcendence is one of the most underrated characteristics of peak performance.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dacher Keltner || The Power Paradox</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>"Power is given, not grabbed.” — Dacher Keltner</p>
<p>Today I’m really excited to have Dr. Dacher Keltner join me for his second appearance on <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>!</p>
<p>Dacher Keltner is a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and the faculty director of the UC Berkeley <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greater Good Science Center</a>. A renowned expert in the biological and evolutionary origins of human emotion, Dr. Keltner studies the science of compassion, awe, love, and beauty, and how emotions shape our moral intuition. His research interests also span issues of power, status, inequality, and social class. He is the author of the best-selling book <em>Born to Be Good: The Science of a Meaningful Life</em> and of <em>The Compassionate Instinct</em>.</p>
<p>His latest book is <em>The Power Paradox: How We Gain and Lose Influence</em>.</p>
<p>In our conversation we discuss several of Dacher’s ideas surrounding power including:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The unique definition of power he presents in the book</li>
 <li>The recent development in power research of the 2 paths to power:
    <ul>
      <li>Domination, Manipulation, Coercion</li>
      <li>Status, Respect, Strong Ties</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The myth of power stereotypes</li>
  <li>The problems of power
    <ul>
      <li>The challenges of getting it</li>
      <li>The difficulties of maintaining it</li>
      <li>The dangers of becoming addicted to it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Humility pathway of enduring power</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"Power is given, not grabbed.” — Dacher Keltner</p>
<p>Today I’m really excited to have Dr. Dacher Keltner join me for his second appearance on <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>!</p>
<p>Dacher Keltner is a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and the faculty director of the UC Berkeley <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greater Good Science Center</a>.

His research interests also span issues of power, status, inequality, and social class. He is the author of the best-selling book <em>Born to Be Good: The Science of a Meaningful Life</em> and of <em>The Compassionate Instinct</em>.</p>
<p>His latest book is <em>The Power Paradox: How We Gain and Lose Influence</em>.</p>
<p>In our conversation we discuss several of Dacher’s ideas surrounding power including:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The unique definition of power he presents in the book</li>
 <li>The recent development in power research of the 2 paths to power:
    <ul>
      <li>Domination, Manipulation, Coercion</li>
      <li>Status, Respect, Strong Ties</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The myth of power stereotypes</li>

      <title>Mitch Prinstein || Popularity and the Power of Likability in a Status-Obsessed World</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Mitch Prinstein, Ph.D. is board certified in clinical child and adolescent psychology, and serves as the John Van Seters Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience, and the Director of Clinical Psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He and his research have been featured in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, NPR, the LA Times, CNN, U.S. News & World Report, TIME magazine, New York magazine, Newsweek, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>In his latest book <em>Popular: The Power of Likeability in A Status-Obsessed World</em>, Prinstein examines how our popularity affects our success, our relationships, and our happiness—and why we don’t always want to be the most popular.</p>
<p>In our conversation we cover this and more, with key themes being:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Why seeking popularity is actually a basic human need,</li>
 <li>Why it's not always the "conventionally popular" people who fare best, and how this relates to the (2) different strategies for achieving popularity:
    <ul>
      <li>Likeability</li>
      <li>Status</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How studies can help explain both the basic human needs Facebook serves, and the more general status-seeking phenomenon on social media,</li>
  <li>What it means to induce a "Popularity Boomerang", and how becoming aware of it can fundamentally change the environment you exist in,</li>
  <li>How your early experiences of popularity (or lack thereof) are probably helping or hindering how you show up in the world today, and if hindering, how you can overcome its effects,</li>
  <li>Why  it's more important the raise likeable kids than you might think, and the parenting implications of popularity research,</li>
  <li>The likeability advantage.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope this conversation gives you some insights about popularity that will help you achieve your social, personal, and professional goals. Enjoy!</p>

      <title>Brendon Burchard || High Performance Habits</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>"What are the deliberate habits I can do consciously and consistently to keep getting better?" -- Brendon Burchard</em></p>
<p>This week I'm delighted to welcome Brendon Burchard to The Psychology Podcast! After suffering depression and surviving a car accident at the age of 19, Brendon faced what he felt were life’s last questions: “Did I live fully? Did I love openly? Did I make a difference?” His intention to be happy with the answers led to his own personal breakthroughs, and ultimately to his life’s purpose of helping others live, to love, and to matter. He spent his 20s researching psychology and leadership, and consulting at Accenture. By age 32, he went out on his own and became a #1 best-selling author, an in-demand high performance coach, a sought-after speaker, and an early pioneer in the online education space.</p>
<p>A #1 New York Times, #1 Wall Street Journal, #1 Amazon and #1 USA Today best-selling author, Brendon’s books include <em>The Motivation Manifesto</em>, <em>The Charge</em>, <em>The Millionaire Messenger</em> and <em>Life’s Golden Ticket</em>. His latest book is <em>High Performance Habits: How Extraordinary People Become That Way</em>.</p>
<p>In this episode we have an enthusiastic and empirically-informed conversation about:</p>
<ul>
 <li>How Brendon's past lead him to become the personal growth expert and multi-media pioneer he is today</li>
 <li>How thinking about life in terms of these 3 types can help you identify when it's time to take action or level up:<br />
<pre><code>&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Caged life&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comfortable life&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charged life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>How these 6 high performance habits can help you achieve long-term success and vibrant well-being:<br />
<pre><code>&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seek clarity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generate energy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raise necessity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase productivity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop influence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Demonstrate courage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>How these 4 key characteristics set successful creatives apart:<br />
<pre><code>&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Obsession&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social Duty&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deadline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>How Brendon thinks about backing his illuminating frameworks with research</li>
</ul>
<p>We cover several useful frameworks in this episode, so be sure to enjoy it with a pen in hand. If you're like us, you'll want to take a lot of notes!</p>

      <itunes:summary>&quot;What are the deliberate habits I can do consciously and consistently to keep getting better?&quot; -- Brendon Burchard
This week I&apos;m delighted to welcome Brendon Burchard to The Psychology Podcast! After suffering depression and surviving a car accident at the age of 19, Brendon faced what he felt were life’s last questions: “Did I live fully? Did I love openly? Did I make a difference?” His intention to be happy with the answers led to his own personal breakthroughs, and ultimately to his life’s purpose of helping others live, to love, and to matter. He spent his 20s researching psychology and leadership, and consulting at Accenture. By age 32, he went out on his own and became a #1 best-selling author, an in-demand high performance coach, a sought-after speaker, and an early pioneer in the online education space.
A #1 New York Times, #1 Wall Street Journal, #1 Amazon and #1 USA Today best-selling author, Brendon’s books include The Motivation Manifesto, The Charge, The Millionaire Messenger and Life’s Golden Ticket. His latest book is High Performance Habits: How Extraordinary People Become That Way.
In this episode we have an enthusiastic and empirically-informed conversation about:

 How Brendon&apos;s past lead him to become the personal growth expert and multi-media pioneer he is today
 How thinking about life in terms of these 3 types can help you identify when it&apos;s time to take action or level up:

    
      Caged life
      Comfortable life
      Charged life
    
  
  How these 6 high performance habits can help you achieve long-term success and vibrant well-being:

    
      Seek clarity
      Generate energy
      Raise necessity
      Increase productivity
      Develop influence
      Demonstrate courage
    
  
  How these 4 key characteristics set successful creatives apart:

    
      Identity
      Obsession
      Social Duty
      Deadline
    
  
  How Brendon thinks about backing his illuminating frameworks with research

      <title>Maia Szalavitz || Rethinking Addiction</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we're glad to welcome Maia Szalavitz to the podcast! Maia Szalavitz is one of the premier American journalists covering addiction and drugs. She is a co-author of <em>Born for Love</em> and <em>The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog</em>, as well as a writer for<em> </em><a href="http://time.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>TIME</em></a><a href="http://time.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>.com</em></a>, <em>VICE</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Scientific American Mind</em>, Elle, <em>Psychology Today</em> and <em>Marie Claire</em> among others. Her latest book is <em>Unbroken Brain</em>, which challenges the idea of the addict's "broken brain" and the simplistic notion of an "addictive personality".</p>
<p>The key themes of our conversation include:</p>
<ul>
 <li> The personal nature of her book and how emergent science has helped her understand her past</li>
 <li>Where the brain is and isn't to blame in the rise of addiction in individuals</li>
  <li>"Addiction is not a sin or a choice. It's also not a chronic brain disease."</li>
  <li>Why many addictive behaviors are adaptive, and the distinction between an "addiction" and a "dependence"</li>
  <li>"Traits that we think are useless can be useful in some settings."</li>
  <li>Why she advocates for a shift from belief-cased addiction treatment (ex. 12-step program) to evidence-based treatment</li>
  <li>"We all learn to become who we are." We end the conversation with a discussion of what this means to Maia and how we can all benefit from reflecting on this idea in different facets of our lives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maia offers a paradigm-shifting take on thinking about addiction, and we think you will learn a lot from this episode. Enjoy!</p>

      <itunes:subtitle>This week we&apos;re glad to welcome Maia Szalavitz to the podcast! Maia Szalavitz is one of the premier American journalists covering addiction and drugs. She is a co-author of Born for Love and The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog, as well as a writer for TIME.com, VICE, the New York Times, Scientific American Mind, Elle, Psychology Today and Marie Claire among others. Her latest book is Unbroken Brain, which challenges the idea of the addict&apos;s &quot;broken brain&quot; and the simplistic notion of an &quot;addictive personality&quot;.
The key themes of our conversation include:

  The personal nature of her book and how emergent science has helped her understand her past
 Where the brain is and isn&apos;t to blame in the rise of addiction in individuals
  &quot;Addiction is not a sin or a choice. It&apos;s also not a chronic brain disease.&quot;
  Why many addictive behaviors are adaptive, and the distinction between an &quot;addiction&quot; and a &quot;dependence&quot;
  &quot;Traits that we think are useless can be useful in some settings.&quot;
  Why she advocates for a shift from belief-cased addiction treatment (ex. 12-step program) to evidence-based treatment
  &quot;We all learn to become who we are.&quot; We end the conversation with a discussion of what this means to Maia and how we can all benefit from reflecting on this idea in different facets of our lives.

Maia offers a paradigm-shifting take on thinking about addiction, and we think you will learn a lot from this episode. Enjoy!

      <title>Michael Shermer || Science and Skepticism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we're excited to welcome Dr. Michael Shermer to <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>. Michael is the publisher of <em>Skeptic</em> magazine, a New York Times bestselling author, and a monthly columnist for <em>Scientific American</em>. He has also been a college professor since 1979 and is currently a Presidential Fellow at Chapman University, where he teaches Skepticism 101. In our conversation, Michael sheds light on a smorgasbord of intersections between psychology and skepticism. This episode is also a great primer for those of you who are curious about what it means to think like a skeptic.</p>
<p>In this episode we discuss:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The core tenants of skepticism</li>
 <li>The difference between skepticism and cynicism</li>
  <li>Whether it's possible--in the eyes of a skeptic--to "prove everything"</li>
  <li>The evidence-based probability that God exists</li>
  <li>How individual differences in personality (ex. Agreeableness) play a role in one's proclivity for critical inquiry</li>
  <li>Whether Michael would consider himself a skepticism "guru"</li>
  <li>How to suspend disbelief when you need to act but don't have all the evidence</li>
  <li>Michael's interpretation of the free speech discussion in light of recent events</li>
  <li>The recent conflation of free speech and hate speech</li>
  <li>Why we might be better off evaluating human problems relatively (as opposed to objectively)</li>
  <li>The differences between Atheists, humanists, and skeptics</li>
  <li>Michael's take on topics discussed by futurists (e.g. The singularity, cryogenics)</li>
  <li>Whether or not he is scared of death</li>
  <li>The distinction between meaning</li>
</ul>
<p>We wrap up the conversation by connecting the science of flourishing to positive psychology, where we cover the loci of focus that can predictably  bring us a sense of purpose, and the distinction between meaning and happiness.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

      <title>Robert Wright || Why Buddhism is True</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we're excited to have Robert Wright on <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>. Robert is the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of<em> Nonzero</em>, <em>The Moral Animal</em>, <em>The Evolution of God</em>, and most recently <em>Why Buddhism is True</em>. He has also written for <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Time</em>, <em>Slate,</em> and <em>The New Republic,</em> and has taught at The University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University, where he also created the online course Buddhism and Modern Psychology. Robert draws on his wide-ranging knowledge of science, religion, psychology, history and politics to figure out what makes humanity tick.</p>
<p>In this episode we cover:</p>
<ul>
 <li>How "taking the red pill" from The Matrix can be likened to the practice of mediation,</li>
 <li>How and why "our brains evolved to delude us",</li>
  <li>If and how Buddhism gets you more in touch with "reality", including the bottom-up processes of cognition,</li>
  <li>Whether or not one can take parts of the practice too far,</li>
  <li>How Buddhism can be beneficial for seeing beauty where you didn't before,</li>
  <li>Why our default state of consciousness isn’t necessarily good,</li>
  <li>How this book might infer that evolutionary psychology is not a complete explanation for many human tendencies,</li>
  <li>Why many feelings are illusions and how we know when they are,</li>
  <li>Why it's true that "the more we engage a 'module' the more power it has",</li>
  <li>Robert's interpretation of what the Buddha really meant by the "non-self", and how this does or does not conflict with one's sense of identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our conversation, Robert offers Buddhism as a solution for finding and sustaining happiness, exploring the interplay between Buddhist practices and evolutionary psychology in an unprecedented way. You may also find this episode interesting if you're curious about whether it's possible to see the world "accurately" or whether that's even best for one's well being. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>Note to Psychology Podcast listeners: This happens to be the 100th episode of The Psychology Podcast. Thank you for your support! It's been a fun journey so far, and we're looking forward to the next 100 episodes!</em></p>

      <title>Caren Baruch-Feldman || Growing Grit in Teens</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Caren Baruch-Feldman is a clinical psychologist, certified school psychologist, and author of <em>The Grit Guide for Teens</em>. She’s also authored numerous articles and workshops on topics such as cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, helping children and adults cope with stress and worry, helping people change, and developing grit and self-control. In this episode of <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>, Caren and I talk about how her work on grit was a natural outgrowth of her clinical practice, and how this led to writing a book specifically for teens. We also cover what she adds to Angela Duckworth’s definition of grit, and her thoughts on some of the controversies surrounding grit, such as the grit vs. conscientiousness debate and the circumstantial factors that affect grit that may be out of one’s control. We also discuss why parenting is different today and the importance of social support in cultivating grit. Lastly Caren sheds some light on things we can pay attention to in order to increase success in achieving our goals, such as the concept of the “two minds” she talks about in her book—the short-term and long-term minds—, effective vs. ineffective goals, why grit for the sake of grittiness isn’t the goal, and why it’s important to connect grit to our values.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Dr. Caren Baruch-Feldman is a clinical psychologist, certified school psychologist, and author of The Grit Guide for Teens. She’s also authored numerous articles and workshops on topics such as cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, helping children and adults cope with stress and worry, helping people change, and developing grit and self-control. In this episode of The Psychology Podcast, Caren and I talk about how her work on grit was a natural outgrowth of her clinical practice, and how this led to writing a book specifically for teens. We also cover what she adds to Angela Duckworth’s definition of grit, and her thoughts on some of the controversies surrounding grit, such as the grit vs. conscientiousness debate and the circumstantial factors that affect grit that may be out of one’s control. We also discuss why parenting is different today and the importance of social support in cultivating grit. Lastly Caren sheds some light on things we can pay attention to in order to increase success in achieving our goals, such as the concept of the “two minds” she talks about in her book—the short-term and long-term minds—, effective vs. ineffective goals, why grit for the sake of grittiness isn’t the goal, and why it’s important to connect grit to our values.

      <title>Sharon Salzberg || Real Love</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sharon Salzberg is a NYT best-selling author and teacher of Buddhist meditation practices in the West. She also cofounded the Insight Meditation Society and is the author of 9 books, the most recent being <em>Real Love: The Art of Mindful Connection</em>.</p>
<p>In this episode of The Psychology Podcast, we get to learn about why Sharon has devoted her life to these ideas, how meditation has impacted her consciousness, what characterizes "real love", what differences exist between the modern-scientific notions of attachment and Buddhist notions of nonattachment, what Loving Kindness practice is, how you can love someone even if you don't like them (and why you should), how to extend compassion to people who are already self-satisfied, why an important component of self-love is accountability, empathy burnout, how stories play a role in love, why love isn't a state, why excitement vs. familiarity in romantic relationships is perhaps a false paradox, and how mindfulness can help you reframe even the most emotionally difficult situations.</p>
<p>Sharon also takes us through her RAIN model for mindfulness:</p>

      <title>Christina Pierpaoli || Aging Meaningfully</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m really excited to have Christina Pierpaoli on the podcast. Christina is a graduate student in the Geropsychological doctoral program at the University of Alabama. Her research explores associations between chronic illness and psychological health in older adults, and she is by all accounts a rising star in the field of psychology.</p>
<p>For our listeners who may not be familiar with the literature, Geropsychology is the psychology of aging. As Christina puts it, this particular field of psychology can be described as “underrated, poorly understood, embryonic, and riddled with all sorts of stigma”. The world and the United States are aging precipitously, with the estimate that by 2030 1 in 5 Americans will be considered an older adult, but few people are talking about it.</p>
<p>In our conversation, Christina offers that “people are uncomfortable with talking about aging because talking about aging invites a conversation of mortality and finiteness” and speaks to the research showing that “the earlier and more often you think about your own mortality, the more gracefully you will live your life.”</p>
<p>Other things we talk about are the differences in language used to describe getting older when we are young vs. when we are older, unique issues older adults face that younger adults don’t, the idea of subjective age vs. chronological age vs. biological age, the role feeling useful plays in  life satisfaction as we age, the idea of loneliness as “the silent killer”, why Christina is so interested in older people, and why she writes a blog about this topic.</p>
<p>Christina brings a unique combination of young and old spirit to the field, a refreshing take on academia and how to get the ideas she finds important into the minds of the people who’d find them useful. No matter your age, you’re sure to get something out of this podcast. Enjoy!</p>

      <title>Monica Worline and Jane Dutton || Awakening Compassion in the Workplace</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>  <p>Today I'm really excited to have Monica Worline and Jane Dutton on the podcast, co-authors of the new book <em>Awakening Compassion at Work: the Quiet Power That Elevates People and Organizations</em>.</p> <p>Monica Worline, Ph.D., is founder and CEO of EnlivenWork. She is also a research scientist at Stanford University Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education and executive director of Compassion Lab. Jane Dutton, Ph.D., is the Robert L Kahn distinguished University professor of business administration and psychology and cofounder of the Center for Positive Organizations at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. She's also a founding member of Compassion Lab.</p> <p>A central thread in their work is that business has become dehumanized and impersonal. "One of the things that we're seeing as technology takes over more of our work spaces is there's an expectation that people are always available and always on, but that is driving out some of the human connection of work. " Increased busyness, workplace pressures and the distractions of technology increase our attentional load and handicap us from being able to notice the need for acts of compassion. The two define compassion in a way that is distinct from most psychologists.</p> <p>That is, their definition is a 4-step process:</p> <ul> <li>Noticing</li> <li>Interpreting (Making sense of human suffering)</li> <li>Feeling</li> <li>Acting (Responding to human suffering)</li> </ul> <p>In our conversation we unpack what each of these stages entails as well as addressing male vs. female values in the workplace, the role of the "toxin handler" in the ecosystem, why goal-oriented people should consider working on the culture of compassion at work, how to tackle the short term vs. long term horizon challenges of business when building compassionate cultures, and how organizations have become obstacles to compassion at work.</p> <p>We can only alleviate what we pay attention to.  The demanding culture of work organizations can drive out our capacity to notice the human state of other people. Through their book and speaking, Dutton and Worline hope to empower change agents in a host of settings.</p> <p>We hope that you leave this episode with a newfound sense of the importance of compassion and with multiple languages to convince others in your organizations to enforce and devote resources to it. Jane and Monica also bring a variety of examples that really crystallize these ideas. It was an honor to speak with these two, and we hope you enjoy the podcast!</p> <p><strong>Related Links</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LYKB8I4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1" target="_blank"> <em>Awakening Compassion at Work</em></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272202633_Empathy_A_Review_of_the_Concept" target="_blank"> Paper on the 8 different characteristics often referred to as "empathy" (mentioned)</a></p> <p>[Resource] <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwcssc/sites/default/files//hw00/d40/uwcssc/sites/default/files/Fear%20of%20Compassion%20Scale.pdf" target="_blank">Work of Paul Gilbert on the compassionate mind</a> (fear of compassion scale) (mentioned)</p> <p>https://anchor.fm/the-psychology-podcast/support</p></blockquote>

      <title>R. Chris Fraley || The Latest Science of Attachment</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we have one of the world's most preeminent attachment scientists, Dr. <a href="http://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/~rcfraley/" target="_blank">R. Chris Fraley</a>, on the podcast! Fraley is a Professor at the University of Illinois's Department of Psychology and received the American Psychological Association's Distinguished Scientific Award in 2007 for Early Career Contribution to Psychology in the area of Individual Differences. In this episode of <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>, we take a deep dive into a few of Chris' many interesting research areas: attachment processes in close relationships, personality dynamics, and development.</p>
<p>Some of the questions we explore are: <em>How are attachment styles measured? How does research on attachment styles differ between children and adults? What are the implications of individual differences in adult attachment styles? How does this relate to internal working models theory? How does all of that relate to one's own motivational account? What are the roles of nature vs. nurture in the development of attachment styles?</em></p>
<p>Note to our listeners: You may have already gotten the sense that this conversation is a bit technical, mostly geared towards those who are interested in understanding the debate, and the various nuances on the table. Nevertheless, we hope you enjoy the show, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts in the discussion below!</p>

      <title>Dan Harris || Become 10% Happier + BONUS Meditation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we have ABC News Anchor Dan Harris on the podcast. Harris is perhaps the most unlikely meditation evangelist, ever. After a panic attack on Good Morning America, he wrote the New York Times bestselling memoir “10% Happier” about what led him to embrace a practice he’d long considered ridiculous. He then started the 10% Happier: Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics app with a handful of bona fide meditation teachers, including Joseph Goldstein and Sharon Salzberg, as well as the 10% Happier podcast. On today's episode of <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>, we discuss Dan's personal experience with self-help gurus Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra, as well as Western Buddhist psychotherapists, such as Dr. Mark Epstein. As a bonus, there is a 3 minute mindfulness meditation led by Dan himself. Enjoy, and please leave feedback below!</p>

      <title>Eric Turkheimer || Intelligence, Genes, Race, and Poverty</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>, Dr. Eric Turkheimer and I take a deep dive into some of the most complex and controversial topics in all of psychology. What is intelligence? How is intelligence measured? Is intelligence meaningful? Is IQ modifiable? Is IQ heritable? What does heritability really mean? Is heritability of IQ the same across social classes? Are there race differences in IQ? If so, what are the potential causes of race differences in IQ? Why does any of this matter? Note to our listeners: This is a very technical discussion, mostly geared towards those who are interested in understanding the debate, and the various nuances on the table. For those who would like to join in the discussion, you can do so below. Enjoy!</p>

      <title>Eric Barker || How to Be Awesome at Life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Eric Barker is the author of the widely popular blog, "Barking Up The Wrong Tree", and he has a new book out with the same title. Barker is known for his science-informed articles on how to be awesome at life. For today’s episode, we focus on<strong> </strong>a range of topics relating to being awesome in life, including when to grit and when to quit, whether nice guys really finish last, the perils of self-esteem, how it's <em>who</em> you know instead of <em>what</em> you know that really matters, and how people can achieve success while striking a work-life balance. It's a fun and playful episode that contains a high-level discussion of many of the most researched constructs in psychology today, such as introversion/extroversion, giving/taking, deliberate practice/grit, and much more!</p>

In the second part of this two part series (see <a href="http://scottbarrykaufman.com/podcast/legendary-social-psychologist-roy-baumeister-identity-morality-meaning-life/" target="_blank">Part I</a>), we cover the psychology of self-control, evil, sex differences, and free will. In addition to Roy responding to the critics of his “ego-depletion” model of self-control, he also offers some practical strategies to improve willpower for goal attainment, looking at how successful people set up habits that deplete less energy. We also speak to him about the four root causes of violence, looking at research on why perpetrators commit atrocities, and we discuss his controversial research on sex differences and some of the ways that society uses men and women differently. Lastly, we discuss whether humans are special in a way that makes us exempt from the natural laws of causality. We’re appreciative of having had the opportunity to speak with Roy and regardless of whether you agree or disagree with his views (we encourage diverse perspectives on the show), we hope these two episodes (this week’s and <a href="http://scottbarrykaufman.com/podcast/legendary-social-psychologist-roy-baumeister-identity-morality-meaning-life/" target="_blank">last week’s</a>) offer a great deal of value to our listeners.

      <title>Tim Urban || Wait But Why? Unravelling Life&apos;s Biggest Mysteries</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We are huge fans of Tim Urban’s <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Wait But Why</strong></a> blog, so it was a great joy to speak with him for today's show. In this episode of The Psychology Podcast, we experience Tim’s patented wry wit and deep philosophical insight as we chat across a wide range of topics, including Tim’s journey to becoming one of the internet’s most popular bloggers, his creative process and self-regulation strategies, his views on our immediate governmental future, the relative importance of personality traits, the connection between the brain and consciousness, the viability of cryogenics, and much more. Tim has some wonderfully clear and entertaining mind experiments that spur some high-level discussions of some of the most fascinating psychological and philosophical mysteries of existence.</p>

      <title>Alain de Botton || Love, Sex, Religion and Happiness</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Modern day philosopher Alain de Botton has become world renown for his ability to provide compelling real world answers to some of life’s biggest questions. For this episode of The Psychology Podcast, we cover the philosophy and science of a range of topics, including what it means to have a “normal” relationship, the origins of the desire for religion, the pervasive lack of systematic thinking about happiness, how the illusion of perfection creates problems, existential crises and much more. We get a bit cheeky with a high brow discussion of the human condition. Fair warning that this episode does include some discussion of sex and pornography as they relate to well-being.</p>

      <title>Steven Kotler and Jamie Wheal || On Ecstasis and Extraordinary States of Consciousness</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Steven Kotler and Jamie Wheal, authors of the new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealin%E2%80%A6" target="_blank"><em>Stealing Fire</em></a>, come on the show to discuss the life changing power of ecstatic altered states of mind. The authors have worked with extreme sports athletes, Silicon Valley innovators, and maverick scientists to understand how high performing people are using peak experiences (such as flow) to unlock human potential. We talk about the “altered states economy” and how people spend trillions of dollars a year seeking altered states of consciousness, the transformative experiences we get from festivals like Coachella, what we see in the brain when individuals are using substances like LSD, and the “Hyperspace Lexicon.” It’s a high-level discussion of extraordinary states of consciousness, made fun and interesting by three experts in the field. Enjoy!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EASTER EGG</strong>: Listen to the very end of the podcast, after the music and outro, to hear a special interview between Steve and Jamie, which occurred while Scott was away!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Are we living in a simulated reality? Are our smartphones essentially an extension of our minds? Could we achieve immortality via being uploaded to the internet? These are just a few of the philosophically fascinating questions we cover on this episode of The Psychology Podcast! David Chalmers is a friend of the show and we are psyched to feature his expert opinions on the philosophy of mind. We cover how technology might affect the evolution of the human species, the future of artificial intelligence, and the future existence of “super-intelligence.” We’re talking about some of the most well thought out perspectives on the future of our species and technology – and it is entirely too much fun. Enjoy the show!</p>

      <title>64: The Power of Meaning</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of The Psychology Podcast, friend of the show Emily Esfahani Smith sheds light on how we can craft a life that truly matters. Finding meaning in life is a crtitical existential good, and with today’s discussion we take a science backed look at how we can achieve this vital purpose. Topics include Sufism, mystical experiences, authenticity, finding purpose, magic mushrooms, mortality, life narratives, transcendence and more. If you would like to hear about how to experience more meaning on a daily basis, give this episode a listen!</p> <p><strong>Emily Esfahani Smith</strong> writes about culture, psychology, and relationships. Her work has appeared in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The Atlantic</em>, and elsewhere. She is also a columnist for <em>The New Criterion</em> and an editor at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, where she manages the Ben Franklin Circles project, a collaboration with the 92nd Street Y and Citizen University to build community and purpose across the country. She studied philosophy at Dartmouth College and has a master’s in positive psychology from the University of Pennsylvania. She lives with her husband in Washington, DC.

This is a high level discussion about what it takes to flourish in the sports world and in life, how to silence one's inner critic, and how nature & nurture factor into world class success.

      <title>61: Creativity, Courageous Vulnerability and Wholehearted Living</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We are especially grateful (and giddy) to be sharing this episode with our listeners! Brene Brown's work really gels with our core interests here on The Psychology Podcast, and the resulting conversation contains some enthusiastic and empirically informed banter that is sure to inform and delight. We geek out over some counter-intuitive findings, like how incredibly compassionate people have a tendency to set the most boundaries and say "no."

      <description><![CDATA[<p>With this episode of The Psychology Podcast, we take a deep look into how exercise benefits us far beyond the time we spend in the gym. We adapt a quick fire style of questioning and cover a wide range of topics like how Olympic athletes set goals – to the importance of becoming comfortable with being uncomfortable. Brad is an expert in the subject and shares practical information about how to recover from stress, how to motivate high performance and how physical fitness improves “life fitness.” We’re making a real effort to improve the show for our listeners and would hugely appreciate 15 seconds of your time filling out this short survey:</p> <p><a href="http://survey.libsyn.com/psychologypodcast" target="_blank"> http://survey.libsyn.com/psychologypodcast</a> (Email is not required).</p>

      <itunes:subtitle>Today we welcome Anne Libera and Kelly Leonard on the show for an especially fun and playful look at the world of improv comedy! Anne and Kelly are world class improv instructors and ambassadors who have a long history at The Second City, the world’s first ever on-going improvisational theatre troupe. The Second City has turned out notable performers like Tina fey, Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers. Topics revolve around improv as it relates to mindfulness, creativity, cognitive reframing, authenticity and more. We also learned a lot from this interview about how improv can be used in everyday life, and we still get a kick out of the story we improvised involving the destruction of Purple Popsicle Man! We thank those listeners who take a moment to leave an honest iTunes review – it helps us hone our craft!

      <title>56: The New Narcissism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In everyday conversation, we use the word “narcissist” to describe our ex-lovers and the jerks we encounter on the subway, but what does it really mean? On this episode of The Psychology Podcast, Scott has a fascinating discussion with Kristin Dombek about the "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Selfishness-Others-Essay-Fear-Narcissism/dp/0865478236" target="_blank">new narcissism</a>”, in which everyone is a selfish narcissist-- <em>except ourselves</em>. In this episode, we take a close look at how the label narcissism is used in psychology and popular culture, and how its increasing use may be a product of our modern times. We also discuss the guilt and fear associated with being labeled a narcissist, we talk about the differences between narcissism and psychopathy, and we cover an assortment of other topics including science journalism, how often we act out of character in a day, and the possibility of a “selfie apocalypse!”</p>

      <title>55: The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this raw and uncut episode, Mark Manson imparts his wisdom on the art of not giving a fuck. According to Manson, the key to living a good life is “not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important”. In this interview, we learn about this unique art form, and all of the counterintuitive ways that giving less fucks in your life actually frees you up to get more of what you truly value. You’ll learn how the acceptance of one’s negative experience can itself be a positive experience, the benefits of suffering, the futility of searching for happiness, the ways that emotions are overrated, and how to distinguish between good values and unproductive values. You’ll also be inspired to learn that you are not as special as you think you are, and that you are wrong about everything. As if that wasn’t motivating enough, you’ll also learn to accept your mundane existence, and the inevitability of death. This was a fun, wise, and at times, rather profound, interview. <em>Note: In the spirit of Mark’s message, this entire interview is uncensored and unedited, which means that Scott shows extreme vulnerability in a way that he hasn’t before in past episodes. Fuck it.</em></p>

      <title>52: Reducing Racial Inequalities in Gifted Education</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dr. Davis</strong> is a career educator with over 30 years of experience as a practitioner, scholar, author and consultant. Her current work, a topic that is near and dear to the show, involves increasing equity of access to gifted education programs. In this episode, we talk about the racial inequalities that plague our nation's gifted education programs, and we discuss work being done to create equal opportunity. Other topics include: the current evaluation criteria for “giftedness” and how it can be improved, the importance of bringing all of the shareholders to the table for these discussions, the anti-intellectualism of our modern era, and several alternative ways of identifying giftedness in school. It’s a personally meaningful episode as Scott and Joy recount their own experiences with our non-inclusive education protocols. We hope you enjoy the show!</p>

      <itunes:summary>Dr. Davis is a career educator with over 30 years of experience as a practitioner, scholar, author and consultant. Her current work, a topic that is near and dear to the show, involves increasing equity of access to gifted education programs. In this episode, we talk about the racial inequalities that plague our nation&apos;s gifted education programs, and we discuss work being done to create equal opportunity. Other topics include: the current evaluation criteria for “giftedness” and how it can be improved, the importance of bringing all of the shareholders to the table for these discussions, the anti-intellectualism of our modern era, and several alternative ways of identifying giftedness in school. It’s a personally meaningful episode as Scott and Joy recount their own experiences with our non-inclusive education protocols. We hope you enjoy the show!

      <title>51: Developing Peak Performance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sean Desai is the defensive quality control coach for the Chicago Bears and works with some of the world’s greatest athletic competitors. In this episode, we discuss his player development model, known as D.I.C.E., which emphasizes the importance of Direction, Instruction, Collaboration and Empowerment. We talk about what it’s like to work with the NFL, the nature of coach-player relationships, and Sean imparts some practical advice to individuals hoping to become high-level athletic coaches. Other topics include: evaluating potential, key characteristics of mental toughness, striving for greatness and more. Football fans, leaders, coaches and teachers will appreciate Sean's insight into developing peak performance. The audio quality is a bit rough toward the beginning (we’re sorry!), but smooths out, and we think the content is top notch!</p>

      <title>50: Life Experimentation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Four time bestselling author (and human guinea pig) A.J. Jacobs gets us laughing, and thinking, about the benefits of lifestyle experimentation. In this episode, we discuss A.J.’s courageous journey to learn everything about the world via reading the entire encyclopedia Britannica. A.J. talks about his book<em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drop-Dead-Healthy-Humble-Perfection-ebook/dp/B005GG0N3M?ie=UTF8&ref_=asap_bc#navbar" target="_blank"> Drop Dead Healthy</a>, </em>where he spent months pursuing perfect physical health. We learn from his experiences following the bible (as literally as possible) for an entire year, and much more. Topics include: The importance of gratitude, what it’s like to win the lottery, the benefits of running electricity through the brain, and the differences between being psychotic, psychopathic and sociopathic. It’s an especially eclectic and playful episode that provides deep insight into what it means to live well. We hope you have as much fun listening to the episode as we had recording it. And feel free to leave a review on iTunes if you’re feeling compelled (it’s a big help to our cause and we thank you in advance)!</p>

      <title>49: Unraveling the Mysteries of Personality and Well-Being</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Who am I? Am I just a product of nature and/or nurture? What does it mean to live a life of meaning and happiness? On this episode of the psychology podcast, Dr. Brian Little helps us explore these existentially significant questions. We discuss whether or not the self is an illusion. We shed light on the effects of genes, societal influences and personal projects on personality. The conversation includes Brian’s experiences with influential psychologists such as George Kelly. Other topics include: the Big Five Model of personality, authentic living, identity change, and the good life. Brian has been described as a mix between Robin Williams and Albert Einstein, and we can see why after our discussion – it’s a fun and philosophically poignant episode featuring one of the legends in the field. Enjoy the show!</p>

      <title>48: The Ego is the Enemy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of The Psychology Podcast, we interview bestselling author Ryan Holiday about the timeless life-advice he gleaned from researching his latest book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015NTIXWE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1" target="_blank">Ego Is The Enemy</a>. Ryan shares insights from great individuals that eschewed the spotlight to put their higher goals above their desires for recognition.<strong> </strong>We talk about the importance of talking less and doing more. Our conversation covers the human drive to live a meaningful life and the dramatic shifts in worldview that takes place when astronauts view earth from outer space. We discuss the well-being benefits of integrating behavior with personal values and we commiserate over feeling existentially compelled to squeeze every last drop of productivity from each moment. It’s an interesting look at the foibles of egoism; anyone interested in contemplating what it means to live a good life would do well to give this episode a listen. Enjoy the show!</p>

      <itunes:summary>On this episode of The Psychology Podcast, we feature a particularly lively exchange, as Scott and Cal attempt to decode the patterns of success, sharing their perspectives on deep work, deliberate practice, grit, creativity, talent, mastery, IQ, and cultural misconceptions about passion and finding one&apos;s calling. The discussion has a fun and curious tone; it is a research-informed exploration of what it really takes to succeed in the 21st century. We had a great time recording this episode and we think you will really enjoy it.

      <title>46: Helping Children Succeed in School and in Life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We are happy  to welcome journalist and author Paul Tough on the show to discuss how we can help children from adverse backgrounds flourish. Paul began his deep dive into this topic 13 years ago for a <em>New York Times</em> piece, and he has been fascinated with the neuroscientific, psychological, political and sociological research ever since. This episode is a look at practical recommendations for how children can transcend difficult circumstances and cultivate well-being. We cover some of the challenges facing impoverished children and the effects of these environments on how children develop. We discuss constructs like grit, conscientiousness, character strengths, and "non-cognitive capacities". We ask important philosophical questions like “are the skills associated with doing well in school really the same as doing well in life?” We look at how pursuing well-being can actually fuel academic success, the importance of creativity and autonomy in school, and much more!</p>

      <title>44: The Cognitive-Experiential Self-Theory of Personality</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>An intellectual hero of the show, 91 year old Seymour Epstein is the creator of one of the most well-respected theories in personality psychology: the Cognitive-Experiential Self-Theory of Personality (CEST). In this episode, we discuss how Epstein discovered his calling, what the field of psychology was like in the 1940s, his experience taking a class with Abraham Maslow, his interaction with Gordon Allport, and how he came to create his dual-process theory of personality. We also talk about implications of the theory as it relates to religion, politics and clinical psychology. It was a pleasure speaking with this giant in the field. Enjoy the show!</p>

      <itunes:summary>We welcome friend of the show Dr. Glenn Geher to discuss human mating intelligence. Glenn is an expert in the field of evolutionary psychology and has a wealth of fascinating research to share on the origins of species – if listeners have ever wanted a crash course in evolutionary thought, this is an excellent primer. Topics include: the attractiveness of creativity and humor from an evolutionary perspective, the many causes of human behavior, human universals vs. individual differences, how our evolutionary hard-wiring affects modern behavior and much more. Conversation really flows in this episode as we discuss what people find attractive in potential mates.. For more information, check out Glenn and Scott’s book Mating Intelligence Unleashed!

      <title>41: Releasing Your Inner Bonobo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Susan Block is a world renowned sex therapist, radio talk show host and expert on the culture of the bonobo great ape. Needless to say, this is an especially interesting episode! We explore how pleasure can be a guiding principle in the good life, when it is tempered with kindness and a sense of meaning. We discuss the methods and positive outcomes of erotic theater therapy. We cover different cultural perspectives on sex, sexual identity, taboos and repression. We take a deep look into the culture of the Bonobo great ape, who is one of our closest relatives in the animal kingdom, to see how they might teach us about forming a more peaceful society – they have never been seen killing each other in the wild or in captivity! Other topics include female empowerment, asexuality, polygamy and politics. This episode contains material that may be graphic for some of our younger viewers, but it is an enlightening look into the psychology of sex and the good life. </p>

      <title>40: Extraordinary Workplaces</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Ron Friedman Ph.D. shares research from his latest book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399165606?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=0399165606&linkCode=shr&tag=ignite80com-20&linkId=VRMLBUA7CGGJ5PB7" target="_blank">The Best Place to Work</a>, about the art and science of creating an extraordinary workplace. Ron discusses how businesses can appeal to basic psychological needs like autonomy, competence and relatedness to design a work environment which optimizes engagement and creativity. It’s an especially practical episode, where we dive into science-backed recommendations to help companies improve the hiring process, boost motivation and enhance decision making. This episode features some very interesting research, like the persuasion techniques used by hostage negotiators, as well as didactic stories about figures like Monica Seles and president Obama on the importance of unconscious thinking and leading by example. </p>

      <title>39: The New Principles of Business Management</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of The Psychology Podcast, Dr. David Burkus discusses the latest research in organizational psychology to help business thrive in our post-industrial world. In particular, we talk about his latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Under-New-Management-Organizations-Upending/dp/0544630971/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1441990711&sr=8-1&keywords=under+new+management+burkus" target="_blank">Under New Management</a>, which reveals the counter-intuitive leadership practices that actually enhance engagement and drive performance in companies. This is a great episode for anyone interested in what the science has to say about optimizing workplace performance. We discuss how and why top companies like Whole Foods and McDonalds are emphasizing employee satisfaction, engagement and well-being at work. We also cover topics such as perceptions of inequality, positive effects of income transparency, ditching performance appraisals, some barriers to productivity and some of the genius tactics of big companies like Zappos (who will pay you to quit you job?!).  We hope you enjoy!</p>

      <title>38: Discussing the nature of childhood prodigies</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>On this episode of the psychology podcast, we gain insight into the fascinating and mysterious psychology of prodigious children. Kimberly Stephens recently co-authored a book investigating the link between autism and extraordinary childhood talent called </strong><a href="http://prodigyscousin.com/books" target="_blank"><strong>The Prodigy's Cousin</strong></a><strong>, which had made her an excellent source of knowledge. We discuss the extraordinary working memory, attention to detail, passionate interest, talent development and parenting styles that tend to characterize incredible childhood skill. We also cover an interesting genetic component; research suggests that autism tends to be present in the families of prodigies. The conversation is a celebration of the high achievement, intense interest and quirky personalities expressed by prodigies like </strong><a href="http://www.jonathanjazz.net/Welcome.html" target="_blank"><strong>Jonathan Russell</strong></a><strong>, who has been known to pass the time recreating music with household items like blenders and washing machines! It’s a fun discussion and we’re excited to share it with our listeners.</strong></p>

      <title>34: How Happiness Can Accelerate Your Success</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span> Dr. Emma Seppälä is a true friend of the show and we’re thrilled to speak with her about her new book, </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Happiness-Track-Science-Accelerate/dp/0062344005" target="_blank">The Happiness Track</a>. In this episode, we provide data-driven insight into how our overextension is hindering our success, and how cultivating happiness can actually drive our achievement. The research shows that we needn’t be chronically over-scheduled and over-caffeinated to achieve our goals. Pursuing things like meaningful relationships, gratitude and self-compassion can actually be more conducive to success. We cover some fascinating studies and offer practical thoughts on enhancing well-being and innovation. We think you’ll really enjoy the dialogue.</p>

      <title>28: Learning How to Learn</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of The Psychology Podcast, we dive deep into the psychology of learning with one of its top experts, Barbara Oakley PhD. She shares some tremendously practical advice on how to optimize learning, boost memory and neutralize procrastination. We also shed light on related topics like improving the education system, the mechanics of learning, popular perceptions of mathematical ability and the importance of optimistic realism. Barbara's free online course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/learning" target="_blank"><strong><em>Learning How to Learn</em></strong></a> is one of the most popular courses in the world, with well over half a million students in its first six months alone; We’re lucky to learn from this master of learning how to learn! </p>   <p>"<strong>Barbara Oakley</strong>, PhD, PE, is a professor of engineering at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, and writer of national acclaim. Her research focuses on the complex relationship between neuroscience and social behavior. Dr. Oakley’s research has been described as “revolutionary” in the Wall Street Journal—she has published in outlets as varied as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and The New York Times. Oakley’s books have been praised by many leading researchers and writers, including Harvard’s Steven Pinker and E. O. Wilson, and National Book Award winner Joyce Carol Oates. Her forthcoming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mind-For-Numbers-Science-Flunked/dp/039916524X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400730505&sr=8-1&keywords=a+mind+for+numbers" target="_blank"><em>A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)</em></a> (Penguin, July 31, 2014) is opening new doors on how to learn.” -Blurb taken from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/barboakley" target="_blank">Coursera</a></p>
