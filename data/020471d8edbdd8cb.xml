   <media:description>Democrats PANIC, Biden Campaigns In BLUE Areas Fearing Midterm Red Wave Is WORSE Than They Thought. Blue districts are turning Republican less than a week from the polls.

Democrats are now warning civil war and the end of democracy are upon us as people participate in democratic elections and vote them out.

Republicans are campaigning on lowering gas prices, stopping crime, and lowering inflation while democrats cry about maga republicans.

   <media:description>Democrats PANIC As New Projection has GOP Winning NH &amp; PA In Midterms, Dems Blame Ignorant Americans. RCP has Republicans winning 54 seats in the senate and it may actually be worse for democrats than that.

Biden is warning about election denial and Hillary clinton is blaming americans for being too stupid to know whats good for them.

But the reality is that a crumbling economy, rising interest rates, diesel shortages, and massive gas prices regular people have had enough of failed democrat policy

   <media:description>Joe Rogan Warns GOP RED WAVE Coming As Diesel Shortage Could Mean NO GAS Just DAYS Before Midterms. Shortages could mean huge spike is gas prices as voters are already outraged at Democrats for failed policy.

Even in New York Zeldin is taking the lead as the red wave hits even the most liberal states. Voters have had enough of skyrocketing crime rates, gas prices, and failed democrat policy.

Republicans may not be offering much more than stopping democrats but for most voters its probably enough. Biden and Fetterman clearly dont have the capacity and Democrats dont have anything else to offer.

   <media:description>DHS LEAKS PROVE Government Conspiracy With Twitter, Big Tech, To Censor And Subvert Elections. The shocking leaks expose a massive conspiracy and may be due to Elon Musk's Twitter take over.

The documents reveal Vijaya Gadde had been meeting with Feds and advocating for government control of information. The report also shows the FBI intervened to Facebook ultimately resulting in the Hunter Biden laptop story being Censored.

With the midterms less than a week away the information here shows we may be facing the true end of the republic. This is one of the biggest stories in US history and of our Lives.

The Biden administration is directly implicated in supporting, advocating for, and trying to shield this degree of extreme corruption.

   <media:description>RCP Projection Shows BLOWOUT LOSSES For Democrats In Midterms, Fetterman Oz Debate BACKFIRING. Democrats and Republicans are already accusing each other of cheating.

If neither side will accept the results due to distrust of each other or the system then the only result will be civil war. Already the RNC files 73 lawsuits in 20 states and democrats and liberal press are claiming Trump is cheating to steal not just the midterms but also the 2024 election.

Despite the revolt from voters Democrats are unwilling to course correct and are continuing to entertain unhinged leftist values that are pushing the gop to victory.

   <media:description>Democrats PANIC Over Armed Groups Monitoring Ballot Boxes, File Lawsuit To STOP Midterm Monitoring. Democrat organizations are suing a conservative group for encouraging people to monitor drop boxes.

Many fear that as we get closer to election day these conflicts could escalate resulting in one or several polling locations being shut down. While the midterm is important and many expect a red wave this could lead up to a more drastic 2024 cycle

Hillary Clinton is now warning that the GOP is trying to steal 2024 in an unhinged rant.

Divisions are getting worse and a second civil war is becoming more and more likely.

   <media:description>DeSantis Volunteer MERCILESSLY BEATEN Canvassing In Biden County, Democrats PANIC As GOP Lead GROWS. The attack sparks fears of growing civil conflict in the US and potential for civil war.

Republicans are calling on Democrats to condemn the attack as more people express fears of growing conflict. In Miami DeSantis is expected to win which would be the first republican to win in 20 years.

The midterms are looming and Biden has nothing to campaign on as many of the cultural issues matter very little to people crushed by high gas prices.

   <media:description>Steve Bannon Sentenced To FOUR MONTHS, Says November 8th Is JUDGEMENT Day &amp; THE END Of Biden Regime. Biden's Corrupt DOJ Has arrested pro life activists but ignored the far left who protested at SCOTUS homes.

Bannon has been released pending appeal and the question of executive privilege may go all the way to SCOTUS. But this case further exemplifies the corruption in our government. Biden and democrats keep targeting the right while ignoring far left protesters who commit comparable crimes

Bannon says November 8th is judgement day and the end of Biden's regime.

   <media:description>Kanye West Calls Biden EFFING R-T-RDED In EPIC SMACKDOWN Of Failing Democrats As GOP WINNING Polling. Gas Prices are skyrocketing and now polls are flipping dramatically in favor of republicans.

Kanye West spared nothing in slamming Biden more than three times as an effing R-T-RD in an interview with Piers Morgan.

Democrats are reeling as the economy tumbles, war is draining our coffers, and the american voter is furious at the failed democrat policies.

Republicans are starting to look good when it comes to taking all of congress, the senate, and the house and the midterms are being called a democrat red october by the nytimes

   <media:description>Stacey Abrams Says ABORT THE POOR In Attempt To Tie Failing Issue To Inflation As GOP Starts WINNING. Democrats know they are losing due to gas prices and inflation so Abrams threw out this hail mary and flopped.

Voters are rejecting democrats as polls have begun shifting wildly toward republicans and the gop. This is national level polling as well signaling Democrats are going to be swept away in a massive red wave.

its gotten so bad that even Obama is railing on Biden and Democrats over their culture war issues and told them to focus on kitchen table issues like the economy.

The midterms are only a few weeks out and anything could happen.

   <media:description>Democrats Run UNHINGED Ad Of Woman ARRESTED For Having Abortion, Voters Switch To GOP Over Inflation. Democrats are banking huge on abortion and January 6th despite voters only caring about inflation and gas prices.

Eric Swalwell ran a ridiculous and poorly produced ad showing a woman getting arrested at dinner with her family. The message is vote Democrat or else. Except even Chuck Grassley and most republicans reject arresting women for abortion and they even opposed a national abortion ban.

Biden is tanking the economy and desperately trying to control gas prices even sacrificing our strategic petroleum reserves for political gain

   <media:description>Democrats In PANIC MODE As GOP Sees MASSIVE Boost After Bidinflation TANKS Economy And Liberals QUIT. The economy and inflation are the number 1 issue as democrats rant about trump, maga and january 6th.

Voters have spoken and the polls show a major swing in favor of the gop to win the midterms. With just a few weeks left the Republicans are taking major gains in the polls as Democrats harp about culture war issues and drive us toward world war 3.

The kicker is that these are national polls and not swing district polls. In one poll the GOP has a 5 point lead in swing districts predicting democrats will LOSE massively in november.
