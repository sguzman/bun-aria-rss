You guys, I am so excited about what you're going to hear and who you're going to hear from.  We're going to worship God and remind each other that God is bigger than the darkness and walls and mountains we're facing. There's an incredible worship team... these teachers are fired up to serve you this weekend... and there are 10 different breakout sessions to choose from too. It's so easy to join us. Even if you can't watch live, you can hop in when you need to and stop and start as you go. Just go to if2022.com to get your digital pass. They start at $29! <br /><br />REGISTER HERE: IF2022.COM]]></itunes:summary><itunes:duration>1383</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://d1bm3dmew779uf.cloudfront.net/rss/show/3553112/52734fce80c84c2333205d2760cbc522.png"/><itunes:season>9</itunes:season><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType></item><item><title>We're lonelier than ever.
