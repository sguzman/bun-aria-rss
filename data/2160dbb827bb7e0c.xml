			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust me when I say you’re in for a treat with today’s podcast. I'm chatting with Beth from Crowley House Flower Farm about how she earns a living doing what she loves… growing cut flowers. If you’re thinking, "I don't need to grow cut flowers," or, "I already grow flowers in my garden, so this episode isn't for me," stick with me because, for decades, I didn't put time or effort into growing flowers. Then I started studying herbalism and quickly realized how certain flowers (that double as medicine) can actually help my vegetable garden as well.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was recently posed a question by one of my listeners regarding the issue of the conflict between supporting local farmers and trying to get the most for your money when it comes to our food. This is a topic of discussion that's getting louder each year as inflation continues to increase the cost of food. The supply-chain issues have also made many of us reconsider where we're sourcing our food and other supplies.

That may sound strange, but we’ve had a dream to host large events and teach real life homesteading classes for a long time now, and this property, just ½ mile from our current home became available and we bought it!

On today's podcast, I'm talking with Carl who, for 30 days, ate only foods he could either grow or source from his own property, or locally to where he lives. This included everything from beverages, fats, seasonings, and more! He even traveled to the ocean to harvest his own sea salt for the challenge! If you’ve wanted to rely less on the grocery store, this is an interview to listen to! For all of the show notes and links, visit https://melissaknorris.com/341</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people recommend artificial lighting to keep up egg production during the winter months, but this is hard on hens. Alternatively, I work with the seasons to allow the hens to produce eggs in their natural cycles. As a result, our homestead has high egg production in the spring, with low production in the winter. A critical homesteading skill is to learn which foods are seasonal, and some may be surprised to learn that eggs are seasonal too!
