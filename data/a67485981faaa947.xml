Official “Just Look Up” Lyrics:
We knew no bounds
Fell at the speed of sound
Riding... Against all odds, But soon against ourselves.
You haunted every memory
With no goodbyes, all bad for me
Your pride put out the fire in our flames
Then just one look is all it takes
I feel your eyes they’re locked on every part of me
Then my dumb heart says...

Just look up
There is no place to hide...
True love doesn’t die, it holds on tight and never lets you go
Just look up!
You cannot deny the signs...
What you’ve waited for, don’t wait no more.
It’s right up above you. Just look up!

(Baby) Know I let you down a n---- can’t deny it (Uh uh)
And there’s so much I could lose and yes that matters (yeah)
I’ve been dealing with madness (yo)
Wasn’t the man you needed
You dealing with sadness
Truthfully it’s all on me
And I’m sorry my love Imma heal your heart
I’ll hold it in my hand
Time is ohh so precious, we don’t really have much left now 
Take my hand baby Never leave you Riley 

Look up
What he’s really trying to say
Is get your head out of your
And listen to the goddamn qualified scientists
We really messed it up, messed it up this time
It’s so close I can feel the heat big time
You can act like everything is alright
but this is probably happening in real time

Celebrate, Or cry or pray ...
Whatever it takes to get you through the mess that we made!
Cause, tomorrow may never come!

Just look up
Turn off that crazy news
Cause you’re about to die soon everybody!
Look up
Here it comes
I’m so glad I’m here with you
Forever in your arms

   <media:description>Ariana Grande - Positions Album (Official Live Performances) | Vevo

If our Official Live Performances of “pov,” “positions,” “safety net,” “my hair,” “34+35,” and “off the table” reveal anything, it’s that Ariana Grande excels at her job because she’s so passionate about the results. You don’t hit the high notes, you don’t exude candor, and you don’t make pop music as moving as she does without crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. A very cool Cali session with the look and feel of a cozy little meadow was a perfect place to turn some of the best tunes on ‘Positions’ into utterly memorable performances. Now they’re all in one place. Just press play. 

00:00 - pov
3:26 - positions
7:44 - safety net
11:10 - my hair &amp; 34 +35
17:20 - off the table

A very cool Cali session with the look and feel of a cozy little meadow was a perfect place to turn some of the best tunes on ‘Positions’ into utterly memorable performances. Go Team Ari. In a typically inventive move, our hero chose to loop her vocals when it came time to perform the album’s title track. Watch her augment the band’s moves with a little layering of her voice. As she references both the kitchen and the bedroom in her lyrics, the sound stacks up, taking on its own internal rhythm. Beautiful.

The Weeknd showed up to assist his pal with the dreamy mood of “off the table.” As proven previously on tracks such as “Love Me Harder” and “Save Your Tears,” their chemistry is deep. The two stars glide through the song, helping each other reveal the nooks and crannies that are only obvious to accomplished musicians.

   <media:description>Ariana Grande - 34+35 (Official Live Performance) | Vevo

If our Official Live Performances of “pov” and “safety net” reveal anything, it’s that Ariana Grande excels at her job because she’s so passionate about the results. You don’t hit the high notes, you don’t exude candor, and you don’t make pop music as moving as she does without crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. A very cool Cali session with the look and feel of a cozy little meadow was a perfect place to turn some of the best tunes on ‘Positions’ into utterly memorable performances. Go Team Ari. She reproves her queen status with the swag she shows while skipping toward the camera at the start of “34+35.” The lustful lyrics are in the air, and visions of a private evening with boo accent the naughty atmosphere. The song has become a certified classic since it arrived last fall. Its steamy luster is obvious here.

   <media:description>Ariana Grande - my hair (Official Live Performance) | Vevo

If our Official Live Performances of “pov” and “safety net” reveal anything, it’s that Ariana Grande excels at her job because she’s so passionate about the results. You don’t hit the high notes, you don’t exude candor, and you don’t make pop music as moving as she does without crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. A very cool Cali session with the look and feel of a cozy little meadow was a perfect place to turn some of the best tunes on ‘Positions’ into utterly memorable performances. Go Team Ari. This spin on “my hair” has a jazzy feel, amplifying the breezy vibe that was established on ‘Positions.’ Makes sense, Ari’s vocals dart and flash like a nightclub saxophonist improvising through a tune. Hang tight, there are three more coming…

   <media:description>Ariana Grande ft. Ty Dolla $ign - safety net (Official Live Performance) | Vevo

For a singer, being able to set a mood is like being able to cast a spell. Time and again Ariana Grande has proven she's one of those vocalists who can architect an aura, and this performance of &quot;safety net&quot; is a great example of the way she controls the emotional climate of a song. The lyrics describe the feeling of being lost in love - a little bit over your head in a new relationship. By inviting Ty Dolla $ign along for a very smooth exchange of lines, Ari takes on an arranger's duties. She knows exactly how she wants this one to sound. &quot;safety net&quot; is from 'Positions,' of course. Like our previous Official Live Performance of &quot;pov,&quot; it puts her voice right up front, exactly where it should be. Deftly designing the use of swoops and trills, she again shows us her mastery of modern pop. Stay tuned, more coming.

   <media:description>Ariana Grande - pov (official live performance) | vevo 

Let’s talk about Ariana Grande’s voice for a sec. At the start of this Official Live Performance of “pov,” the superstar reveals the strength, depth and emotional clout that her instrument is able to share at any given moment. It’s an extended passage that swoops to unexpected places while remaining centered. “You got more than 20-20 babe/made of glass the way you see through me,” hovers in the air, and then the band sweeps in and everything swells a bit more. But it’s Ari that has established the tone, Ari that’s carrying the ball. It’s masterful in a way, and the lush set design bolsters both the song’s dreamy mood and her fetching fashion statement. Fans know that “pov” is from last year’s ‘Positions’ - a career high point for a  vocalist who has a natural way of totally enchanting her audience. We have other performances coming in this series. Follow our socials and you won’t miss a thing.

Official “POV” Lyrics:

It’s like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You’ve got more than 20/20 babe
Made of glass the way you see through me

You know me better than I do
Can’t seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride

I wanna love me (ooh)
The way that you love me (ooh)
For all of my pretty
And all of my ugly too
I’d love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me 
The way you trust me 
Ooh, ‘cause nobody ever
Loved me like you do
I’d love to see me from your point of view

I’m getting used to receiving
Still getting good at not leaving
I’mma love you even though I’m scared
Learning to be grateful for myself

You love my lips ‘cause they say the
Things we’ve always been afraid of
I can feel it starting to subside
Learning to believe in what is mine

I wanna love me (ooh)
The way that you love me (ooh)
For all of my pretty
And all of my ugly too
I’d love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me
The way you trust me
‘cause nobody ever
Loved me like you do
I’d love to see me from your point of view

I couldn’t believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient but now I’m out here falling falling
Frozen slowly thawing, got me right
I won’t keep you waiting, waiting
All my baggage fading safely
And if my eyes deceive me, 
Won’t let them stray too far

I wanna love me (ooh)
The way that you love me (ooh)
For all of my pretty
And all of my ugly too
I’d love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me
The way you trust me
‘cause nobody ever
Loved me like you do
I’d love to see me from your point of view

Official “main thing” Lyrics:

You on your way it’s a Friday night, hear the rain outside yeah
Its rose on ice, candlelight and I’m feeling nice
Anything you like boy you know it’s on me
Been a minute since I tasted something so sweet

Always pull up when I call you, call you
Yeah you never keep me waiting, waiting 
Got me tripping I adore you, I adore you 
Oh baby

You, oh you’re really different baby
You, you might be the main thing baby

It’s time to go take it nice and slow, tip toe to the bedroom
Lookin at me like when it’s cold you gon keep me warm
All I wanna do is spend my time with you
Even when the learnings done and nothings new

Always pull up when I call you, call you
Yeah you never keep me waiting, waiting 
Got me tripping I adore you, I adore you 
Oh baby

You, oh you’re really different baby
You, you might be the main thing baby 
You, oh you’re really different baby 
You, you might be the main thing baby
