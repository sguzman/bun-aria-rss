      <title>We Will We Will Mock You</title>
      <description>Mina and ESPN's Joel Anderson go back and forth to create a mock draft of who NFL teams should select later this month in Nashville. Joel tells us which prospect looks like Meek Mill, the player that doesn't have a face for greatness, and why a prospect's last name is giving him a boost. Mina suggests that Mountain Time is inconsiderate, says that a player has planetary upside, and rotates through a series of phrases like "pro ready", "plug and play", and "day one starter", which all mean the same thing. Plus, Mina chats with former Washington safety Taylor Rapp about his preparation for the draft.
