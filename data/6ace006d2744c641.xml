					<description><![CDATA[<p>Courtesy of EMicheal in comments. Kind of the point, I have been making for a while now. Labor wages are not the big driver of inflation. Corporations are increasing non-cost related prices and blaming it on inflation. But it&#8217;s not because of inflation. It is a cause of inflation.
