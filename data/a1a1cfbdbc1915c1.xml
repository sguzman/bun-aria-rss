Bans are happening around the country, in every state, and disproportionately affecting books by and about LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC people. What’s more, challenges are likely underreported, because librarians who are resisting them are facing unprecedented workplace retribution and in some cases physical danger.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Book Bans are on the ballot on November 8th, in every state and local election, up and down the ticket. State legislatures, local town councils, county leadership and school boards are being overrun with candidates supported by conservative activists looking to limit access to books and ideas that offer identity, empathy, awareness, and power to young people around the country. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We’re concerned, so today, we’re releasing a special episode of Fated Mates focused on book bans across the country. We interview three experts on what’s happening, who is most impacted, and how we can all help. Show notes are extensive, and we hope you’ll take a look at them. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thank you to librarians, teachers, and kids and families who are standing up and speaking out.

Bans are happening around the country, in every state, and disproportionately affecting books by and about LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC people. What’s more, challenges are likely underreported, because librarians who are resisting them are facing unprecedented workplace retribution and in some cases physical danger.

Book Bans are on the ballot on November 8th, in every state and local election, up and down the ticket. State legislatures, local town councils, county leadership and school boards are being overrun with candidates supported by conservative activists looking to limit access to books and ideas that offer identity, empathy, awareness, and power to young people around the country. 

We’re concerned, so today, we’re releasing a special episode of Fated Mates focused on book bans across the country. We interview three experts on what’s happening, who is most impacted, and how we can all help. Show notes are extensive, and we hope you’ll take a look at them. 

Thank you to librarians, teachers, and kids and families who are standing up and speaking out. We are proud to stand with you. </itunes:summary><itunes:explicit>yes</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>01:59:27</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/1665787508354-TIB5AREZH6UDGG55R6WV/fm+special.jpg?format=1500w"/><itunes:season>5</itunes:season><itunes:episode>6</itunes:episode><itunes:title>Stop Book Banning: A Special Episode of Fated Mates</itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>bonus</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/6349a5a9f4ae1e4a16079ad7/1665771013881/fated+mates+stop+book+banning.mp3" length="117655226" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/6349a5a9f4ae1e4a16079ad7/1665771013881/fated+mates+stop+book+banning.mp3" length="117655226" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">Stop Book Banning: A Special Episode of Fated Mates</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>S05.05: Moonstruck: A Wolf Without a Foot Redux!</title><category>full-length episode</category><category>joy</category><category>Milestone Episode</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Prokop</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2022/10/11/s0505-were-moonstruck-on-our-200th-episode</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644:5bcf6773419202388fdccb10:6345548d3cf5527bfc0ec1ea</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s our 200th Episode and we’re finally doing the thing we’ve been talking about doing for 200 episodes!

In this episode, we talk about her journey to romance writing — from writing in high school for her friends, while parenting, while thriving in a completely different career. We also discuss her career at multiple publishing houses including BET Arabesque, Silhouette Desire, Kimani, Mira, HQN, and now, with her own publishing company. We also talk about Brenda Jackson’s legendary families — the Westmorelands, the Steeles, the Madarises and the Grangers — about her relationship to readers, about her writing, about covers, about why 36 is a magic age in romance, and about keeping romance alive beyond the pages.  

We are thrilled to share this incredible conversation with all of you, and we are so grateful to Brenda Jackson for taking time to talk with us.</itunes:summary><itunes:explicit>yes</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>01:41:35</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/1656946680282-OL9P3Q2BIM93V7QSZ1BD/RED+trailblazers.jpg?format=1500w"/><itunes:season>4</itunes:season><itunes:episode>46</itunes:episode><itunes:title>S04.42: Brenda Jackson: A Trailblazer Episode</itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/62c4f8040641f26daedfb88e/1657075798126/fated+mates+trailblazer+brenda+jackson.mp3" length="101866179" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/62c4f8040641f26daedfb88e/1657075798126/fated+mates+trailblazer+brenda+jackson.mp3" length="101866179" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">S04.42: Brenda Jackson: A Trailblazer Episode</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>S04.41: Unputdownable Romance Novels</title><category>full-length episode</category><category>interstitial</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Prokop</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 12:55:37 +0000</pubDate><link>https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2022/6/28/s0441-unputdownable-romance-novels</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644:5bcf6773419202388fdccb10:62ba857959e11d4780dba670</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We don’t even know, y’all, so this week, we’re doing a little bit of flailing and a lot of talking about books we found unputdownable when we read them the first time.

As is right and just, the internet disagreed and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=top&amp;q=%23heroeswhoeat&amp;src=typed_query">#HeroesWhoEat</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=top&amp;q=%23batmangoesdown&amp;src=typed_query">#BatmanGoesDown</a> were born. It was a great day.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For what it's worth, it wasn't just the internet that disagreed. Zach Snyder confirmed that Batman in fact <em>does</em> eat, with <a href="https://twitter.com/pikaso_me/status/1407034041598050304/photo/1">one of the greatest tweets of all time</a>. At least, we think so. <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/1405702805948538881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1405702805948538881%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleedingcool.com%2Fcomics%2Fdc-removes-zack-snyder-cut-of-batman-going-down-on-catwoman%2F">DC apparently did not care for it</a>. While we like Snyder's version very much, here are some other NSFW images we like almost as much (eye headphones in): From artist <a href="https://twitter.com/Mrs_Van_Damn/status/1406701910644625408">@Mrs_Van_Damn</a>; commentary from <a href="https://twitter.com/realAgdtwinkie/status/1405428794568044558">@realAgdtwinkie</a>; from artist (with excellent commentary) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArtKhobra/status/1406120646342553600">@ArtKhobra</a>; and this one, from artist <a href="https://twitter.com/rpace/status/1486066384090058756">@rpace</a>, with special love for the pegging crew.</p>]]></description><itunes:author>Fated Mates</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>S04.39: Superhero Romance with Barry Lyga</itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary>This week, we’re talking Superheroes! Why is it so rare to see a great romance in a superhero story? Is there really no room for love and capes? Do heroes eat? (spoiler: obviously) — We’re joined by author Barry Lyga,  a comics and superhero expert, to discuss all this and more…and to chat about the new YA Superhero anthology, Generation Wonder, in which Sarah has a short story (it’s a romance). We also recommend some great superhero romances and comics, because of course we do.

It was an absolute pleasure to have Nora Roberts personally explain things to us; we’re beyond grateful to her for making time for Fated Mates. </itunes:summary><itunes:explicit>yes</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>01:41:30</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/1649175401359-8JKMYJLQP7A2GPNEL4FK/RED+trailblazers.jpg?format=1500w"/><itunes:season>4</itunes:season><itunes:episode>33</itunes:episode><itunes:title>S04.29: Nora Roberts: a Trailblazer Episode</itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/624d0baac4031830d32f677b/1649216456584/fated-mates-nora-roberts-trailblazer.mp3" length="102870641" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/624d0baac4031830d32f677b/1649216456584/fated-mates-nora-roberts-trailblazer.mp3" length="102870641" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">S04.29: Nora Roberts: a Trailblazer Episode</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>S04.28: Boss/Assistant Romance Interstitial</title><category>interstitial</category><category>full-length episode</category><category>romance recommendations</category><category>S04</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Prokop</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 13:06:37 +0000</pubDate><link>https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2022/3/28/s0428-boss-assistant-romances-interstitial</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644:5bcf6773419202388fdccb10:6242324a80860631cf4b6555</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We’re on a roll delivering interstitials about all our very favorite wild tropes, and this week we’re tackling boss/assistant romances!

In it, we will answer questions like: What the heck is IAD? Who the heck is Rune? Why on earth are the two of you always talking about MacRieve brain? and Is a hero bringing a heroine a bag of her enemies’ heads really a good grand gesture? 

If you already know all these answers, have a listen to the new intro, and enjoy a fun trip down memory lane.</itunes:summary><itunes:explicit>yes</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>00:54:10 </itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/1643161286381-1L99PEYZXROZNGZWCL72/PINK+read+along.jpg?format=1500w"/><itunes:season>4</itunes:season><itunes:episode>21</itunes:episode><itunes:title>Bonus: Rerelease of A Wolf Without a Foot</itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>trailer</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/61f0c7412412507148edc201/1643169629448/fated-mates-wolf-without-a-rerun.mp3" length="52394200" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/61f0c7412412507148edc201/1643169629448/fated-mates-wolf-without-a-rerun.mp3" length="52394200" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">Bonus: Rerelease of A Wolf Without a Foot</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>S04.20: The "Break In Case of Emergency" Romance Interstitial</title><category>interstitial</category><category>S04</category><category>full-length episode</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Prokop</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2022/1/17/s0420-the-break-in-case-of-emergency-romance-interstitial</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644:5bcf6773419202388fdccb10:61e5c445e9e2d81d12e80a19</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thanks to romance reading sisters Cait &amp; Kara for their donation to the Romance for Haiti auction last year, and for this fabulous episode idea!

We’re talking about the whole season (except for that one episode we’re going to pretend doesn’t exist). Spoilers abound, so if you haven’t watched, do that first!

He talks about writing gay romance and about the way reading about love and happiness change readers lives. He also shares rich, wonderful stories about his vibrant life as a picture editor in publishing, about the literary set in New York City in the 70s and 80s, about writing during the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, about the times in a writer’s life when the words don’t come easily, and about the times when they can’t be stopped. 

We are honored and so grateful that Vincent took the time to speak with us, and we hope you enjoy this conversation as much as we did. </itunes:summary><itunes:explicit>yes</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>01:29:12</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/1636816912190-J6NF83CXSO5P2XRL9PQU/RED+trailblazers.jpg?format=1500w"/><itunes:season>4</itunes:season><itunes:episode>11</itunes:episode><itunes:title>S04.11: Vincent Virga: a Trailblazer Episode</itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/61972fa0bcaff666d86fc042/1637298245006/vincentvirga-final-revL-a.mp3" length="89417409" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/61972fa0bcaff666d86fc042/1637298245006/vincentvirga-final-revL-a.mp3" length="89417409" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">S04.11: Vincent Virga: a Trailblazer Episode</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>S04.10: Beverly Jenkins: a Trailblazer Episode</title><category>full-length episode</category><category>trailblazers</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Prokop</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2021/11/13/s0410-beverly-jenkins-a-trailblazer-episode</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644:5bcf6773419202388fdccb10:618fd7a0aff35733eb8d73c0</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This week, we’re continuing our Trailblazer episodes with Beverly Jenkins—the first Black author of historical romance featuring Black main characters.

Added bonus, we’re joined by Jen’s brother Erik to talk sports stories (and check in on Jürgen Klopp).

This person does all the work and learns how to navigate a life around the aggressor and their world. These are not stories of love redeeming, but rather of learning to find love and happiness with the person (people) in front of you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The characters are suffering from current or past psychological or physical trauma. The non-aggressor represents the last bits of humanity that the aggressor has to hold on to. Dark romance explores a relationship where only one person has strains of humanity and the impact it has on a person without it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The evil and violence of the aggressor must take place on the page.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Some Terms we'll use on this episode</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/women-who-stray/202102/consensual-non-consent-exploring-challenging-boundaries"><strong>Consensual non-consent (non-con)</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;is when romantic partners engage “in behaviors that may include role-playing nonconsensual behaviors, or may involve negotiating sexual behaviors where one partner agrees to give up consent during certain behaviors or relationships.” This can include&nbsp;<a href="https://inews.co.uk/opinion/why-some-women-fantasise-about-forceful-sex-and-why-thats-nothing-to-be-ashamed-of-212098">fantasizing about rape</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playboy.com/read/how-should-we-think-about-sex-fantasies-in-the-era-of-metoo">and kidnapping,&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://thepointmag.com/criticism/rape-fantasies/">lots of women have complicated feelings</a>&nbsp;about these fantasies.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.skyewarren.com/2012/03/29/what-is-dubious-consent/"><strong>Dubious consent (dub-con):</strong></a>&nbsp;is the gray area between full, enthusiastic consent and rape.

Sarah’s friend&nbsp;<a href="https://www.micolostow.com">Micol Ostow</a>, who writes YA horror recommended this essay about&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.philipbrophy.com/projects/bodyhorrible/essay.html">the "spectacle of the ruined body."</a>&nbsp;Meanwhile, Jen follows&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/RAforAll">Becky Spratford</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://raforallhorror.blogspot.com/p/summer-scares.html">a librarian and horror expert</a>, who says that one thing romance and horror have in common is they are both “genres of emotion.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There’s some&nbsp;<a href="http://bear.warrington.ufl.edu/brenner/mar7588/Papers/leavitt-Psychological%20Science-2011.pdf">research on horror and spoilers from Jonathan Leavitt &amp; Nicholas Christenfeld</a>&nbsp;which indicates that spoilers might allow people to enjoy a story more fully.

We speculated that there are two reasons for the length of many of these books: 1) The books are long because the trauma on page must have an equal or greater redemption arc. Readers must believe that the non-agressor has fully accepted the bad deeds of the aggressor in order to believe the HEA. 2) Many of these books are on KU, which means authors are getting paid by the page. Like Charles Dickens, the incentive is to write longer to increase their pay.</p>]]></description><itunes:author>Fated Mates</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Jen and Sarah venture into the darkness, but not without reinforcements. </itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary>We promised you an episode on Dark Romance and truthfully we’re pretty proud of how well we’ve delivered.

We are endlessly grateful for their guidance through this end of the romance pool! 

We talk about what makes a romance “dark,” about how dark romance differs from morality chain and taboo romance, and about why dark romance resonates with so many readers.

Show Notes

Sarah has a book coming on August 24th! Preorder Bombshell now. You won't regret it.


Everyone is struggling with getting dressed again. 


It’s a 1001 in the 1001 Dark Nights series as an homage and allusion to Scheherazade, the story-teller of the Arabian Nights. 


We also love the VIP series by Kristen Callihan, and the 4th book in that series, Exposed, comes out next month, July 2021.


On our upcoming episode with Susan Elizabeth Phillips, where she told us that back in the day, “rock stars, actors, and athletes” were not allowed in the early days of romance. We aren’t sure why, but we speculate that it was fear of putting “sex, drugs, and rock and roll” and other high roller lifestyles on page. 


If you want to join the OSRBC group (Old School Romance Book Club) on Facebook, make sure to answer the three questions if you want to be admitted.


Beverly Jenkins liked the Stage Dive series, too.


Andi Arndt is the narrator of all Kylie’s books, including the entire Stage Dive series, and Jen thinks she is terrific. 


The Captains’ Vegas Vows has a similar set up to Lick: waking up married in Vegas, and only one of them remembered what happened. 


“Retcon” is a word that started out as shorthand for retroactive continuity, and here’s a piece from Merriam-Webster explaining its remarkable elasticity.


Hyperemesis gravidarum is the medical term for severe morning sickness, which affects about one percent of pregnant people. 


DC comics claims that Batman doesn’t go down, but the internet and everyone else on twitter and even Zach Snyder disagred. But in all seriousness, maybe it's just another interesting data point about America turning back towards the Hays Code and continuing to remove sex from all kinds of media.

Thelma and Louise does have a great ending, you can’t argue with that. And since 2021 is the 30th anniversary of the film’s release, there are lots of interesting retrospectives on the movie.
 

Desmond Morris is an English zoologist who outlined the 12 stages of intimacy -- hey, humans are animals, too! 


Our July interviews will be with Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Nicola Yoon, and Nikki Sloane. Our July read-along is Unmasked by the Marquess by Cat Sebastian.</itunes:summary><itunes:explicit>yes</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>01:21:04</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/1624147394035-9TG6PZL2JD2E10QBZKZL/fm_logo_3000.jpg?format=1500w"/><itunes:season>3</itunes:season><itunes:episode>51</itunes:episode><itunes:title>S03.44: The Stage Dive Series by Kylie Scott: #HeroesWhoEat</itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/60d29d20d8141f47c5c038a0/1624415617255/fated-mates-lead-final-revA.mp3" length="81265768" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/60d29d20d8141f47c5c038a0/1624415617255/fated-mates-lead-final-revA.mp3" length="81265768" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">S03.44: The Stage Dive Series by Kylie Scott: #HeroesWhoEat</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>S03.43: Writers in Romance Interstitial with Tia Williams</title><category>full-length episode</category><category>guest host</category><category>interstitial</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Prokop</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2021/6/13/s0343-writers-in-romance-interstitial-with-tia-williams</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644:5bcf6773419202388fdccb10:60c6120eb649cd1c43eae060</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>We’re welcoming Tia Williams, author of the wonderful <em>Seven Days in June,</em> to talk about her delicious book, about writing writers, about romances set in New York City, about her youth as a romance reader, and about Drew Barrymore as inspiration, and about <em>The Joan Wilder?!</em>. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our next read along is Kylie Scott’s <em>Lead</em>, one of our longtime favorites.

Your eyes do not deceive you! We’re actually talking about spy romances this week and no Sarahs were harmed during the discussion, but that’s probably because it was a discussion with one of her favorite people, the fantastic Nana Malone! </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We talk about Nana’s immense career, about how she took matters into her own hands and started making the covers she wished to see in the world, about her Brown Nipple reading challenge, about her latest book, a Kobo original, <em>The Spy in 3B, </em>and about porny ferris wheels. Real ordinary stuff. We also get to the bottom of why Sarah doesn’t like spy romances generally, but why she can’t get enough of <em>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith </em>retellings.  </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our next read along in some number of weeks (three? four?) is Kylie Scott’s <em>Lead</em>, one of our longtime favorites.

She is an amazing author and recently&nbsp;<a href="https://frolic.media/why-i-put-myself-on-my-book-covers-by-nana-malone/">became her own cover model</a>&nbsp;after failing to find good stock photos for her books.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you don’t know&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stockphotosecrets.com/questions-answers/how-do-stock-photos-work-beginners-guide.html">how stock photography works</a>, here’s a brief primer on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/stock-photos-for-book-covers">how they can be used to make book covers and teasers</a>. The problems with&nbsp;<a href="https://zora.medium.com/why-i-never-use-stock-photos-of-white-people-e069868160ba">finding stock photography that is truly diverse is a well-known problem.</a>&nbsp;For most authors, custom photography is cost-prohibitive. Nana’s favorite photographer is<a href="http://wanderaguiar.com/">&nbsp;Wander Aguiar</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you want to hear more about romance covers and their history, Sarah was interviewed on&nbsp;<a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-clinch/">an episode of the 99% Invisible podcast</a>&nbsp;about covers this week.

Your eyes do not deceive you! We’re actually talking about spy romances this week and no Sarahs were harmed during the discussion, but that’s probably because it was a discussion with one of her favorite people, the fantastic Nana Malone! 

We talk about Nana’s immense career, about how she took matters into her own hands and started making the covers she wished to see in the world, about her Brown Nipple reading challenge, about her latest book, a Kobo original, The Spy in 3B, and about porny ferris wheels. Real ordinary stuff. We also get to the bottom of why Sarah doesn’t like spy romances generally, but why she can’t get enough of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith retellings.  </itunes:summary><itunes:explicit>yes</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>01:31:08</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/1622462061081-0L44L8O7E4C1TVC0AAKF/interstitial_logo_3000.jpg?format=1500w"/><itunes:season>3</itunes:season><itunes:episode>47</itunes:episode><itunes:title>S03.41: Spy Romance Interstitial with Nana Malone</itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/60b6f32bc8bda5106a778603/1622602600220/fated-mates-nana-malone-final.mp3" length="94842396" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/60b6f32bc8bda5106a778603/1622602600220/fated-mates-nana-malone-final.mp3" length="94842396" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">S03.41: Spy Romance Interstitial with Nana Malone</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>S03.40: Tangled Lies by Anne Stuart - Who Flies in White Linen?!</title><category>full-length episode</category><category>S03 - BOOB</category><category>read along</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Prokop</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2021/5/25/s0340-tangled-lies-by-anne-stuart</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644:5bcf6773419202388fdccb10:60acf42ee52348558593e3b7</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Continuing our conversation about Bright Bananas on the Romance Tree — this week we’re reading an extreme oldie, Anne Stuart’s Tangled Lies, famous for being a story about a heroine falling for her brother…except he’s not really her brother!

If you'd like to read a morality chain romance written by Katee, we recommend&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2QCeUAJ"><em>The Bastard's Bargain</em></a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/50259/song-it-was-a-lover-and-his-lass">“In springtime, the only pretty ring time”</a>&nbsp;is from Shakespeare’s&nbsp;<em>As You Like It</em>. It's also possible Sarah knows it from&nbsp;<em>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</em>. She would like you to believe that it's from the former, but we'll leave you to draw your own conclusions. Either way,&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/4m1EFMoRFvY">“If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it,”</a>&nbsp;is from Beyonce.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As it turns out,&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AvG3weBETcwAe-KPmOjFThgc3gPpIWft/view?usp=sharing">Chicago is a great town for beach volleyball.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s hard not to talk about morality chain &amp; dark romance together, but we think they are inverse tropes. The internet definition of&nbsp;<a href="https://allthetropes.fandom.com/wiki/Morality_Chain">Morality Chain</a>&nbsp;is “is a character who is the reason another character is Good.” Jen and Sarah’s current definition is that in morality chain romance, the Love Interest pulls a hero towards humanity and goodness, while in dark romance, the love interest is pulled down into the hero’s lawless world.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Some examples in pop culture are&nbsp;<a href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Spike">Spike from&nbsp;<em>Buffy</em></a>&nbsp;and maybe&nbsp;<a href="https://how-i-met-your-mother.fandom.com/wiki/Barney_Stinson">Barney in&nbsp;<em>How I Met Your Mother</em></a>r. Also, check out a movie called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on:_The_Professional"><em>The Professional</em></a>, where a child (played by Natalie Portman!) befriends the assassin next door. The Jason Statham one with a kid is called&nbsp;<em>Safe</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey">The Hero’s Journey</a>&nbsp;is very common character archetype in literature and&nbsp;<a href="https://venngage.com/blog/heros-journey/">pop culture</a>, but Sarah and Jen are both very taken with Gail Carriger’s description of the alternative archetype,&nbsp;<em>The Heroine’s Journey</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you want more about morality chain, so many of Kresley’s books from The Immortals After Dark series will work,&nbsp;<a href="https://fatedmates.net/the-books">so please listen to season one!</a>&nbsp;Our favorites are&nbsp;<a href="https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2018/11/28/4-something-we-said-dark-needs-at-nights-edge"><em>Dark Needs at Night’s Edge</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/4/8/11-lothaire"><em>Lothaire</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/6/27/16-sweet-ruin"><em>Sweet Ruin</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We were divided on whether the character has to be a danger to others in order to qualitfy as morality chain. In the Gamemaker series:&nbsp;<a href="https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/4/22/13-the-professional"><em>The Professional</em></a>&nbsp;is about an assassin who is a danger to others, while in&nbsp;<a href="https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/6/27/17-the-player"><em>The Player</em></a>&nbsp;he’s only a danger to himself.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://twitter.com/JenniferRNN/status/962804770116321280?s=20">Jen Porter wrote a long thread about what she thinks of as PEA</a>, or problematic ever after, romance.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mickey is "kind of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagin">Fagin</a>-y" as a character, but without the antisemitism.

This  is an imperfect shorthand, but at this point in our understanding of  sex and gender, it seems like the most respectful way to acknowledge  that there is a huge range of sexual identities that exist for people of  all genders. For example, if we call a book with two women “a lesbian  romance” it might not take into account that one character is bisexual,  which adds to bi-erasure. So if a romance is labeled M/F, we know there  is a man and a woman in a romantic relationship, but that leaves room  for the sexual identity of the characters to be fully explored in the  book. In romance with more than two people, the order of the letters  matters. A book that is MFM would mean that the two men do not have a  sexual relationship with each other, while FMM or MMF means that they  do. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is nothing taboo about <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/polyamorous#key-values">polyamory</a>. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Jen liked the progression of menage in Elle Kennedy’s Out of Uniform  series.

The observing one was <a href="https://amzn.to/3kGuip1">Heat of the Night</a>  (available in the Hot and Heavy anthology), where Ryan watches  Annabelle have sex with his roommate. But as the series progresses,  there is contact between the SEALs in <a href="https://amzn.to/35FIBFP">Feeling Hot</a> and a fully formed menage relationship in <a href="https://amzn.to/36Lupuj">Hotter Than Ever</a>. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://thesteamyreader.com/what-the-heck-happened-to-elloras-cave">Ellora’s Cave</a> and <a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/indie-author-news/samhain-closes-is-amazon-to-blame">Samhain</a> were two of the original (and now shuttered) indie publishers that specialized in erotic romance and/or taboo romance. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a27259689/toxic-masculinity-male-friendships-emotional-labor-men-rely-on-women/">That article in Harpers about how men don’t have friends</a>. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://ew.com/books/2018/08/07/laurell-k-hamiltons-anita-blake-25th-anniversary/">The Anita Blake series</a> went through a lot of changes, so just go with Katee’s method and start with #9, <a href="https://amzn.to/35FrkN5">Obsidian Butterfly</a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Katee will be back to talk about <a href="https://allthetropes.fandom.com/wiki/Morality_Chain">morality chain</a> in 2021. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Next week, we’ll be airing our Best of 2020 episode, and then the first week of December, we’ll be discussing <a href="https://amzn.to/35FqEaw">The Hating Game</a>. </p>]]></description><itunes:author>Fated Mates</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Katee Robert stops by</itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary>It’s getting colder out there, so we’re getting hot in here!

She liked it so much, that we tracked the lost limbs from the books in what is now an epic lost limb counter.</p><p class="">Also, if you missed Season One, it's our pure joy in your earholes. We recommend it.</p><p class=""><strong>Legs &amp; Feet</strong></p><p class="">Years earlier, Yvenne attempted to escape with her mother. In retaliation, her father and brother shatter her knee. It never heals properly and she will never run again.</p><p class="">At the end, Yvenne is trapped in her tower, and from that window she shoots her father Zhalen right through his knee and calf with her arrow, shattering his knee as hers had been.</p><p class=""><strong>Arms, Hands, and Fingers</strong></p><p class="">Immediately before the book begins, Yvenne used a bow and arrow to kill her brother Lazen. To punish her, her father cut off the first and second fingers of her right hand so she can never draw a bow again.</p><p class=""><strong>Head, Face, and Eyes</strong></p><p class="">Yvenne throws a dagger at her brother Bazir’s eye. Although her aim is perfect, the handle hits him in the eye rather than the blade. Later that night, Bazir and his men attack, and Maddek rips out Bazir’s tongue, stabs and kills Bazir with his own poisoned sword.</p><p class=""><strong>Torso</strong></p><p class="">When Zhalen realized that Yvenne sent a message to Maddek’s parents, he whipped her back and left numerous scars.</p><p class="">When Maddek kidnaps her from the wedding caravan, Yvenne stabs her brother Cezan in the back with her dagger.</p><p class="">When Zhalen’s men come for her and kill Banek, she rips the arrows from the fallen bodies around her in order to shoot back at her father’s men.</p><p class=""><strong>Total Body Destruction</strong></p><p class="">After Yvenne’s brother Aezil poisons Maddek, he is too weak to wield a weapon. He crawls to the edge of the cliff, drops his sword into the drepa (an evil bird dinosaur kind of thing) nest which causes them to attack and kill Aezil while Maddek and his wolf play dead.</p><p class="">Zhalen tricks Yvenne into drinking three doses of half-moon milk. She was not sure she was pregnant, so it forced her to have a heavy period or perhaps an abortion. She is overcome with grief.</p><p class="">After Yvenne shatters Zhalen’s kneecap with her arrow, Maddek rips out his tongue, shreds his cock and balls with his silver claws, and then tears out his heart. He then uses Zhalen’s own axe to cut off his head, which he then presents to Yvenne as a sign of his love and devotion.</p>]]></description><itunes:author>Fated Mates</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Sarah and Jen really like this book. </itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary>This week, we begin the Season 3 read alongs, and we announce the first wave of work of romance we want to honor -- joy. Romance is supposed to be fun, and sometimes, especially now, as 2020 rages around us, it can be difficult to remember that.

So, we begin talking about joy this week with a book that gave us both immense joy, Milla Vane's A Heart of Blood and Ashes. This one is a long one, y'all, so get ready. We're all over the place because we loved it so much, and it's a ride. Eric wants us to tell you that this is going to feel like an old-school IAD episode, so if you haven't read the book, good luck!

It’s here, we’re back, and we’re back on our bullsh*t because it’s 2020 and it’s all we have, honestly. 

Season One gave us a full lAD deep dive (if you’ve never read Kresley Cole’s Immortals After Dark, pandemic anxiety is a really good reason to start), and Season Two gave us The Books That Blooded Us -- the books that made us the romance readers we are.

Season Three will pick up where Season Two left off. This season, we'll tackle 15 (or so) books that did heavy lifting for the genre and for readers. Some of the books are transformative, some are juggernauts, and some are just truly excellent romance that shows how vast and magnificent the romance pool can get. All of them will show just how the genre works, and how it’s always changing the game. 

We’ve also got some great interstitials planned, including some fabulous, brilliant guests on deck…and when Munro is released, we’ll (obviously) be here for you!

So...where do we begin? We begin in two weeks with a text that no one can deny transformed romance and the way the world looked at it: Fifty Shades of Grey. We'll talk fan fiction, Christian Grey, 1st person POV, billionaires, the early 2010s, why the book mobilized so many readers, why it made so many others angry, and the work it did to set the genre spinning in multiple directions over the last decade. </itunes:summary><itunes:explicit>yes</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>00:49:40</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/1597761519975-WABSXBS222VOBXZATEOQ/fm_logo_3000.jpg?format=1500w"/><itunes:season>3</itunes:season><itunes:episode>1</itunes:episode><itunes:title>S03.1: Season Three: Back on our Bullsh*t</itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/5f3caddde527ad70e396ce78/1597812236614/fm-s3e1-final-128k.mp3" length="49667246" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/5f3caddde527ad70e396ce78/1597812236614/fm-s3e1-final-128k.mp3" length="49667246" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">S03.1: Season Three: Back on our Bullsh*t</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Representation of Trauma Survivors in Romance: Adriana Herrera and Jen Prokop</title><category>Bonus Episode</category><category>guest host</category><dc:creator>Sarah MacLean</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2020/8/12/representation-of-trauma-survivors-in-romance-adriana-herrera-and-jen-prokop</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644:5bcf6773419202388fdccb10:5f334b8247d6c96ddc4c0e29</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Surely the silverest lining of the Pandemic is how many fabulous conversations are happening all around us.

So if you just need "enemies to lovers" and you've already read <a href="https://amzn.to/2ts6Y9J">Her Best Worst Mistake,</a> or "friends to lovers" and you've already read <a href="https://amzn.to/2OHlsdx">Scoring Off the Field</a>, then you just need to google it.</p><p class=""><strong>- Question 2:</strong> Who are we fancasting? These beautiful people: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Henry Cavill, Tessa Thompson, and Tom Hardy. Also, listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/pkqqs0iEWTA">Henry Cavill</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/y5X3gLwvrRI">Tom Hardy</a> grunt is one of our favorite things.</p><p class=""><strong>- Question 3</strong>: Who do we want to have lunch or tea with? Kresley Cole, obviously! Sarah said Joanna Lindsey. Jen says Julie Garwood. We'd both love to meet Sandra Brown. Jen still can't believe the people she's met, and hopes she was <a href="https://youtu.be/lOgbxRJikiM">cool like Yolanda</a>.</p><p class=""><strong>- Question 4:</strong> Do we have recommendation for lesbian and f/f romance? Is it more difficult to find? Check out <a href="https://www.boldstrokesbooks.com/">Bold Strokes Books</a>. strands of f/f, and others have different roots. We will keep looking for some history of f/f romance and link to them if we find one. But in the meantime, <a href="https://loandbehold.substack.com/p/the-invisible-lesbian-in-young-adult">YA author, critic, and expert Malinda Lo wrote about "The Invisible Lesbian" in YA</a>, and it's right on point and worth your time. But we do have lots of great f/f romances that we love in the photo array below.</p><p class=""><strong>- Question 5: </strong>What about steampunk? Is that ever coming back? We don't know! But all we can do is recommend these ones we do know. Sorry!</p><p class=""><strong>- Question 6:</strong> What is like Harry Potter for grown-ups? <a href="https://amzn.to/31oGZg0">Burn For Me</a> by Illona Andrews (Jen also liked the Kate Daniels series). That's it. That's the answer.</p><p class=""><strong>- Question 7: </strong>Books with power outages? Read this Naima Simone series called Blackout Billionares.</p><p class=""><strong>- Question 8:</strong> How to get started with reviewing and NetGalley? You should look at lists that big reviewing clearinghouses make--<a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/2020-preview-romance-fiction-look-new-year/">Kirkus</a> (Jen writes that one!), Booklist, and <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/81915-spring-2020-announcements-romance-erotica.html">PW</a>. Just trying to look at some of these lists will give you a sense of what books will be coming out. <a href="https://www.tbqsbookpalace.com/p/2020-r.html">The Book Queen is keeping a list of 2020 new releaes</a>. But <a href="https://bookish.netgalley.com/exclusive-interviews/01/2020/netgalley-tips-publicist/">Estelle from Forever Romance wrote a great piece about how to get started with NetGalley</a>.</p><p class=""><strong>- Question 9:</strong> Looking for hardcore enemies to lovers with kids in the mix. Jen recommends Wait For It by Molly O'Keefe. Lord of Scoundrels is great for this, too!</p><p class=""><strong>- Quesiton 10: </strong>Books that made us literally laugh out loud. Jen recommends I Think I Might Love You by Christina C Jones. Sarah recommends It Takes Two by Jenny Holiday. Christina has a huge backlist, and Jenny's newest book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2RY9SwA">Mermaid Inn</a>, came out last week.</p><p class=""><strong>- Question 11:</strong> Looking for books with a heist plot and polyamory. Jen thinks Katrina Jackson has cornered the market on this request and we have all been blessed by it.</p><p class=""><strong>- Quesiton 12:</strong> A question if there are any romances with a Muslim hero and heroine with on-page sex. Jen couldn't think of any, but asked author Farah Heron. Farah also couldn't think of one, but we do recommend her book The Chai Factor.</p><p class=""><strong>- Quesiton 13:</strong> Jackie from Elyria Ohio (where Jen went to high school!) is looking for historical with a murder and a twist. We recommend Kelly Bowen and Sarah's book No Good Duke Goes Unpunished.</p><p class=""><strong>- Quesiton 14:</strong> Sarah is looking for books with virgin heroes--but hot!</p><p class=""><strong>- Question 15:</strong> A book with a grovel so unconvincing that the character has to do it again. Oh, we have suggestions but also you should check out <a href="https://www.jenreadsromance.com/post/rombklove-day-3-groveling">Jen's treatise on groveling</a>.</p><p class=""><strong>- Quesiton 16: </strong>What are some museums we love? Sarah talked about these in England: <a href="https://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/museum-london">The Museum of London</a>, <a href="https://foundlingmuseum.org.uk/">The Foundling Museum</a>, <a href="https://www.soane.org/">The Soane's Museum</a>, and <a href="https://www.bl.uk/">The British Library</a>. She also loves <a href="https://www.museumofsex.com/">the Museum of Sex</a> in New York, and the <a href="https://www.gardnermuseum.org/organization/theft#gref">Isabella Gardner Museum</a> in Boston. Jen doesn't research, but in Chicago, she recommends <a href="https://www.artic.edu/">The Art Institute</a> and the <a href="http://nationalmuseumofmexicanart.org/">National Museum of Mexican Art.</a> If you're ever in Cleveland, the <a href="https://www.rockhall.com/exhibits">Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame</a> is so cool, and in Houston, check out the most meditative place Jen has ever been, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/23/magazine/the-rothko-chapel.html">The Rothko Chapel.</a>(when this aired in Feb 2020, the chapel was temporarily closed for renovations! <a href="http://www.rothkochapel.org/">Please check the website</a>).</p>]]></description><itunes:author>Fated Mates</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Jen and Sarah revisit their holiday AMA questions</itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary>We promised we’d get to the rest of our Holiday AMA questions eventually, and Sarah’s on deadline, so this seemed like the perfect week to do it!

If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women. “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.”</p><p class=""><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/mary-wollstonecraft-britains-first-feminist/zkpk382">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> is all the evidence you need that feminists have been around for a long time.</p><p class="">Jen recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/2NtNYOZ">In the Dream House by Carmen Marie Machado</a>, which is about domestic abuse in a queer relationship.

Read <em>Born in Ice </em>at <a href="https://amzn.to/2Pw5gLI">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/born-in-ice-nora-roberts/1100316778#/">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>, <a href="https://books.apple.com/us/book/born-in-ice/id357914515?app=itunes&amp;at=1l3vpAR&amp;mt=11">Apple Books</a>, <a href="https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/born-in-ice-1">Kobo</a> or <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780515116755">your local indie</a>.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 1:</strong> Beth from Milwaukee asked, "I'm going to Iceland in December for my 10th wedding anniversary! I obviously need a book that has snow/cold and using body heat and -ahem- other activities for warmth. Bonus points if a volcano or other geological feature is a part of the story! Sub genre is not important, and yes I'm aware of the <a href="https://amzn.to/36BBA6K">Ice Planet Barbarians</a>."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations:</strong> From the deep recesses of Jen's brain, the only romance she can think of with a volcano, <a href="https://amzn.to/2sEk4zO">Eden Burning by Elizabeth Lowell</a>. And that's from the 80s, so fair warning that it's likely to have problematic elements. When it comes to snuggly, warm, only one bed romances, you just need to use the internet! But <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/one-bed-romance-close-quarters/">Jen did write a piece about Only One Bed for Kirkus</a>, which you should read. In the meantime, go watch <a href="https://youtu.be/cmQDIne3CLo">Joe versus the Volcano</a>, and then talking about Hawaii reminded Sarah of some bananas sounding book by Anne Stuart called <a href="https://amzn.to/2Pv2NSQ">Tangled Lies</a>. But a few snowy romances: <a href="https://amzn.to/2EswEoI">Beary Christmas Baby</a> by Sasha Devlin or <a href="https://amzn.to/2Epgxbr">How the Dukes Stole Christmas</a>.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 2:</strong> Emily from Washington D.C. want our opinion aobut "the BEST star crossed lovers trope (it always gets me so good)."</p><p class=""><strong>Our Recommendations: </strong>The reason Sarah thinks that star-crossed lovers have to end up unhappy is Romeo and Juliet, of course. But Jen thinks you should try <a href="https://amzn.to/36GYutm">Luck of the Draw by Kate Clayborn</a> and Sarah recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/2YUXEXa">Long Shot by Kennedy Ryan</a>, but comes with a whole suitcase of content warnings for domestic violence. In the interim, Jen read and recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/2sElMRK">Forbidden Promises by Synithia Williams</a>, the heroine falls in love with her sister's ex-husband! And of course, coming in the summer of 2020 comes <a href="https://amzn.to/2YWiaqx">Daring and the Duke</a> by Sarah, which will also work. But you have to wait!</p><p class=""><strong>Question 3:</strong> Megumi from San Antonio, TX is looking for "a contemporary of someone not Scottish going to Scotland and finding love. (Maybe England but mostly Scotland)"</p><p class=""><strong>Our Recommendations:</strong> Jen lost her mind and said <a href="https://amzn.to/2rLUYPN">Unfixable by Tessa Bailey</a>, but Willa is a heroine who goes to Ireland. She thinks it still counts. Sarah recommends a novella by Sophie Jordan called "In a Stranger's Bed" which was a Goldilocks retelling published in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Glamour-AL-Jackson/dp/1973722364">the Glamour anthology</a> but which is currently unavailable so come on Sophie, get it together and put your stories up because they are ON FIRE. A few others you can try: <a href="https://amzn.to/2S1uJ2d">A Duke by Default by Alyssa Cole</a>, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2PSiJO8">Under the Kilt series by Melissa Blue</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/35xheLA">Getting Hot with the Scot by Melonie Johnson</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/2rWN99R">Ten Days With the Highlander by Hayson Manning</a>. Also, we didn't know what Adriana Herrera had up her sleeve when we recorded, but <a href="https://amzn.to/36I0n9c">Mangos &amp; Misteltoe</a> is ADORABLE, and features to delicious Dominican heroines falling in love on a Scottish Baking Show. It's also a perfect holiday romance!</p><p class=""><strong>Question 4:</strong> Becca wants "a funny contemporary, a true romcom, minimal trauma."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations</strong>: Jen thinks it doesn't exist. Sarah recommends going old school to Jennifer Crusie or Susan Elizabeth Phillips. If it helps, you should know that later this season, we'll be talking about Bet Me and Nobody's Baby But Mine. After we recorded, Sarah realized she should have recommended Christina Lauren, who she adores, and who she believes is one of the few authors writing real RomCom. If you haven't read <a href="https://amzn.to/35wv4xZ">Josh &amp; Hazel's Guide to Not Dating</a>, it's a very funny, very romantic friends-to-lovers romance! "What happened to romantic comedy" is an existential question for our time.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 5:</strong> Laurel from NC wants a book that "Has marriage of convenience, preferably historical."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations:</strong> Sarah says Sherry Thomas better than everyone and recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/36MUqro">Ravishing the Heiress</a>. Jen thinks <a href="https://amzn.to/36IZsp2">The Duke Buys a Bride</a> by Sophie Jordan might work. Sarah points out that in order to qualify, the marriage has to happen pretty early in the story. The marriage has to be part of the plot the whole time. Once again, there are so many of these we had trouble thinking of them on the spot, but in hindsight, Sarah would like you not to miss Amalie Howard's <a href="https://amzn.to/2Epxpig">The Beast of Beswick</a> or Scarlet Peckham's <a href="https://amzn.to/35zfj9E">The Duke I Tempted</a>. Bonus story from Jen about a Sherry Thomas YA book about Mulan called The Magnolia Sword.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 6:</strong> Cara from Finland wants a book that "Has chosen families strongly included in the plot. Extra points if it's enemies-to-lovers with the heroine's family ready to kick the pining-but-unfortunately-dumbass hero's butt."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations:</strong> Whoa! That's a lot of asks all at once. Just reread IAD, Cara! This is the plot of Sarah's book <a href="https://amzn.to/36HHBPg">A Scot in the Dark,</a> so that's a good place to start. Lots of rock star romances have chosen family, try Kristen Callihan's series, and <a href="https://amzn.to/2M4mkHs">Managed</a> will be a book that blooded Jen later this season. It's not linked via heroines, but Elle Kennedy's <a href="https://amzn.to/2YXwsqQ">Hotter than Ever</a> is bonkers sexy, a MMF menage, and has lots of found Navy SEAL family. In historicals, there are lots of sisterhood/brotherhood books. Try the Wallflowers series by Lisa Kleypas, or Lorraine Heath's <a href="https://amzn.to/2S3PTNg">Scoundrels of St. James</a>!</p><p class=""><strong>Question 7:</strong> Krystal from New Jersey is looking for "Childhood friends to lovers - historical! Where the Male is titled and the woman is not!"</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations:</strong> There are so many that will work here. Sarah recommends Tessa Dare's first series, the Wanton Dairymaids (!!!) should work, try <a href="https://amzn.to/2YX9kJ2">Godess of the Hunt</a>. After recording, of course, a bunch of books came to mind! Try Kelly Bowen's <a href="https://amzn.to/2RZmhRf">You're the Earl That I Want</a>, Vanessa Riley's <a href="https://amzn.to/35rXxF7">The Butterfly Bride</a>, and Loretta Chase's <a href="https://amzn.to/2EqFYtb">Last Night's Scandal</a>.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 8:</strong> Rosalie from the Chicago suburbs wants books she "can recommend to my 15 year old son. Have thought about Sarina Bowen’s Ivy Years. Although LJ Shen “Sinner of Saints” series is high school, seems too dark/gritty and I think he would not be able to suspend reality for some of the story lines given he is the same age."</p><p class=""><strong>Our Recommendations: </strong>Sarah thinks the Sarina Bowen series you mentioned should work just fine. Adult romances that are adventure stories might work are the <a href="https://amzn.to/2r13ABv">Hidden Legacy series</a>by Ilona Andrews and <a href="https://amzn.to/2rVORZ8">Polaris Rising by Jessie Mihalik</a>. Some actual YA Romance that Jen likes are <a href="https://amzn.to/2rMye27">The Way You Make me Feel</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2S1eZwj">I Believe in a Thing Called Love</a>, which are both by Maurene Goo. One of Jen's favorite YA books of all time is called <a href="https://amzn.to/2r0z1Mi">The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks</a>. She also recommneds <a href="https://amzn.to/2M3eLB9">Not if I Save You First by Ally Carter</a>. Some sports romances we recommend are the WAGS series by Naima Simone, especially <a href="https://amzn.to/38KnLoh">Scoring Off the Field</a>. Finally, <a href="https://amzn.to/2PToQ4G">The Deal by Elle Kennedy</a> might be a good choice.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 9:</strong> Jemma from Texas is looking for "Found family. Also with lots of good food descriptions. Not necessarily a chef romance though (they stress me out because chefs stay up so late at night; ugh, who does that?)"</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations:</strong> This is such a perfect question for Sarah. She recommends the <a href="https://amzn.to/2EsZy84">Recipe for Love series by Louisa Edwards</a>. Another series by the same author is called the <a href="https://amzn.to/2YWfgC8">Rising Star Chefs</a>. <a href="https://amzn.to/2qXG6gy">The Opposite of You by Rachel Higginson</a> will work. Finally, <a href="https://amzn.to/38Sve51">American Dreamer by Adriana Herrera</a>, and a series by <a href="https://amzn.to/35seOxU">Sabrina Sol</a>. In hindsight, Sarah basically only recommended books with chefs in them. She's sorry. She has a problem.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 10:</strong> Sara from Albuquerque wants a "Bodyguard trope where the person being guarded does NOT spend the whole book trying to escape the bodyguard because he/she doesn't think there is any danger even though it's incredibly obvious to everyone else. Bonus if the bodyguard character is female."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations: </strong>Jen recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/35wQmvq">Sexy/Dangerous</a> (female bodyguard) by Beverly Jenkins, which is fabulous. Nana Malone has a few, one in her royals seris, and another is <a href="https://amzn.to/35wQmvq">Bodyguard to the Billionaire</a> (female bodyguard) -- also, <a href="https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/6/27/165-royals-interstitial">listen to Nana talk about Royal Romance on an interstitial last season!</a>. And! Try HelenKay Dimon's <a href="https://amzn.to/35wqAYh">Leave Me Breathless</a>(female bodyguard), Katee Robert's <a href="https://amzn.to/36LYaK0">Thalanian Dynasty series</a> (male bodyguard/MMF menage) and Anna Zabo's <a href="https://amzn.to/2M2Rm2M">Reverb</a> (trans male bodyguard).</p><p class=""><strong>Question 11:</strong> Molly from Washington has an AMA question about how to organize her Kindle books. She is also looking for a book that "Features a Grumpy/terse older brother’s friend (or older brother of friend) with smart mouth heroine, bonus points for SUPER HOT, some sort of road trip, or problem they have to solve much to their reluctance (trapped on a desert island?) basically Bowen and Mari 😂"</p><p class=""><strong>Our answer: </strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1080139561739661312">Jen wrote a long thread about how she organizes her Kindle</a>, which you should just read on Twitter. But it takes a lot of time, so clear a day to do it! For the grumpy road trip question, Sarah recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/2Py7GL4">Right by Jana Aston</a>. This is the second book in a series, the first one is called Wrong and you don't have to read them in order. Also, don't miss Tessa Bailey's <a href="https://amzn.to/34uCWPk">Staking His Claim</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2PT4QPy">Fix Her Up</a>! Maybe try Mister McHottie by Pippa Grant. And...have you listened to our <a href="https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/1/18/55-road-trip-interstitial">Road Trip interstitial</a>?</p><p class=""><strong>Question 12: </strong>Hero from Paris, France (not Texas!) wants to know what trope would be, and then some books that take you on a "yellow brick road of emotions."</p><p class=""><strong>Our Recommendations: </strong>We ended up talking about the last books that made us cry. The last book Sarah read that made her cry was <a href="https://amzn.to/36LaDNQ">Sinner by Sierra Simone</a>. For Jen, it was <a href="https://amzn.to/2PUcGbR">The Bride Test by Helen Hoang</a>. Jen also thinks Sarah's books are pretty emotional, so start off with her first, <a href="https://amzn.to/2PWb2pT">Nine Rules to Break When Romancing the Rake.</a> Finally, <a href="https://amzn.to/2to04BX">The Madness of Lord Ian MacKenzie by Jennifer Ashley</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/38NSMba">Escorted by Claire Kent</a>. Also, we're going to read Alexis Hall's <a href="https://amzn.to/2Pvz10b">For Real</a> as a book that blooded Sarah, so stay tuned for that!</p><p class=""><strong>Question 13: </strong>Chris from Seattle wants to know how we keep track of all these books! Also, a book that "starts with the main character in jail."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations:</strong> Jen recommends the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2YZ693F">Hard Time by Cara McKenna</a>. The entire Devil's Rock series by Sophie Jordan is fantastic, and the first one is actually called <a href="https://amzn.to/35rEniF">All Chained Up</a>, but you're going to want to read them all. Sarah recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/38SDr9l">My One and Only Duke by Grace Burrowes</a>, which starts with the hero in Newgate. Another historical with the hero in jail is <a href="https://amzn.to/34u6o7V">The Highwayman by Kerrigan Byrne</a>. <a href="https://amzn.to/2PYBNKz">Hold by Claire Kent</a> starts with both characters on a prison planet, and there is also an <a href="https://amzn.to/2PZdImI">entire series of prison planet books by Emmy Chandler</a>.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 14:</strong> Emily wants to know "How do you find time to read as much as you do? I’m a fast reader but can never seem to carve out enough time to read as much as I want." And also is looking for recommendations for books that are "deeply, utterly romantic and swoony and leaves you with a PROFOUND book hangover. Great, sexy banter is a plus!"</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations:</strong> Jen doesn't watch TV and Sarah starts a book every day. <a href="https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1150220499840098305">Don't be afraid to DNF!</a> Book wise, Jen knows a book is a real winner if she rereads it, and some of her favorites are <a href="https://amzn.to/2YWeTHE">Everything I Left Unsaid</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2Z8pRKx">The Truth About Him</a> by Molly O'Keefe (famously, this is the only duology/book with a cliffhanger that Jen has ever finished!), <a href="https://amzn.to/36GG6AI">Thirsty by Mia Hopkins</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/35wZ5xF">Never Sweeter by Charlotte Stein</a>, and she also rereads <a href="https://amzn.to/36Ksdl9">a lot of Kresley Cole</a>. Sarah recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/2PTDhpu">Three Little Mistakes by Nikki Sloane</a>.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 15: </strong>Rosa, Daughter of Mexican immigrants living in Oakland, CA wants to know "Is a historical romance where both main characters are people of color. Does this exist?"</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations: </strong>Some #OwnVoices historical authors you should check out are <a href="https://amzn.to/2EtPUC8">Beverly Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2RZYbFQ">Alyssa Cole</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14248946.Rebel_Carter">Rebel Carter</a>, <a href="https://vanessariley.com/">Vanessa Riley</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/2PUhlKS">Piper Huguley</a>. Lydia San Andres has several historicals with Latinx characters, start with <a href="https://amzn.to/2M5f1zs">A Summer for Scandal</a>. Also, check out <a href="https://amzn.to/38OxDh2">the Decades series, which are African-American historicals that focus on each decade of American history.</a> Each book has a different author, so you can check out lots of new writers. <a href="https://amzn.to/2M5fHF0">Jeannie Lin</a> writes luscious historicals set in China. Forthcoming in 2020, Diana Quincy is coming out with books that feature Middle Eastern characters.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 16: </strong>Rachel from Kansas asks for a book that "Features a heroine who had breast cancer. Your podcast has helped me through my recovery."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations:</strong> Jen recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/2PvPTE3">Hooked on You by Kate Meader</a> which has a heroine had a double mastectomy. She is in recovery and does have a cancer scare after finding a lump in her armpit, but it is not cancer. Sarah recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/2PXFlfY">a contemporary by Brenna Aubrey called At Any Moment</a>, and then <a href="https://amzn.to/2S1WzeX">When the Duke was Wicked,</a> which is a historical by Lorraine Heath which is based on extensive medical research that is accurate to the time period. Although it's not breast cancer, Sarah references a Nikki Sloane book where the hero is recovering from cancer in another question on today's episode, and that one was Three Little Mistakes.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 17:</strong> Katrin from London would "like a book where the hero has a smaller 🍆 (penis)."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendation: </strong>Jen has one that she could think of, which is <a href="https://amzn.to/36ID92I">A Matter of Disagreement by E.E. Ottoman</a>. But that is a difficult request! We are going to keep thinking about it.</p><p class=""><strong>Our last AMA</strong> was from Rosa, who also asked about historical romance with people of color, and she wants to know about the process of cover design.</p><p class=""><strong>Our answer:</strong> Sarah talked about the process and <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/reese-ryan/">Jen described what she learned in her conversation with Reese Ryan</a>. Sarah talked about how she does give some advice on colors and why the people in the art department needs visual information for making the best cover. For <a href="https://amzn.to/2S2YkIT">The Day of the Duchess</a>, Sarah sent a photo of Cate Blanchette as guidance. Inspired by this quesiton, Jen did contact Harlequin and is interviewing someone at Harlequin about their cover design process, and that will be published at Kirkus in January 2020.</p>]]></description><itunes:author>Fated Mates</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Listeners attempt to stump Jen and Sarah. </itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary>It’s the second half of our recommendation podcast!

Next week, just in time for your tryptophan induced coma, we’re talking Loretta Chase’s <em>Lord of Scoundrels</em>, which was on both Jen &amp; Sarah’s list, and is on the lions’ share of Best Romance Novels Ever lists. We’ll get into why. Read <em>Lord of Scoundrels</em> at <a href="https://amzn.to/2oQXq61">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/lord-of-scoundrels-loretta-chase/1100616009?ean=9780061753817">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>, <a href="https://books.apple.com/us/book/lord-of-scoundrels/id360602857?app=itunes&amp;at=1l3vpAR&amp;mt=11">Apple Books</a>, <a href="https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/lord-of-scoundrels">Kobo</a> or <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780380776160">your local indie</a>.</p><p class=""><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=""><strong>Question 1</strong>: Ennis from New York asked, "is like <a href="https://amzn.to/2OrcOi9">Lothaire</a> by Kresley Cole or <a href="https://amzn.to/2O4UHQh">Cold Cole Heart</a>by K Webster, where the hero is someone who would be a villain in any other book. A megalomaniac, horribly damaged, murderous, whatever- and a heroine who takes NONE of his shit and brings him to his knees."</p><p class=""><strong>Our Recommendations</strong>: The name of <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain">this trope is "morality chain"</a> which might help you on your search for books like this. <a href="https://ew.com/books/2019/10/24/sarah-maclean-bareknuckle-bastards-daring-and-the-duke-cover/">Sarah's Summer 2020 release Daring and the Duke</a> is perfect for this question, but since it's not out yet, try The Masterpiece Duet by Skye Warren. The first is <a href="https://amzn.to/2QInjR9">The King</a>.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 2:</strong> Lesley from Washington DC asked for books "with Jewish heroes and heroines, does not have to be holiday themed."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations: </strong>: Jen suggests <a href="https://amzn.to/2pB19oE">Knit One, Girl Two</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2OvKKtU">Cinnamon Blade</a> by Shira Glassman. In fact, <a href="http://heavingbosoms.libsyn.com/ep-91-cinnamon-blade-knife-in-shining-armor-by-shira-glassman-with-jenreadsromance">Jen was a special guest on the Heaving Bosoms podcast</a> taking about Cinnamon Blade. Sarah recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/2r2TNe3">Craving Flight</a> by Tamsen Parker and <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ox3Cci">Dalliances and Devotion</a> by Felicia Grossman. <a href="https://twitter.com/nystacey">Stacey Agdern</a> also writes about <a href="https://www.heyalma.com/were-obsessed-with-these-jewish-romance-novels/">Jewish representation in romance</a> and has written some novellas in the Rogue Anthologies. We also mentioned a <a href="https://twitter.com/HFeliciaG/status/1187765935257640961">great point</a> that inspired a <a href="https://twitter.com/HFeliciaG/status/1187810638384504832">great thread</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/HFeliciaG">Felicia Grossman</a> about Jewish characters in literature.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 3:</strong> Daniela from Winnipeg had this AMA question: If there was a battle royale between all the IAD heroes, who would win? Does the answer change if they can't use weapons?</p><p class=""><strong>Our Answer:</strong> The Wroth brothers would band togehter, Declan Chase has a real shot, and Lothaire wouldn't care. No matter who wins, Thronos goes down first. Jen mentioned someone who wrote about <a href="https://faceintheblue.wordpress.com/2012/08/22/in-a-mass-knife-fight-to-the-death-between-every-american-president-who-would-win-and-why/">what would happen if all the US Presidents were in a knife fight</a>. Enjoy.</p><p class="">FWIW, Daniela also asked a question we skipped because we couldn't think of anything: <em>A historical that has a silver fox duke and a spitfire heroine who exhausts the hell out of him</em>. IDEAS? Let us know on twitter.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 4:</strong> Kristen from DC! asked, "LGBTQ romance easily available in PRINT for my book club???? We do it through a local indie bookshop, and are having a hard time finding things other than Cat Sebastian/Olivia Waite from Avon."</p><p class=""><strong>Our Recommendations:</strong> Adriana Herrera's <a href="https://amzn.to/2QywELd">American Dreamer</a> series! <a href="https://amzn.to/37lAuxd">Red, White, and Royal Blue</a> by Casey McQuiston. We think <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vanessa-North/e/B008HIQXI0?qid=1574177757&amp;ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1&amp;sr=1-1">Vanessa North</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&amp;k=KJ%20charles&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss">KJ Charles</a> might be <a href="https://www.ingramspark.com/blog/print-on-demand-for-indie-publishers">print on demand</a>, which many indie bookstores won't carry. Dreamspinner is a mess right now, but many great authors are there, including LaQuette's latest, <a href="https://amzn.to/2CZKxKl">Under His Protection</a>, which Jen bought a copy of at <a href="http://lovessweetarrow.com/index.html">Love's Sweet Arrow</a>. Carina titles might be more easily available, so try <a href="https://amzn.to/2Kz68xa">Syncopation</a> and the rest of the <a href="https://amzn.to/35b4fyG">Twisted Wishes</a> series by Anna Zabo. Jen mentioned <a href="https://amzn.to/2QtZT1H">Being Hospitable by Meka James</a>, but it's just in E. But you should still read it for fun.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 5:</strong> Courtney from the <a href="http://www.bodicetipplers.com/">Bodice Tipplers Podcast</a> wants to know what books made us fall in love with the genre.</p><p class=""><strong>Our answer:</strong> Well, just listen to all of season 2 of Fated Mates! But Sarah mentioned <a href="https://amzn.to/2QywdjL">Nobody's Baby but Mine</a> by Susan Elizabeth Phillips. Jen mentioned a new book that has made her feel that way is <a href="https://amzn.to/35izqbv">The Bride Test</a> by Helen Hoang. Julie Garwood and Jude Deveraux were old-school authors we both loved back in the day.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 6</strong>: Ali in NYC had an AMA and a question: How is Eric Mortensen so good at podcast editing?</p><p class=""><strong>Our answer</strong>: Well, he just is and you should <a href="mailto:eric@ericmortensen.net">contact him</a> if you need podcast editing help.</p><p class="">Ali also wanted recommendations about historicals with witches/magic. Our recommendations: So many of these are old school, because this is not a very popular trope right now, so please proceed with caution. Sarah recommended <a href="https://amzn.to/37deog6">Bewitching by Jill Barnett</a> and Jen recommended a pair of books by Teresa Medeiros, <a href="https://amzn.to/343WFpl">Breath of Magic</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2rccxrh">Touch of Enchantment</a>. In fact, Jen reviewed <a href="https://www.tbqsbookpalace.com/2017/09/throwback-review-touch-of-enchantment.html">Touch of Enchantment for The Book Queen</a>. Post-recording, we thought of <a href="https://amzn.to/2Qz4D6b">Sex and the Psychic Witch</a> by Annette Blair, which is the first of a series where three sisters use their "magic powers for good and their good looks for seduction."</p><p class=""><strong>Question 7</strong>: Hannah from Texas asked for a romance that "has a Lucy Liu in "Set It Up" type heroine getting her actual HEA. I need ball-busting energy falling in love with a guy/gal/whoever that deserves her."</p><p class=""><strong>Our Recommendations:</strong> Sarah recommended <a href="https://amzn.to/2CZ74Xy">The Takeover Effect</a> by Nisha Sharma which has a corporate espionage plot. Jen was maybe thinking of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_It_Off_(film)">Set it Off</a> and recommeded Elle Kennedy's Out of Uniform series. Jen mentioned <a href="https://amzn.to/2CZ7b5q">Getting Hotter</a> by Elle Kennedy, but upon further reflection, also thinks The Heat is On (in an anthology called <a href="https://amzn.to/2KB2G58">Hot &amp; Heavy</a>) might work. But since Hannah was actually talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_It_Up">Set it Up</a>, which is about assistants and bosses, maybe try <a href="https://amzn.to/2OqTzoP">The Assistant</a> by Ramona Gray or check out this extensive <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/boss-employee-romance">goodreads list of boss/employee romance novels</a>.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 8: </strong>Jenica from New York asked for a book that has "Childhood friends to enemies to lovers, preferably contemporary."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations: </strong>: We don't say it here, but one strategy Sarah and Jen use all the time with more popular tropes is searching for a Goodreads list. If you can find a book with a title or two you like on it, you might like others! Jen recommended <a href="https://amzn.to/2OsMVhP">His Until Midnight</a> by Reese Ryan, and also noted that Sarah's book <a href="https://amzn.to/2XtABlw">A Rogue by Any Other Name</a> has this trope. Sarah recommended <a href="https://amzn.to/2XutsBt">Punk 57</a> by Penelope Douglas. And a trailing suggestion was trying <a href="https://amzn.to/2pBE70W">Christina Lauren</a>, who has written many great enemies to lovers books and maybe one also has childhood friends. We didn't mention it on the podcast, but if you like YA, Jen loved <a href="https://amzn.to/346ntW8">Not if I Save You First</a> by Allie Carter. That one would definitely work!</p><p class=""><strong>Question 9:</strong> Holly from Chapel Hill asked for a book that "Has all the mutual pining. Friends to lovers, enemies to lovers, doesn't matter. Give me every last drop of pining."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations</strong>: Sarah suggests <a href="https://amzn.to/37hzw4W">Waking Up with the Duke</a> by Lorraine Heath. Jen recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/35eAyNe">On Broken Wings</a> by Chanel Cleeton. After we realized that there is lots of pining in Lisa Kleypas, but we think Again the Magic might be best.</p><p class="">Holly had a follow up AMA, "What would your ideal book-centered vacation be?" Sarah said a beach, Jen has always wanted to stay at <a href="https://libraryhotel.com/">The Library Hotel</a>, and that led to a discussion of Nora Robert's <a href="https://innboonsboro.com/">Boonsboro Inn</a>, in Boonsboro, Maryland. But Jen also loves to read locally, which means reading books set in the places you are traveling.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 10:</strong> Kara asked for a recommendation that "Has some sort of adventure or quest but is also slow burn."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations: </strong>Slow burns aren't our speciality. Jen joked she likes a "fast, incendiary burn." Please check out the Hidden Legacy series by Ilona Andrews, and the second one where they finally do it is called <a href="https://amzn.to/35fW18p">White Hot</a>. The first one is called <a href="https://amzn.to/2QF4ON4">Burn For Me</a>, it's right in the title! If you like fantasy, try <a href="https://amzn.to/2D0e4nb">Bound to the Battle God</a> by Ruby Dixon. Sarah mentioned <a href="https://amzn.to/32ZSMAz">A Promise of Fire</a> by Amanda Bouchet. And <a href="https://amzn.to/2OwAWjk">Aurora Blazing</a> by Jessie Mihalik could count for this category and for pining!</p><p class=""><strong>Question 11</strong>: Chase from Germany wants "Has m/m with a happy ending and the trope enemies to lovers?"</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations</strong>: Sarah recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/332sLAH">Goalie Interference</a>, which has enemy hockey players. Annika Martin has a good series, the first is called <a href="https://amzn.to/35eOdE7">Enemies Like You</a>, and Jen also likes a series by Layla Rayne called <a href="https://amzn.to/2QA0UFy">Agents Irish and Whiskey</a>. <a href="https://amzn.to/2OlODl2">Cask Strength</a> also appeared in Jen's list of <a href="https://www.tbqsbookpalace.com/2019/06/who-did-it-better-on-pool-table.html">Who Did It Better on a Pool Table</a>. You're welcome.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 12</strong>: Caitlin from Wisconsin wants a book that "Has a plus size heroine, emphasis on fashion...vampires would also be nice."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations</strong>: We had to handle these two separately. For a curvy heroine with fasion, we recommended <a href="https://amzn.to/346FSC4">Take Me</a> by Bella Andre and <a href="https://amzn.to/2KB48Vt">The King of Bourbon Street</a> by Thea De Salle. For vampires, try <a href="https://amzn.to/2OtwnX5">Tall Dark and Hungry</a> by Lynsay Sands. It's about a vampire who writes vampire novels. The Sherrilyn Kenyon book Sarah was thinking about is called <a href="https://amzn.to/2CXC22a">Night Play</a>, but it's actually about a werewolf. Oh well.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 13:</strong> Jess asked, "Has an alpha submissive (I’ve tasked Sarah with this before and want more!)"</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations: </strong>Jen doesn't think this exists, but Sarah recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/2XwLO4N">The Duke I Tempted</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/32XzWKo">Giving It Up</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2CZOdvA">The Devil's Submission</a> and Sierra Simone's <a href="https://amzn.to/37m8U2N">New Camelot series</a>. If you can roll with Kristen Ashley's prose style, try <a href="https://amzn.to/2O25VVo">Deacon</a>. There is no pony play involved.</p><p class="">Jess had a follow up AMA: "I would love to hear more about audiobook production. How much say authors have. Do they get to check in during production to make sure jokes are being delivered properly, etc?" Sarah replied that the answer is ... authors don't have much say at all, except maybe a choice of narrators. Sarah loves her narrator, Justine Eyre.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 14</strong>: Lesley from San Francisco asked for a book that "Has a heroine over 50 who is single (not divorced or widowed)."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations:</strong> This was a hard one, and we are hoping that listeners will chime in with answers. We don't think any of these heroines are single--all widowed or divorced. But try <a href="https://amzn.to/334MnUC">Apples Are Red</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2CWKIpG">Driving in Neutral</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2CWDqSQ">Bound with Love,</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2OwpcgM">Mrs. Martin's Incomparable Adventure</a>. But, you can check out this <a href="https:///groupwww.facebook.coms/958318970951705/">facebook group for seasoned romance</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tarheelmom1">Donna</a>posts a weekly Frolic column of seasoned romances. Finally, Sarah recommended London Hale's <a href="https://amzn.to/330SlWH">Talk Dirty To Me.</a></p><p class=""><strong>Question 15:</strong> Carly from Atlanta is looking for “there’s only one bed,” historical edition (bonus points if they don’t have sex that time, but do later).</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations:</strong> There are so many of these that we had a hard time answering. Yikes! But <a href="https://amzn.to/2XwyqxW">A Christmas Gone Perfectly Wrong</a> is amazing. Later in Season 2 of Fated Mates, we'll read <a href="https://amzn.to/2O1eCzm">Devil's Bride</a> by Stephanie Laurens, but the ohter one Sarah was thinking of was <a href="https://amzn.to/37m5aOH">The Capture of the Earl of Glencrae</a> Afterwards, we thought of <a href="https://amzn.to/2pxJXAf">The Duke Buys a Bride </a>and <a href="https://amzn.to/2s19Vx1">Tycoon</a>.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 16</strong>: Shannon in Atlanta said, "Ghosts. I need all the ghosts. I’m regrading Lynn Kurland’s Stardust of Yesterday to see if I am still madly in love with Kendrick like 14 yr old me was. But I need more ghosts. For spooky season and for always."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations:</strong> So obvioulsy the best IAD book is <a href="https://amzn.to/2qsf54A">Dark Needs at Night's Edge</a>. But <a href="https://amzn.to/2CZztNq">Halloween Boo</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2KC63ZD">Hot Ghost</a> might also be of interest. After recording, Jen thought of <a href="https://amzn.to/2XyXtAb">The Headmaster</a> by Tiffany Reisz and Sarah thought of <a href="https://amzn.to/2r7RBll">For the Earl's Pleasure</a> by Anne Mallory.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 17:</strong> Natali from Tampa asked for romances with "a sexy but serious body guard- saves heroine from her evil husband OR serious sexy body guard that is hired by father to care for wild heroine. And/Or sexy but consensual teacher-student relationship."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations: </strong>Sarah and Jen both liked <a href="https://amzn.to/2O6suZn">The Professor</a> by Charlotte Stein. Sarah also recommended <a href="https://amzn.to/343HpZF">The Unrequited</a> by Saffron Kent. Bodyguards for some reason we didn't have specifics, but check out <a href="https://amzn.to/2OyZEjo">Sexy/Dangerous</a> by Beverly Jenkins, which has a female bodyguard. <a href="https://amzn.to/2QG3pG2">Fallen </a>by Rebecca Zanetti will work. But also, Jen is convinced that something in Lexi Blake's <a href="https://amzn.to/345evIC">Masters and Mercenaries</a> series will work.</p><p class=""><strong>Question 18:</strong> Nisha wants books that are "bananas sexy."</p><p class=""><strong>Our recommendations: </strong><a href="https://amzn.to/34fs8F6">Ice Planet Barbarians</a> forever. But Brill Harper anything will work, and Jen especially recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/35jZyml">Altogether</a>. Everyone on twitter thinks <a href="https://amzn.to/37nUDT0">White Whiskey Bargain</a> is super hot, and <a href="https://amzn.to/35jfeGi">The Red</a> is amazingly sexy. Grace Goodwin's <a href="https://amzn.to/2Xw44LR">Interstellar Brides series</a> is also pretty hot.</p>]]></description><itunes:author>Fated Mates</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Jen and Sarah answer questions and make recommendations</itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary>It’s the first half of our recommendation podcast!

We’ll also talk about dating in 2019, recommend some books (obviously), and talk about Andie’s upcoming, Not the Girl You Marry, which is out November 12! </itunes:summary><itunes:explicit>yes</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>01:01:07</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/1571004447456-W00MGL5XBKT0GHDZ2GBB/interstitial_logo_3000.jpg?format=1500w"/><itunes:season>2</itunes:season><itunes:episode>6</itunes:episode><itunes:title>S02.6: Cinnamon Roll Romance Heroes with Andie Christopher - Interstitial </itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/5da67e60969104796c2c0e79/1571192533214/cinamonrolls-final-rev2.mp3" length="64281771" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/5da67e60969104796c2c0e79/1571192533214/cinamonrolls-final-rev2.mp3" length="64281771" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">S02.6: Cinnamon Roll Romance Heroes with Andie Christopher - Interstitial </media:title></media:content></item><item><title>S02.5: James Malory Gets Bangs: Gentle Rogue</title><category>full-length episode</category><category>S02 - TBTBU</category><dc:creator>Jennifer Prokop</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/10/7/s025-gentle-rogue</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644:5bcf6773419202388fdccb10:5d9b8d5fd96ae85fdb070d18</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Don’t forget to subscribe to the podcast in your favorite podcasting platform — and while you’re there, please leave us a like or a review!</p><p class="">In two weeks, we’re going back to paranormal with the first book in JR Ward’s Black Dagger Brotherhood series, <em>Dark Lover. </em>It’s a whole ride.

We promised you we'd be back with Season Two in September, and here we are in September, back with Season Two! 

We've said farewell to [Season One][1], but we'll never fully be able to quit IAD, so Season Two will be **The Books That Blooded Us** -- that is, the books that made us the romance readers we are...books that taught us what the genre could be, books that scratched our itch, books that made us lifelong romance readers, books that set us on the path directly to your earholes! 

Over the season, we'll tackle 10 (or so) books that blooded each of us -- we'll deep dive, discuss, and delight in each other's picks -- and we've got some fun ideas for how you all can share the books that blooded you! 

So...where do we begin? We begin in two weeks with the primordial text for both of us...the one...the only...*Dreaming of You*. We'll talk Derek Craven's cockney accent, Sara Fielding's legendary novel, Lisa Kleypas's immense skill with talismans, and we'll get to the very bottom of some of the most controversial bits of this glorious book that the two of us love a whole lot. </itunes:summary><itunes:explicit>yes</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>00:38:47</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/1568209291766-8TRTIIXUF4VRZC7QHYV4/fm_logo_1000.jpg?format=1500w"/><itunes:season>2</itunes:season><itunes:episode>1</itunes:episode><itunes:title>S02.1 Welcome to Season Two</itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/5d784cd09da84f77dcfb3db4/1568165154014/fated-mates-s02.1-final.mp3" length="39173820" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644/t/5d784cd09da84f77dcfb3db4/1568165154014/fated-mates-s02.1-final.mp3" length="39173820" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">S02.1 Welcome to Season Two</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Fated Wallflowers/Wicked Mates Crossover Episode! </title><category>Bonus Episode</category><category>romance recommendations</category><category>crossover episodes</category><dc:creator>Sarah MacLean</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2019 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/9/4/fated-wallflowerswicked-mates-crossover-episode</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5bc7409ec46f6d369ce5f644:5bcf6773419202388fdccb10:5d6f0137184182000156c774</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Be sure to subscribe to the podcast in your favorite podcasting app so you know the moment we return!</p><p class="">- Subscribe to these other amazing romance podcasts! </p><p class="">— <a href="https://wickedwallflowersclub.com">The Wicked Wallflowers</a> (with Jenny &amp; Sarah)</p><p class="">— <a href="https://heavingbosomspodcast.com">Heaving Bosoms</a> (with Melody &amp; Erin)</p><p class="">— <a href="https://learningthetropes.podbean.com">Learning the Tropes</a> (with Erin &amp; Clayton) </p><p class="">— <a href="https://www.jeffandwill.com/biggayfictionpodcast/">The Big Gay Fiction Podcast</a> (with Jeff &amp; Will)</p><p class="">- Listen to <a href="https://wickedwallflowersclub.com/2019/07/31/ep-92-sarah-maclean-brazen-and-the-beast/">the longer version</a> of the conversation with Sarah (MacLean) that Jenny (Nordbak) talks about in her discussion of <em>Brazen &amp; the Beast</em>.</p><p class="">- Sarah's hometown library (complete with dark corridors for romance novels) is the <a href="https://www.lincolnlibrary.com">Lincoln Public Library</a> in Lincoln, Rhode Island.</p>]]></description><itunes:author>Fated Mates</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Sarah and Jen team up with Jenny and Sarah from The Wicked Wallflowers podcast.</itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary>In July, at the Romance Writers of America annual conference, we had the extraordinarily good luck to record a crossover episode with Jenny Nordbak &amp; Sarah Hawley of The Wicked Wallflowers podcast!

We're joined by the brilliant Adriana Herrera to talk Wicked Deeds on a Winter's Night, starring Bowen (the werewolf trapped in a tunnel of fire) and Mariketa the Awaited (the witch who is going to run him ragged)!

Adriana, Jen &amp; Sarah cover everything from Snow White to trauma survivors, jungle warfare to May-December romances, sexism and Cardi B. And we still find time to fangirl over Kresley's heroines.

Don’t forget to subscribe to the podcast in your favorite podcasting platform — and while you’re there, please leave us a like or a review.

Our next read (in two weeks) will be Dark Needs at Night's Edge — complete with a broken hero tied to a bed (vampire, obvi) and a haunting heroine who just wants to be seen (literally). This one makes for a LOT of opinions among IAD fans...you won’t want to miss it.

Get ready for the read along at Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Apple Books or your local indie. Also, the Audible versions of IAD are on sale right now -- and WORTH EVERY PENNY!
