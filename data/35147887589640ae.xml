   <media:description>In November 1989, two bands from Manchester appeared together on Top of the Pops and it changed indie music forever. The Madchester sound was the unity of jangly guitars and thumping dance music: big, psychedelic, even funky and a perfect companion to taking Ecstasy. Artists like The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, A Guy Called Gerald, 808 State and The Charlatans would bridge this formerly insurmountable musical gap. 

It is the story of punk and disco colliding, how Manchester became for a brief moment the centre of the musical universe, and why Bez is one of the most important figures in British music. This is Before 1989: How Manchester Became Madchester.

   <media:description>For most of the 90s, Aphex Twin ran counter to what was happening in mainstream dance music. He was messing with low-key ambience during the forceful Eurodance of “Rhythm is a Dancer.” Moved to harsh industrial noise as Europe was smitten by the dreamy trance of Robert Miles’ “Children.” And when Prodigy and Chemical Brothers ruled the roost, Aphex Twin was attempting to rupture drum and bass with rapid stuttered software-programmed beats. 

The Aphex Twin story is similarly antagonistic, filled with fabrication, half-truths and provocation pried from the man himself. Did he own a tank, live in a bank and do a DJ set using solely sandpaper and a food mixer? Quite possibly, but picking through everything he’s said for the presence of truth is a foolish exercise. The legend is more fun than the bedroom-based music geek reality. This is New British Canon and this is the story of “Windowlicker.”

   <media:description>Despite its name, Power Pop as a genre has often failed to accrue the popularity necessary to set the charts ablaze. Fountains of Wayne’s brand of detail-rich storytelling and bittersweet character study twinned with a sugary 90s alt rock crunch did little to change that. 

They were the bizarro Weezer, loved by critics but underrated by the general music listening public. That was until they created the “second-catchiest song ever written about a girlfriend's parent.&quot; [Ben Greenman, The New Yorker, June 2003] By that point though, one of their songwriters had already racked up his fair share of fantasy pop gems for Hollywood. This is the Story of “Stacy’s Mom” and the Many Imaginary Hits of Adam Schlesinger.

   <media:description>If 2004 was the year of Franz Ferdinand for the NME crowd, then 2005 was all about Bloc Party. With razor sharp guitarwork, disco beats and Kele Okereke’s anguished yelp, they brought the indie set heartache you could dance to. 

In spite of studio issues, Gang of Four comparisons and feuds with Britpop elderstatesmen, with Silent Alarm Bloc Party unleashed one of the most exciting British debuts of the decade. A reaction to the reductive boring rock’n’roll surrounding them, they added life, vitality and whatever they could find into their jagged yet sensitive post-punk. This is New British Canon and this is the story of “Banquet.”

   <media:description>Björk never wanted the spotlight. Fame was never the goal, she just wanted to be able to defy the boundaries of pop on her own terms. Debut was where she would burst her way onto MTV and Radio, but with her 1995 album Post she became the innovative and unflinchingly adventurous musician we know today. 

Here she would paint from an unrivalled palette of sound: Jazz, Ambient, IDM, Trip Hop, Acid House, Techno and even showtunes. Peppered with dial-tone atmospherics, crushing beats and playful orchestration, it was musically promiscuous, bursting with the full spectrum of emotion, and like nothing the mainstream had encountered before. This is the story of Post: How Björk Reinvigorated Electronic Music.

   <media:description>Even amongst the ragamuffins and likely lads of the UK Punk scene, Ian Dury stood out. In his late 30s, with his left arm and leg withered from Polio, and in love with Stax, Motown and free jazz - But that is also what made him transcend. Aided by the funk-punk backing of the Blockheads, his acerbic Estuary wit was on full display on the band's only UK number one, an around the world jaunt that takes in Bingo Lingo, James Brown and the universal appeal of copulation. This is New British Canon and this is the story of “Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick.”

The Beatles broke up in 1970. Emerging two years later, Power Pop was an attempt to resurrect the Fab Four’s early days. What did it sound like? Impossibly catchy tunes with attitude, taking the contagious harmonies, jangly guitars and la la las of the British Invasion groups, and making them punchier, sometimes heavier. Pop music but powerful. Key bands like Raspberries, Big Star, The Flamin Groovies and Cheap Trick lamenting, yearning and crying about young love in a way that you couldn’t help but sing along to. 

The genre would hit its commercial peak at the end of the 70s. But what were the essential steps along the way, the key tracks and influencers? And how did it get to the point where “My Sharona” could become the biggest-selling US single of 1979. This is how Power Pop became Power Pop.

   <media:description>The mid-80s was make-or-break time for Kate Bush. Since her breakthrough in 1978, she’d been gradually alienating her fans with successive ambitious but non-commercial left turns. As such, her label EMI was seriously concerned for her future as a pop artist. 

However, that all changed in 1985. She returned after 18 months at her farmhouse recording studio with her weirdness intact and a song about Faustian-deals, body swapping and the power of love. And it saved her career. This is New British Canon and this is the story of “Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God).”

Mainstream Radio in 2001 was a weird time to listen in. There was loud abrasive anger: Linkin Park, Staind and Eminem. Hyperactive teenaged immaturity: blink-182, Sum 41 and American Hi-Fi. Plus Max Martin-produced pop bubblegum: Britney Spears and N*Sync. And Andrew WK contained shades of all of the above. 

Heavier than almost anything else in the mainstream, but sugary sweet like the purest pop, his debut single was a Vodka Redbull smashed into your ear canal, an punishingly uplifting tune released in the aftermath of the worst tragedy to befall the US in living memory. This is the story of “Party Hard” and How Andrew WK is not who you think he is.

   <media:description>In the 70s, there was metal - Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple. And then there was punk, Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Damned. Two separate entities that rarely if ever mixed. However a band both subcultures could agree on was Motörhead.

Led by the hoarse rumble of Lemmy, with their first three albums they cemented their place as one of the loudest bands Britain has ever produced. But the lead single from their fourth album proved they could be metal heavy, mangle it with a punk attitude and still be able to crossover to the pop charts. This is New British Canon and this is the story of &quot;Ace of Spades.&quot;

The British Indie Disco has a long tradition. Dating back to the days of Orange Juice and New Order, through The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays, it was Guitar Pop that moved you, that you could dance to. But after the death of Britpop there was little to groove to. You can sway and sob to Coldplay, you can do a hyperactive pogo to The Libertines but you can’t dance. In 2004 Franz Ferdinand reignited this shimmying fire by again colliding jangle and funk. And they did so with the best love as a battlefield metaphor this side of Pat Benatar. This is New British Canon and this is the story of “Take Me Out.”

   <media:description>For those that adored the Manic Street Preachers in the early 90s, no other band will ever compare. At first mixing political rhetoric and literary wit with populist glam punk, they kicked back against the impartial shoegaze, baggy and acid House scenes, and, for the first time since the Smiths, they felt like a British band that actually had something to say. 

Their masterwork 1994’s The Holy Bible, formed of dark metallic post-punk, tangled head on with the worst impulses of human-kind, masterminded by their driving force “guitarist,” Richey Edwards. But if one gazes too deeply into the abyss, there is a chance that person might get lost. This is New British Canon and this is the story of The Holy Bible. “4 stone 7 pounds”

   <media:description>Van Halen’s David Lee Roth once said: “Rock critics love Elvis Costello because rock critics look like Elvis Costello.” When he first appeared on Top of the Pops in September 1977, beyond Buddy Holly and Hank Marvin, there had been few rock stars with the nerd aesthetics of Elvis Costello. Though much too musically competent to be truly punk, he possessed a tongue bathed in acid and a remarkable ability to turn a phrase. But while this Angry Young Man persona made him a star, it would also destroy him. This is New British Canon and this is the story of “Radio Radio.”

   <media:description>Few genres have had the lasting impact of punk. 1976 is one of those seismic dividing lines in popular music. A history destroying year zero. The point after which everything changed. It was the year that The Ramones debut was released, the year that the first singles from the UK Punk scene were set loose upon an unprepared public. And while the punks wanted to remove themselves from the past, burn all that had come before, nothing happens within a vacuum. These bands didn't appear out of nowhere with the key principles of the genre locked in place. This innovative minimalist, three-chords and the truth, turbo-powered rebellious music had to have precedent. There were other artists that lead up to this era-defining moment in music that are either forgotten, ignored or not given credit. This is how Punk became punk.

By 1997 Britpop was winding down. But Brit Rock had a new wave of bands that preferred heaviness to cribbing from the Beatles. Amongst this lot were Feeder, framed as the plucky underdogs.  At first dubbed the “British Smashing Pumpkins”, Feeder hit the scene delivering grunge-affected heavy pop gems imbued with heart, charm and nostalgia for better days. Though they would score twenty Top 40 singles, their 2001 hit about a brand new car would be the one that remains glued in the national consciousness, in spite of their frontman’s enduring indifference to it. This is New British Canon, and this is the story of “Buck Rogers.”
