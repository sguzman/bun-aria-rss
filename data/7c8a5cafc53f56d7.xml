    <strong>abandon</strong> &#149; \uh-BAN-dun\&nbsp; &#149; <em>noun</em><br />
    <p><em>Abandon</em> means “a feeling or attitude of wild or complete freedom,” and is often used synonymously with <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enthusiasm"><em>enthusiasm</em></a> and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exuberance"><em>exuberance</em></a>. It also appears in the phrase <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/with%20reckless%20abandon"><em>with reckless abandon</em></a> to describe something done without fear or concern for consequences.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>catercorner</strong> &#149; \KAT-ee-kor-ner\&nbsp; &#149; <em>adverb or adjective</em><br />
    <p><em>Catercorner</em> is used as both an adverb and adjective to describe things that are situated in a diagonal or <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oblique#h1">oblique</a> position. The word is a less common variant of <em>kitty-corner</em>.</p>

<p>// The elaborate water fountain is <em>catercorner</em> to the building's entrance, so it's the first thing you see when you enter the foyer.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Did you know?</strong><br />
    <p><em>Catercorner</em> gets its first element from the Middle French noun <em>quatre</em>, meaning “four,” which English speakers modified to <em>cater</em> and applied to the four-dotted side of a die—a side important in several winning combinations in dice games. Perhaps because the four spots on a die can suggest an X, <em>cater</em> eventually came to be used dialectically with the meaning of “diagonal” or “diagonally”; <em>cater</em> was then combined with <em>corner</em> to form <em>catercorner</em>. Eventually the variants <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kitty-corner"><em>kitty-corner</em></a> and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catty-corner"><em>catty-corner</em></a>, which are now the more common forms, developed.

    <strong>Did you know?</strong><br />
    <p>In Oscar Wilde’s 1891 novel <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Picture-of-Dorian-Gray-novel-by-Wilde"><em>A Picture of Dorian Gray</em></a>, Dorian’s unscrupulous friend Lord Henry Wotton impresses upon the young Dorian what the process of aging will do, saying "Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed." Literature of the 19th century abounds with sallow people—Charles Dickens applied the word to characters in no fewer than 12 novels—but the word had been in use with the same meaning for centuries before that literary heyday. Its synonymous Old English forbear is <em>salu</em>, which shares an ancestor with an Old High German word meaning "murky" as well as with a Russian word meaning "yellowish gray."</p>

In Oscar Wilde’s 1891 novel [A Picture of Dorian Gray](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Picture-of-Dorian-Gray-novel-by-Wilde), Dorian’s unscrupulous friend Lord Henry Wotton impresses upon the young Dorian what the process of aging will do, saying "Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed." Literature of the 19th century abounds with sallow people—Charles Dickens applied the word to characters in no fewer than 12 novels—but the word had been in use with the same meaning for centuries before that literary heyday. Its synonymous Old English forbear is salu, which shares an ancestor with an Old High German word meaning "murky" as well as with a Russian word meaning "yellowish gray."  ]]></itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>words, word, word of the day, word a day, English, language, vocabulary, dictionary, Webster, Merriam, Merriam-Webster</itunes:keywords><merriam:shortdef><![CDATA[of a grayish greenish yellow color]]></merriam:shortdef></item><item><guid>8d1e3dd4-041a-446c-8851-8da0839c0a92</guid><title><![CDATA[lycanthropy]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/lycanthropy-2022-10-31]]></link><description><![CDATA[<font size="-1" face="arial, helvetica">

    <p>There’s quite literally no place like utopia. In 1516, English humanist Sir Thomas More published a book titled <em>Utopia</em>, which compared social and economic conditions in Europe with those of an ideal society on an imaginary island located off the coast of the Americas. More wanted to imply that the perfect conditions on his fictional island could never really exist, so he called it “Utopia,” a name he created by combining the Greek words <em>ou</em> (“not, no”) and <em>topos</em> (“place”). The earliest generic use of <em>utopia</em> was for an imaginary and indefinitely remote place. The current use of <em>utopia</em>, referring to an ideal place or society, was inspired by More’s description of Utopia’s perfection.</p>
