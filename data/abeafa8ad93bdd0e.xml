					<description><![CDATA[<p>PyData happened in San Francisco two weeks ago and I&#8217;m happy to say that I was fortunate enough to be one of the speakers at this fine event. It was three exciting days of meeting interesting people and listening to insightful tutorials and presentations. Big shout out to the organizers who put the conference together on a voluntary basis. Videos of all the talks can be found here. As already mentioned, I had the opportunity to represent Yelp, speaking about: &#8220;Large Scale CTR Prediction &#8211; Lessons Learned&#8221;. Here&#8217;s the video with a brief description of the covered content below: &#8220;Starting with a basic…</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Everybody who has taken a machine learning course probably knows the geometric intuition behind a support vector machine (SVM, great book): A SVM is a large margin classifier. In other words, it maximizes the geometric distance between the decision boundary and the classes of samples. Often you&#8217;ll find plots similar to this one: But what about logistic regression? What is the geometric intuition behind it and how does it compare to linear SVMs? Let&#8217;s find out. Geometric intuition behind logistic regression First, a quick reminder about the definition of the logistic function, given features: &#160; &#160; With that out of the way, let&#8217;s dive into the geometric aspects of…</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>A challenge which machine learning practitioners often face, is how to deal with skewed classes in classification problems. Such a tricky situation occurs when one class is over-represented in the data set. A common example for this issue is fraud detection: a very big part of the data set, usually 9x%, describes normal activities and only a small fraction of the data records should get classified as fraud. In such a case, if the model always predicts &#8220;normal&#8221;, then it is correct 9x% of the time. At first, the accuracy and therewith the quality of such a model might seem…</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Half a year ago, I was working in the heart of Silicon Valley and attended many meetups and networking parties &#8211; yes, I would call them parties rather than events. It became obvious to me that I wanted to try to get my own business started once I would get back to Munich a few months later. Hence, starting in May, I showed up at many networking events for entrepreneurs in Munich in order to get to know the local Startup crowd. Also, I began to work for the startup smarchive which has an amazing team and creates a fascinating product.…</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>In one of my previous posts about Nutch, I already mentioned plugins. The plugin system is central to how Nutch works and allows you to customize Nutch to your personal needs in a very flexible and maintainable way. Everybody who wants to use Nutch for other things than just playing around will be challenged to write an own plugin at one point or another. Indeed, there are many settings which can be changed within the files &#8216;nutch-default.xml&#8217; or rather &#8216;nutch-site.xml&#8217;. But simply imagine you would like to add a new field to the index by doing some custom analysis of…</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>This is going to be an ongoing article series about various aspects of Machine Learning. In the first post of the series I&#8217;m going to explain why I decided to learn and use R, and why it is probably the best statistical software for Machine Learning at this time. R vs. popular programming languages like Java Implementing Machine Learning algorithms is not an easy task because it requires a deep understanding of the inner workings of the algorithm. Furthermore, it can make a big difference how the function of a Machine Learning algorithm is implemented in detail because the application of advanced…</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As you might already have noticed by now, one of my big interests is IT, especially new developments and trends within that area. Just so happens, that in my spare time I like to do many kinds of sports and being physically active. So one of my sweet spots really is anything where sports and information technology connects. Sadly, at present only a few products are located at that intersection. However, there is one product that recently created a lot of buzz: Nike+ FuelBand. To get an idea what it is all about, take a look at this short and well…</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>After the installation of Nutch as described in my previous post, you can either follow this tutorial without the need of thinking, or get a sense of how Nutch actually works beforehand. I recommend doing both in parallel. And since you won&#8217;t find the latter on the Apache Nutch Website, let me help you out in this matter. The following illustration depicts the major parts as well as the workflow of a crawl: The injector takes all the URLs of the nutch.txt file and adds them to the crawldb. As a central part of Nutch, the crawldb maintains information on all known URLs…</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Nutch is a flexible and powerful open source tool for web crawling, developed by the Apache Software Foundation and its community. It builds on Apache Solr and comes with an integration of the highly popular Apache Hadoop, which actually started out as a subproject of Nutch. Nowadays Nutch is widely-used and probably the most popular tool in its niche. However, the software does not come with a graphical user interface, which makes it difficult for new users to get their feet wet. Hence, this post is geared towards facilitating the first steps by describing my experiences with the software. All…</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Next to my interest for Cloud Computing, I recently started to focus more and more on Machine Learning and became passionate about it. To me, it is a truly fascinating field of work! However, when I talk to friends, more often than not they don&#8217;t have a clear understanding of Machine Learning: yes, it is about making computers smart. But, other than that? For example: how does it work in general and what are some use cases? Even in the Silicon Valley, when I introduce myself as a Machine Learning Engineer, people sometimes ask me to explain it in more detail.…</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the hottest topics in Silicon Valley these days is &#8220;Big Data&#8221;. It feels like every meetup or event in the Bay Area is somehow connected to it and once an event is particularly about Big Data, sure enough it is vastly overcrowded. A couple of days ago I attended the SVForum Main Event &#8220;What&#8217;s Hot &#38; What&#8217;s Not for 2012&#8221; and it literally took 5 minutes until Big Data was the center of attention. But what are the reasons for the sudden hype? After all, companies like Walmart have stored tremendous amounts of data already years ago. The…</p>
