One of the most formidable queens in history, Njinga lived a tumultuous life and was able to defy Portuguese colonial rule for decades. For such a successful ruler, not much is known about her. Much of what is said about her in European and Western stories paints a picture of a cold-hearted, bloodthirsty warlord. But how much of that is true?

Widely known for making Prussia a military power while modernising and liberalising culture, Frederick was a complicated character, shaped by a tragic childhood ruled by his cruel father. We uncover why he wasn’t the greatest ally to neighbouring countries, and why forks enraged his father - and answer the crucial question of whether it's King of Prussia or King in Prussia.

From bold changes to her appearance as a teenager to ensure her place on her father's ship, to aggressive actions on a castle that refused to serve her food.
