   <media:description>This video visualizes the largest decrease in market value by tech companies from the start of 2022. It is a visual comparison of these losses using stacks of $100 dollar bills. These huge losses were expected after the meteoric rise of their market cap during the pandemic. This increase in value was unsustainable and only temporary because of pandemic. It included the largest companies such as Apple, Tesla, Amazon, etc.

   <media:description>This data visualization video is an updated version of the the top billionaires video from 2020. These are the richest people in the world and comes from Forbes' yearly billionaire list. Some of the individuals are somewhat controversial, as their wealth comes from the state, corruption or wage theft. 

I also included a line graph to show the performance over time. Lines stop when there's no more data on the particular individual.

   <media:description>Top Solar Energy Producing Countries, Per Person, 1990 - 2022
In this video I look at countries trying to move off fossil fuels by producing more solar energy. I used per capita (per person) because it shows us who is putting more of their resources into the transition to solar energy.

Solar energy has been used by humans since the beginning of time. The first use of solar energy was for cooking and heating. Here are some important dates in the history of solar energy production:

1883 - First solar cells made from selenium at 1% efficiency
1954 - First solar cells made from silicon at 6% efficiency, at $300/watt
1960 - Hoffman Electronics achieve 14% efficiency by 1960
1964 - Nimbus launched with solar panels able to power entire spacecraft.
1973 - University of Delaware  builds first building powered by solar roof tiles similar to Tesla solar tech
1979 - President Jimmy Carter had solar panels installed on the White House at $70/watt
1985 - University of South Wales achieves 20% generation efficiency
1999 - National Renewable Energy Laboratory achieves 33.3% efficiency
2016 - University of South Wales achieves 34.5% generation efficiency

   <media:description>In the last video a viewer suggested showing the cheapest Big Mac, which would be more interesting. I agree, so here it is! The countries with the cheapest Big Macs. This data comes from the Big Mac Index, recorded multiple times a year since 1986. Basically those with cheaper Big Macs offer a lower cost of living, which is great for retirees and digital nomads.

The Big Mac Index was created by The Economist in 1986 as a way to measure the purchasing power parity (PPP) between different currencies. The index is based on the theory of PPP, which states that in a free market, the exchange rate between two currencies should equal the ratio of the prices of a basket of goods in each country. The Big Mac Index uses the price of a Big Mac as its basket of goods, and compares the price of a Big Mac in different countries to see if their currencies are under- or over-valued.

The Big Mac Index has been criticized for its simplistic approach, and for not taking into account other factors such as inflation. However, it remains a popular way to measure PPP, and has been used by the IMF, World Bank, and other organizations.

   <media:description>Because of the current situation I decided to create a data visualization video on the state of nuclear weapons throughout the world. I not only show the numbers of nuclear weapons but also some of the devices and their destructive power. Some of these tests and devices include:

1945: It all started with the Trinity nuclear test in Alamogordo, New Mexico
1949: The Soviet Union conducts its first nuclear test, RDS-1
1952: The United States detonates the first hydrogen bomb, &quot;Ivy Mike&quot;
1953: The Soviet Union detonates their first hydrogen bomb, RDS-6
1954: Castle Bravo was a 15 megaton nuclear test by the US at Bikini Atoll
1961: Soviets detonate a 50 megaton bomb, Tsar Bomba
1962: The US conducts a nuclear weapons test in space, Starfish Prime
1970: French military detonates hydrogen bomb in Licorne

After the pandemic I expected the world to come together and work on all sorts of solutions to improve this planet, yet here we are on the brink of WW3.</media:description>

   <media:description>In this bar race I take a look at the most popular music formats by revenue share from 1972 to 2022. This data comes from the RIAA, so it only includes legally sold music and legal streaming. 

The popular formats from 1972 until today include:

Vinyl - This format has been around since the 1800s and is still pretty popular today thanks to hipsters and DJs.

8-Track - The 8-track format was originally developed for looping messages on Learjet planes. It featured great audio quality and 4 looping stereo audio tracks but its delicate system and larger size allowed cassette tapes to take the lead.

Cassette Tape - The cassette tape was developed before the 8-Track but did not take the lead until the sound quality became on-par with 8-Track. 

CD - CD's portability and audio quality dominated the format wars, but not it's price and the price of the new gear. As prices dropped it became the dominant format until MP3s and streaming became popular.

Digital Download - Although Napster was the first to start selling MP3s, they quickly flopped while the iTunes Store became the main legal provider of digital downloads.

Streaming Services - In 2002 Rhapsody started the first subscription based music streaming service. In 2011 it acquired Napster and used it as its brand name in 2016.</media:description>

   <media:description>Over the past decade China has seen incredible growth in all it's sectors but mainly in its tech sector. Tech has helped China achieve in one decade what took the US over 5 decades. In this chart we'll look at the revenues generated by the largest tech companies from both countries. 


As China surpasses the US in tech this trend will continue until China generates more revenue in tech than the US, probably within 10 years.</media:description>

   <media:description>In this bar race we'll take a look at gaming imports per 1000 people, which lets you compare the interest in gaming between countries. These imports includes console and computer games, arcade machines and all sorts of gaming consoles.


Note that some of the major gaming countries, such as China and Japan don't appear on this list since they mostly buy local games and consoles. 


I attribute the dip in imports around 2008 to the proliferation of the modern smartphone which seems to have had a huge impact on console and video game sales throughout the world.</media:description>

   <media:description>In this bar race we'll take a look at the top importing countries of consoles and video games from 1995 to today. This includes console and computer games and all sorts of gaming consoles. You will probably notice that the proliferation of the smartphone around 2010 had a huge impact on console and video game imports in countries outside the US. Allowances were now being saved for smartphones instead of consoles and video games. In the next video I will post this information per capita, which will show which countries are most addicted to video games.</media:description>

   <media:description>In this bar race we'll take a look at the TikTok accounts with most followers from its beginning in 2016 until today. By now it seems TikTok is not another Vine and is definitely here to stay. Many of these individuals have become overnight celebrities thanks to TikTok. This data comes from the TikTok website and The Internet Archive.


Do you have any favorites that you would recommend?</media:description>

   <media:description>When did you get you first computer? 


In this video I look at the countries with the highest penetration of home computers. In other words, the percentage of each country's population with a home computer. What surprised me the most was that the superpowers didn't even make it to the top 20. I projected the value for this year, since that data has not been collected. The rest of the data comes from Statista. 



I failed to find a new song similar to the one I've been using for the past 2 years, Epic Motivation. So I tried creating a new song in a similar style, this is the first draft called Epic Inspiration.</media:description>

   <media:description>Using the Wikipedia page with the top 100 streamed songs on Spotify and the Spotify API I was able to prepare this visualization. The line graph at the bottom is not as smooth as I liked but you will quickly understand the pattern.

Thank you for watching! 

Which have been your favorite songs this past decade?</media:description>

   <media:description>In this data visualization video I look at the most popular search engines based on average monthly users, the industry standard when comparing search engines and websites. It does not take into account page views nor unique visitors. Some of the data includes approximate numbers as the data available skipped years. The data comes from Wikipedia, Google Books, Alexa PR, and a few search engine trackers. 

I also include screenshots of certain search engines as they looked during that particular year.


The songs are all from MelodyLoops.com:
Battlefield by ArtIss 

Above the Ocean by Infraction
