    <description>Editors’ Notes: “I want to give everybody the tools to solve their own etiquette problems,” says Nick Leighton, cohost and producer of Were You Raised by Wolves?, a weekly podcast in which he and cohost Leah Bonnema look into the many sticky social situations we all face. “With each of the questions that we get, from the bonkers to the ordinary, I always try to take a step back and ask, ‘What are the bigger principles here?’ I'm always looking for topics that help us make a larger point.” In each episode, Leighton, a two-time Emmy Award-winning journalist, and Bonnema, a comic/writer, share practical advice on how to navigate a wide range of situations, from the serious to the whimsical—whether they tackle interrupting excessive talkers, establishing healthy boundaries with coworkers, or the proper way to eat Cheetos.

When they developed the show in 2019, Leighton and Bonnema had one goal in mind: to have empathy for other people. Their informal conversations tackle a mix of personal topics, viewer questions, and the occasional historical fact with warmth and positivity and humor. Leighton views this approach as an antidote to a lot of the negativity he sees in the online world, while Bonnema thinks the show’s premise is a natural fit for her situational style of comedy. “A lot of my comedy is about events where I’m like, ‘What just happened here?’ or where I embarrass myself,” she says. “And, ironically, all of these fall under the guise of etiquette, where you either feel aggrieved or you feel like you committed some sort of social crime. I just loved the topic.”

Leighton and Bonnema credit the show’s ongoing success to their work ethic. They haven’t missed a single week since they launched the show, which recently hit a new milestone: 100 episodes. But what they value the most, above all else, is how they've built a community of listeners from all backgrounds. “We have conservative grandmothers in Tallahassee to nonbinary chefs in Seattle and everybody in between,” he says. “Because who among us has not experienced an etiquette crime? This is universal.”

      <title>Sharing Combs at Gyms, Hijacking Hiking Plans, Starting Toilet Paper Rolls, and More</title>
      <link>https://wyrbw.com/145</link>
      <description>Etiquette, manners, and beyond! In this episode, Nick and Leah answer listener questions about sharing disposable combs at the gym, hijacking hiking plans, starting toilet paper rolls, and much more. Please follow us! (We'd send you a hand-written thank you note if we could.)
Have a question for us? Call or text (267) CALL-RBW or visit ask.wyrbw.com

QUESTIONS FROM THE WILDERNESS:

What do I do about someone at the gym putting used combs back into a communal jar?

What do I say when someone asks if I sent any money with a graduation congratulations card?

How can I tell a friend that I don't want to move a previously planned hike to accommodate their birthday?

After installing a new roll of toilet paper, should you remove the adhesive and start the roll, too?

Vent: People who flip their hair over the back of airplane seats.


THINGS MENTIONED DURING THE SHOW
Previous episode about orienting toilet paper rolls

A neighbor is upset I'm not always available to volunteer to babysit on short notice...what do I do?

At a buffet lunch, should sliced lemons for water be served with a spoon or a fork?

Should I say something to a family member who isn't washing their hands after using the bathroom?

Is it OK to cash a check before sending a thank you note?

Should I say something to a friend who has typos in her online advertisements?

QUESTIONS FROM THE WILDERNESS:

Is a glare ever within the bounds of etiquette?

How can I get guests to hang up their coats when they come over?

      <title>Gifting Pajamas, Expecting Cards With Money, Tipping at the Holidays, and More</title>
      <link>https://wyrbw.com/119</link>
      <description>Etiquette, manners, and beyond! In this episode, Nick and Leah answer listener questions about giving people pajamas, expecting cards to contain money, tipping people at the holidays, and much more. Please follow us! (We'd send you a hand-written thank you note if we could.)
Have a question for us? Call or text (267) CALL-RBW or visit ask.wyrbw.com

QUESTIONS FROM THE WILDERNESS:

Are pajamas an "intimate" gift that should only be given between spouses or between parents and children?

What can I do about my mother who bought me patio furniture that I don't want?

We were expecting a holiday card to contain money...should we tell the sender that it wasn't included in the envelope?

Should we tell our best friends that we're planning on getting them a gift this year?

What do I do about holiday tipping for a new cleaning person I only met for the first time today?

I'm a teacher and have received more than a hundred gifts...do I have to send a thank you note to everyone?

QUESTIONS FROM THE WILDERNESS:

Are pajamas an "intimate" gift that should only be given between spouses or between parents and children?

What can I do about my mother who bought me patio furniture that I don't want?

We were expecting a holiday card to contain money...should we tell the sender that it wasn't included in the envelope?

Should we tell our best friends that we're planning on getting them a gift this year?

What do I do about holiday tipping for a new cleaning person I only met for the first time today?

I'm a teacher and have received more than a hundred gifts...do I have to send a thank you note to everyone?

      <title>Gaslighting Bosses, Addressing Postcards, Trashing Swag, and More</title>
      <link>https://wyrbw.com/109</link>
      <description>Etiquette, manners, and beyond! In this episode, Nick and Leah answer listener questions about showing up for parties that aren't happening, addressing postcards to households, trashing promotional swag, and much more. Please follow us! (We'd send you a hand-written thank you note if we had your address.)
Have a question for us? Call or text (267) CALL-RBW or visit ask.wyrbw.com

QUESTIONS FROM THE WILDERNESS:

What do I do about my boss who invited me to a BBQ and then was surprised I showed up?

When sending postcards, do you have to address them to everyone in a household?

What is the polite way to decline beverages?

What do we do about unwanted promotional merchandise we were given?

How long before a Zoom meeting should I log in? And how long should I wait if someone doesn't show up?

Vent: Guests who call your apartment an "unacceptable standard of living."

      <title>Telling Cooks They're Terrible, Leaving Cash on Tables, Handling Wet Laundry, and More</title>
      <link>https://wyrbw.com/105</link>
      <description>Etiquette, manners, and beyond! In this episode, Nick and Leah answer listener questions about telling cooks they're terrible, leaving cash on tables in restaurants, handling strangers' wet laundry, and much more. Please follow us! (We'd send you a hand-written thank you note if we could.)
Have a question for us? Call or text (267) CALL-RBW or visit ask.wyrbw.com

QUESTIONS FROM THE WILDERNESS:

How do you tell a friend they’re a terrible cook and they shouldn't bother?

At a restaurant, is it OK to leave cash on the table and then leave?

What do I do about my family who jumps on FaceTime with other relatives whenever they're over at my house?

Is it OK to offer to meet someone “halfway” when I live outside of the city?

Should you put wet laundry that isn't yours in a dryer?

Aftermath: An awkward Zoom date turns into a marriage


THINGS MENTIONED DURING THE SHOW

"Aedh Wishes for the Clothes of Heaven" by W.B. Yeats

L'Effervescence Restaurant in Tokyo

Geocaching

Previous episode that included question about taking things out of the dryer

CORDIALS OF KINDNESS: Thanks to chauffeurs, Thanks for the pecans


THINGS MENTIONED DURING THE SHOW

QUESTIONS FROM THE WILDERNESS:

There have been two LaCroix sodas sitting in the work fridge for more than a year…can I take them?

Is it rude that my friend booked a vacation house for our trip without checking with me first?

Is it OK to drink wine at a dinner with members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints?

I’ve decided to skip a destination wedding in Europe I’m invited to…does this mean I should buy a more expensive gift than I normally would?

I invited some parents over to my house for a party, but other parents who weren’t invited are now upset. Was I wrong?

Vent: Squeezing into the same wedge in a revolving door


THINGS MENTIONED DURING THE SHOW

How to produce LaCroix soda

Lacroix on "Absolutely Fabulous"

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Satins: Style Guide

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints: The Word of Wisdom

Eisenhower's Farewell Address

Erin Jackson on being stuck in a revolving door with someone

      <title>Telling People to Smile, Judging People’s Homes, Keeping Quiet in Gazebos, and More</title>
      <link>https://wyrbw.com/99</link>
      <description>Etiquette, manners, and beyond! In this episode, Nick and Leah answer listener questions about telling people to smile, judging people's homes, keeping quiet in gazebos, and much more. Please follow us! (We'd send you a hand-written thank you note if we could.)
Have a question for us? Call or text (267) CALL-RBW or visit ask.wyrbw.com

QUESTIONS FROM THE WILDERNESS:

What should I say when I'm told to smile?

Should people respect my need for quiet in a public park?

After a divorce, how much responsibility does an ex have in maintaining ties with former in-laws?

I'm an architect...what can I say to friends who think I'm judging their home when I'm only a guest?

I'm housesitting...should I tell the owner the bed wasn't made when I arrived?

QUESTIONS FROM THE WILDERNESS:

What should I say when I'm told to smile?

Should people respect my need for quiet in a public park?

After a divorce, how much responsibility does an ex have in maintaining ties with former in-laws?

I'm an architect...what can I say to friends who think I'm judging their home when I'm only a guest?

I'm housesitting...should I tell the owner the bed wasn't made when I arrived?

Vent: Nurses putting patients in dirty cars

QUESTIONS FROM THE WILDERNESS:

What do I do about my neighbor who won't stop talking negatively about our new fence?

How can I ask if someone likes the Amazon Echo Dot I gave them as a gift?

How do you feel about saying "go!" when asking a question in a Facebook group?

How long should I wait before following up on an email if I don't get a response?

Was bringing a bottle of wine an acceptable gift when invited over for dinner by new neighbors? And do we have to return the favor?

Repent: Running out of hot water

QUESTIONS FROM THE WILDERNESS:

Is it rude to invite people to a party when you're not the host?

Is it rude to wear sequins during the day?

Is commenting on appearance still rude if you're intending to flirt?

What do I do about a coworker who says mean things and then says "just joking"?

How do I properly thank good samaritans who helped me get back into my car when I locked my keys inside?

Vent: People who don't make an effort to be helpful in their email responses

      <description>Etiquette, manners, and beyond! In this bonus episode, Nick and Leah answer listener questions about asking doctors to wash their hands before an exam, waiting for bosses who are never on time to meetings, telling therapists that they are yawning too much, and much more.

How can I tell my doctor to wash his hands before examining me?

How can I stop people who invite themselves to my goat farm?

What can I do about my yawning therapist?

How can I tell colleagues that I can't offer instant responses to every email?

Audience Repent: A late birthday card

In this bonus episode, Nick and Leah answer listener questions about sliding into people's DMs, dealing with a coworker's dirty dishes, following up on whether gifts were received, and much more. Please follow us! (We'd send you a hand-written thank you note if we could.)

QUESTIONS FROM THE WILDERNESS:

Is it rude to slide into someone's DMs?

Is it OK to ask about the cost of a "market price" or a daily special item at a restaurant?

Would it be rude to leave a coworker's dirty dishes on their desk if they don't wash them?

How can I make sure a gift I sent was actually received?

At the gate of my gated community, is it OK to drive ahead of guests waiting to be buzzed in?

Can you use a wedding gift card before the wedding?

Do you have to return missed calls when someone doesn't leave a message?

What do you do if you receive an unwanted dreamcatcher?
