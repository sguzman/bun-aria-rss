Vox film critic Alissa Wilkinson explains why you should spend time in Gawain’s world this weekend. The Green Knight is in select theaters starting July 30.

      <title>Expired food is a myth | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>It seems reasonable to assume that food packaging saying the contents are expired indicates inedible food. You can trust the labels on what you buy in the grocery store, can't you? Except America’s food label system isn’t standardized, and it has very little to do with food safety. In other words, you could be tossing eggs and milk and other goods that are perfectly fine to eat. Vox’s Alissa Wilkinson explains.

      <title>K-pop is everywhere but on the radio | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>K-pop is hugely popular worldwide, and boy band BTS’s “Dynamite” was virtually inescapable in 2020. And yet, the genre is hard to find on American radio. Despite K-pop’s takeoff online in the US and all over the globe, radio DJs still find most of it too risky to play for a Top 40 audience. Aja Romano, a culture writer at Vox, explains why.

      <title>The pros and cons of eating bugs | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>In many parts of the world, insects are a regular part of people’s diets. That’s not the case in the United States, but perhaps it should be. Vox senior correspondent Dylan Matthews explains why eating bugs may be a more environmentally friendly alternative to eating meat, as well as what insect farming might look like. He also lays out why some people still have reservations about insect diets (beyond the ick factor), since we don’t know whether insects feel significant pain.

And you can read more about sustainability and farming from the team at Future Perfect.

      <description>There’s been a lot of pressure to become a better person during the pandemic — to pick up a new hobby, read more books, or learn a new language. And as life gets back to something like normal for many Americans, that pressure is coming around again. Some employers are reportedly asking job applicants about the "passion project" they pursued over the past 18 months. Even in social circles, there’s a sense that you were supposed to have undertaken some form of self-improvement during the Covid-19 outbreak, instead of just surviving. Vox’s Anna North dives into why some people still feel they were expected to treat the pandemic as an opportunity for growth.

      <title>How big business exploits small business | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Nothing makes a corporation seem less evil than a shout-out to small business. Big companies love to talk about how much they support the little guys. But are they actually helping or harming and what can be done about their fraught relationship? Vox’s Emily Stewart explains how companies like Uber and Facebook and Amazon use the reputation of small business for their own benefit and what we as consumers can do to actually save their smaller competitors.

      <title>MAGA, but for coffee | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Right-wing coffee shops are popping up across the country, proving yet again that America can make pretty much anything political. One sells blends such as “The Don” and “Sleepy Joe Decaf.” Another offers concealed-carry permit classes. Many have Donald Trump-themed decor and products. Reporter Luke Winkie discusses the MAGA coffee trend and why Republicans are looking for a conservative-leaning version of Starbucks.

      <link>https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/11/10/21556650/best-money-covid-19-moving-home-kayak</link>
      <description>When Max Ufberg and his girlfriend left New York for Pennsylvania at the beginning of the pandemic, they assumed it would be a quick trip. But as weeks became months, they splurged on a kayak and began to spend their downtime ambling through the very landscapes Max had once been so eager to leave behind. And he started to realize just how wrong he was about the place.

      <title>The 51st state | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>The House of Representatives recently voted to make Washington, DC, the 51st state in the union, something many residents have wanted for a long time. Even though momentum is building, the bill probably isn’t going anywhere in the Senate unless Democrats get rid of or change the filibuster rules. Vox policy reporter Jerusalem Demsas (@jerusalemdemsas) discusses what DC not being a state means for the people who live there as well as politics and polling around the issue.

      <title>Questlove made the music documentary of the summer | What to Watch</title>
      <description>Summer of Soul revives the forgotten, groovy history of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, a pivotal moment in Black culture sometimes dubbed “Black Woodstock.” 
This massive concert series spanned multiple weekends and featured everyone from Sly and the Family Stone to Nina Simone to Stevie Wonder to Mahalia Jackson. But the footage of the festival sat in a basement for 50 years. Now it’s been compiled into a documentary by director Ahmir Thompson — better known as Questlove, the drummer and frontman for the Roots — and the result is absolutely infectious.
How to watch it: Summer of Soul is in theaters and streaming on Hulu.

      <title>No, Biden isn’t coming for your burger | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>A rumor has taken hold among some Republicans that President Joe Biden wants to curtail America’s meat consumption — a rumor that, to be clear, isn’t true. The White House has no plans to limit people to eating certain amounts of beef as part of its climate proposal. However, that doesn’t mean meat has a positive impact on the environment. Food-related emissions, including those resulting from meat production, are a major contributor to climate change. Vox senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp debunks claims of Biden’s burger crackdown — and discusses why we should be having a discussion about meat if we really want to save the planet.

Read Zack’s story about Biden’s fake burger ban here.

Season 3 of Future Perfect is about the meat industry. Listen to the trailer here.

      <title>Air travel sucks now | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Flying wasn’t a particularly enjoyable experience prior to the pandemic, and it certainly wasn’t during it. But now, the experience is even worse as the air travel industry struggles to adjust to the influx of passengers eager to get back to the friendly skies. Terry Nguyen, a reporter at The Goods by Vox, explains.

A fear of growing older and physical signs of aging is at the core of a $200 billion dollar anti-aging skin care industry, but there’s hope that this may start to change. Vox senior correspondent, Anna North, explains what’s behind a growing movement to love the skin we’re in, no matter what age.

      <title>Did mask mandates and school closures make a difference? | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>The United States employed a suite of tools in the fight against Covid-19, albeit unevenly. Many states and cities put in place strict guidelines, including mask mandates, business shutdowns, and school closures. Others were more relaxed; some set restrictions, but only for a while. Vox’s Dylan Scott discusses what did and didn’t work in America’s pandemic response, and why it’s hard to even begin to figure it out.

Check out Vox’s pandemic playbook, a look at how six countries handled the fight against Covid-19.

      <title>Why the internet is a luxury | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Think about everything you did yesterday. Now imagine how the day would have gone if you didn’t have the internet. Access to the internet isn’t as universal as you might think. Millions of Americans don’t have access to broadband, because of either where they live or what they can afford. But there’s another big, more insidious factor: politics. Vox senior reporter Emily Stewart (@emilystewartm) is here to discuss.

References: 
Rani wrote about low-income Americans’ access to broadband.

And Emily wrote about what it would take to get widespread internet access across the country.

      <title>The death of ‘girlboss’ | What's the Story?</title>
      <description>It’s been almost a decade since the idea of the “girlboss” emerged in the corporate world. And while the concept had feminist intentions, the conflation of feminism and capitalism has lead to its downfall. Senior culture writer, Alex Abad-Santos (@alex_abads) explains why we weren’t wrong to hope that girlboss culture would change the workplace for the better, and why it ultimately failed.

      <title>Cops, kink, and Pride | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>June is Pride Month, a moment to celebrate the queer community and advocate for LGBTQ rights. But the politics of Pride are always thorny: who should participate, how, and what that means for the moment. This year, debates have centered around how much kink should be allowed at pride and, in places like New York, whether the police should be welcome. And there’s a perpetual question of the corporatization of Pride — when Target and MasterCard are sponsoring parade floats, how radical is it? Alex Abad-Santos, a senior correspondent at Vox, lays out the conversation.

      <title>The adventures of cool old ladies | Ask a Book Critic</title>
      <description>A 68-year-old, retired grandmother wants to know: "Are there any reads about senior women having creative, life-altering adventures that don’t heavily involve matriarchal family stuff? "
It's a tough request considering the publishing industry hasn't demonstrated much interest in these types of stories. But Constance did some research, phoned a friend for help (her mom) and has three books to recommend.

      <title>A housing bubble? | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>There’s no denying the housing market has been a little wild lately — home prices are soaring in many parts of the country, and the competition among buyers has people going to some pretty extreme lengths. The last time we saw such a frenzy in the housing market, about 15 years ago, it ended in a crash. Now, it’s hard not to wonder whether the US economy is headed in the same direction, and whether skyrocketing prices will soon come back down to earth. Vox policy reporter Jerusalem Demsas explains whether America is seeing yet another housing bubble, and how to solve the problem.

      <title>The enduring legacy of Dawsoncrying.gif | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Whether or not you grew up watching the hit TV teen drama, Dawson’s Creek, you are probably familiar with a gif of the titular Dawson, played by James Van Der Beek, sobbing all over the internet. Why did this become a thing and what was the backstory behind it’s existence in the first place? Vox’s Constance Grady interviewed showrunners, editors, and TV critics to find the answers.

      <title>“In the Heights” rocks! | What to Watch </title>
      <description>In the Heights, the new movie musical based on Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit Broadway debut, seems poised to be the movie of the summer. It’s an electric, joyful celebration of the Latino community in New York City’s Washington Heights neighborhood — and it will make you want to dance. If you haven’t been back to the theaters yet, this is the movie to go see.

      <title>Where on the internet is Donald Trump? | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>The former president was kicked off social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube in the wake of the Capitol riots, and it’s not clear when — or if — they’re going to let him back on. There’s been buzz about Trump starting his own platform, but he’s had a hard time getting it off the ground thus far: The blog he launched in May folded in less than a month. In a way, Trump canceled himself. Shirin Ghaffary, a senior reporter at Recode, discusses life on the internet without the man who used to be one of its most ferocious voices

Recode’s Sara Morrison wrote about Trump shutting down his blog

And Recode’s Rebecca Heilweil wrote about Facebook’s recent decision on Trump

      <title>Learning to skateboard in my 30s | The Best Money I Ever Spent</title>
      <description>Starting to skateboard in your 30s and beyond, the trend stories tell us, signals some sort of desperation. You’re either going through a midlife crisis or trying to hide one if you think that awkwardly rolling around on a wooden toy, risking a hospital visit the entire time, is a good idea. Steve Rousseau considered all of this, and then decided not to worry about it. He bought a skateboard at the very start of the pandemic, and it’s the best money he’s ever spent.

      <title>Corporate America is over the pandemic | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>After a pandemic year of brands telling us “we’re all in this together” and corporations calling their workers “heroes,” companies are ready to move on. Many businesses cut hazard pay long ago, even though the risks of Covid-19 remain, and firms are pushing their workers to get back to the office. Vox senior correspondent Anna North explores the way the pandemic changed the way we work, and whether we can — and should — go back.

      <description>Despite TikTok’s promise of being the world’s biggest algorithmically-driven talent show, you may have noticed that the app rewards...the same kinds of people.

      <title>The problem with work is work | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>A lot of people felt overworked before the pandemic. Now, well, you can imagine. American work culture has become increasingly untenable for many people. It's basically impossible to keep up with the demands of work and the rest of life, which is especially true for parents, even when we’re not living through a pandemic. The past year has exposed America’s problem with work culture, and pushed working parents to their limits. Is there a way we can fix this? Vox’s Anna North is here to explain.

      <title>A billionaire, a cryptocurrency, and a disaster in India | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Crypto philanthropy is a burgeoning field, and one with lots of unique complications. Take the case of Vitalik Buterin, the programmer who co-founded the cryptocurrency ethereum, and his recent donation to a charity in India to help respond to the Covid-19 crisis there. He gave $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency, including $1 billion in a memecoin called Shiba Inu coin. And, well, that gift didn’t work out as planned. Former Recode senior reporter Teddy Schleifer discusses what happened with Buterin’s donation and what it might mean for other crypto donations like it.

Emily has a story on the current crypto craze here.

He gave $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency, including $1 billion in a memecoin called Shiba Inu coin. And, well, that gift didn’t work out as planned. Former Recode senior reporter Teddy Schleifer discusses what happened with Buterin’s donation and what it might mean for other crypto donations like it.

      <description>Language and identity are tightly intertwined. Which is why for Latina writer Maria Theresa Hart, conquering the Spanish language was something she’s tried to achieve since childhood. When Trump was elected in 2016, she decided to double down on her commitment.

      <title>So are the Olympics happening or what? | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>The 2020 Olympics in Tokyo are getting a second chance in 2021 after being postponed due to the pandemic. But whether they should is an open question. Japan is in the midst of a Covid-19 surge, and polls show a majority of its citizens don’t want the games to happen. If there is an outbreak at the Olympics, it’s not just that athletes and coaches could be sickened; they also risk taking the virus home. Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide has a lot riding on the event, and Japan and the International Olympic Committee are forging ahead. They insist the Olympics can still be safe. Vox reporter Jen Kirby explains the Olympic Games in flux.

      <title>“Hacks” will have you laughing out loud | What to Watch</title>
      <description>Jean Smart (the living legend and multiple Emmy winner) plays Deborah Vance, a famous comedian whose glory days are behind her. Deborah’s agent has a suggestion for her: Hire a younger comedy writer named Ava (Hannah Einbinder) to help spice up her material. 

Smart and Einbinder’s chemistry and performances take “Hacks” from a showbiz comedy to something with broader appeal. It’s a show that’s interested in the ways women in male-dominated industries are constantly one mistake away from having their careers seriously undermined, the ways that women across different generations view the world differently, and the ways those different points of view can make for varied types of comedy.

“Hacks” will release two new episodes on HBO Max every Thursday until June 10. The first four are streaming now.

      <title>Cancel culture, canceled | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>You probably think you know what cancel culture is, but do you really? The term “cancel culture” has become a trope on Twitter and Fox News, with people constantly decrying someone or something is unfairly being canceled — Dr. Suess, Ellen DeGeneres, July Fourth. But a lot of people misunderstand what cancel culture is, or at least what it was supposed to be: a way to hold powerful people accountable. Vox internet culture reporter Aja Romano joins to discuss what cancel culture means in theory and in practice, whether it’s as much of a problem as the right claims, and whether we need to have a broader conversation about having empathy for one’s past mistakes.

The term “cancel culture” has become a trope on Twitter and Fox News, with people constantly decrying someone or something is unfairly being canceled — Dr. Suess, Ellen DeGeneres, July Fourth. But a lot of people misunderstand what cancel culture is, or at least what it was supposed to be: a way to hold powerful people accountable. Vox internet culture reporter Aja Romano joins to discuss what cancel culture means in theory and in practice, whether it’s as much of a problem as the right claims, and whether we need to have a broader conversation about having empathy for one’s past mistakes.

      <title>MAGA, but for coffee | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Right-wing coffee shops are popping up across the country, proving yet again that America can make pretty much anything political. One sells blends such as “The Don” and “Sleepy Joe Decaf.” Another offers concealed-carry permit classes. Many have Donald Trump-themed decor and products. Reporter Luke Winkie discusses the MAGA coffee trend and why Republicans are looking for a conservative-leaning version of Starbucks.

The buy now pay later concept isn’t new, but as startups make it more popular, what might be the unforeseen consequences, and why might Americans be particularly susceptible to going into more and more debt?

      <title>One of 2021’s best shows | What to Watch</title>

      <title>The great lumber shortage of 2021 | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Lumber mania is sweeping North America. Prices are skyrocketing, and lumber supplies are scarce. It’s making building or renovating a home more expensive and has turned a stick of wood into a hot commodity at places like Home Depot and Lowe’s. The internet has taken notice of America’s lumber frenzy and has turned it into a bit of a meme on places like TikTok and Twitter. Paul Jannke, principal at Forest Economic Advisors, explains the current supply-demand crunch going on in lumber and whether there’s any end in sight.

        <![CDATA[<p>Lumber mania is sweeping North America. Prices are skyrocketing, and lumber supplies are scarce. It’s making building or renovating a home more expensive and has turned a stick of wood into a hot commodity at places like Home Depot and Lowe’s. The internet has taken notice of America’s lumber frenzy and has turned it into a bit of a meme on places like TikTok and Twitter. Paul Jannke, principal at Forest Economic Advisors, explains the current supply-demand crunch going on in lumber and whether there’s any end in sight.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learn More:</strong> </p><p><br></p><p>Read Emily’s story <a href="https://www.vox.com/22410713/lumber-prices-shortage">here</a>. </p><p><br></p><p>Read more from Vox about lumber and sustainable building <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/1/15/21058051/climate-change-building-materials-mass-timber-cross-laminated-clt">here</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>–</p><p><br></p><p>Tell Me More is hosted by Emily Stewart and produced by Sofi LaLonde.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enjoyed this episode?</strong> Rate Tell Me More ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ and leave a review on Apple </p><p> </p><p><strong>What do you want to learn about on Tell Me More? </strong>Send your requests and questions to <a href="mailto:tellmemore@voxmedia.com">tellmemore@voxmedia.com</a>.

      <title>Aubrey Gordon’s travel talisman | The Best Money I Ever Spent </title>
      <description>If you haven’t been fat, you might not know what it’s like to fly as a fat person. To walk past rows of passengers who meet your face with dread, disgust, or fear. To hear your body loudly derided in your presence. To be removed from a flight and required to rebook, sometimes without a refund, and nearly always without legal recourse. 

This week on The Best Money I Ever Spent, Aubrey Gordon, the writer behind ‘Your Fat Friend’ and the co-host of the Maintenance Phase, explains how a simple device she purchased for $19.98 — her travel talisman — helped her reclaim control and dignity over some of the worst aspects of flying.

      <title>“Asian American” | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>The term “Asian American” applies to more than 50 ethnic groups and people who speak upwards of 100 languages. While it’s served Asian Americans to build political power, it’s also left many people feeling marginalized and erased. Lumping such a diverse group together masks the different ways people experience the economy, culture, and society. The Indian American experience is quite different from, say, the Burmese American experience. Vox reporter Li Zhou discusses the inadequacy of the term “Asian American."

      <description>Whether or not you grew up watching the hit TV teen drama, Dawson’s Creek, you are probably familiar with a gif of the titular Dawson, played by James Van Der Beek, sobbing all over the internet.

      <title>Live. Watch. Pose  |  What to Watch</title>
      <description>Vox critic-at-large Emily VanDerWerff and film critic Alissa Wilkinson recommend FX’s groundbreaking series Pose, which recently started its third and final season. The show dramatizes the lives of members of New York City’s drag ball community in the late 1980s and early ’90s. It’s a fundamentally warm and optimistic celebration of found family, but it’s also not afraid to look at the terrible things that can happen to queer people in our culture, particularly during that time period.
Seasons 1 and 2 are available on Netflix. 18 episodes total. New episodes Sunday on FX and available Monday on Hulu.

      <title>The housing boom, but for renters | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Tell Me More is Vox Quick Hits exclusive series, hosted by Vox reporter Emily Stewart and produced by Sofi LaLonde.

America’s high-flying housing market might mean you’ll be renting forever — or, at least, for quite some time. Housing prices have soared during the pandemic as people have rushed to buy homes to escape cities and secure space for themselves and their families. Big companies have scooped up houses as well, sometimes outcompeting would-be homebuyers. As a result, more people may be pushed toward rentals because they can’t find or afford houses to buy. Recode’s Rani Molla explains whether the housing boom is turning America into a nation of renters.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Tell Me More</strong> is Vox Quick Hits exclusive series, hosted by Vox reporter Emily Stewart and produced by Sofi LaLonde.</p><p><br></p><p>America’s high-flying housing market might mean you’ll be renting forever — or, at least, for quite some time. Housing prices have soared during the pandemic as people have rushed to buy homes to escape cities and secure space for themselves and their families. Big companies have scooped up houses as well, sometimes outcompeting would-be homebuyers. As a result, more people may be pushed toward rentals because they can’t find or afford houses to buy. Recode’s Rani Molla explains whether the housing boom is turning America into a nation of renters.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong> </p><ul>

      <title>No, Biden isn’t coming for your burger | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>A rumor has taken hold among some Republicans that President Joe Biden wants to curtail America’s meat consumption — a rumor that, to be clear, isn’t true. The White House has no plans to limit people to eating certain amounts of beef as part of its climate proposal. However, that doesn’t mean meat has a positive impact on the environment. Food-related emissions, including those resulting from meat production, are a major contributor to climate change. Vox senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp debunks claims of Biden’s burger crackdown — and discusses why we should be having a discussion about meat if we really want to save the planet.

Learn more: 

Read Zack’s story about Biden’s fake burger ban here.

Season 3 of Future Perfect is about the meat industry. Listen to the trailer here.


Tell Me More is hosted by Emily Stewart and produced by Sofi LaLonde.

      <title>Moderna Mafia vs. Pfizer Pham vs. J&amp;JHive | What's the Story?</title>
      <description>Let’s be clear: All the available vaccines are worth taking and public health officials have avoided comparing them, because the best coronavirus vaccine is whichever one you can get. But that hasn’t stopped people from inventing their own perceptions about what it means to be part of the Moderna Mafia or the Pfizer Pham. Vox contributor Luke Winkie (@luke_winkie) explains why we do this.

      <title>Too old for Disney, too young for The CW | What to Watch </title>
      <link>https://vox.com/</link>
      <description>We’ve been hunkered down at home for more than a year and, for many families, that’s meant finding common ground in viewing habits. 
This week on What to Watch, Vox film critic Alissa Wilkinson and critic at large Emily VanDerWerff help Stasi, a California mom with two tweens (ages 10 and 12). Stasi says it has been tough to find things to watch as a family — the options are either too juvenile or too mature, and very few hit that sweet spot right in middle. So she wants to know: What should they try?
Emily recommends:


Wolfwalkers (Apple TV+): Animated storytelling at its finest. 


Avatar: The Last Airbender (Netflix): One of the greatest shows ever made. 


Lost (Hulu): Perhaps the most significant show of the 21st century.


Alissa recommends:


Nailed It! (Netflix): A playful reality baking show that celebrates the joy of sugar, friendship, and messing up.


I Am Greta (Hulu): An intimate, vulnerable documentary about the teen behind the headlines.


The Water Man (in theaters May 7): It feels like a family film from a bygone era — and that’s what makes it great.

      <title>The 51st state | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>The House of Representatives recently voted to make Washington, DC, the 51st state in the union, something many residents have wanted for a long time. Even though momentum is building, the bill probably isn’t going anywhere in the Senate unless Democrats get rid of or change the filibuster rules. Vox policy reporter Jerusalem Demsas (@jerusalemdemsas) discusses what DC not being a state means for the people who live there as well as politics and polling around the issue.

      <title>Should hot spots get more vaccines? | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>For months, the primary tools we had to combat Covid-19 outbreaks were testing, distancing, and masks. Now there’s a new and highly effective tool: vaccines. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has asked the White House for more vaccines and resources to address the state’s Covid spike. Thus far, the Biden administration is sticking to its plan of distributing vaccines according to population, whatever case rates in certain areas may be. Vox senior correspondent German Lopez (@germanrlopez) discusses whether the US needs to tweak its vaccine plan so that more shots get directed to places where the virus is surging.

Read more about the nominees:

Judas and the Black Messiah

Mank

Minari

Nomadland

Promising Young Woman

The Father

The Trial of the Chicago 7

      <title>How Nigeria explains the climate crisis | Worldly</title>
      <description>In a very special Earth Month episode, Zack, Jenn, and Alex use Nigeria as a case study to uncover the deep reasons why it’s so hard for the world to quit fossil fuels. Nigeria is a country deeply threatened by climate change, but it’s also one with a major oil industry that hopes to lift millions out of poverty — a feat that has never been done without some degree of reliance on dirty energy. The team explains how these barriers affect the prospects for mitigating climate change in both Nigeria and globally, and talk about what solutions might help overcome these barriers.

References:

Check out all of Vox’s Earth Month podcasts.

This is Nigeria’s national climate action plan.

Reuters reports on how Nigeria’s minister of environment said the country must be ready for oil’s decline.

Science magazine explains how fighting poverty makes it harder to fight climate change.

Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò wrote about the African case for carbon capture for Africa Is A Country.

Zack read from this smart paper on home energy needs in Nigeria.

Learn about the problem with “degrowth.”

      <title>The blunt truth about weed farms | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>The environmental cost of growing marijuana is quite a bit higher than you might think, especially when growing indoors. America’s legal marijuana production industry consumes enough electricity to power nearly 100,000 homes every year. According to one estimate, if Colorado would shift all of its marijuana production to outdoors, it would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 1.3 percent annually. Dharna Noor (@dharnanoor), a staff writer at Earther, discusses the surprising environmental impact of marijuana production.

Tell Me More is hosted by Emily Stewart and produced by Sofi LaLonde.

      <title>Will the superpowers unite on climate? | Tell Me More </title>
      <description>The United States and China play leading roles in the global response to climate change: Together, they account for 43 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. And it’s not just actions within their borders that matter; they are highly influential in the world, too. Many industrialized countries look to the US for cues on climate action, and many developing countries look to China. Jariel Arvin (@jarielarvin), a fellow at Vox, discusses what the US and China are doing on climate, including President Biden’s attempt to reset America on the environment post-Trump; what’s going on with China’s Belt and Road Initiative; and what’s next for the two superpowers.

**Update** Over the weekend, the US and China signed a rare statement of cooperation on climate, which includes an agreement to enhance their respective climate actions in the 2020s. You can read more about the update here.

Tell Me More is hosted by Emily Stewart and produced by Sofi LaLonde.

      <title>America is finally leaving Afghanistan | Worldly</title>
      <description>Zack, Jenn, and Alex talk about President Joe Biden’s announcement that all remaining US troops will withdraw from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021 — the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that launched the war. They discuss what the US withdrawal means for the near-term future of Afghanistan, why Biden finally made the tough call that his predecessors couldn’t (or wouldn’t), and what that decision tells us about how Biden sees the future of US military engagement abroad.

      <title>Twitter doesn't want Trump's tweets, but the National Archives does | Recode Daily</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/recode-daily-podcast</link>
      <description>When a presidency ends, the National Archives and Records Administration's work begins. They play a key role in transferring millions of records and artifacts from the White House. And they even archive the Twitter accounts belonging to members of the previous administration. We first saw this happen with the Obama administration, and those archived accounts are still around. But President Trump has created a kind of thorny problem for the National Archives: how do you preserve the tweets of a president who's been banned from Twitter? Politico’s Quint Forgey (@QuintForgey) explains.

        <![CDATA[<p>When a presidency ends, the National Archives and Records Administration's work begins. They play a key role in transferring millions of records and artifacts from the White House. And they even archive the Twitter accounts belonging to members of the previous administration. We first saw this happen with the Obama administration, and those archived accounts are still around. But President Trump has created a kind of thorny problem for the National Archives: how do you preserve the tweets of a president who's been banned from Twitter?

      <title>Can Chuck Schumer's flip phone save America? | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Democrats have the slimmest of majorities in the United States Senate, and it’s up to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to keep his caucus together. He has to manage moderates, such as Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, while at the same time dealing with progressives to his left. And, he’s up for reelection in 2022 and would rather not face a primary challenge from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Vox reporter Li Zhou (@liszhou) recently interviewed Schumer. She and host Emily Stewart discuss the New York Democrat’s political style — which includes lots of personal calls to lawmakers on his flip phone — and how he hopes to accomplish “big, bold change” in the coming months.

Tell Me More is hosted by Emily Stewart and produced by Sofi LaLonde.

      <title>The trauma of the Derek Chauvin trial | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis in 2020 was a deeply traumatic moment for America, and Black Americans, in particular, were affected. Now, many people are living that pain as the trial for former police officer Derek Chauvin, who faces criminal charges in Floyd’s death, is underway. Vox race reporter Fabiola Cineas (@fabiolacineas) discusses what’s happening in the trial, the prosecution’s plan for using video and witness testimony to advance their case, and the impact those elements can have on people participating in the trial and those watching at home. 

Tell Me More is hosted by Emily Stewart and produced by Sofi LaLonde.

      <title>Jordan’s royal family feud | Worldly</title>
      <description>Zack, Jenn, and Alex break down the royal drama that has roiled the normally quiet kingdom of Jordan this week: The king has accused his half-brother, the former crown prince, of a vague conspiracy against the crown and has put him under house arrest. 

References:

Alex wrote Vox’s explainer on the royal family feud.

This is the audio of Prince Hamzah and the Jordanian general talking that Jenn mentioned.

The New York Times has a good piece on the roots of the King Abdullah and Prince Hamzah split.

      <link>https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/11/10/21556650/best-money-covid-19-moving-home-kayak</link>
      <description>This is The Best Money I Ever Spent, a series of personal essays about the purchases we make – big and small — that make an impact on our lives. 
When Max Ufberg and his girlfriend left New York for Pennsylvania at the beginning of the pandemic, they assumed it would be a quick trip.

And he started to realize just how wrong he was about this place.

      <title>Vaccine passports, explained | Recode Daily</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/recode-daily-podcast</link>
      <description>One way that America can get “back to normal” is through what's called a digital vaccine passport. America is well underway with its covid vaccination rollout and while we still have a long way to go, more and more people are getting vaccinated. But while carrying a digital vaccine record sounds like a useful idea, experts warn of privacy issues and serious ethical concerns. Vox’s Rebecca Heilweil explains.

      <title>Biden’s Afghanistan dilemma | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>President Joe Biden has a decision to make by May 1: whether to pull troops from Afghanistan or have them stay. There is no easy answer; both options could have serious consequences. But a decision has to be made. President Donald Trump made a deal with the Taliban that troops would leave by May 1, but in the end, Biden has to make the call. What would happen if the troops stay, and what would happen if they leave? Vox’s Alex Ward is here to discuss. He’s a White House reporter and a co-host of the Worldly podcast. 
Learn more: 
Alex recently talked to two experts who argued both sides of the decision. You can read those arguments here: staying in Afghanistan or leaving Afghanistan.

      <title>The problem with work is work | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>A lot of people felt overworked before the pandemic. Now, well, you can imagine. American work culture has become increasingly untenable for many people. It's basically impossible to keep up with the demands of work and the rest of life, which is especially true for parents, even when we’re not living through a pandemic. The past year has exposed America’s problem with work culture, and pushed working parents to their limits. Is there a way we can fix this? Vox’s Anna North is here to explain.

      <title>Minari on streaming platforms | What to Watch</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/22274856/minari-review-yeun-chung</link>
      <description>From the Vox Quick Hits archive (Feb. 19, 2021): Vox film critic Alissa Wilkinson and critic-at-large Emily VanDerWerff recommend Minari. 
Minari is the story of Korean immigrants Jacob (Steven Yeun) and Monica (Yeri Han) who move their two small children (Noel Kate Cho and Alan S. Kim) from California to Arkansas in pursuit of Jacob’s dream of farming. But Jacob and Monica’s marriage is on the rocks, a circumstance that doesn’t improve the way they hoped it would when Monica’s mother (Yuh Jung Youn) comes to stay with them.
Written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung (Munyurangabo, Lucky Life) and set in the 1980s Ozarks, Minari feels deeply personal. It’s both a family drama seen through the eyes of a Korean American boy and a moving tale of love and loss in the American heartland, exquisitely told.
Read Alissa's review of Minari here.

Minari is the story of Korean immigrants Jacob (Steven Yeun) and Monica (Yeri Han) who move their two small children (Noel Kate Cho and Alan S. Kim) from California to Arkansas in pursuit of Jacob’s dream of farming. But Jacob and Monica’s marriage is on the rocks, a circumstance that doesn’t improve the way they hoped it would when Monica’s mother (Yuh Jung Youn) comes to stay with them.
Written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung (Munyurangabo, Lucky Life) and set in the 1980s Ozarks, Minari feels deeply personal. It’s both a family drama seen through the eyes of a Korean American boy and a moving tale of love and loss in the American heartland, exquisitely told.

      <title>Is Myanmar heading for civil war? | Worldly</title>
      <description>Zack, Alex, and returning guest Jen Kirby talk about the potential for a “bloodbath” in Myanmar. Since the military deposed the democratic government in a February 1 coup, pro-democracy protesters and armed ethnic groups have risen up against the junta. They’ve been met with extreme violence, leading to more than 500 dead and concerns from experts that a broader civil war is coming. The Worldly crew explains how this horrible situation came to be, what may come next, and what — if anything — the international community can do to stop a Syria-like crisis.

      <description>Vox's Worldly host Zack Beauchamp talks with author and New Statesman editor Emily Tamkin about the life and legacy of George Soros.

      <title>The new wave of anti-trans legislation, explained | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>America has never been particularly concerned with women's sports, and yet a slew of bills trying to block transgender girls and women from participating in them are popping up across the country. Transgender student athletes are just the latest target in conservatives’ attempts to pass anti-LGBTQ legislation; before they were talking about sports, they were fretting over bathrooms and puberty blockers. This move against trans athletes stems from the argument that men are biologically stronger than women. But is the science there? Katelyn Burns, a contributing writer at Vox, explains.

      <title>Why so many houseless people didn’t get their stimulus checks | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Like many Americans, you may have an extra $1,400 dollars in your bank account, or you're expecting it to arrive soon. After President Biden signed the Covid-19 relief bill on March 11, stimulus checks went out to millions of people, but not everyone who's eligible got one. In fact, many of the most vulnerable Americans, including people experiencing homelessness, did not receive payments. Vox's Kelsey Piper explains what happened and how we may be able to fix it.

      <title>Why the gun control debate is stuck | Today, Explained in 10</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/today-explained</link>
      <description>Recent mass shootings in Georgia and Colorado have recharged the movement to regulate gun ownership. But federal gun control legislation has little chance of passing. Patrick Blanchfield from the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research argues that the best way to mitigate gun violence may be not talking about gun control at all.

      <title>Your questions about the world, answered | Worldly in 10</title>
      <description>In a very special Worldly episode, Zack, Jenn, and Alex answer YOUR questions! From the many great listener questions sent in over the last several weeks, the gang picked four to answer in this week’s episode: What is “the Quad” and how does it fit into geopolitics in the Indo-Pacific; what’s driving migration to the US from Central America; why Imperial Japan’s use of Korean forced labor and “comfort women” in the 1930s and ’40s continues to complicate relations between Japan and South Korea today; and how to go about explaining world affairs topics to folks who don’t have a deep background in these subjects.

Hosts:
Zack Beauchamp (@zackbeauchamp), senior correspondent, Vox

      <itunes:summary>In a very special Worldly episode, Zack, Jenn, and Alex answer YOUR questions! From the many great listener questions sent in over the last several weeks, the gang picked four to answer in this week’s episode: What is “the Quad” and how does it fit into geopolitics in the Indo-Pacific; what’s driving migration to the US from Central America; why Imperial Japan’s use of Korean forced labor and “comfort women” in the 1930s and ’40s continues to complicate relations between Japan and South Korea today; and how to go about explaining world affairs topics to folks who don’t have a deep background in these subjects.

      <title>What lies beneath our feet?  | Unexplainable</title>
      <link>https://vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>Sixty years ago, geologists tried to drill down through the Earth’s crust to pull up a piece of the Earth’s mantle. Their mission didn’t go exactly as planned. But it sowed the seeds for a new field of science that’s helped us rewrite not only the history of the planet, but, potentially, our definitions of life itself.
The documentaries featured in this episode are "The First Deep Ocean Drilling: Mohole, Phase 1" and "Project Mohole: Report No. 1."

      <title>Student debt, part 2: The case against forgiveness | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>As the argument for student debt forgiveness has been fleshed out in recent years, so has the case that it’s not the right way to go. Some experts, economists, and ordinary Americans are skeptical of forgiving student debt. They argue that while debt is certainly a problem for the people who have it, forgiveness isn’t a really effective way to stimulate the economy or to tackle equity goals. Beth Akers, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, lays out the case against broad-based student debt forgiveness in Tell Me More’s two-part series on student debt.

      <title>Student debt, part 1: The case for forgiveness | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Student debt in America now totals some $1.7 trillion, and the debate about what to do that debt is part of the mainstream political conversation. Pressure is growing on President Joe Biden and Democrats to try to do something about it — including canceling some or even all student loan debt altogether. Fenaba Addo, an associate professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, talks about the burden student debt represents for borrowers and what it would mean for that debt to be forgiven. This is the first of a two-part series from Tell Me More on student debt cancellation.

      <title>Europe’s vaccine disaster | Worldly</title>
      <description>Zack, Jenn, and Alex discuss the raft of problems stymying Europe’s vaccine rollout, which has been slower and messier than expected, given some of the earlier successes the continent had controlling infection rates. They talk about why some countries decided to pause administering the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and how the EU’s decision to negotiate for vaccines as a bloc, rather than as individual countries, slowed down the rollout and exacerbated tensions between some of the wealthier and less-wealthy countries in the bloc. They also discuss what all of this turmoil might mean for the future of the EU as a political institution.

References:

Politico Europe has a great piece on how the EU fell behind on vaccines.

Here’s the survey showing Europe is the most vaccine-skeptical region of the world.

The New York Times reported politics may have played a bigger role in the AstraZeneca vaccine freeze than science.

The Washington Post reported that Europe may be headed into a third coronavirus wave.

      <title>How smell works | Unexplainable</title>
      <link>https://vox.com/unexplainable</link>
      <description>Believe it or not, scientists still don’t know exactly how the sense of smell works. But they’re looking at how powerful it is — dogs can actually sniff out cancer and many other diseases — and they’re trying to figure out how to reverse engineer it. In fact, one MIT scientist may have built a robot nose without completely understanding how his invention works.

      <title>Is everyone getting vaccinated without me? | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Now that the Covid-19 vaccine is here, a lot of people want it as soon as possible. The problem is, there aren’t enough shots to go around. A lot of emotions stem from that, including a new trend — vaccine shaming — where people pile on those who got vaccines, wondering how they qualified and feeling like the system is unfair. Vox senior correspondent Alex Abad-Santos explains why people feel compelled to shame others in the pandemic, whether it’s an effective tactic, and who’s really to blame.

      <title>Should Democrats scrap the filibuster? | Tell Me More</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/22319564/filibuster-reform-manchin-democrats-nuclear-option</link>
      <description>The filibuster, a Senate rule that was put in place by accident in the 19th century, is standing in the way of much of President Joe Biden’s agenda. A growing chorus of Democrats are calling for the Senate to scrap the filibuster, arguing that it’s the only way the party can act on issues such as voting rights, gun control, and climate. Not everyone is in agreement — including, importantly, Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Vox’s Andrew Prokop explains what’s going on.

      <itunes:subtitle>What is the Senate filibuster, and why is everyone talking about it?</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>The filibuster, a Senate rule that was put in place by accident in the 19th century, is standing in the way of much of President Joe Biden’s agenda. A growing chorus of Democrats are calling for the Senate to scrap the filibuster, arguing that it’s the only way the party can act on issues such as voting rights, gun control, and climate. Not everyone is in agreement — including, importantly, Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Vox’s Andrew Prokop explains what’s going on.

      <description>It’s been harder to buy things online this past year. Some of that has to do with the pandemic causing supply chain holdups but there’s another reason why so many hard-to-find items are ever harder to find lately. Casey Taylor is a contributor for Vox who tracked down the origin story from sneakers to The Nugget Couch in the online reselling market. 

One Good Answer is a Vox Quick Hits exclusive series hosted by co-deputy editor of The Goods, Meredith Haggerty, produced by Schuyler Swenson and mixed by Paul Mounsey. New episodes every other Wednesday.

      <title>Gen Z’s transit meme dream | Tell Me More</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/2021/3/10/22303355/gen-z-high-speed-rail-biden-map-meme-buttigieg</link>
      <description>President Joe Biden is known for his love of Amtrak — and now, many young Americans are hoping that might translate to a push for public transit, maybe even high-speed rail, from the federal government. A meme has taken off among Gen Z and millennials of an imagined high-speed rail system that would connect many of the biggest cities in the country. Vox policy and politics intern Gabby Birenbaum discusses how a meme about trains took off among young people, and how their aspirations go beyond the internet. They want a better, more equitable transit system, and they hope Biden can deliver.
Read Gabby's story here.
Tell Me More is a Vox Quick Hits exclusive series hosted by politics and business reporter Emily Stewart and produced by Sofi LaLonde. New episodes on Mondays and Tuesdays.

      <title>The best Covid-19 vaccine is the one you can get | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Americans now have three Covid-19 vaccines available to them — Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer/BioNTech. People shouldn’t worry about which vaccine they get, what matters is they get one. All of the Covid-19 vaccines available in the US right now are more effective than the flu shot. Vox senior correspondent Dylan Scott lays out what’s going on with the Covid-19 vaccines and answers questions about efficacy rates, vaccine hesitancy, and whether there’s finally some room for optimism about the end of the US outbreak.

      <title>Biden goes big on the economy | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Joe Biden is the type of guy who can tell which way the political winds are blowing — and right now, that means taking a big, bold swing at boosting the economy. Democrats are pushing a nearly $2 trillion stimulus package through Congress, arguing that the real risk is doing too little, not too much, to help steer the country through the Covid-19 crisis. It’s quite a shift from deficit concerns of the past. Vox’s Ella Nilsen discusses the Democratic Party’s more progressive turn on the economy and whether it will last.

      <title>Why Biden hasn’t reentered the Iran deal — yet | Worldly in 10</title>
      <description>Zack, Jenn, and Alex break down why the Biden administration hasn’t yet reentered the Iran nuclear deal. They explain that the process of rejoining is more complicated than it might seem, but that it’s still likely the deal will come back eventually. They then debate the pros and cons of rejoining the accord and how well the Obama foreign policy team — many of whom have joined the Biden administration — handled the pact. One point of agreement: The Trump administration’s Iran policy failed.

References:

Alex wrote about the impending US-Iran talks over the nuclear deal.

Vox has a great visual explainer on the Iran deal.

      <title>Vaccine equity | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Black and brown communities have been disproportionately impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, on both the health and economic fronts.

White people are being vaccinated at higher rates than people of color, and many places aren’t tracking who’s getting vaccinated, race-wise, at all. Vox reporter Fabiola Cineas discusses vaccinations in the context of race and what an equitable policy should look like.

      <title>The politics of stimulus checks | Tell Me More</title>

Vox senior correspondent Dylan Matthews explains the evolving politics around the government sending people money, how we got here, and whether these policies are likely to stick around.

      <title>Protesting farmers, India's democracy, and Rihanna | Worldly</title>
      <description>Zack, Jenn, and Alex discuss the huge farmers’ protests in India. They explain the very real policy debate over new agricultural reform laws that sparked the protests, and how that debate has now been obscured by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist politics, international celebrity activism, and online trolls. Oh, and they talk about Rihanna. Yes, that Rihanna.

References:

Vox’s Jariel Arvin explains the Indian farmers’ protest.

And he also writes about why India’s government is mad at Rihanna.

The New Yorker in 2019 had an excellent feature on Modi’s Hindu nationalism.

The Times of India looks into the rise of internet trolls.

      <title>Our favorite TV | What to Watch</title>
      <description>A few weeks ago, Vox critic-at-large Emily VanDerWerff and film critic Alissa Wilkinson shared their favorite movies. This week they're back with their favorite shows:

The Simpsons on Disney Plus (Emily) 
This classic has been on the air since 1989. Not all the jokes will fly today, but looking back on the comedy of the 1990s, The Simpsons seems to have aged the best. Since it's animated and the characters never age, it can continually comment on American life. And it will only take 258 days to watch all 695 episodes!

The Comeback on HBO Max (Alissa)
There are so many good reasons to watch this meta-comedy co-created by Lisa Kudrow (who also stars in it) and Michael Patrick King, the executive producer of Sex and the City. It's funny and binge-able. It cleverly skewers the kind of sexism that was present on the set of sitcoms in the 1990s. And although it's not necessarily cheerful, it has a lot of heart. You'll see new jokes and funny bits with each re-watch. There are 21 episodes in all, each lasting between 25 and 55 minutes.

Deadwood on HBO Max (Emily) 
Set in the town of Deadwood, South Dakota, this series follows the town's new sheriff Seth Bullock, played by Timothy Olyphant. He's not trying to be law enforcement. He just wants to have a quiet life opening a hardware store. Deadwood is a Western, yes, but it explores the ways in which we construct civilization and societies are born — the ways America was born. There's tension between the need for individuality and the need for community. And this is one of best shows at believably tracing a really terrible person's movement toward getting involved with his community. There are three seasons and a wrap-up movie. You can watch all in around 35 hours.

High Maintenance on HBO Max (Alissa) 
At face value, this is a show about buying weed. But it's really about all the different characters that the weed dealer — the connecting thread of each episode — comes into contact with. We meet people from all walks of life who have weird jobs, weird problems, weird fetishes, weird predicaments. You won't get long, drawn-out character arcs with this show, just little snippets of people's lives. Every episode is delightful. There are 34 in all, and there's even one that's entirely from the perspective of a (very good) dog.

      <description>Picking up skating in your 30s and beyond, the trend stories tell us, signals some sort of desperation. You’re either going through a midlife crisis or trying to hide one if you think that awkwardly rolling around on a wooden toy, risking a hospital visit the entire time, is a good idea. 
Steve Rousseau considered all of this, and then decided not to worry about it. He bought a skateboard at the very start of the pandemic, and it’s the best money he’s ever spent.

      <description>Vox culture writer Constance Grady explains why TV shows like Dragnet, Law &amp; Order, Hawaii Five-0, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine always seem to feature police as heroes. She explains how police consultants became the go-to for procedurals, the police archetypes that saturate pop culture, and how cop shows are pivoting for 2021.

      <title>Why the U.S. can’t figure out reopening schools | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Nearly a year into the pandemic, the country still hasn’t quite figured out how to keep students and teachers safe at school. It’s largely been up to states, school districts, and teachers to figure out whether to keep schools open or switch to distance learning. Experts say measures like masks, ventilation, and testing can make schools safer — but those measures often require resources that schools don’t have. Vox’s Anna North explains what’s happening with schools during the pandemic, and whether the Biden administration can turn things around.

      <title>Robinhood, meet the Dotcom bubble | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>The Redditors of WallStreetBets should maybe take a look at the 1990s before piling into their next trade. The GameStop saga has shed a light on the growing individual investing trend, brought about by commission-free trading, gamified apps, and a lot of down time during the pandemic. But like so many trends, this isn’t new: Day trading was super popular in the 1990s, when people were also looking on chat boards for stock tips and making speculative bets. Recode’s Peter Kafka puts the current day trading craze into context.

      <title>Can you convict an ex-president? | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial is on the horizon, even though he’s out of the White House. Trump was impeached for the second time in January, this time on incitement of insurrection over the riots at the US Capitol, and now, the matter is headed to the Senate. Some Democrats worry conducting an impeachment trial now will collide with Joe Biden’s early agenda, but lawmakers insist they can balance legislation, appointee confirmations, and Trump. Vox’s Li Zhou explains the lay of the land.

      <title>An actual federal Covid-19 response | Tell Me More</title>
      <description>With Joe Biden in office, the United States has a chance to reset its response to the Covid-19 pandemic and address the crisis at hand. President Biden has set a goal of administering 100 million Covid-19 vaccines in 100 days. Central to his plan to get there: an increased federal role in the process and billions of dollars in investment. Vox’s German Lopez discusses America’s current vaccination landscape, Biden’s coronavirus strategy, and how the new administration’s approach differs from Donald Trump’s.

      <title>Why is everyone talking about Section 230? | Tell Me More</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/recode/22221135/capitol-riot-section-230-twitter-hawley-democrats</link>
      <description>Lawmakers in Washington are fighting over an internet law you’ve never heard of called Section 230. It’s a sword and shield that basically means internet companies like Twitter and Facebook can police their platforms however they want, and they’re not liable for what people post there. But now, the law is increasingly under fire on both sides of the aisle. Recode reporter Sara Morrison explains the growing criticism of Section 230 and whether scrapping or reforming it is really the best way to make the internet better.

      <title>Understanding Kamala Harris's multiracial identity | What's the Story?</title>
      <link>https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/8/14/21366307/kamala-harris-black-south-asian-indian-identity</link>
      <description>In her new role, Kamala Harris will break many barriers: she is the first woman, first Black person, and first person of South Asian descent to become the vice president of the United States.
For some people, that last part is news: Wait, Harris is Asian American? When she was nominated, there was much discussion about Harris’s identity. While some South Asian voters were upset that this part of her identity has long been downplayed, others were excited about the historic nature of her nomination and what it represents for South Asian American women and women of color. Meanwhile, some Black voters debated whether she is truly “Black enough,” and far-right critics pushed birther-style arguments, questioning whether Harris is a US citizen and her eligibility for vice president.
Vox’s Nisha Chittal walks us through Kamala Harris’s background and explains why Americans still struggle to talk about multiracial people.
