      <title>Alberto Ríos — December Morning in the Desert</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Standing at the edge of a desert, surveying the stars on a December morning, the speaker in this poem observes the everything of everything. He is so small; the universe is so loud and so silent. Thinking about the enormity of all this, he thinks of the smallness of the hearts of birds, wasps, moths, bats, and dragonflies — all flying things around him, suspended in space, like the earth is suspended in space. His own heart, too, echoes the universe’s noise.</p><p><strong>Alberto Ríos</strong> is Arizona’s inaugural poet laureate and a recent chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, as well as the author of twelve collections of poetry, most recently, <i>Not Go Away Is My Name</i>. Published in the <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>Paris Review</i>, <i>Ploughshares</i>, and other journals, he has also written three short story collections and a memoir, <i>Capirotada</i>, about growing up on the Mexican border.  Ríos is also the host of the PBS programs Art in the 48 and Books & Co.

      <title>Donika Kelly — In the Chapel of St. Mary’s</title>

      <title>Linda Hogan — Song for the Turtles of the Gulf</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In a poem called a “Song,” Linda Hogan crafts a song for turtles and other creatures killed through oil spills in the gulf. At once a praise song for the beauty of the sea, the earth, and its animals, this song also functions as a lament: for the history erased by industrial practices; for the lack of respect and love for living breathing other-than-human lives; for plastic and the plastic containers used to hold the body of a dead sea turtle. The poem veers towards a prayer, too, begging forgiveness for being “thrown off true.”</p><p>Linda Hogan is a Chickasaw novelist, essayist, and environmentalist. She earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs and an MA in English and creative writing from the University of Colorado-Boulder. Her books of poetry include <i>Dark. Sweet.</i>, <i>The Book of Medicines</i>, <i>Seeing Through the Sun</i>, and many more.</p><p>Find <a href="https://onbeing.org/programs/linda-hogan-song-for-the-turtles-of-the-gulf/#transcript">the transcript</a> for this show at onbeing.org.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The exile’s return to the motherland is the theme around which Lory Bedikian’s poem “On the Way to Oshagan”<i> </i>circles. She, a proud Armenian, stops by a roadside stall on a trip to her home country; and is immediately understood as an <i>Amerigatzi</i>, even though she’s speaking Armenian, not English. The poem could end with this awkward exchange, but instead pushes through, and a connection occurs between the returned-departed and the never-departed: there’s a gift, an invitation, and a bridge across exile.</p><p>Lory Bedikian received her BA from UCLA with an emphasis in Creative Writing and Poetry. She earned her MFA in Poetry from the University of Oregon, where she received the Dan Kimble First Year Teaching Award for Poetry. Bedikian's <i>The Book of Lamenting</i> won the 2010 Philip Levine Prize in Poetry.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Telling some of the story of the Flower Wars of the Aztec era, Nico Amador’s poem pits wars against creation. In a poem that begins by recalling creation myths from multiple cultures, he then poses questions about why: Why would people sacrifice their own people to keep a god happy? Why would any god benefit from people’s deaths? Evoking how the Flower Wars contributed to the Aztec downfall, this poem also wonders about wars today: Who benefits from a war? Who decides who should die? Why?</p><p>Nico Amador has been published in a number of journals and anthologies. His chapbook, <i>Flower Wars</i>, was selected as the winner of the Anzaldúa Poetry Prize and was published by Newfound Press in 2017.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In a poem that addresses a worm directly as “you,” Gail McConnell considers how these tube-shaped beings live: ingesting the earth, aerating it, digesting it, making its nourishment accessible for all kinds of growth. The worm burrows, knows dead things, and knows underground ways.

      <title>Tishani Doshi — Species</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In a fantastical poem about the future, Tishani Doshi explores the present. She imagines a future where agriculture, forestry, and cultivation are things of the past, distant memories learned by humans existing on other planets, or on intergalactic spaceships. That distant future is reflecting on how it should have learned from the grass, abundant, generous, sustainable. This poem of dystopian magic-realism is more real than magic, offering advice on thriving, while noting the knife-edge of self-destruction so familiar to human behavior.</p><p><strong>Tishani Doshi</strong> was born in the city formerly known as Madras in 1975. She has published seven books of poetry and fiction. Her essays, poems and short stories have been widely anthologized.

      <itunes:duration>00:16:09</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>In a poem considering trees, Jason Allen-Paisant opens up many associations with trees: in a woodland, there’s a dead tree, from which new forms of life are finding sustenance. He, a Black man in the woods, is aware of people looking suspiciously at him. The poem reflects on how trees were used for building the ships of enslavers, who considered countries and people their property. In light of this, he shares a nature poem about all the things that nature holds.</itunes:summary>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In a poem of four stanzas, Margaret Atwood traces bread from its growth in bone-nurtured soil, to the warm ovens of baking, to the table, to the mouth of one person, then the hands of someone breaking bread for many.

Her latest novel, The Testaments, is a co-winner of the 2019 Booker Prize. It is the long-awaited sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale, now an award-winning TV series.

      <title>Esteban Rodríguez — 22 La Bota</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>A poet considers his father, and, particularly, his father’s boots. These boots could be a hammer, a prop, a weapon. But Esteban Rodríguez also remembers how his father — a sleepwalker — would walk outside at night in his underwear, wielding his boots, slapping them against each other in a kind of protective ritual.

      <title>Vievee Francis — How Delicious to Say It</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Building up in lists of delicious words — uvular, hibiscus, loquacious, shuttlecock, dollop, chipotles and chocolate — this poem uses sensual language to make a simple point.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This poem starts off by describing how split the poet — Jónína Kirton — feels between two identities: having both Métis and Icelandic heritage. The poem imagines a bridge between these two places and cultures, and arrives, in the second stanza, at the image of a “living root bridge.”It is in this image that the poem anchors itself: a bridge that is part of the earth, a bridge that lives, that is not torn, but alive and growing. This metaphor speaks to what is possible in a life, and helps Jónína Kirton thrive in the tension she thought would tear her.</p><p><strong>Jónína Kirton </strong>is a Red River Métis/Icelandic poet and a graduate of the Simon Fraser University’s Writer’s Studio where she is currently their BIPOC Auntie supporting and mentoring BIPOC students. In 2016, she received the City of Vancouver’s Mayor’s Arts Award for an Emerging Artist in the Literary Arts category.

      <itunes:summary>Have you ever projected your own awkwardness onto someone else? How did you do it? And how would you address them now?

This poem recalls how, as a young adult, Zaffar Kunial judged his immigrant father’s way of speaking English. A poem that’s filled with adolescence as with awkward parental relationships, it also speaks of his yearning to fit in, to enjoy his own life. Shame features in this poem — the younger poet had been ashamed of his father’s grammar, but now, with time, he seems ashamed to have been that son.</itunes:summary>

This poem considers the posture of the body when writing: writing a letter, writing a note, writing a poem. The poet pays attention to hands — when dancing, when speaking from the heart, in prayer. This poem invites the listener to slow down, to listen to the stories the body is telling by how it&apos;s held in small moments.

      <title>Emily Dickinson — 1383</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Emily Dickinson’s poem “1383” honors the friendships that endure across time, circumstance, and even misunderstanding. Akin to fire, the connections in these friendships may be strong enough to burn or hurt us, but Dickinson acknowledges that their light continues to draw us in regardless.</p><p>After listening, we invite you to reflect on this question: Think about a friendship that has remained steady for you across the years, even as both of you have changed. Why do you think your relationship has endured?</p><p>About the Poet:</p><p>Emily Dickinson was a 19th-century American poet from Amherst, Mass. She wrote around 1,800 poems in her life, and her first collection of poetry was published posthumously in 1890.</p><p>“1383” comes from <i>The Poems of Emily Dickinson</i>, edited by Thomas H. Johnson. Thank you to Harvard University Press, who published the book and gave us permission to use Emily’s poem. Read it on our website at <a href="https://onbeing.org/poetry/1383/">onbeing.org</a>.</p><p>Find the transcript for this episode at <a href="https://onbeing.org/programs/a-poem-for-how-friendship-endures/">onbeing.org</a>.</p><p>The original music in this episode was composed by <a href="https://floatingfast.bandcamp.com/album/music-from-poetry-unbound">Gautam Srikishan</a>.</p>

      <title>Kei Miller — Book of Genesis</title>
