And in the meantime, its stock sells at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of 12, a fraction of the industry average.

This podcast (20:40) challenges Siegel with a bit of the gloom and doom that we’re seeing. The financial analyst concedes that a sober view of markets is justified, but defends the view that the broader economy is progressing. In this interview and in his book, Siegel prefers to light a candle than to curse the darkness.

Hoping to cure investors of their innate credulity, I summon the story of the Witch of Endor, which memorably illustrates the fraudulence of acts of divination.

This podcast (6:36) suggests that clients holding alternative investments or structured notes are likely already exposed to complex derivative strategies, and that advisors should therefore know about the workings of trades like variance swaps that can magnify an already volatile environment.

This podcast (8:15) concurs with Sloan that there is a future in stock-market investing, but investors need to take a different approach to decision making. Investing has returned to becoming a long-term proposition, where due diligence matters, where top-line growth without corporate window-dressing returns to its former importance.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Roll Call reports that the Teamster’s largest fund is headed toward insolvency, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation fund that serves as its backstop is about four years from depletion. CNBC reports a closed Catholic hospital’s nearly 700 former employees may wind up with nothing from its insolvent pension. This podcast (6:51) suggests that people can survive portfolio depletion more easily than the drying up of lifetime income, and that advisors’ income plans must therefore specify how much their clients should save, what they can spend and when they can retire.

We saw an example of that this week, and it’s something investors need to proactively defend against.

This podcast (5:53) argues that we should target a 15 percent rate of savings, since ideal conditions do not exist, and that home ownership, portfolio wealth and longevity insurance all enhance financial resilience.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Collaborative Fund’s Morgan Housel, on his blogpost yesterday, called “Risk is what you don’t see,” tells the story of the punch Houdini didn’t see coming. This podcast (3:46) notes a parallel between the Houdini story and the famous inattentional blindness experiment, in which about 50% of viewers fail to see a gorilla sauntering into the middle of a basketball game. Housel’s point is the risk that matters is the one you don’t see; mine is the only way to defend against such risk is to have a system in place that maintains portfolio stability.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Surveying the past decade, one could say that macro-analysis fell into two camps, one questioning the propriety of the Fed’s balance-sheet expansion, the other saying “Don’t fight the Fed.” The Fedophobes lost big and the Fedophiles won big. But who’s to say that relationship won’t reverse this decade? This podcast (5:38) argues that the problem with macro-analysis is that it’s all too often a binary affair. A better approach, exemplified by Mohamed El-Erian’s recent interview in Investment News, raises good questions, warns of potential dangers and builds in portfolio flexibility.

This podcast (5:06) discusses this intriguing formula, but assumes it wouldn’t work in the U.S. context.

With this conversation starter, the next steps are to determine a path to reach that goal via saving and investing or by paring that standard of living.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Thanksgiving is very much a day celebrating economic success, and as such, is something financial advisors can learn from. I would argue that their thriving when their main hope had been to survive was the source of their jubilation. This podcast (5:06) suggests that advisor’s concrete actions in the realm of wealth management over time take on an intangible quality, in which clients can enjoy wealth and financial stability as a result of the advisor’s influence over many decades.

The moral of the story is thus that we should always be prepared for a downturn – and positioned for an upturn – and not wait for portfolio-manager pronouncements.

      <itunes:summary>DoubleLine bond manager Jeffrey Gundlach tells Switzerland’s Finance and Economy publication that it’s time to prepare for a downturn. This podcast (4:51) credits Gundlach with some astute observations, but notes that he’s issued plenty of doomsday warnings throughout years of the market’s relentless ascent.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Seeking Alpha contributor Ploutos proposes an intriguing approach to timing one’s purchases of gold based on calculating “gold yield,” which cleverly adapts earnings-yield analysis to the yellow metal. This podcast (3:58) argues in favor of using gold yield as a rough guide, but cautions advisors to look out for further validation of this formulation over the coming decades.

I offer my takeaways as to the relevance of Moody’s experience to clients planning their retirements. Specifically, this podcast (5:20) argues that just as we need to allocate our clients’ investment assets properly, clients’ goal-setting requires thought about the ideal allocation of their time and the right balance as to how much wealth will really benefit them.

That period’s historic bull market favored aggressive TDFs, as we’d expect, but the real news is that the defensive portfolio continued to outperform for seven years, from 2007 to 2013. This podcast (4:30) suggests that it is calamitous to measure an individual retirement on the basis of broad-based population statistics. For the real retirees who began their portfolio withdrawals during the years 2007 to 2013, a defensive approach was a lifesaver.

But what advisors can truthfully tell clients is that it’s unrealistic to live your life assuming a turn for the worse will never turn back. They can also remind clients that few people were “in the mood” to invest back in March of 2009.

      <itunes:summary>Today’s anniversary of 9/11, and the discovery of a van loaded with gasoline under the T. Rowe Price offices earlier this week, occasions a “fire drill” of sorts. This podcast (5:24) suggests that advisors will eventually be faced with clients who are doubtful about the future and looking for assurances, i.e., predictions, that advisors cannot give. But what advisors can truthfully tell clients is that it’s unrealistic to live your life assuming a turn for the worse will never turn back. They can also remind clients that few people were “in the mood” to invest back in March of 2009.

Today’s index funds remind Burry of yesterday’s CDOs. In contrast, he likes Japanese small-caps. This podcast (5:13) argues that exiting investment theses from famous investors require extra scrutiny. We find reason to be wary of both of his theses. But even if they have some merit, big shorts and exotic investments are suited to money managers like Burry, not to advisors managing the assets of ordinary investors.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Mexico appears third from last in Seeking Alpha’s list of country ETFs over the past year, above Nigeria and Pakistan, and may be ripe for an upward rotation. Mexico appears to working with the U.S. more effectively than other countries today, and while not cheap on a valuation basis, it is at about half the level of U.S. stocks. This podcast (6:39) argues that it’s fair to expect a volatile series of dips in Mexican stocks over the next year, amidst U.S. elections. A post-election reassertion of U.S.-Mexican commercial ties could make those dips buying opportunities.

UBS postulated a bear market that took 74 months to return to its former high. This podcast (5:45) reports UBS’s calculation that a liquidity strategy keyed to this worst of worst case scenarios did far better than a 100% equity strategy. These numbers should be of interest to anyone who thinks the next bear market might be a big one, and may also suggest a longer liquidity window than most advisors budget for.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Germany’s finance minister has announced that Berlin could make 50 billion euros available for stimulus spending, following an announcement by the Bundesbank concerning recession risks. This podcast (6:06) argues that such an un-German move speaks profoundly to the near universal inhalation of the debt narcotic. When the next crisis occurs, debt will likely be deeply implicated. Advisors should therefore consider an allocation to gold, which is apt to strengthen in a financial crisis, as the only time-tested safeguard against high and rising inflation.

This podcast (5:58) suggests four advisor implications of this current social reality: first, that all is not lost for investors who lack the cash flow at a young age; second, that contemporary economics requires vigilance regarding negative compounding; third, that people need to take maximum advantage of positive economic conditions and prepare for a poor economy ahead of time; and fourth, that accessing the miracle of compounding is facilitated by establishing a reasonable standard of living.

This podcast (6:03) relates some four lessons that advisors can learn, or re-learn, internalize and use to help clients regarding the distinction between gambling and investing; between diversified vs. concentrated risk; the difficulty of analyzing investments; and the hazards of data. We conclude that advisors can act as a restraint on investors who, left alone, can and do end up harming themselves.

In a way, last week’s Fed rate cut has the feel of making an expensive item, stocks, more affordable to the already rich. From these musings come two takeaways for advisors.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In a Morningstar podcast interview, Jonathan Clements of the HumbleDollar website, and formerly of the Wall Street Journal, expressed a dystopic view of what has become of American retirement. He maintains that 60 percent of Americans are not financially in good shape for retirement; and even among the 40 percent who are, some, like his late father, don’t have good retirement experiences. This podcast (6:30) argues this situation cries out for amelioration by America’s financial advisors, through actions to increase solvency of the 60 percent and via pilot retirements for the 40 percent in good financial shape.

He maintains that 60 percent of Americans are not financially in good shape for retirement; and even among the 40 percent who are, some, like his late father, don’t have good retirement experiences. This podcast (6:30) argues this situation cries out for amelioration by America’s financial advisors, through actions to increase solvency of the 60 percent and via pilot retirements for the 40 percent in good financial shape.

They must also understand, and underscore, that life expectancy is as volatile as stock market returns (something I illustrate with a personal example).

According to the Heritage Foundation, 96% of those enrolled in multiemployer plans are in pensions that are less than 60% funded, implying a tidal wave of insolvencies could be looming.This podcast (7:56) argues that advisors would do well to do the opposite of the current irresponsible spirit of the times. In contrast to legislation that would license investing in stocks to bail out an underfunded pension, advisors should build sound pensions that would undergird clients’ riskier ventures in stocks, secure in the knowledge that their basic needs are being met.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The International Monetary Fund’s economists just released their semi-annual  World Economic Outlook, downgrading global growth and world trade projections. This podcast (6:11) argues that advisors managing clients’ money should probably heavily discount economists’ forecasts and market prices alike, and balance portfolios between risk-on and risk-off tendencies on a permanent basis. The IMF outlook cites numerous troubling uncertainties that could shift the direction of markets, but neither the IMF nor Goldman Sachs nor any other organization’s smartest economists know how to time these shifts.

This podcast (5:26) argues that that means that advisors have never been freer to articulate their value proposition. But, at the same time, one lesson of Fidelity’s indexing campaign best not ignored is that part of an advisors’ appeal will depend on fees that seem reasonable to consumers in an increasingly competitive marketplace.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>A reader asks: Do REITs function in an asset allocation as physical real estate does? My answer is no: The research literature indicates a very high correlation of returns between REITs and small-cap value stocks. But this podcast (6:30) “thinks aloud” about ways to import the characteristics of physical real estate into one’s portfolio, without the hardships of being a landlord. While I see no ideal solution, I would look for low-volatilty, income-oriented value investments that play out over a long time period, as physical real estate does.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Retirement savers generally want to know what large “number” they need to fund their retirement. But people live their whole lives based on a monthly income, and it is on the basis of that small number that we can try to arrive at the bigger one. We present an oversimplified method of generating a portfolio goal from one’s income needs. This podcast (5:09) suggests that this back-of-the-envelope calculation is really just a starting place for a much more sophisticated discussion to which financial advisors can add tremendous value.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>A New York Times essay published Tuesday about one man’s unexpected and untimely brush with near death illustrates and strengthens the dangers of overly aggressive asset allocations.

Advisors should preempt those calls by assuring clients they will offer them meat and potatoes, not potato chips. One way to do that would be to customize statements so as to highlight what is truly important.

However, while earning high returns helps secure the Canadian retirement system, the fund’s management should focus on “beating” U.S. Social Security, not the S&amp;P 500. The goal should be solvency, not hedge-fund-like performance.

In contrast to a momentum approach, low-vol stocks’ best relative returns occur during downturns and their worst relative returns during upswings. This podcast (5:09) argues that the type of person who buys a stock because it’s exciting is likely to sell it because it is disappointing, and hence funds alpha for those whose passions are not inflamed by market volatility, i.e., low-vol investors.

Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, is an authority on financial decision making; retirement healthcare; and annuitization. In this interview, Professor Silverman offers three reasons why two similarly situated people would have different financial outcomes. He offers a solution to the classic retirement-saving puzzle – the surprising phenomenon that retirees strongly avoid drawing down their wealth beyond what researchers would expect. His answer to this question also helps to resolve the so-called “annuity puzzle,” wherein consumers shun products that economic theory assumes they would embrace.

The 20-month high in oil inventories should be bearish for oil, but prices are rising because the market weighs tension between the U.S. and Iran more than the current glut. While short-term investors should be eyeing Brent crude oil futures, in the long-term, a Middle East conflict could ratchet up the price consumers pay at the pump and damage the global economy.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You have heard about non-voluntary retirement, but is it something you have made provision for? According to a study of wide scope by ProPublica and The Urban Institute, it appears that somewhere close to 56% of Americans experience this unanticipated job loss after age 50. This means that years assumed to be peak-earning years could end up as years of substantially reduced earnings. Nevertheless, foreknowledge of this trend can help us safeguard our incomes and plan for contingencies.

However, a reader wondered if an annuity purchase would address the “too much cash” problem. I explain how it actually might do so.

But the father of Modern Portfolio Theory, Harry Markowitz, offers a rare upbeat image of investing, through Antonio in Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The popular media’s image of retirement as a period of continuous partying is not reality, nor could it be. Joseph Coughlin, the head of MIT’s Age Lab, observes that today’s two-decade retirements equal about 8,000 days, or one-third of one’s adult life. That unit of time marks completely different eras in an individual’s life. Thinking about how to ideally fill the pages of the final chapter of your life’s story should be an uplifting experience.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The ninth annual survey of boomer retirement preparedness by the Insured Retirement Institute finds that 45% of boomers have zero savings for retirement. That’s not news to most people nowadays, but I share two points I think are. The first was not included in the report, but mentioned in a press call; the second was one interesting statistic. The upshot is that some retirees have resources not reflected in the statistics and that others lacking resources are being quite rational about it. I conclude with the story of a Chilean waterside enclave to underscore the key point I believe this survey brings out.

The question arises as to how parents should financially structure their support: through outright gifts; via formalized loans, as guarantors or as co-borrowers. This podcast also considers the question of how much to give.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>York University Professor Moshe Milevsky, today’s foremost authority on retirement finance, discusses his new book, “Longevity Insurance for a Biological Age,” which provocatively asks: “What if the number of years planet earth has circled the sun with you as a passenger is the wrong metric?” Milevsky thinks chronological age is indeed a poor metric, which distorts one’s work strategy, asset allocation and everything else that in actuality keys off one’s biological age. He says a shift to biological thinking will one day make annuities as “legitimate” as life insurance now is. He recounts his rationale for purchasing a deferred income annuity and the strong negative reaction it induced in others, and explains the difference between investment and insurance, and why both are needed.

The standard advice focusing on portfolio overlap may require unneeded or unwanted portfolio surgery.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The City of San Diego appears to be going through a sort of retirement version of Brexit. Employees hired after the passage of Proposition B in 2012 have been receiving 401(k)-style defined contribution benefits rather than the pensions that earlier hires receive. But the California Supreme Court ruled the ballot measure illegal, and this week, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to get involved. That leaves the city and unions to reconcile a situation complicated by a 2009 agreement to reduce future benefits, meaning workers wouldn’t benefit from a reinstatement of pensions in any event. But the unions see value in guaranteed income, which is precisely the obligation the city wants to avoid.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This is my nonpartisan take on the swelter of tax-hike proposals bubbling up today from Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and more. These politicians have their reasons for their levies, like universal child care, which they counterpose against President Trump’s tax cuts on corporations, which they argue has favored the rich. But the debate glides over the fact that these promises and policy preferences sit on top of a mountain of IOUs that politicians have been accumulating for a generation now. I go through the numbers, and implications.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Nobel Prize winning economist Bill Sharpe has been simulating various income paths through a variety of strategies, including fixed withdrawal rates and annuity approaches. He tells Investment Advisor  magazine that fixed withdrawal approaches, like the 4% rule, are inefficient because you either spend too much and go bust or spend too little and leave more to heirs than you planned. Sharpe thinks annuities increase efficiency, by letting you spend more.

Lincoln achieved financial comfort, and then preserved that wealth through bonds, but his investment approach was based mainly on patriotism rather than an effort to become rich.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>New research by Moshe Milevsky distinguishes between chronological age and biological age. Someone who has lived 60 years may be as fit as a 50-year-old or may be biologically equivalent to a 70-year-old. Thus, the implications for asset allocation and insurance coverage for two people both aged 60 may be very different.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The past two months provided a rare stock-market round trip covering quite a distance in percentage terms, with 9.6% losses in December followed by 8.6% returns in January. If you were among those who sold, the reason was likely the perception that stocks were weakening since October, along with perpetual reminders that the bull market was long in the tooth. But this rationale isn’t relevant to the personal financial plan you should be following, which depends on your age, resources and goals.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>An analysis written for the British bank HSBC nearly a decade ago by economist Karen Ward, called “The World in 2050,” projected how the world economy would appear in 40 years. Ward thought today’s emerging markets would make up 19 of the top 30 economies in 2050, with China rising to the top spot. It seems fair to surmise that HSBC has advocated its clients increase their allocations to emerging markets. My own sense of development economics leads me to favor a selective approach to emerging markets, rather than a broad asset-class approach.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Independent analyst Daniel Amerman ,CFA thinks it naïve to expect inflation-adjusted Social Security payments in perpetuity; nor does he expect the system will go bankrupt; rather, he holds retirees will get paid – just less than before each year out. He says Medicare is not keeping up with inflation and is eating most people’s Social Security check, and higher-income recipients are effectively subsidizing lower-income recipients. This system design biases the claiming decision to no later than age 65. He warns that, because the U.S. national debt is now larger than the U.S. economy, policy makers are using “financial repression,” a policy that is injurious to retirees, to cope with debt.

But it may well be that the easy money has already been made in Big Data.

But its biggest promise lies in its real estate projects, whose revenues are growing slowly. This suggests that Tejon may have a lot of good news ahead of it and most of the bad news behind it.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Shachar Kariv, a decision theorist at U.C. Berkeley and chairman of its economics department, has the unique distinction of relating behavioral economics in a fashion that is relevant to investment decision makers. In other words, it’s not just academic. In this podcast, he answers such questions as what are the key trade-offs we should consider in making investments; what kind of investor should go to a financial advisor; and who is more important – your advisor or your physician?

De-escalation will be neither quick nor easy. Whether this was the intention or not, the hard line against Beijing gives the U.S. instant credibility to carry out tough measures on trade. That makes U.S.-China trade an issue that could prompt an immediate market reaction.

Yet just last week, the president boasted the market had reached a record high, for which he took credit. It seems unwise for the president to intimately entangle himself with stock market performance. Rather, he, Fed chairman Powell and investors alike should concentrate on their jobs, the performance of which is not enhanced by close attention to the stock market.

Indeed, the burden of public policy falls more on Sanders and his colleagues.

That would roughly be akin to your owing $10,000 to somebody, whom you don’t want to pay with funds in your investment account, so you instead borrow on your credit card. The risk that you end up in even worse shape than where you started is not low.

I’m skeptical of Musk’s tweet because the company has not produced any proof of funding over the past 48 hours and because Tesla’s board has given the impression that the idea is far from fully developed.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>A CNBC headline proclaims that the “oil market is ignoring the big Iran story.” Is there something that one analyst CNBC interviewed understands that the oil market does not? To the contrary, the market has correctly figured out what Saudi Arabia’s current interests are, and what Russia’s interests are, and as they go, so will go oil prices for now. Fears of a “nasty” Iranian response to U.S. sanctions, voiced by one analyst, are not relevant to the current oil price trend.

But I wonder if falling fertility is leading to another unwholesome economic trend quietly taking root in our day-to-day lives.
