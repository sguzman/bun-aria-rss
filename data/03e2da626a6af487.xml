			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Some of the most important things I’ve ever done in my life almost didn’t happen. If I’d listened to the voice of fear in my head, and if I’d let my inner critic win, I would never have written any of my books—or launched this podcast! Luckily, I used my spiritual tools to shut down my inner critic. I’ll teach you how to do the same on today’s Big Talk with Mel Robbins. Mel has a simple, surefire technique you can use to stop criticizing yourself for good. </p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">This episode is the self-confidence boost we could all use!

She has an incredible knack for developing methods that will change your life in five seconds flat. Her bestselling book The 5 Second Rule is an international phenomenon.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Some of the most important things I’ve ever done in my life almost didn’t happen. If I’d listened to the voice of fear in my head, and if I’d let my inner critic win, I would never have written any of my books—or launched this podcast! Luckily, I used my spiritual tools to shut down my inner critic. I’ll teach you how to do the same on today’s Big Talk with Mel Robbins. Mel has a simple, surefire technique you can use to stop criticizing yourself for good. </p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">This episode is the self-confidence boost we could all use!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ When I sat down with my honorary brothers Lewis Howes and Jay Shetty—a.k.a. two of the best podcast hosts on Earth—I couldn’t wait to dive into the Big Talk. Vulnerability, lasting love, how to find your purpose in life, sex, career, regrets …. we tackled them all.    <p>We dove right into big, beautiful topics, and we held nothing back. When the Big Talk started flowing, I never wanted it to stop.  On today’s Big Talk, we explore:</p> <ul> <li>How to deepen your conversational skills for more meaningful connections</li> <li>What it means to be an active listener</li> <li>How to attract the right romantic partner into your life (and why you might attracting Mr. or Ms. Wrong)</li> <li>How to view vulnerability as a loving exchange</li> <li>The key to a long-lasting relationship</li> <li>How to cope with being an extrovert in these isolating times</li> </ul> This Big Talk is packed with so many amazing life lessons, and they’re guaranteed to enhance your closest relationships.     RESOURCES: The following are helpful resources and books I mention within the episode:  ABOUT JAY Jay Shetty is a former monk, a transformational life coach, and host of the On Purpose podcast. He’s also the author of <em>Think Like a Monk</em>, and the co-creator of my favorite new beverage, Sama tea. <em>Think Like a Monk</em>: <a href= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://amzn.to/2XD2Mmv&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1634916975930000&usg=AOvVaw0ftXBjm8iJ0zSdnsbG0IKW" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://amzn.to/2XD2Mmv</a> On Purpose podcast: <a href= "https://jayshetty.me/podcast/">https://jayshetty.me/podcast/</a>  Sama tea: <a href= "https://www.samatea.com/">https://www.samatea.com/</a>  Sama tea is an adaptogenic tea brand launched by Jay and Radhi Shetty.

He’s just the most beautiful soul, and I’m honored to share him with you today. </p> <p dir="ltr"> </p> <p dir="ltr">MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES</p> <p dir="ltr">I believe the foundation of addiction treatment really is through therapy, through a connection to a higher power, and through modalities and practices like these. </p> <ol> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href= "https://ifs-institute.com/">IFS Therapy</a>: <a href= "https://ifs-institute.com/">https://ifs-institute.com</a></p> </li> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Learn more about IFS Therapy on the <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dear-gabby/id1561694805?i=1000532780139"> Dick Schwartz Dear Gabby episode</a></p> </li> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href= "https://www.thebowencenter.org/introduction-eight-concepts">Family Therapy</a>: <a href= "https://www.thebowencenter.org/introduction-eight-concepts">https://www.thebowencenter.org/introduction-eight-concepts</a></p> </li> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href= "https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral"> Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</a>: <a href= "https://www.apa.org/">https://www.apa.org/</a></p> </li> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href= "https://www.aa.org/">AA</a>: <a href= "https://www.aa.org/">https://www.aa.org</a></p> </li> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href= "https://www.intherooms.com/home/">In the Rooms</a>: <a href= "https://www.intherooms.com/home/">https://www.intherooms.com/home/</a></p> </li> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href= "https://bit.ly/3C8VZ2M">Safety, Recovery and Mental Health Resources</a>: <a href= "https://bit.ly/3C8VZ2M">https://bit.ly/3C8VZ2M</a></p> </li> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href= "https://bit.ly/3zbKOnS">Mental Health Resources and My Story of Recovery from Postpartum Anxiety and Depression</a>: <a href= "https://bit.ly/3zbKOnS">https://bit.ly/3zbKOnS</a></p> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr">BOOKS AND CARDS</p> <ul> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href= "https://amzn.to/3a0nPln">Super Attractor</a> : <a href= "https://amzn.to/3a0nPln">https://amzn.to/3a0nPln</a></p> </li> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href= "https://bit.ly/2XhisMr">Card Decks</a> : <a href= "https://bit.ly/2XhisMr">https://bit.ly/2XhisMr</a></p> </li> </ul>  <p dir="ltr">MIRACLE MEMBERSHIP</p> <p dir="ltr">Want even more support?

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;">This episode of Dear Gabby BIG TALK is incredibly transformational! I sat down with Dr. Richard Schwartz, founder of Internal Family Systems therapy (IFS). This therapeutic practice has changed my life. IFS has helped me heal from trauma, brought me back to inner safety, and radically improved my relationships with others and myself. I’m so psyched for you to learn about it here!<br /> <br /> You’ll learn:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;">An introduction to IFS</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;">How to explore SELF in your own life</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;">The 3 types of parts we all have</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;">Why we are so reactive when we’re triggered</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;">Why we sometimes turn to addictive behavior</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;">The intersection between IFS and spirituality</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;">What it means when we spiritually bypass</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;">And ... stick around to the end of the episode! We finish our conversation with Richard walking us through an amazing meditation. He guides all of our parts into an open space where healing can begin.
