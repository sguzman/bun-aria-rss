<title>Labor Market May Remain Tight until Labor Demand Cools Further</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkeb/94950</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[U.S. labor demand—measured by job openings or vacancies—has started to cool but is still elevated compared with pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, labor supply—measured by the labor force participation rate remains below pre-pandemic levels. This weakness in the labor force participation rate may persist, as it reflects lower participation among older individuals. Accordingly, the imbalance between demand and supply in the labor market may continue until labor demand cools further.]]>

<title>Promoting Payment Inclusion in the United States</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkpb/94900</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[In recent decades, entities in both the public and private sectors have worked to promote payment inclusion in the United States, whether by expanding the supply of transaction accounts or boosting consumer demand for them. However, more research and data collection are needed to better define and measure payment inclusion as well as evaluate how effective efforts have been to improve it.]]>

<title>Marijuana Industry Has Boosted Economic Activity in the Tenth Federal Reserve District</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkeb/94895</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[Since Colorado became the first state to open recreational marijuana stores in January 2014, the marijuana industry has expanded across the nation and to other states in the Tenth Federal Reserve District, including Missouri, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Within the Tenth District, this expansion has increased commercial real estate demand and tax revenues and created jobs, but has also presented challenges for the industry and local communities.]]>

<title>Hybrid Working, Commuting Time, and the Coming Long-Term Boom in Home Construction</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedker/94859</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[The long commuting times from outer suburbs to the central business districts of large metropolitan areas have depressed single-family home construction over the last two decades. The shift to hybrid working during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, has reduced the time many people spend commuting and potentially increased their willingness to live farther from employers. Lightly settled land at the peripheries of metropolitan areas may become more desirable for development, relaxing a long-standing constraint on single-family home construction.
In this article, Jordan Rappaport estimates the statistical relationship between single-family home construction and commute duration, finding a significant negative correlation across the largest U.S. metropolitan areas. Across metropolitan areas with a population of at least 1 million in 2020, the time employees save commuting from outer suburbs to central business districts by working remotely two days a week ranges from 130 to 406 hours per year. These results suggest that in the long run, the time savings from fewer commutes could almost double single-family home construction in these metropolitan areas from its level just prior to the pandemic, an aggregate increase of 427,000 units per year. The largest metropolitan areas are likely to see an especially strong boost.]]>

<title>Immigration Disruptions and the Wages of Unskilled Labor in the 1920s</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkrw/94842/original</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[An era of mass immigration into the United States ended with the onset of World War I in Europe, followed by the passage of restrictive immigration laws in 1921 and 1924. We analyze various sources of wage data collected in the 1910-1929 period to explore the impact of this significant disruption of the flow of immigration on the wages of unskilled labor. Our approach to identification entails examining differences in wages across local labor markets and industries differentially exposed to the disruptions in immigration due to different ethnic compositions of
their immigrant populations in the pre-war era. We find evidence strongly suggesting that during the 1920s, industries and regions more affected by the disruptions in immigration experienced larger reductions in flows of immigrants that resulted in increased wages of unskilled labor.]]>

<title>Commodity Prices Have Limited Influence on U.S. Food Inflation</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkeb/94818</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[Food prices increased at the fastest pace in more than two decades from July 2021 to July 2022. We show that this increase has not been driven by commodity prices but by an increase in consumer spending on food at home and increases in costs along the supply chain. Our results suggest that food inflation could ease if consumers shift more purchases back to food service establishments and if costs in food processing and marketing abate. Conversely, food inflation could remain high if broader measures of inflation persist.]]>

<title>Data Aggregators: The Connective Tissue for Open Banking</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkpb/94776</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[Open banking, which allows third-party financial apps to access consumer financial data electronically and
securely, relies on data aggregators to establish connections with consumers’ financial institutions and extract consumer data. Data aggregators are critical to enhancing consumer financial services and increasing competition—both among financial service providers and across payment methods. However, their role raises some concerns related to data security, data privacy, and competition.]]>

<title>Price Pressures for U.S. Exporters and a Strong Dollar Have Increased Inflation in Foreign Countries</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkeb/94775</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[As the higher demand for imported goods during the pandemic has moderated, U.S. export prices have become an important factor in determining inflationary pressures from the United States. As of 2022:Q2, export prices increased by 11.8 percent annualized, far exceeding the historical average of 3.75 percent. Further, 58 percent of the increase in export prices can be attributed to the recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar, while the remaining 42 percent can be attributed to price pressures for U.S. exporters.]]>

<title>Recent Appreciation in the U.S. Dollar Unlikely to Have Large Effect on Domestic Inflation</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkeb/94773</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[The U.S. dollar has appreciated more than 8.5 percent since May 2021, raising questions about potential effects on domestic inflation. If imports are billed in foreign currencies, then a strong dollar could reduce import prices and therefore domestic inflation. However, U.S. imports are almost entirely invoiced in U.S. dollars, dampening this effect. We find that the recent appreciation in the U.S. dollar has a negligible effect on domestic inflation as measured by the core price index for personal consumption expenditures.]]>

<title>A Slowdown in Job Vacancies Is Likely to Coincide with Higher Unemployment and Slower Wage Growth</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkeb/94772</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[Recently, some market observers have proposed that job vacancies could decline, and ease wage growth, without a commensurate increase in the unemployment rate. However, we find that the typical relationship of declining job vacancies and higher unemployment holds even at exceptionally low levels of the unemployment rate. A notable decline in job postings will likely coincide with an easing of tightness in the labor market, a higher unemployment rate, and slowing wage growth.]]>

<title>Government Assistance and Moral Hazard: Evidence from the Savings and Loan Crisis</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedker/94766</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[When regulators intervene to rescue failing financial institutions, they may lead banks to expect future assistance and increase their risk-taking. To avoid incentivizing risky behavior, regulators often try to signal that they will not assist banks in a future crisis. Regulations passed during the savings and loan (S&L) crisis in the 1980s provide a rare example of policies that in fact discouraged risk-taking. After a wave of S&L failures, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) liquidated or sold some failed S&Ls but assisted others to keep them in operation. In 1989, however, the FSLIC closed. A new regulatory agency was prohibited from assisting failed institutions, which signaled the suspension of future assistance.

Padma Sharma examines how suspending assistance to failed S&Ls in 1989 affected the balance sheets of operational S&Ls. She finds that S&Ls responded to the change in policy differently depending on ownership structure: stock S&Ls increased their composition of safe assets relative to mutual S&Ls. If government assistance had remained feasible, stock S&Ls likely would have continued taking risks, lending an additional $2.14 billion and reducing their holdings of securities by $4.5 billion. In contrast, mutual S&Ls did not engage in excessive risk-taking even when government assistance was feasible, so they had little incentive to further reduce risk-taking when assistance was suspended.]]>

<title>Leaning Against the Data: Policymaker Communications under State-Based Forward Guidance</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkrw/94764/original</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[A purported benefit of state-based forward guidance is that the private sector adjusts the expected stance of policy without further policymaker communications. This assumes a shared understanding of how policymakers are interpreting the data and that policymakers are consistent in their assessment of the data. Using text
analysis, we test whether the FOMC’s introduction of state-based forward guidance in December 2012 changed the tone of policymaker communications. We find that policymakers tended to downplay positive data following the introduction of the guidance, in effect leaning against the data and reinforcing the dependence of policy
expectations on policymaker communications.]]>

<title>Downward Wage Rigidities and Recession Dynamics in Advanced and Emerging Economies*</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkrw/94763/original</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[Downward wage rigidity limits the downward adjustment of wages, especially during recessions. Although macroeconomic models generally suggest that wage rigidity exacerbates employment losses and generates asymmetric business cycles, direct empirical evidence is scarce. In this paper, we construct a data set covering 53
countries, including both emerging markets and advanced economies, to measure and compare downward real wage rigidities across countries. We find that wage rigidities are widespread, but overall higher in emerging markets. We provide empirical evidence that countries with higher downward wage rigidities are subject to more sizable
contractions in employment and real GDP per capita during recessions. Finally, we show that our downward wage rigidity measure is closely related to minimum wage growth and de jure labor-market rigidity measures but has very different effects from labor unions on employment during recessions.]]>

<title>Credit Guarantee and Fiscal Costs</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkrw/94752/original</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[This paper studies the effectiveness of government-backed credit guarantees to the infrastructure sector, a policy tool adopted by a range of countries during recessions. We propose
a two-sector model with financial intermediary frictions so that infrastructure producers rely
on bank loans to finance their risky production. Governments can intervene in the credit market by providing a partial guarantee on those bank loans. We find that a credit guarantee
increases infrastructure production, leading to a high fiscal multiplier in the longer run. In the
near term, however, higher wages in the infrastructure sector crowd out labor supply in the
private sector, dampening economic activity. Importantly, the higher leverage associated with
credit expansion raises non-performing loans, and this channel is particularly pronounced if the
government-backed credit guarantee lingers for a long period of time.]]>

<title>Foreign Reserve Management and U.S. Money Market Liquidity: A Cost of Exorbitant Privilege</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkrw/94751/original</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[We show theoretically and empirically that the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency
can lead to economically significant changes in U.S. money market liquidity. We develop a
model in which U.S. money market spreads respond to foreign central banks’ exchange-rate
management decisions. Foreign central banks remove liquidity from U.S. money markets and
cause spreads to widen by selling Treasuries to supply liquidity to their financial systems.
Our analysis focuses on the major oil exporting countries with fixed exchange rates because
their foreign-exchange market interventions are straightforward to characterize. Our regression analysis shows that shifts in the central banks’ demand for dollar liquidity related to oil
price volatility are associated with significantly higher overnight spreads in domestic money
markets. A one-standard deviation increase in the demand for dollar liquidity by a central
bank in an oil-exporting country leads, on average, to three billion dollars of Treasury sales
and a two to six basis point increase in U.S. money market spreads. At the same time, deposits
held with the Federal Reserve increase in response to this higher oil-price volatility, which is
consistent with the model’s predictions. This evidence indicates that the widespread use of the
U.S. dollar as a reserve currency acts as a channel that can propagate funding shocks from the
rest of the world to the United States.]]>

<title>Attention Allocation and Heterogenous Consumption Responses</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkrw/94568/original</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[Recessions often have detrimental effects on both employment and equity returns, forcing
individuals to make decisions about how to balance risks to their labor and capital income.
In this paper, we study how individuals allocate their limited attention between capital income and labor income risks in a two-period consumption-saving model with recursive utility.
Specifically, we examine how the optimal attention and consumption-saving decisions are influenced by individuals’ attention capacity, wealth endowments, income risks, and preferences
for risk and time. We show that our model can generate results that are consistent with several novel facts regarding how differences in individuals’ wealth levels and beliefs about their
unemployment risks influenced their consumption during the Great Recession. Furthermore,
we find that the welfare loss due to limited attention is significantly larger for households with
lower wealth; allowing these households to flexibly allocate their attention can significantly
reduce this welfare loss.]]>

<title>The Supply and Demand of Agricultural Loans</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkrw/94521/original</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[Credit plays a critical role in the agricultural sector, but many studies suggest that farmers are credit constrained. We examine the degree to which changes in non-real-estate agricultural loans at commercial banks are driven by changes in supply and demand, using information provided by agricultural lending surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and Minneapolis. Building on recent studies of loan officer opinion surveys, we estimate the changes in agricultural loan supply and demand using an unbalanced panel of 1,024 banks across 191 quarters (2002:Q1–2021:Q2). The survey responses provide instruments of “pure” supply and demand changes that allow us to examine fluctuations in bank-level agricultural loan volumes. We find that changes in the volume of non-real-estate farm loans at commercial banks are principally driven by changes in excess demand for loans. In addition, we demonstrate that excess loan demand is countercyclical to aggregate farm income.]]>

<title>Cutting-Edge Methods Did Not Improve Inflation Forecasting during the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[Amaze Lusompa and Sai A. Sattiraju investigate whether innovations in time-varying parameter models led to improved inflation forecasting during the pandemic. They find that despite their promise prior to the pandemic, forecasting innovations did not improve the accuracy of inflation forecasts relative to a baseline time-varying parameter model during the pandemic. Their results suggest that forecasters may need to develop a new class of forecasting models, introduce new forecasting variables, or rethink how they forecast to yield more effective inflation forecasts during extreme events.]]>

<title>Increased Loan Demand and Higher Interest Rates May Benefit Ag Banks</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[Extreme weather, geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates all directly affect
U.S. agriculture, which may in turn affect banks that make agricultural loans. Demand for loans from ag
banks could rise following events that reduce net farm income or increase banks’ ability to reprice loans,
such as supply chain disruptions or higher interest rates. But competition with other banks and nonbank
financial institutions may offset some of these benefits.]]>

pressures were fully under control. Although policymakers in both the 1970s and today have faced
extraordinary challenges, future perceptions of current policy will likely be defined primarily by the
outcome of the Committee’s attempts to curb inflation, rather than the circumstances surrounding it.]]>

<title>Evaluating Quantitative Easing: The Importance of Accounting for Forward Guidance</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedker/94422</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[During the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, policymakers used large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) along with forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate to help stabilize financial markets. However, policymakers and economists have yet to reach a consensus on the efficacy of LSAPs in providing accommodation and improving macroeconomic outcomes. Because announced changes in LSAPs often coincide with changes in forward guidance, the market responses to these two tools can be difficult to disentangle and each tool’s efficacy challenging to evaluate.

Brent Bundick and A. Lee Smith attempt to measure the efficacy of the FOMC’s previous asset purchase programs during the Great Recession while explicitly accounting for changes in forward guidance. They find that controlling for concurrent changes in forward guidance implies a roughly 25 percent reduction in the accommodative effects of the FOMC’s first two asset purchase programs relative to estimates that do not disentangle the two tools. The effects of an asset purchase program could thus be overstated if researchers fail to account for changes in interest rate uncertainty induced by forward guidance occurring at the same time.]]>

<title>Disagreement among Households May Foreshadow a Rise in Inflation Expectations</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkeb/94410</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[Households’ expectations about future inflation can influence realized inflation, so many policymakers
track median household inflation expectations. However, the median changes slowly if households learn
about economic fundamentals gradually. A widening distribution of household inflation expectations may
foreshadow an increase in the median. During 2021, for example, disagreement about inflation
expectations rose months before the median increased appreciably.]]>

<title>Assessing the Case for Retail CBDCs: Central Banks’ Considerations</title>
<link>https://fedinprint.org/item/fedkpb/94353</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[Many central banks around the world have been researching, experimenting, or developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Although central banks in several emerging markets and developing economies have implemented or plan to implement a general-purpose, or retail, CBDC to promote financial inclusion and improve their payment systems, central banks in many advanced economies have not yet found a compelling case for a retail CBDC.]]>
