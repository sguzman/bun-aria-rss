            <description><![CDATA[<p>Parenting isn't easy, and Rachel Jankovic's "Sir Badalot and the Cranky Danky Dragon" gives parents the tools to talk with their fat-faced toddlers about emotional self-control. Most parents do that by resorting to the poor parenting tactics of 1) emotional distraction, and 2) emotional reaction. Turns out, your child's response to a "fussy dragon" should include actually pretending to kill it! But the self-control vitamins are not why Sir Badalot is a good book -- that's just an added benefit. The SASF guys host Rachel Jankovic to talk through this parenting advice and how her fun new book, illustrated by Hello Ninja's own Forrest Dickision, is really just a fresh chocolate cookie for a hungry child. (Oh, and you'll also get a nice long stretch of Nate's dark take on relying on real-life vs fictional friends.)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode juxtaposes abortion and hospitality. We live in a post-Roe v. Wade world -- can we apply those lessons to storytelling now? How do evangelicals do with that cultural fight? Does fiction have a place in it? (Not the way you probably mean it.) The guys dig deeper into the themes of Episode 90, exploring the meaning of "proof" and poor ways of obligating belief. Familiar SASF themes emerge in this episode -- specifically, the importance of a good meal outweighing the value of "good" propaganda. Comparisons between October Baby and Juno are made. And you'll get to hear about grandmothers and the random acts of kindness that inspire the next generation more than all the political sloganeering in the world.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A listener writes in to find out why, as a pastor's kid, Nate uses expletives like "hell" and "damn" in Notes from the Tilt-a-Whirl. (Shh, don't mention that Nate has written worse.) This leads to a discussion of the sliding scale of bad words -- truth is, no word is bad intrinsically. Seriously: a word's badness or goodness is dependent on how it's used -- on its place in the STORY. (This is SASF, people, you should have seen that coming.) Or, if you prefer to look at it this way, EVERY word is bad -- if used in a way God wouldn't. This naturally leads into a discussion of the nature of evil. Brian tries to lump Nate in with Augustine. Nate resists: Evil is not black goo you can add to things! And so this episode goes.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Here's an interesting truth that Nate once tried out on his roommate: pure, syllogistic reasoning is not persuasive. In fact, unvarnished truth does not "prove" anything -- by that we mean that it does not obligate belief as well as, say, story might. And you'll notice that people seldom believe the things they do for logical reasons: they come to their beliefs by narrative paths, and construct the logic to defend as needed. So, what does it mean to "obligate belief"? When is truth not persuasive? Why are Christians the one who often need to hear this most? These and other rhetorical intricacies occupy this episode of SASF.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Is a book with a good witch a bad book? The guys use the Wizard of Oz as a jumping off point for this lengthy discussion of magic, which listeners know is a favorite SASF hobbyhorse.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Episode ocho-ocho is about narrative architecture, but that sounds boring so we made the headline more interesting, having been inspired by one of SASF's favorite novels, Evangellyfish. In point of fact, though, this week's episode is fantastic: The guys get into a discussion of favorite (living) novelists, with disagreements aplenty. If you've been looking for novel recommendations for adults, this is the episode for you. And when the guys move into film, and how to structure new stories based on old ones that work, you'll just have to listen to get Nate's take on Terrence Malik... Nipples on the Batsuit and jumping the shark are also discussed. Oh, and Nate loops back around to tie a bow on his disappointment with the end of Cobra Kai.</p>

Then, in a shocking turn of events, one of the guys is accused of being too critical of a film--and the critical one is Brian. Nate defends the honor of Top Gun 2, and even a bit of Cobra Kai (always with filters, people). They get into a discussion of character and when you can allow bad things to happen to main characters. They venture far afield in this SASF medley -- perhaps they were just relieved to not be watching Rings of Power.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Nate explains why some Christian readers are the worst: they love to demand that he sell chicken sandwiches with a side of Gideon Bible in the french-fry box. But Nate's trying to sell the best chicken sandwich &amp; fries he can... he gives away Bibles elsewhere, including in this podcast. This episode is about when / why you might choose to have your characters in fiction pray -- and when you might not. You'll also get some key insights into rhetoric: who are you, who are you writing for, and where do you want to get them. And also some really interesting thoughts comparing Nate's characters to those in the Christian movie "The War Room" (about prayer).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The guys dig deep into this Coen Bros Academy Award Winner. Is it worth the hype? Watch it and find out. We're sure you'll get that cozy family movie night feeling as Brian and Nate discuss brutal stun gun executions and drug money chasing. They'll also answer your key question about the film, and discuss what Josh Brolin's character is up to in "No Country for Old Men." Spoilers included: Fundamentally, the movie is about the clash of two villains: the romantic, old-school outlaw and the new, pitiless vice of Chigurh. You can also hear what two small things Nate would have changed in this movie -- which is high up on his list. As a bonus, they'll discuss the danger of thinking you're so smart when watching a movie, and then proceed to fall into the trap. (Brian manfully restrained from bringing WB Yeats into the conversation.)</p>

In today's SASF, the guys discuss how a mom can help her children with their own "character" weaknesses.

But the real takeaways from this episode is 1) where to get the best breakfast burritos in the the Pacific Northwest; 2) stop trying to make life easy for your kids; and 3) be a killer side character in your kids' stories instead.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Taking revenge has been the subject of many different TV shows, and -- no surprise -- as soul food, it can be well-cooked or very bland. Both Nate and Brian started a vengeance show which is getting tons of positive reviews from conservatives: The Terminal List -- which falls flat on its face right out of the gates because there's not a single real human in the show. And of course the entire T-List doesn't even handle the theme vengeance as well as those four seconds from The Patriot....or Fantastic Mr. Fox. This leads into a discussion of what Nate claims is perhaps the best pilot in TV history: "Lost" episodes 1 &amp; 2. Yes, that and the Rings of Power trailer (just kidding, we're just checking to see if anyone is still reading).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Another delightful episode of SASF is here for you as Nate and Brian discuss the dustup from two previous episodes, focusing mostly on artistic temperament and motivation gone bad. But first, Brian decides what we need is not less but MORE of Nate's unvarnished opinions, and the guys head into a discussion of a book idea found on Twitter, and how to make a good pitch. You get a sneak peek at an upcoming Nate project as well... Also, if you have a question the guys would want to discuss, please send it in! The question tank could use a top-up, and that's not cheap here in Biden's America. Enjoy! And don't forget, if you prefer video, that's streaming only on Canon+.</p>

Follow the story beginning with Jim's childhood as a Nebraska farm kid "tricking" his teachers and working in stockyards, to his Navy years wooing a missionary lady eight years older than him who was absolutely not interested, to the intermission of the Korean War, to the move to Idaho and his life's work of giving books away (leading in part to you all sitting here listening). RIP, Grandpa Jim!</p>]]></description>

Dave Radford of The Gray Havens comes on #SASF to ask the guys questions about how, precisely, one teaches children (and yourself!) how to watch movies. BUT FIRST, Dave criticizes the SASF soundtrack -- and as one of Nate's favorite songwriters, his complaints carry weight -- and the SASF pod makes an exciting new acquisition. Then the guys discuss the dangers of ruining the moment by watching movies like a worldview robot: the point is to ENJOY it together. That's what parents are for, after all. Lots of practical movie night recommendations, too. And remember, for a few weeks or so, SASF listeners can get a free month of Canon+ for 99 cents (first-time subscribers only).<br />#SASF #StoriesAreSoulFood #NDWilson #movienight #family</p>]]></description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Get ready for a practical-advice episode about training your kids how to watch movies together. Dave Radford of The Gray Havens comes on #SASF to ask the guys questions about how, precisely, one teaches children (and yourself!) how to watch movies. BUT FIRST, Dave criticizes the SASF soundtrack -- and as one of Nate's favorite songwriters, his complaints carry weight -- and the SASF pod makes an exciting new acquisition. Then the guys discuss the dangers of ruining the moment by watching movies like a worldview robot: the point is to ENJOY it together. That's what parents are for, after all.

And all of human history since Christ's birth has happened in the glow of the first Christmas. - Every December is an opportunity to show your kids how the obscure parts of the Bible are about Jesus. - And that leads us to... the awful, gruesome story of the Levite and his murdered concubine. We'll leave the explanation to ND, but GET READY for an epic Christmas rant. #SASF #StoriesAreSoulFood #NDWilson #Christmas #Advent Check out God Rest Ye Merry: https://canonpress.com/products/god-rest-ye-merry/ ]]></itunes:summary>
