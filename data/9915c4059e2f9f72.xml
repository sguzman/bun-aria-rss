			<description><![CDATA[<p>Season 2 - Episode 9</p> <p>This week, Team Deakins is so happy to invite documentary filmmaker Alex Pritz (THE TERRITORY, MY DEAR KYRGYSTAN) to join us for a wide ranging conversation. Alex explains to us how his background in science spurred him into filmmaking, and still drives the larger questions his films attempt to ask. We also discuss the moral issues raised by documenting real life events - and perhaps more importantly, real people. And then we get into the importance of being 100 percent honest in grappling with those issues. Eventually, the conversation turns to a field we know almost too much about: how to maintain a healthy work/life balance when your spouse is also in the business!</p>]]></description>

He explains why some of the hardest work for the props team involve eating, drinking, and smoking scenes. We talk about the different kinds of acting styles that relate to props, and why some actors latch onto them, while others seem to dismiss them out of hand.

In this episode, we discuss what taking stills gives to Roger that film does not, how he enjoys observing things and places, how there is no pressure to shoot anything specific, what he likes to take images of, and why he prefers to shoot in black and white. We talk about his time shooting for the Beaford Archive and developing his eye. He likes dedicating his day to shooting on his stills camera and he only takes iPhone photographs when he’s fishing. We discuss our incredible and collaborative experience working with Damiani, the publishers of BYWAYS.</p> <p>IMAGES WE DISCUSSED: The Joy of Flight (72), Budapest Runners (116), and Lightning Strikes (131)</p>]]></description>

Sturla talks about shooting Songs for Alexis, his first documentary film, and explains what Scandinavian Folk high schools are. He tells us that he didn’t show his work to the outside world until his final year at the National Film School of Denmark, which dared him to fail and allowed him to focus on developing his artistic sensibility. Together we discuss Victoria and how they decided to shoot it in real-time without cuts, working with harsh weather conditions while filming Rams, and Sturla’s visual inspiration for Heartstone. Sturla also tells about his experience working with Thomas Vinterberg (Episode 101) on his film, Another Round.

He walks us through designing the sound for the war rig in MAD MAX: FURY ROAD as well as his close collaboration with director Denis Villeneuve on BLADE RUNNER 2049, and Tom Holkenborg on BLACK MASS. We discuss how Mark decides when to use a music cue or sound effect cue, how you can earn loud sounds by buying silence early on in a film, and the creative necessity and financial incentive to capture production sound on set instead of recreating it in post.

We learn that Peter started shooting at a very young age and was printing images in the darkroom at the age of 6! Peter tells us stories from working with the great directors John Boorman, Peter Watkins and David Cronenberg. Peter tells us about interviewing with George Lucas for Star Wars, why he hadn’t seen a single one of Cronenberg’s films before his interview for Dead Ringers, and his collaborations with Peter Watkins. Peter believes it is easy to fall into formulaic filmmaking if you work too much, and to him that is the enemy of creativity.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>EPISODE 155- KEN LOACH & BARRY ACKROYD - Director & Cinematographer</p> <p>Team Deakins speaks with director Ken Loach and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd (THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY, SWEET SIXTEEN, CARLA’S SONG, LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD) in this episode. Barry (Episode 70) and Ken share memories from their many collaborations together and Ken is very open with us about his process. He tells us that the most important thing that the director has is the actor’s instincts. We learn what Ken looks for when casting his movies, why he shoots in sequence, what he looks for in a crew, what his rehearsal processes are like, and how everyone rides in the same minibus on his sets because he and his crew are one team. We learn how Ken’s experience at the BBC shaped his approach to filmmaking and why he didn’t go into politics. Ken tells Barry why he asked him to shoot Riff-Raff and how he believes Barry has a great skill for finding natural movement from a camera on legs and how it suited their collective ideas. Don’t miss it!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>EPISODE 154- JOHN SEALE - Cinematographer</p> <p>Team Deakins speaks with cinematographer John Seale (MAX MAD: FURY ROAD, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, RAIN MAN, DEAD POET’S SOCIETY) in this episode. John shares stories from his time working with director Peter Weir, Anthony Minghella, Sydney Pollack, and George Miller. We discuss camera operating at length– how much John loves operating and believes it to be the most fulfilling job on set, how it is instinctive and how the position of the cameraman can be very important. John talks about the toughest challenge he and his crew faced during the production of The Perfect Storm as well as his experience working with natural daylight while shooting THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY. We discuss the “imperceptible zoom” and the “what if system” and how shooting with multiple cameras can allow an editor to cut for performance rather than continuity. We laugh a lot on this episode, tune in!</p>]]></description>

We talk about his (and Roger’s) beginnings in music videos and his experiences working with both Tony and Ridley Scott. He tells us he learned to light 360 degrees while working with Tony. We learn a lot of his method of working with Ridley - how Ridley is not afraid of silhouettes and how he likes to draw the movie as a way of thinking and focusing. He shares his experiences on NEWS OF THE WORLD and well as PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. We also talk about the VFX on PIRATES and the experience of shooting movie 2 and 3 at the same time! He tells us his philosophy is not to control everything and even shares a few stories about Conrad Hall (what’s an episode without mentioning Connie?). A fun and insightful episode! <span class= "Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>]]></description>

Matyas has shot in the US, UK and Hungary and says he doesn’t feel there is much difference in his work wherever he works. He shares that he feels it is soul crushing to take a project just for the money if it is something you don’t connect with. He also goes into detail about his collaboration with Lazlo Nemes (SON OF SAUL, SUNSET) (Episode 113 of Team Deakins) and how they began thinking they would shoot SON OF SAUL on Steadicam but how and why changed their minds. He also shares how they chose lenses with the guiding core idea of using the limitation of visual information by focus. And we learned how he and Lazlo approached their next collaboration on the film SUNSET differently. A great conversation with a talented cinematographer!</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: Son of Saul</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>EPISODE 147 - DONALD BURT - Production Designer</p> <p>Team Deakins delves into the craft of production design with the great production designer, Donald Burt (THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, HOSTILES, MANK). We loved hearing about his path to the film business! We talk about his first movie as production designer, JOY LUCK CLUB - quite a film to start on! He shares his methods of working with a director and how he doesn’t want to draw attention to what he is doing and that he wants to be supportive and serve the story first.

We loved hearing about his path to the film business! We talk about his first movie as production designer, JOY LUCK CLUB - quite a film to start on! He shares his methods of working with a director and how he doesn’t want to draw attention to what he is doing and that he wants to be supportive and serve the story first.

She thinks that if a scene doesn’t work on screen, it wasn’t written correctly. Krysty discusses the core tenants of good screenwriting and goes into detail about the importance of collaboration with the director. She admits to stealing the experiences of people around her and not considering the budget when she writes.

He speaks about his experiences working with Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, on Amelie and Delicatessen, respectively. We learn about how he achieved the look on Amelie and how, in France, it was the first film to involve a DI, and how the digital workflow has changed. When he chooses a project, he is not looking for the challenges as much as discovering the director’s vision and figuring out how to implement that. He also shares his experiences with working director Tim Burton. We speak of how he prepares his lighting and the importance of determining what you really need on a shoot and hearing what it is that production needs. It’s not about compromise but about finding the right method. And, of course, we speak about The Darkest Hour and the look. Not an episode to miss!</p>]]></description>

Alex shares how he gave his characters cameras during the filming of Toto and his Sisters which allowed him access to special, intimate footage that would not have been possible with him in the room. He also speaks of how a project gets set up and his desire to direct fiction now.

We also break down the challenges of the film 1917 and how they met them. They share how much they had to learn about trenches, how they created them, and reconstruct the original land when the film ended. We also talk about using models on 1917 and why they were so helpful. They also share the way the night town set was envisioned and built. It’s a wonderful examination of the role of the art department in filmmaking as they give specific examples of the issues they face and then solve.</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: 1917</p>]]></description>

A great insight into the world of editing!</p>]]></content:encoded>

We start by talking about what the special effects department covers and how it varies per film. We talk about the challenges of creating atmosphere and how he approached that on Blade Runner 2049. Specifically, we examine the differences in using mist or smoke for the atmosphere. Of course, we discuss what is covered by SFX and VFX and how this is determined. We go into detail on the challenges that the sea wall sequence in Blade Runner 2049 offered. Gerd also shares details of the effects on the film, The Girl in the Spiderweb and he tells us how important planning is and knowing what the camera position will be for his work. A really great conversation with a special effects master!</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: The Girl in the Spiderweb, Blade Runner 2049</p>]]></description>

He talks about his experiences with directors Lasse Hallström, James Ivory, and Ang Lee. Since he worked with Ang Lee on the movies Taking Woodstock and Life of Pi (two very different movies!), he talks about his approaches to the films and talks about designing for a 3D project. And we learn some specifics about the shooting of Life of Pi, such as the tank work and working as a production designer with the VFX team!

We learn that he started out as an actor and how that has helped him when he became a director. He talks about the immediate recognition, on his first directed film Crazy Heart, that directing was his path and not acting. He shares his belief that you make a film 3 times: when writing it, when shooting it and when editing it. He talks about shooting with a single camera, how he works with actors, and how he wants to create space for the actors to take big chances. He tells about the experiences of working on each of his films and says he likes to push himself in unsafe places. A very interesting look into the process of a director!</p>]]></description>

We talk about how it’s hard when you are starting out to consider compromising, but as you learn more about the collaborative nature of filmmaking, it becomes easier, as well as the idea that getting worked up on a set will never help you achieve your goal. Dion speaks about the difficult balance of knowing when and how you need to work with what you’re given and when to stand firm. We also cover learning to light, prepping for a film, and setting the look with the director. Dion also shares his experiences of working with Rob Marshall who taught him a lot about musicals and Ang Lee, shooting with a high frame rate.

We talk about his experiences with actors Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons on MERCHANT OF VENICE and we learn a lot about IL POSTINO and the challenges that entailed. A refreshing and very frank conversation with a talented director!</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>EPISODE 119 - LEE SMITH - Editor</p> <p>Team Deakins sits down with editor, Lee Smith (1917, SPECTRE, DUNKIRK, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES). He shares with us his thoughts on a lot of subjects: how working on bad films helps you learn, that the rhythm of the cut is instinctive and how you use the cut to create the rhythm, how his approach depends on the director and the differences between directors. We talk about how “finding it in the editing room” is not our favorite approach, editors being on set, the editor being a fresh eye, and working on the fractured time structure in Dunkirk. He also speaks of his work on the films Dunkirk and 1917 as well as his thoughts on cutting action sequences, using split screens unwisely and continuity. It’s a great episode that really delves into the craft of motion picture editing. Don’t miss it!</p>]]></description>

He shares with us the experience of his first film flopping and all that he learned from that, as well as the “rules” he sets for each individual film and the power of breaking these rules. He talks about his process, his avoidance of storyboarding, his dislike of multiple cameras, and remembering that films based on actual people are still works of fiction. According to Pablo, “when you are shooting, you’re fighting the script, when you are editing, you are fighting the shoot”. We learn a lot about the production of the movie “Jackie,” the production design, the shooting design, and why he chose to shoot in 16mm film.

Of course, we speak about his collaboration with Atom Egoyan and learn how they work together. We break down a lot in the film, The Sweet Hereafter, and learn a lot! He shares that he thinks prep normally revolves around figuring out one thing and the rest “you just deal with”. We also touch on his working on two movies based on Russell Banks movies in a row, operating the camera, working with a non-linear time structure, digital technology as being subtractive vs additive, and the difference of working in TV and on features. And much, much more! A great conversation!</p>]]></description>

We also touch on his working on two movies based on Russell Banks movies in a row, operating the camera, working with a non-linear time structure, digital technology as being subtractive vs additive, and the difference of working in TV and on features. And much, much more! A great conversation!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Working with the Coens is a good challenge because they don’t repeat themselves so it’s new territory every time. He also shares about working with Sidney Lumet on Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead which was a unique experience. We learn how the composer can be asked to help save a scene that isn’t working with the score and how you can do that.

We have the opportunity to go behind the scenes on this movie and ask everything we’ve always wanted to know. The more we learn, the more our admiration for the film grows. He shares they had many limitations in terms of money and equipment, but they did have the luxury of time. VFX was not an option so they had to figure out how to do everything in-camera. Some of the stories from the making of the film are quite amazing - like the use of real bullets in the scenes. We also delve into his other movies such as ORLANDO and THE PARTY and his approach. It’s a great conversation with a great talent!</p>]]></description>

He shares his experiences on Arrival and that it was his first experience working with storyboards and also speaks about his work on Star Wars.

He shares what he loves about filmmaking - the collaboration, the democracy of ideas that grow stronger as you define, and how the medium of film is a great medium for social exchange and political change. He talks about the differences of working with varying directors - such as Les Blair, Michael Winterbottom, Sam Taylor Johnson, Tom Ford, Oliver Stone, and Joe Wright. He likes the terror of not working with a locked-in storyboard or shot list! We even get into the experience of shooting television and learn what he likes and what he doesn’t like.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>EPISODE 83 - DAVID MULLEN - Cinematographer</p> <p>Team Deakins has the opportunity to talk with cinematographer David Mullen(THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL, NORTHFORK, TWIN FALLS IDAHO). We learn lots of specifics about the shooting and lighting of the film Northfork. He really breaks it all down for us. We also speak in detail about the different ways of flashing film and why you would do it, as well as the ways of taking color out of the visuals on a film. He also shares the difficulty of storyboards that were created without the input of the cinematographer. We cover shooting anamorphic - why and the differences between spherical shooting, his experience of negotiating for a DI finish in the early days of the DI, and how he oversees the look when shooting the packed schedule of television. We learned a lot when talking with David!</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: Northfork, Akeelah and the Bee<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>EPISODE 82 - JEFF NICHOLS, ADAM STONE - Director/Cinematographer Team</p> <p>Team Deakins has a great conversation with the collaborative team of director Jeff Nichols and cinematographer Adam Stone (MUD, LOVING, TAKE SHELTER). We learn about how they found each other, how they work together, and how that collaboration has grown over the years. They share their preference for shot lists over storyboards and their specificity when choosing locations (and how they drive the location department crazy!). Jeff, who also writes his projects, speaks of not adding camera direction in his scripts. We also talk about the difference in shooting for television and features and the different opportunities found in long-form storytelling. A great look at a close collaboration!</p>]]></description>

We learn that when he started, he directed and shot for Flemish TV and he explains why he changed his path and became a stills photographer. He shares the importance of intuition in his work and finding your own way of seeing and style. We love what he does with color so we speak a lot about color and how he uses it, and he speaks of when he would use B&W over color. He also goes into detail about his early work in Morocco and how he relates to the subjects of his photographs. He shares what he was thinking when shooting specific shots and tells a wonderful story about his photo with the Magritte painting. He’s an artist that works for his own pleasure without concerning himself about how people will react and we certainly love the results he achieves!</p>]]></description>

Mike shares with us his method of working and delineates the difference between his work and that of the directors John Cassavetes and Ken Loach. We learn the importance of having the right location and being able to return to the location during the course of the shoot. As the film is an “ongoing investigation” of what it will be according to Mike, Dick shares how amazing the experience is when he sees the blocked scene play out on location for the first time. Mike speaks on his way of working with actors. We also learn why on the film Peterloo, which involved a lot of scenes with a lot of extras and battles, they chose not to do storyboards. Both Mike and Dick talk about the specifics of their collaboration and how it has strengthened over years.

We learned a lot about the process in television series - how far in advance the scripts are done, the actors' ownership of their role, the importance of cinematographers in episodic TV. We also learned how much of the story is known at the start of the season and how the scripts change during the season.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>EPISODE 75 - JOHN WELLS - Director, Producer, Showrunner</p> <p>Team Deakins has a great conversation with John Wells, a director, producer and showrunner of such television as ER, WEST WING, THIRD WATCH, SOUTHLAND, and SHAMELESS. John spells out the responsibilities of the position of showrunner on television, and we get to ask all the questions for which we’ve always wanted to know the answer! We learned a lot about the process in television series - how far in advance the scripts are done, the actors' ownership of their role, the importance of cinematographers in episodic TV. We also learned how much of the story is known at the start of the season and how the scripts change during the season. John also gives a thoughtful opinion on the effect of streaming on future moviemaking. We talk about writing a villain successfully, ensemble movies, and much, much more!

We talk about the careful selection by Plan B of the projects they choose and how the company’s goal is to protect the original intention of a film throughout the process. Dede tells us her process in choosing projects to back and that she chose to become a producer because it allowed her to spend the longest time on a project.

She speaks at length on her working relationship with Jeremy Kleiner, Plan B’s other co-president.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>EPISODE 64 - JON KILIK - Getting the project off the ground</p> <p>Team Deakins is happy to welcome producer Jon Kilik back again with a specific subject - how to get film projects off the ground. Because films are different, we look at the different ways you can move forward. Jon tells us about the need to be flexible without compromising the vision, how often compromises can be opportunities, and if you can’t bring the film’s operating price down, you might have to wait and do a smaller project first. He also walks us through the process of finding distribution for a film. We talk about how to deal with a project that is financed from many sources and how to structure this. He also touches on the weight a name actor adds to a project, how the process of filmmaking is making the project better everyday and dealing with stress. We’re so glad that Jon came back and delved into this subject with us!</p>]]></description>

Greig asks questions on 7 clips of the film. There is a companion pdf with this episode (see the link below) that lists the approximate time these clips appear in the movie with images of the first and last frames. We get into specific breakdowns of these shots as well as talking about the experience of working with the director, the lyric nature of the book and how that influenced the film as well as the incredible music track from composer Nick Cave. Greig had done his homework and had plenty of questions for us!

He also talks about his love of NOT relying on big lights and working up lighting gags. He likes restrictions and having to think outside of the box. He talks about some specifics on Shawshank Redemption, Blade Runner 2049, Hudsucker Proxy, Barton Fink and Fargo. When asked what his gaffer’s nightmare is, he not only told us but let us know it was a waking nightmare - he did experience it!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>EPISODE 57 - TURNING THE TABLES - Shawshank Redemption</p> <p>In this episode, we get the tables turned upon us! Greig Fraser leads the conversation and asks US the questions. He starts by diving into our collaboration process and then moves onto the movie SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. In addition, he chose 5 clips from the movie to discuss. We list and describe the clip in an accompanying PDF file for this episode that can be accessed by the link below. We also strayed from the movie discussion to talk about choosing the format of a movie, why one shoots anamorphic, choosing the camera for 1917, the pressure on the DP when trying to wait for the right light and the joy of seeing the performance as you are shooting. It’s a fun episode which Greig skillfully leads.

Jake speaks about his relationship with directors and with cinematographers. We speak about his work in Donnie Darko and Prisoners, as well as Jarhead and Wildlife. He speaks about how, as an actor, the final result is always in other people’s hands. He also shares how important the collaboration between actor and cinematographer is and the importance of creating a “safe place” for the actor in front of the camera. Although we were hoping he would explain the end of the movie Enemy (and he said he would!), we finished the episode without knowing any more! And we also got into the craft of building sand castles! A really fun conversation that gave us an insight into the world of an actor! Don’t miss it!</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: Donnie Darko, Jarhead</p>]]></description>

We speak with a VFX Producer, Sona Pak (1917, THE TWO POPES, ALIEN: COVENANT) and a VFX Supervisor, Guillaume Rocheron (1917, AD ASTRA, LIFE OF PI). So the first question we get to settle is who does what. We also look into things like, the advantages and disadvantages of working with multiple vendors, how to keep a continuity of look when so many people are working on a shot, face replacement in shots, how what is a VFX shot and what isn’t is decided, the importance of knowing the different strengths of the various VFX houses and how the post schedule can contract. And that’s just a few of the points we touch on. It’s a large subject and it was great to speak with two such talented people!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>EPISODE 39 - HOYTE VAN HOYTEMA - Cinematographer</p> <p>Team Deakins has a fascinating conversation with celebrated cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (DUNKIRK, LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY, HER, INTERSTELLAR). He shares his experience of working with directors, Christopher Nolan and David O Russell. He talks about the value of shooting as much as possible in camera and how he approaches lenses, often creating a set specifically for a movie. We learn about how working with Christopher Nolan the second time on Dunkirk was different and he goes into detail on shooting in IMAX, talking about the pros and cons. He also shares his opinions on working with a large budget and a small budget. And there’s plenty more. You don’t want to miss this!</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: Dunkirk, Ad Astra, Interstellar</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>EPISODE 38 - JEB BRODY - Pres of Production, Amblin Studios</p> <p>Team Deakins sits down with Jeb Brody, the president of production at Amblin Studios and learn a lot about the studio side of production. Jeb walks us through so much - the difference between a studio exec and a producer, the relationship between the filmmakers and the studios, the differences between the studios and the movies they make. We discuss what kind of films are getting made these days, look at the difference of negative pickup and acquisition, and why the bad behaviors of filmmakers in the ’70s no longer works. We worked with Jeb on 1917 and get into that as well. And we learn from the studio’s point of view what the growth of streaming means for moviemaking. We even got into the “dark arts of filmmaking” (you’ll have to listen to learn about this!). We’ve never had the opportunity to sit with the studio and ask them all our questions so we had a great time! Don’t miss it if you want to learn everything on the studio side!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>EPISODE 37 - LAURA METCALFE - DI Producer/Finishing Producer</p> <p>Team Deakins looks into the final step of making a movie or the DI, with DI Producer/ Finishing Producer, Laura Metcalfe (1917, WONDER WOMAN, TOMB RAIDER). While previously called the “DI Producer” since when it started it was all about the DI (“Digital Intermediate”), because the process has become so complex, you’ll hear the role referred to as “Finishing Producer”. We speak with Laura Metcalfe of Company 3 in London who worked with us on “1917”. We talk about when this role actually starts on a movie (much earlier than you might think!) and talk at length about setting up workflows that continue until the film finishes. We also go into detail with Laura about the very bespoke workflow on “1917” and the challenges it presented. We also walk through some of the deliverables of a film (the different formats that are made), how the dailies timing differs from the DI timing and the steps to setting up a DI. And, of course, much more! A very detailed look at post!</p>]]></description>
