<p>At the heart of Sight is what Logitech dubs the AI director, which allows the camera to automatically shift focus onto those that are speaking around the table.

It also has a sliding lens cap to give you peace of mind from prying eyes when no meetings are taking place. </p><p>At a launch event in London attended by <em>TechRadar Pro</em>, Logitech was open about its R&D process, detailing the failed attempts leading up the development of the Sight. One of these made “uncanny valley” avatars of the people in the room, but thankfully this was scraped.</p>

You can check and book your route <a href="https://www.nationalexpress.com/en/events/glastonbury" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p><p>If you are thinking of coming by train, the closest station is Castle Cary. Here, there will be a free shuttle bus running throughout the event days.</p><p>Those coming by car or campervan should keep in mind that, despite the name, the festival is not actually located in the town of Glastonbury. As with previous events, Glastonbury 2023 will be held at Worthy Farm which is in Pilton, in Somerset.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-glastonbury-children-s-tickets"><span>Glastonbury children's tickets</span></h3>
<p>If you are thinking of heading to the festival with all your family, good news: kids under 12 go free!</p><p>Glastonbury festival is a popular destination for families, too. So, nothing to worry about. Just make sure to keep an eye on the youngest family members at all times.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-get-glastonbury-tickets-what-to-do-if-you-miss-out"><span>Get Glastonbury tickets: what to do if you miss out</span></h3>
<p>If you miss out on the registration end date, don&apos;t panic. There&apos;s still another chance around April when returned tickets get resold. So, you still have a chance to land your Glastonbury 2023 spot. Plus, you can always work there and get in for free.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>How many times in history can you remember a room full of competitive tech companies all in the same room with one shared goal – not to compete, but to work together for something better? Imagine now that among these companies are megalithic lumbering giants among men, and you&apos;ve just imagined the room we were in earlier this week.</p><p>Along with other industry behemoths including Google, Samsung, and Apple, Amazon has committed to the future of smart homes by joining the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA), a collaborative group of over 550 companies working together for the cause. </p><p>The result is Matter, a new standard, which was officially launched at an event in Amsterdam on November 3. Offering a level of interoperability we’ve only been dreaming of until now, Matter 1.0 is the real starting point of smart homes becoming truly smart. </p><p>It’s the beginning of a long road; as of now, only certain product categories are Matter-compatible; these include lighting and electrical, HVAC controls, controllers and bridges, TVs and media devices, blinds and shades, security sensors, and door locks. The CSA expects to expand into more product areas in 2023, including security cameras, and robot vacuums.</p><p>Amazon, of course, is only growing in its smart home prominence, and with its recent acquisition of iRobot, its portfolio is going from strength to strength. Today, Alexa supports over 30,000 devices in its Works with Alexa program – but this number will grow substantially with the launch of Matter.</p>
<h2 id="not-a-leap-but-a-step-in-the-right-direction-2">Not a leap, but a step in the right direction</h2>
<p>In Amazon’s keynote at the event, Marja Koopmans, Director of Smart Home and Health for Amazon discussed the company’s plans for Matter, and why it’s so important for them. Amazon intends to bring Matter support to “well over 100 million devices” across 30 Echo and eero devices in what Koopmans called a “hugely unprecedented undertaking”.</p><p>Later, in conversation with Chris Decenzo, Amazon&apos;s technical lead for Matter and chair of the Matter steering committee, he said that as well as the crucial opportunity for customers to have more choice in terms of what will work interoperably in their smart home, Matter should also increase speed to market for new products.</p><p>“Device makers can build a product and they don&apos;t have to invest in six different versions of it, six different kinds of hardware because of all the different protocols that are out there. It’s reducing work for developers.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1641px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mqYcDVVuKyy7sXyxf2Mipb" name="Amazon-presentation-matter-conference.jpg" alt="Amazon's roadmap for Matter support rollout" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mqYcDVVuKyy7sXyxf2Mipb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1641" height="923" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of compatibility, Koopmans announced a phased approach that would see compatibility arrive on Alexa and several generations of Eero routers and Echo smart speakers in December – but only for plugs, switches and bulbs, and only on Android. This will support connections with currently Matter-compatible devices exclusively over Wi-Fi. Further Echo and eero devices and device types are on the roadmap for early 2023.</p><p>So, where does that leave users on iOS and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-thread-and-why-do-your-smart-home-gadgets-need-it">Thread</a> networks? Well, support for these will come early next year, and there’s a good reason behind this. We spoke with Decenzo to learn more.</p>
<h2 id="slow-and-steady-wins-the-race-xa0-2">Slow and steady wins the race </h2>
<p>One of the key conversation points of the whole event is that Matter is a journey, and we’re just at the beginning of it–and that’s great, but Decenzo says that customer experience is “absolutely critical”–and that’s why they’re taking it slow.</p><p>First, we tackled the conversation around Wi-Fi vs. Thread, and why Amazon was sticking with Wi-Fi for its first phase of the rollout. The process of aligning credentials and APIs takes time, and integrating all of the different companies hosting thread border routers is not an easy one. Decenzo uses the example that rushing into Thread compatibility could lead to four Thread networks rather than one and end up an “absolute disaster for the customer”. “That caused us to decide to wait on the thread stuff until we get enough of the industry integrated,” he explains. </p><p>It’s a slightly different story with Android vs. iOS–some of which simply comes down to timing. Apple only recently announced its iOS requirements for Matter, which include brand new APIs that only just came out in Xcode 14. Unfortunately, this means that developers have not had enough time to make sure the integration works–yet.</p><p>Decenzo says that while Amazon is happy with its progress, customer-centricity remains key. “ It&apos;s not going to be a long time that customers have to wait but unfortunately, we&apos;re not able to be as aggressive on that one.”</p>
<h2 id="analysis-no-risk-no-reward-xa0-2">Analysis: No risk, no reward </h2>
<p>While many of the founding companies attending the CSA’s Matter launch event have some serious stakes in the new standard, Amazon holds an interesting position. </p><p>Wearing multiple hats, including vendor and manufacturer, Amazon’s position at the front and center of this collaborative approach ias somewhat of a surprise. After all, this kind of standard could move consumers outside of the Amazon Alexa ecosystem, create more competition, and even stand to create risk in the development of new smart products–and considering Amazon’s range of products and its recent acquisition of iRobot, we’d expect more risk adversity.</p><p>Speaking with Decenzo, however, brought the company’s stake in Matter into focus.</p><p>For Decenzo, who sits in between the various areas of the business that may have conflicting interests around Matter, it’s been a boon for Amazon to be able to speak as both a device maker and a service provider, allowing it to “earn a lot of trust” with the other members of the standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="Cs5bDEaSeRSKQhdM3kcA9B" name="2 Amazon Smart Plug.jpg" alt="The Amazon Smart Plug connected to a power outlet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cs5bDEaSeRSKQhdM3kcA9B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="506" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Amazon Smart Plug is one product in Amazon's growing smart home device portfolio </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the one hand, Amazon understood the priorities of device makers. “A lot of the device makers want to be able to differentiate–they don&apos;t want to have some middleman that&apos;s blocking them from the customer and dictating what features they can have.”</p><p>However, as a service provider, Decenzo explains that Amazon is more attuned to the benefits of standardization–especially when it comes to security and privacy. He credits this as the reason Amazon was able to “help try to find the right balance.”</p><p>So, what of the risk created by increased competition? Decenzo says that overall, there were more benefits to growing smart homes and product availability. “Sometimes you have to look around corners and see an opportunity to standardize and be confident that your customers love the experience that they get from your product. They&apos;re still going to love that, even if you know things are completely open.</p><p>“We&apos;ve always been into open standards and that&apos;s why we&apos;ve embraced them, and we&apos;re happy that we were able to bring other companies along that haven&apos;t always been into them.”</p><p>The measured approach being taken by Amazon and the hundreds of companies that form the CSA now and in the future speaks to a very unique movement in the tech space–one that we hope other industries could learn a thing or two from. We’ll be keeping our eyes peeled as Matter 1.0 gains traction in 2023.</p>

Decenzo uses the example that rushing into Thread compatibility could lead to four Thread networks rather than one and end up an “absolute disaster for the customer”. “That caused us to decide to wait on the thread stuff until we get enough of the industry integrated,” he explains. </p><p>It’s a slightly different story with Android vs. iOS–some of which simply comes down to timing. Apple only recently announced its iOS requirements for Matter, which include brand new APIs that only just came out in Xcode 14. Unfortunately, this means that developers have not had enough time to make sure the integration works–yet.</p><p>Decenzo says that while Amazon is happy with its progress, customer-centricity remains key. “ It&apos;s not going to be a long time that customers have to wait but unfortunately, we&apos;re not able to be as aggressive on that one.”</p>
<h2 id="analysis-no-risk-no-reward-xa0-5">Analysis: No risk, no reward </h2>
<p>While many of the founding companies attending the CSA’s Matter launch event have some serious stakes in the new standard, Amazon holds an interesting position. </p><p>Wearing multiple hats, including vendor and manufacturer, Amazon’s position at the front and center of this collaborative approach ias somewhat of a surprise. After all, this kind of standard could move consumers outside of the Amazon Alexa ecosystem, create more competition, and even stand to create risk in the development of new smart products–and considering Amazon’s range of products and its recent acquisition of iRobot, we’d expect more risk adversity.</p><p>Speaking with Decenzo, however, brought the company’s stake in Matter into focus.</p><p>For Decenzo, who sits in between the various areas of the business that may have conflicting interests around Matter, it’s been a boon for Amazon to be able to speak as both a device maker and a service provider, allowing it to “earn a lot of trust” with the other members of the standard.</p>

<p>On the one hand, Amazon understood the priorities of device makers. “A lot of the device makers want to be able to differentiate–they don&apos;t want to have some middleman that&apos;s blocking them from the customer and dictating what features they can have.”</p><p>However, as a service provider, Decenzo explains that Amazon is more attuned to the benefits of standardization–especially when it comes to security and privacy. He credits this as the reason Amazon was able to “help try to find the right balance.”</p><p>So, what of the risk created by increased competition? Decenzo says that overall, there were more benefits to growing smart homes and product availability. “Sometimes you have to look around corners and see an opportunity to standardize and be confident that your customers love the experience that they get from your product. They&apos;re still going to love that, even if you know things are completely open.</p><p>“We&apos;ve always been into open standards and that&apos;s why we&apos;ve embraced them, and we&apos;re happy that we were able to bring other companies along that haven&apos;t always been into them.”</p><p>The measured approach being taken by Amazon and the hundreds of companies that form the CSA now and in the future speaks to a very unique movement in the tech space–one that we hope other industries could learn a thing or two from. We’ll be keeping our eyes peeled as Matter 1.0 gains traction in 2023.</p>

Last year in particular saw a huge surge, with <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/ransomware-attacks-saw-a-huge-rise-in-2021">over 600 million attacks worldwide in 2021</a>, more than twice the number of the preceding year. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Being able to work anywhere is convenient and familiar for many employees and the businesses they work for, but there are a few things to think through – such as how your business will maintain a high level of security with workers in many different locations. A large number of remotely-connecting employees increases the number of potential entry points for adversaries and leaves sensitive data vulnerable to interception during transit. That’s exactly where cloud-based zero trust network access (ZTNA) comes in.</p><p>Traditionally, employers have had little or no control over the home or public Wi-Fi networks and the devices that remote employees use to work. ZTNA, like GoodAccess, helps overcome that, ensuring that your small or medium business remains competitive by staying secure while allowing your employees to remain focused on the task at hand.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2561px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Y3DNDUmk3VACLZKSpgipeY" name="goodaccess-access-control-2560x1440-2022-06.png" alt="GoodAccess Control Panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y3DNDUmk3VACLZKSpgipeY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2561" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Good Access)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Zero trust as a concept basically ensures that users go through strict verification procedures to minimize threats to company data and applications. Traditional zero trust solutions are robust, but can be hard for small or medium businesses to implement because of their complexity and the costs associated with implementing them. Those are the exact barriers that cloud-based zero trust access networking overcomes. </p><p>A particularly helpful use-case for ZTNA is to help prevent fallout from phishing attacks. As these attacks get increasingly more widespread and organizations have larger footprints, it becomes much more common for an employee to fall for them. ZTNA helps mitigate that risk by ensuring that malicious actors never get unlimited access to all company data and therefore cannot completely paralyze a company.</p>

                                <p>Being able to work anywhere is convenient and familiar for many employees and the businesses they work for, but there are a few things to think through – such as how your business will maintain a high level of security with workers in many different locations. A large number of remotely-connecting employees increases the number of potential entry points for adversaries and leaves sensitive data vulnerable to interception during transit. That’s exactly where cloud-based zero trust network access (ZTNA) comes in.</p><p>Traditionally, employers have had little or no control over the home or public Wi-Fi networks and the devices that remote employees use to work. ZTNA, like GoodAccess, helps overcome that, ensuring that your small or medium business remains competitive by staying secure while allowing your employees to remain focused on the task at hand.</p>

<p>Zero trust as a concept basically ensures that users go through strict verification procedures to minimize threats to company data and applications. Traditional zero trust solutions are robust, but can be hard for small or medium businesses to implement because of their complexity and the costs associated with implementing them. Those are the exact barriers that cloud-based zero trust access networking overcomes. </p><p>A particularly helpful use-case for ZTNA is to help prevent fallout from phishing attacks. As these attacks get increasingly more widespread and organizations have larger footprints, it becomes much more common for an employee to fall for them. ZTNA helps mitigate that risk by ensuring that malicious actors never get unlimited access to all company data and therefore cannot completely paralyze a company.</p>

Ignoring the cost of a drone, the device reportedly costs $20 in parts, making it easy to assemble for criminals such as thieves.</p>
<h2 id="polite-wifi-x2019-s-implications-2">Polite WiFi’s implications</h2>
<p>Polite WiFi means that smart devices will respond to connection requests even when they’re <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager"><u>password</u></a> protected and the connection is refused. The Wi-Peep is able to track devices so closely by continuously sending contact messages to all devices in range. </p><p>In a statement, Abedi contextualized the threat similar devices pose to security in the home and beyond.</p><p>““Using similar technology, one could track the movements of security guards inside a bank by following the location of their phones or smartwatches,” he said.</p><p>“Likewise, a thief could identify the location and type of smart devices in a home, including security cameras, laptops, and smart TVs, to find a good candidate for a break-in.”</p><p>“In addition, the device’s operation via drone means that it can be used quickly and remotely without much chance of the user being detected.”</p><p>The Wi-Peep was assembled to test the theory that these kinds of attacks would be possible after the identification of the Polite Wi-Fi loophole. In his statement, Abedi advocated for an extensive fix, “so that our devices do not respond to strangers”.</p>

<p>He also suggested that, until then, Wi-Fi chip manufacturers could introduce randomized response times so as to decrease the accuracy in device location reporting by devices such as the Wi-Peep.</p><p>Before any fix is issued, businesses and homeowners ought to be concerned about the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the growing accepted wisdom that any and all devices, from cars, to fridges, to barbecues, benefit from internet connectivity.</p>

                                <p>A drone that leverages a widespread security flaw to detect <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-wi-fi-extenders"><u>Wi-Fi</u></a> networks from inside buildings has been developed by the University of Waterloo (UOW) in Canada, raising fears about similar devices being used to conduct criminal activity.</p><p>In a press release, the university <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/media/waterloo-researchers-discover-security-loophole-allowing" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a> on developments first published in a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3495243.3560530" target="_blank"><u>paper</u></a> by Dr. Ali Abedi, adjunct professor of computer science at UOW, and Deepak Vasisht, Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, titled “Non-cooperative wi-fi localization & its privacy implications”.</p><p>The device, known as the Wi-Peep, is a modified consumer drone that sends messages to connected devices as it flies, and can track their location “within a meter” by leveraging a known vulnerability known as “polite WiFi”. Ignoring the cost of a drone, the device reportedly costs $20 in parts, making it easy to assemble for criminals such as thieves.</p>
<h2 id="polite-wifi-x2019-s-implications-5">Polite WiFi’s implications</h2>
<p>Polite WiFi means that smart devices will respond to connection requests even when they’re <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager"><u>password</u></a> protected and the connection is refused. The Wi-Peep is able to track devices so closely by continuously sending contact messages to all devices in range. </p><p>In a statement, Abedi contextualized the threat similar devices pose to security in the home and beyond.</p><p>““Using similar technology, one could track the movements of security guards inside a bank by following the location of their phones or smartwatches,” he said.</p><p>“Likewise, a thief could identify the location and type of smart devices in a home, including security cameras, laptops, and smart TVs, to find a good candidate for a break-in.”</p><p>“In addition, the device’s operation via drone means that it can be used quickly and remotely without much chance of the user being detected.”</p><p>The Wi-Peep was assembled to test the theory that these kinds of attacks would be possible after the identification of the Polite Wi-Fi loophole. In his statement, Abedi advocated for an extensive fix, “so that our devices do not respond to strangers”.</p>

<p>He also suggested that, until then, Wi-Fi chip manufacturers could introduce randomized response times so as to decrease the accuracy in device location reporting by devices such as the Wi-Peep.</p><p>Before any fix is issued, businesses and homeowners ought to be concerned about the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the growing accepted wisdom that any and all devices, from cars, to fridges, to barbecues, benefit from internet connectivity.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Matter 1.0 is here. After months of hearing about how this software standard will provide a massive benefit to our smart home, users can finally start to see it in action as it rolls out to new gadgets and old favorites.</p><p>Over 500 companies across the world have been working together under the Connectivity Standards Alliance to bring Matter to life. With the launch of Matter 1.0 and the start of the Matter certification program, it should now be much easier to find smart home tech that&apos;ll benefit your day-to-day rather than cause you a bunch of headaches.</p><p>But what is Matter and how will it work? We&apos;re here with the answers.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-matter"><span>What is Matter?</span></h3>
<p>The promise of smart home tech is that your gadgets can interact with each other to make a system that is better than the sum of its parts. One example of an ideal world could see you unlock your front door’s smart lock after coming home from a long day of work and your <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-echo-dot-2020">Amazon Echo Dot (2020)</a> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-smart-speakers">smart speaker</a> could instantly kick on your favorite tunes while a smart coffee machine brews you a relaxing beverage.</p><p>Unfortunately to achieve something like this you need to spend a lot of time researching if a device is compatible with the gadgets you already have – and if it isn&apos;t there might not be an alternative that is.</p><p>That’s where Matter comes in. Rather than lots of smaller micro-ecosystems, Matter-supporting devices will all be able to interact as part of one big smart home setup. When buying a new Matter-compatible product you won’t need to worry if it will interact with your existing <a href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-use-google-assistant-to-control-your-smart-home">Google Assitant</a>, Amazon Alexa, or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-homekit-devices">Apple Homekit</a>-powered setup, it should just be able to integrate seamlessly.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-will-matter-work"><span>How will Matter work? </span></h3>
<p>Using Matter shouldn’t change how you currently interact with your smart home setup. Once the update rolls out to your devices and their smartphone apps, you should be able to continue using everything as you do now, you’ll just have more options for the gadgets you can add to your home. The only thing to watch out for is that different brands aren’t integrating their products with Matter in the same way.</p><p>Some, such as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gadgets/appliances/philips-hue-1124842/review">Phillips Hue</a>, will make nearly all of their existing devices (as well as new ones) Matter compatible. Like Phillips, companies will do this via a software update – which for the Hue Bridge will happen in “Q1, 2023,” or January, February, or March – which will then bring the devices into the fold of the new standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="raruFRgqMxeRyNHxhCQNyf" name="Philips Hue + Spotify -1.jpg" alt="Philips Hue + Spotify" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/raruFRgqMxeRyNHxhCQNyf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Nearly every Phillips Hue device will work support Matter </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Philips)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There may be a few hiccups here and there – Philips is having to abandon the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/philips-hue-play-hdmi-sync-box">Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box</a> and the dial of the Philips Hue Tap Dial Switch for now, and some settings may be reset by the change – but for the most part, the transition over to Matter will be quick and painless.</p><p>Unfortunately, this total adoption of Matter won’t be possible for every existing smart home device. For some brands – like Amazon and Google – very old models will be left behind.</p><p>If you have the latest smart device like the new <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/new-amazon-echo-dot-promises-bigger-bass-and-clearer-sound-at-the-same-size">Echo Dot (5th gen)</a>, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-nest-hub-max">Google Nets Hub Max</a>, or the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-echo-show-10-review">Echo Show 10</a> (among others) then those should get the Matter update. However, models that are older than a few years won’t necessarily offer the same support. In those instances, you’ll either have to upgrade your smart speakers or forgo the benefits that Matter will bring.</p><p>Further, even some fairly recent models won’t update to Matter, with support for the new standard only coming to newly released smart home gadgets from some brands. That’s the case with Nanoleaf’s smart lighting – only the new Matter-compatible additions to its Essentials line will adopt the Matter standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pzma8ZakYxb82T8anokgXK" name="Echo-Dot_1920x1080_301.png" alt="Echo Dot with clock next to bed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzma8ZakYxb82T8anokgXK.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The new Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) will support Matter, but many older models won't. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, even if your older gadgets don’t get the update, your existing smart home setup should continue to work as well as ever. So, unless you were planning to upgrade it already there shouldn’t be a need for you to rush out and replace everything right away.</p><p>If you are looking to buy some upgrades though – say you&apos;re looking to take advantage of some of this year&apos;s best <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-sales">Black Friday deals</a> on smart home tech – then you&apos;ll want to make sure what you&apos;re buying does support Matter, otherwise, your new purchases could become outdated pretty quickly.</p>

                                <p>Matter 1.0 is here. After months of hearing about how this software standard will provide a massive benefit to our smart home, users can finally start to see it in action as it rolls out to new gadgets and old favorites.</p><p>Over 500 companies across the world have been working together under the Connectivity Standards Alliance to bring Matter to life. With the launch of Matter 1.0 and the start of the Matter certification program, it should now be much easier to find smart home tech that&apos;ll benefit your day-to-day rather than cause you a bunch of headaches.</p><p>But what is Matter and how will it work? We&apos;re here with the answers.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-matter"><span>What is Matter?</span></h3>
<p>The promise of smart home tech is that your gadgets can interact with each other to make a system that is better than the sum of its parts. One example of an ideal world could see you unlock your front door’s smart lock after coming home from a long day of work and your <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-echo-dot-2020">Amazon Echo Dot (2020)</a> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-smart-speakers">smart speaker</a> could instantly kick on your favorite tunes while a smart coffee machine brews you a relaxing beverage.</p><p>Unfortunately to achieve something like this you need to spend a lot of time researching if a device is compatible with the gadgets you already have – and if it isn&apos;t there might not be an alternative that is.</p><p>That’s where Matter comes in. Rather than lots of smaller micro-ecosystems, Matter-supporting devices will all be able to interact as part of one big smart home setup. When buying a new Matter-compatible product you won’t need to worry if it will interact with your existing <a href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-use-google-assistant-to-control-your-smart-home">Google Assitant</a>, Amazon Alexa, or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-homekit-devices">Apple Homekit</a>-powered setup, it should just be able to integrate seamlessly.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-will-matter-work"><span>How will Matter work? </span></h3>
<p>Using Matter shouldn’t change how you currently interact with your smart home setup. Once the update rolls out to your devices and their smartphone apps, you should be able to continue using everything as you do now, you’ll just have more options for the gadgets you can add to your home. The only thing to watch out for is that different brands aren’t integrating their products with Matter in the same way.</p><p>Some, such as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gadgets/appliances/philips-hue-1124842/review">Phillips Hue</a>, will make nearly all of their existing devices (as well as new ones) Matter compatible. Like Phillips, companies will do this via a software update – which for the Hue Bridge will happen in “Q1, 2023,” or January, February, or March – which will then bring the devices into the fold of the new standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="raruFRgqMxeRyNHxhCQNyf" name="Philips Hue + Spotify -1.jpg" alt="Philips Hue + Spotify" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/raruFRgqMxeRyNHxhCQNyf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Nearly every Phillips Hue device will work support Matter </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Philips)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There may be a few hiccups here and there – Philips is having to abandon the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/philips-hue-play-hdmi-sync-box">Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box</a> and the dial of the Philips Hue Tap Dial Switch for now, and some settings may be reset by the change – but for the most part, the transition over to Matter will be quick and painless.</p><p>Unfortunately, this total adoption of Matter won’t be possible for every existing smart home device. For some brands – like Amazon and Google – very old models will be left behind.</p><p>If you have the latest smart device like the new <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/new-amazon-echo-dot-promises-bigger-bass-and-clearer-sound-at-the-same-size">Echo Dot (5th gen)</a>, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-nest-hub-max">Google Nets Hub Max</a>, or the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-echo-show-10-review">Echo Show 10</a> (among others) then those should get the Matter update. However, models that are older than a few years won’t necessarily offer the same support. In those instances, you’ll either have to upgrade your smart speakers or forgo the benefits that Matter will bring.</p><p>Further, even some fairly recent models won’t update to Matter, with support for the new standard only coming to newly released smart home gadgets from some brands. That’s the case with Nanoleaf’s smart lighting – only the new Matter-compatible additions to its Essentials line will adopt the Matter standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pzma8ZakYxb82T8anokgXK" name="Echo-Dot_1920x1080_301.png" alt="Echo Dot with clock next to bed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzma8ZakYxb82T8anokgXK.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The new Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) will support Matter, but many older models won't. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, even if your older gadgets don’t get the update, your existing smart home setup should continue to work as well as ever. So, unless you were planning to upgrade it already there shouldn’t be a need for you to rush out and replace everything right away.</p><p>If you are looking to buy some upgrades though – say you&apos;re looking to take advantage of some of this year&apos;s best <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-sales">Black Friday deals</a> on smart home tech – then you&apos;ll want to make sure what you&apos;re buying does support Matter, otherwise, your new purchases could become outdated pretty quickly.</p>

<h2 id="easy-and-secure-authentication-2">Easy and secure authentication</h2>
<p>“U.S. cybersecurity Executive Order 14028 requires the use of phishing-resistant MFA on all device platforms. On mobile, while customers can provision user certificates on their personal mobile device to be used for authentication, this is primarily feasible for managed mobile devices. But this new public preview unlocks support for BYOD,” Vimala Ranganathan, product manager of Microsoft Entra, wrote in the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/azure-ad-certificate-based-authentication-cba-on-mobile/ba-p/2365672" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing the new features. </p><p>With the new solution, Microsoft AD users will be able to provision certificates with a hardware security key, allowing them to easily authenticate on mobile devices. Apple’s iOS users need to register via the Yubico Authenticator app, and copy the public certificate into the iOS keychain. After that, they can select the YubiKey certificate to sign in, and enter the PIN code. </p>

                                <p>Microsoft is looking to better protect hybrid workers connecting to its Azure Active Directory (AD) service via iOS or Android <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-endpoint-security-software" target="_blank">endpoints</a> from phishing and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager" target="_blank">password</a>-stealing attacks. </p><p>The company has introduced a new authentication method for the enterprise identity service that it says is a paswordless, certificate-based authentication (CBA) one, enabled through the YubiKey hardware <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-security-key">security key</a>, built by Yubico. </p><p>According to Microsoft’s announcement, the tool will give mobile users Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) certified login solution, fully resistant to phishing attacks. </p>
<h2 id="easy-and-secure-authentication-5">Easy and secure authentication</h2>
<p>“U.S. cybersecurity Executive Order 14028 requires the use of phishing-resistant MFA on all device platforms. On mobile, while customers can provision user certificates on their personal mobile device to be used for authentication, this is primarily feasible for managed mobile devices. But this new public preview unlocks support for BYOD,” Vimala Ranganathan, product manager of Microsoft Entra, wrote in the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/azure-ad-certificate-based-authentication-cba-on-mobile/ba-p/2365672" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing the new features. </p><p>With the new solution, Microsoft AD users will be able to provision certificates with a hardware security key, allowing them to easily authenticate on mobile devices. Apple’s iOS users need to register via the Yubico Authenticator app, and copy the public certificate into the iOS keychain. After that, they can select the YubiKey certificate to sign in, and enter the PIN code. </p>

<p>For Android users, Microsoft said Azure AD CBA support with YubiKey on Android mobile is enabled via the latest MSAL. Android users don’t need the YubiKey Authenticator app, as they can plug in their YubiKey via USB, initiate Azure AD CBA, pick the certificate from YubiKey, enter the PIN and get authenticated.</p><p>Microsoft claims this authentication method minimizes the chances of credential theft and identity theft, done through phishing or social engineering. </p><p>“Microsoft’s mobile certificate-based solution coupled with the hardware security keys is a simple, convenient FIPS-certified phishing-resistant MFA method,” Ranganathan concluded. </p>

<p>In August, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/no-the-punisher-isnt-getting-a-marvel-disney-plus-show">we covered the news that Bernthal wasn&apos;t set</a> to get his own MCU <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-disney-plus-shows">Disney Plus show</a>, or join the MCU whatsoever. That report came after Rosario Dawson, who played Claire Temple/Night Nurse in multiple Netflix Marvel TV series, including Daredevil and The Punisher, had incorrectly suggested Bernthal&apos;s Punisher was getting a standalone MCU TV series.</p><p>While Marvel hasn&apos;t officially commented on the matter, numerous MCU insiders have claimed that Bernthal will join Charlie Cox – who played Matt Murdock/Daredevil in Netflix&apos;s Defenders-Verse – in making the jump to the MCU via <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/disney-plus-movies-shows-free-trial-hamilton-and-more-explained">Disney Plus</a>.

<p>Given his obvious ties to Daredevil from Netflix&apos;s various Marvel TV programs, Daredevil: Born Again seems like the most likely place for Bernthal to make his MCU debut.</p><p>The duo were two sides of the same coin in Netflix&apos;s Defenders-Verse, juxtaposing each other incredibly well due to their individual brands of justice and opposing beliefs on how far vigilantes should go in the pursuit of vengeance. Reuniting them in Daredevil&apos;s first MCU project would be a perfect opportunity to explore that dynamic further, particularly with Born Again set to run for an unprecedented 18 episodes (well, unprecedented as far as the length of Marvel Studios&apos; TV shows are concerned).</p><p>If not Born Again, where could The Punisher – aka Frank Castle – appear? Marvel&apos;s Thunderbolts movie would be an ideal fit, what with that supergroup being positioned as an anti-hero team. Castle isn&apos;t a villain, nor is he a hero in the traditional sense, so he&apos;d be a perfect (not to mention crowd-pleasing) addition to the Thunderbolts&apos; roster.</p><p>What about Echo&apos;s TV series, too? Maybe The Punisher will make the briefest of cameos in that show, especially if Daredevil appears in a similarly small role. That would set up an intriguing side plot in Born Again, with Murdock potentially stunned to see Castle making the rounds across the US with the aim of doling out his own form of, well, punishment on criminals nationwide.</p><p>The rest of Marvel&apos;s Phase 5 line-up, such as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/loki-season-2">Loki season 2</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/secret-invasion-on-disney-plus-everything-we-know-so-far">Secret Invasion</a>, and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-release-date-trailer-and-more">Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</a> are all too far along in their production to include The Punisher.

If The Punisher is about to join the MCU&apos;s increasingly stacked roster, it&apos;s sure to be in a Disney Plus series like Born Again.
