        <![CDATA[<p>We continue our conversation with Kathryn Miles about her book “Trailed: One woman’s quest to solve the Shenandoah murders” about the murders of Lollie Winans and Julie Williams in Shenandoah National Park in May of 1996.

      <title>#404: The Shenandoah Murders - Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In May 1996, Lollie Winans and Julie Williams were murdered at their campsite in the popular Shenandoah National Park in the middle of rural Virginia, not far from a busy tourist resort called Skyland. Many people, including park and resort staff, had seen the happy, friendly couple in the area and were alarmed when they were reported missing. As experienced outdoorswomen, Lollie and Julie knew how to take care of themselves and each other.&nbsp;When their bodies were discovered, despite evidence that the women had been brutally tortured and killed, law enforcement decided not alert the public that a murderer could be in the park, and in fact diverted attention away from the crime. This and other shocking facts about the case are revealed in Kathryn Miles new book “Trailed: One woman’s quest to solve the Shenandoah murders”.&nbsp;&nbsp;We interview Kathryn about new details that have emerged about possible suspects. Jim and Laura discuss the victimology of Lollie and Julie, two extraordinary women whose families are still left searching for answers about their deaths.&nbsp;</p><p>#LollieWinans #JulieWilliams #Trailed #KathrynMiles #ShenandoahValley #MurderinNationalParks #WomenAreTargets #Femicide&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>*************** SUPPORT OUR OTHER SHOWS ***************</p><p>CRIME ANALYST PODCAST -&nbsp;</p><p>You’re interested in real crime?

They'll also welcome the occasional Buffy cast member, guest star, or celebrity superfan to join in the slaying.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Listen to The ReWatcher:&nbsp;<a href="http://wondery.fm/RCP_REWATCHER" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wondery.fm/RCP_REWATCHER</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In part 1 we discussed the brutal murder of Connie Dadkhah on June 14 2022. In the second part of our conversation, Laura shares with us another horrific case, the murder of professional photographer Sania Khan on July 18 2022. Sania had posted on TikTok about her struggles of a painful&nbsp;divorce and its stigma in her South Asian community.</p><p>Sania's vengeful ex-husband stalked her and flew from Georgia to Chicago and shot her dead.</p><p><br></p><p>And we discuss the murder of Tirany Savage, her son Dayton and her mother Kim by he ex Bo Eugene Savage on July 10 2022. During the time that Tirany&nbsp;was trying to leave her husband Bo, she saw his behavior escalate and she was fearful. Tirany called 911 on at least two occasions, had him removed from the home and begged a judge for a protection order to protect herself and her teenaged son and filed for divorce. Her husband had been threatening suicide, procured a gun and threatened to kill her. So why did Judge Troy Daniel deny the order? What happened next to Tirany, Dayton and Kim will shock you but it didn't surprise Laura who has been tracking lethal male violence for many years and set up the first Homicide Prevention Unit at New Scotland Yard.</p><p><br></p><p>This is an important discussion.

      <title>#387: Analyzing Gabby Petito's Murderer's "Confession" - Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Laura and Jim conclude their analysis of the "confession" written by Brian Laundrie about the death of Gabby Petito. </p><p>Here is the letter in its entirety.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“Gabby, I wish I was right at your side, I wish I could be talking to you right now. I’d be going through every memory we made, getting even more excited for the future. But [we] lost our future. I can’t [live] without you. I’ve lost every day we [could’ve] spent together, every holiday. I’ll never get to play with [illegible] again. Never go hiking with TJ. I loved you more than anything. I can’t bear to look at our photos, to recall great times because it is why I cannot go on. When I close my eyes, I will think of laughing on the roof of the van, falling asleep to the sight of [illegible] at the crystal geyser. I will always love you.”</em></p><p><em>“If you were reading Gabs’ journal, looking at photos from our life together, flipping through old cards you wouldn’t want to live a day without her. Knowing that everyday you’ll wake up without her, you wouldn’t want to wake up. I’m sorry to everyone this will affect, Gabby was the love of my life, but I know [adored] by many. I’m so very sorry to her family because I love them. I’d [consider] her younger siblings my best of friends… I am sorry to my family, this [is] a shock to them as well a terrible grief.”</em></p><p><em>“They loved as much, if not more than me. A new daughter to my mother, an aunt to my nephews. Please do not make this harder for them, this [occurred] as an unexpected tragedy. Rushing back to our car trying to cross the streams of [illegible] Spread Creek before it got too dark to see, too cold. I hear a splash and a scream. I could barely see. I couldn’t find her for a moment, shouted her name. I found her breathing heavily, gasping my name [illegible.] She was freezing cold. [Illegible] We had just came from the blazing hot national parks in Utah.”</em></p><p><em>“The temperature had dropped to freezing and she was soaking wet. I carried her as far as I could from the stream toward the car, stumbling, exhausted in shock, when my knees buckled[illegible] and knew I couldn’t safely carry her. I started a fire and spooned her as close to the heat. She was so thin, had already been freezing too long. I couldn’t at the time realize that I should’ve started a fire first but I wanted her out of the cold back to the car. From where I started the fire I had no idea how far the car might be, only knew it was across the creek.”</em></p><p><em>“When I pulled Gabby out of the water, she couldn’t tell me what hurt. She had a small [bump] on her forehead that [eventually] got larger. Her feet hurt, her [wrist] hurt but she was freezing, shaking violently. While carrying her she continually made sounds of pain. Laying next to her she said little, [lapsing] between violent shakes, gasping in pain, begging for an end to her pain. She would fall asleep and I would shake her awake, fearing she shouldn’t close her eyes if she had a concussion.”</em></p><p><em>“She would wake in pain, start her whole painful cycle again [illegible] She was furious that I was the one waking her. She wouldn’t let me try to cross the creek, thought like me that the fire would go out in her sleep and she’d freeze. I don’t know the extend of Gabby’s injuries, only that she was in extreme pain. I ended her life, I thought it was merciful, that it is what she wanted but I see now all the mistakes I made. I panicked, I was in shock. But from the moment I decided, took away her pain, I knew I couldn’t go on without her.”</em></p><p><em>“I rushed home to spend any time I had left with my family. I wanted to drive north and let James or TJ kill me but I wouldn’t want them to spend time in jail over my mistake, even though I’m sure they would have liked to. I am ending my life not because of a fear of punishment but rather because I can’t stand to live another day without her. I’ve lost our whole future together, every moment we could have [shared.] I’m sorry for everyone’s loss. Please do not make life harder for my family, they lost a son and a daughter. The most wonderful girl in the world. Gabby I’m sorry.”</em></p><p><em>“I have killed myself by this creek in the hopes that animals may tear me apart. That it may make some of her family happy.”</em></p><p><em>“Please pick up all of my things. Gabby hated people who litter.”</em></p><p>#HerNameWasGabbyPetito #confessionletter #brianlaundrie #WhatHeIsn'tSaying #expertanalysis #truecrime #podcast&nbsp;</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

I’d [consider] her younger siblings my best of friends… I am sorry to my family, this [is] a shock to them as well a terrible grief.”</em></p><p><em>“They loved as much, if not more than me. A new daughter to my mother, an aunt to my nephews. Please do not make this harder for them, this [occurred] as an unexpected tragedy. Rushing back to our car trying to cross the streams of [illegible] Spread Creek before it got too dark to see, too cold. I hear a splash and a scream. I could barely see. I couldn’t find her for a moment, shouted her name. I found her breathing heavily, gasping my name [illegible.] She was freezing cold.

She wouldn’t let me try to cross the creek, thought like me that the fire would go out in her sleep and she’d freeze. I don’t know the extend of Gabby’s injuries, only that she was in extreme pain. I ended her life, I thought it was merciful, that it is what she wanted but I see now all the mistakes I made. I panicked, I was in shock. But from the moment I decided, took away her pain, I knew I couldn’t go on without her.”</em></p><p><em>“I rushed home to spend any time I had left with my family. I wanted to drive north and let James or TJ kill me but I wouldn’t want them to spend time in jail over my mistake, even though I’m sure they would have liked to. I am ending my life not because of a fear of punishment but rather because I can’t stand to live another day without her. I’ve lost our whole future together, every moment we could have [shared.] I’m sorry for everyone’s loss. Please do not make life harder for my family, they lost a son and a daughter. The most wonderful girl in the world. Gabby I’m sorry.”</em></p><p><em>“I have killed myself by this creek in the hopes that animals may tear me apart. That it may make some of her family happy.”</em></p><p><em>“Please pick up all of my things.

        <![CDATA[<p>Laura and Jim analyze the “confession” written by Brian Laundrie about his version of events leading to, in his words, his “ending” Gabby Petito’s life.

I can’t bear to look at our photos, to recall great times because it is why I cannot go on.

        <![CDATA[<p>We continue our cross analysis of the HBO Max scripted version of "The Staircase" starring Toni Collette, and how it stacks up to the true events in the death of Kathleen Peterson.

        <![CDATA[<p>We continue our cross analysis of the HBO Max scripted version of "The Staircase" starring Toni Collette, and how it stacks up to the true events in the death of Kathleen Peterson. Laura and Jim both question the 911 calls made by Michael Peterson compared to how it was depicted in the&nbsp;show. Laura focuses on the gap in the timeline of these calls. We also discuss the three scenarios leading to Kathleen's death that the scripted&nbsp;show&nbsp;dramatized.

      <title>#384: The Staircase Revisited - Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On December 9, 2001, Kathleen Peterson died a terrible death, suffering for over 2 hours, bleeding from scalp lacerations and blunt force trauma while she lay in the stairwell of her North Carolina home. Her husband Michael Peterson was convicted of her murder after a contentious trial where all sorts of theories about who or what actually killed Kathleen were posited. Had Michael killed her in a fit of rage as the prosecution argued? Or did she fall down the staircase in a freak accident as claimed by her husband?&nbsp;&nbsp;The world became fascinated by this case due to a documentary called “The Staircase” which chronicled the run up to Michael’s trial as well as his post conviction appeals through 2018. HBO Max has made the docuseries into a scripted show, starring Toni Collette as Kathleen and Colin Firth as Micheal. The RCP team looks back at our original coverage of “The Staircase” documentary and compares it with the new show.&nbsp;How do both projects stack up to the truth?

      <title>Wondery Presents: The Execution of Bonny Lee Bakley</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On May 4, 2001, Bonny Lee Bakley was found fatally shot in a car on a dark North Hollywood street. The prime suspect was her husband, famed actor Robert Blake. But Bonny, a longtime con artist, had plenty of enemies. She left behind a trail of men she’d scammed, and she had a volatile relationship with Christian Brando, the troubled son of movie star Marlon Brando. Not since the O.J. Simpson case had the eyes of the nation been so fixated on a homicide. The search for Bonny’s killer took detectives on an eleven-month odyssey across the country and through Hollywood's underbelly of hustlers, drug addicts, and would-be hitmen. It would be the most expensive murder investigation in LAPD history to date.</p><p>This is the story of Robert and Bonny’s toxic relationship, her shocking murder, and his chaotic trial. Did actor Robert Blake kill his wife? Or was the murder someone else's vendetta? From Wondery, and the team behind the hit series Hollywood &amp; Crime (The Dating Game Killer, The Wonderland Murders, Death of Starlet) comes a six-part series about love, obsession and fame gone wrong.

      <title>#378: Her Name Was Mariah Alvarez - Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We finish analyzing the heart wrenching case of Mariah Alvarez, the 2-year old who died of blunt force trauma to the head. Her mother Melissa Lucio was convicted of her murder and sentenced to death. But did Melissa in fact commit capital murder? Was she criminally neglectful of her child? Was she physically abusive? Was Mariah’s death an accidental fall down a steep stairs? Was Mariah abused by someone else? An eyewitness says someone else banged Mariah’s head on the floor that day.&nbsp;Was Mariah’s death a combination of all of these factors?

      <title>#377: Her Name Was Mariah Alvarez - Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In Harlingen, Texas on February 17, 2007, two year old Mariah Alvarez died of blunt force trauma to the head. Her small body was covered with bruises, possible bite marks, her arm had a spiral fracture and her spine and internal organs had also been injured. Mariah's mother Melissa Lucio said that Mariah died from an accidental fall down a staircase. Authorities said Melissa beat her own daughter to death. A jury agreed. Melissa received a death sentence in 2008. Fast forward to 2022, with Melissa's execution date approaching, public outcry stayed her death for now. Her defense is asking for a new trial to present evidence that was ignored by her previous counsel. But can we ever get to the truth?

      <title>#374: "Why Can't You See Me?" : The Victims of the U.K.'s Most Prolific Pedophile and Sexual Abuser (Part 1)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Samantha Brown was just 11 years old when then celebrity DJ Jimmy Savile started sexually assaulting her in a back room of her own church as she prepared the collection plates for mass.&nbsp;While daring to be nearly in plain sight of the congregation and the priest, Savile would cover her mouth and do whatever he wanted with her. This happened at least 20 times throughout her youth. Same place, same time. Samantha often wondered at all the turned heads who never bothered to notice “WHY CAN’T YOU SEE ME?” she thought. Samantha is one of hundreds of children and others that Savile ruthlessly abused. Why couldn’t anyone see them, help them or stop him — for decades?&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we analyze this case of a serial pedophile and sexual abuser who hid in plain sight using the framework of a new Netflix documentary "Jimmy Savile - A British Horror Story".</p><p>#hernameisSamanthaBrown</p><p>#hundredsofvictims</p><p>#whycan'tyouseeme?</p><p>#netflix</p><p>#jimmysavile</p><p>#britishhorrorstory</p><p><br></p><p>OUR SPONSORS MAKE OUR SHOW POSSIBLE, PLEASE SUPPORT THEM!</p><p>BOMBAS - Bombas designed their socks, shirts, and underwear to be the clothes you can’t wait to put on every day.Everything they make is soft, seamless, tagless, and has a luxuriously cozy feel.

      <title>#373: Phoenix Rising (Part 2)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We continue to analyze the HBO docuseries “Phoenix Rising” about Evan Rachel Wood. At the age of 18, Wood was pursued by a then 37-year-old rock icon. Their relationship spanned over four years, beginning with intensive flattery, then escalating to emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Looking back, she recognized a pattern of grooming and control tactics similar to those experienced by other survivors, who told their stories of harrowing experiences at the hands of this same offender. What is special about this film is its intimate, personal portrayal of not only Evan’s life –– a chronicle of how she fell down the rabbit hole and ultimately climbed her way back out –– but also of the importance of community and solidarity to overcome.&nbsp;</p><p>#phoenixrising</p><p>#hbomax</p><p>#hbo</p><p>@HBO, @HBODocs, @HBOMax&nbsp;</p><p>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS</p><p>PROSE HAIRCARE - makes custom haircare that’s <u>effective</u> because it’s <u>personal</u>.

        <![CDATA[<p>When is the last time you watched a really good Nordy Noir set in some frozen tundra? Well, never fear, we are going to take you along with us to Finnish Lapland to meet Officer Nina Kautsalo, who is trying to figure out why young Russian women are being murdered in her tiny village of Ivalo bordering the Arctic Circle. Are they being sex trafficked? And is something even more terrifying afoot? Nina has a lot on her hands, she's a single mom to beautiful 6 year old Venla, she's trying to keep her ailing mother and rebellious sister safe -- plus she's a hard working cop smarter than her superiors. You will love the characters, layered story line and the fact that most of the show is spoken in English. (Speaking of layers! Lisa is loving the sweaters in this series.) Season one of Arctic Circle is available on <a href="https://www.topic.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.topic.com</a> OR on Amazon Prime with a free trial of the Topic streaming platform.

      <title>#368: Debriefing on Will Smith, Chris Rock, and Jada Pinkett Smith</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Jim and Lisa are joined by artist, actress and activist Lili Bernard to debrief about the dramatic, confusing and shocking incident that unfolded between Will Smith and Chris Rock during the 2022 Oscars.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>It is the stuff that gothic horror movies are made of, but instead of fiction,&nbsp;the story of the missing children of Tuam, Ireland, is tragically real. Using the framework of the stunning documentary streaming now on the Topic platform, “The Missing Children”, Laura, Jim and Lisa analyze this case that involves multiple layers of treachery, abuse and as Laura says “evil”. If 796 children went missing in your town, there would be an uproar. If year after year, 30 to 40 babies died in the care of those who were responsible for their well being your community would demand answers. So why did no one question this when it happened to these particular children. Your blood will boil when you hear the answers.&nbsp;</p><p>We dedicate this podcast series to International Women's Day 2022 to honor all the women and children victims and survivors.

      <title>#358: Lauren Smith-Fields - Part 3 | Family Attorney Darnell Crosland</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We interview Attorney Darnell Crosland who represents both Lauren Smith-Fields' and Brenda Rawls' families. Jim gives expert advice regarding hair analysis and the investigation. Laura asks Darnell about the timeline of Lauren's death and the response by Bridgeport Police and the Mayor’s office. Lisa asks if several pieces of evidence have been collected by police and if tests have been conducted by the medical examiner. Attorney Crosland explains the failure of law enforcement to undertake a basic investigation in order to establish the manner of death. He highlights the importance of listening to the family in establishing a timeline as well as key evidence they believe they identified in the case.&nbsp;</p><p>#HerNamewasLaurenSmithFields</p><p>#LaurenSmithFields</p><p>#HerNameWasBrendaRawls</p><p>#BrendaRawls</p><p>#DoYourDamnJob</p><p>#VictimsMatter</p><p>#WomenMatter</p><p>Clips used in this episode can been seen here in their entirety:</p><p><a href="https://thereal.com/videos/full-interview-lauren-smith-fields-family-blames-police-for-botched-investigation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://thereal.com/videos/full-interview-lauren-smith-fields-family-blames-police-for-botched-investigation/</a></p><p>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS.

        <![CDATA[<p>We interview Attorney Darnell Crosland who represents both Lauren Smith-Fields' and Brenda Rawls' families. Jim gives expert advice regarding hair analysis and the investigation. Laura asks Darnell about the timeline of Lauren's death and the response by Bridgeport Police and the Mayor’s office. Lisa asks if several pieces of evidence have been collected by police and if tests have been conducted by the medical examiner. Attorney Crosland explains the failure of law enforcement to undertake a basic investigation in order to establish the manner of death. He highlights the importance of listening to the family in establishing a timeline as well as key evidence they believe they identified in the case.&nbsp;</p><p>#HerNamewasLaurenSmithFields</p><p>#LaurenSmithFields</p><p>#HerNameWasBrendaRawls</p><p>#BrendaRawls</p><p>#DoYourDamnJob</p><p>#VictimsMatter</p><p>#WomenMatter</p><p>Clips used in this episode can been seen here in their entirety:</p><p><a href="https://thereal.com/videos/full-interview-lauren-smith-fields-family-blames-police-for-botched-investigation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://thereal.com/videos/full-interview-lauren-smith-fields-family-blames-police-for-botched-investigation/</a></p><p>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS.

      <title>#354: Akia Eggleston &amp; Relisha Rudd | "Black &amp; Missing" -  Part 6</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We finish our coverage of the HBO docu-series "Black and Missing" by focusing&nbsp;on the cases of Tamika Huston, Akia Eggleston and Relisha Rudd. Tamika's disappearance&nbsp;and her family's frustration with getting media attention led Natalie and Derricka Wilson to form the Black and Missing organization. Akia, an expectant mother, went missing and it was shockingly difficult for her family to get the police to take it seriously. Eight year old Relisha Rudd was missing for almost an entire month before anyone reported it to the police. How did this happen? You won't believe these heartbreaking cases.&nbsp;</p><p>#hernamewasTamikaHuston</p><p>#hernamewasAkiaEggleston</p><p>#hernamewasRelishaRudd</p><p>#blackandmissing</p><p>#neverstopsearching</p><p>#soledado'brien</p><p>#derricawilson</p><p>#nathaliewilson</p><p>#hbodocumentaries</p><p>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS</p><p>BOLL &amp; BRANCH SHEETS&nbsp;-</p><p>The Signature Hemmed Sheets from Boll &amp; Branch are a best-seller for a reason.

        <![CDATA[<p>We finish our coverage of the HBO docu-series "Black and Missing" by focusing&nbsp;on the cases of Tamika Huston, Akia Eggleston and Relisha Rudd. Tamika's disappearance&nbsp;and her family's frustration with getting media attention led Natalie and Derricka Wilson to form the Black and Missing organization. Akia, an expectant mother, went missing and it was shockingly difficult for her family to get the police to take it seriously. Eight year old Relisha Rudd was missing for almost an entire month before anyone reported it to the police. How did this happen? You won't believe these heartbreaking cases.&nbsp;</p><p>#hernamewasTamikaHuston</p><p>#hernamewasAkiaEggleston</p><p>#hernamewasRelishaRudd</p><p>#blackandmissing</p><p>#neverstopsearching</p><p>#soledado'brien</p><p>#derricawilson</p><p>#nathaliewilson</p><p>#hbodocumentaries</p><p>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS</p><p>BOLL &amp; BRANCH SHEETS&nbsp;-</p><p>The Signature Hemmed Sheets from Boll &amp; Branch are a best-seller for a reason.

      <title>#353: Kennedi High &amp; Pam Butler | "Black &amp; Missing" - Part 5</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Jim and Laura analyze the cases of Kennedi High, Pam Butler and Tamika Huston. 16 year old Kennedi High went missing after being lured away from home by men who took advantage of her vulnerability due to her autism. When Pam Butler and Tamika Huston went missing, their families desperately searched for them, and tried to get the national media's attention to help them get the word out -- to no avail. Police had strong suspicions about who was responsible in each case-- but needed the public's help to find answers.

      <title>#352: Elon Wilson &amp; Banaz Mahmod | "Black and Missing" - Part 4</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, we discuss a different kind of “missing person”, those who are missing from the lives of their families due to police misconduct, and wrongful arrests. Such was the case for Elon Wilson, Natalie’s son, a former D.C. firefighter who spent almost two years in prison after a “pretextual” traffic stop, by then Officer Jonathan A. Freitag. Elon was released after it was discovered that Freitag lied about what happened and had a history of racially motivated stops.&nbsp;Laura also talks about a case that came across her desk where law enforcement had many intervention opportunities. Banaz Mahmod, a 20-year-old woman in South London went to police several times.</p><p>Banaz asked the police for help. She told them she was&nbsp;</p><p>‘going to be the victim of an “honor killing”. She even gave them the names of the men who would kill her - orchestrated by her own father and uncle. When Banaz went missing there were already so many red flags that police should have realized the danger she was in.

      <title>RCP on FB Live Answering Listener Questions</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Laura, Jim and Lisa recorded a FB Live holiday gathering! The team got to interact with their listeners, answer questions and generally chat about anything and everything! It was was great to see everyone's comments and thoughts in the moment and discuss the cases that are important to our supporters.

      <title>#346: How Law Enforcement Can Help Victims of Color: The Building Bridges Project - Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We continue our interview with the Building Bridges Project team leaders Richard Washington and Marianna Wells — a program of the National Center for Victims of Crime. Richard points out that while there is a legacy of communities and families feeling uncomfortable reporting crimes to law enforcement — all it can take is ONE law enforcement officer who is&nbsp;trained and trauma informed&nbsp;to help make someone come forward with information about a crime. Support of victims and witnesses is critical. Laura talks about how accountability is important and that is what leads to trust. Jim explains how language and communication are critical skills in rapport building. Lisa wonders if communities don’t only mistrust police, but also fear retaliation for reporting crime.&nbsp;</p><p>To find out more about Building Bridges:</p><p><a href="https://victimsofcrime.org/building-bridges-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://victimsofcrime.org/building-bridges-project/</a></p><p>If you are a victim of crime, please look at all the resources available from the National Center for Victims of Crime&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://victimsofcrime.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://victimsofcrime.org</a></p><p>#buildingbridgesproject</p><p>#nationalcenterforvictimsofcrime</p><p>#supportvictims</p><p>#supportwitnesses</p><p>#traumainformedtraining</p><p>#victimsresources</p><p>To see the clips used in this episode in their entirety click below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxal22JbeBA</p><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rebuilding-the-publics-trust-in-the-police/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rebuilding-the-publics-trust-in-the-police/</a></p><p>************************************************************************************************</p><p>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS DURING THIS SEASON OF GIFT GIVING</p><p>THRIVE CAUSMETICS - Need to multitask your evening routine?

      <title>#344: Devil In Disguise: Honoring the Victims and Deconstructing a Serial Rapist/Killer' - Part 3</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We continue our analysis of a serial killer who raped and murdered at least 33 young men and boys. Jim points out how in this case and others, law enforcement assumed that all sex between gay men is consensual, and as a result they often did not take seriously reports of rape.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they had, they might have stopped JG sooner when victims came forward accusing him of rape. Laura explains why it is so important not to give sensationalistic monikers to these offenders and why at Real Crime Profile we do our best to not name them. Lisa asks about the post execution conspiracy theory posited by some, that JG was part of a large child sex trafficking ring.&nbsp;</p><p>#DevilinDiguise</p><p>#Peacock</p><p>#VictimsMatter #SerialKiller #Profiling #BehavioralAnalysis</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS!

        <![CDATA[<p>We continue our analysis of a serial killer who raped and murdered at least 33 young men and boys. Jim points out how in this case and others, law enforcement assumed that all sex between gay men is consensual, and as a result they often did not take seriously reports of rape.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they had, they might have stopped JG sooner when victims came forward accusing him of rape. Laura explains why it is so important not to give sensationalistic monikers to these offenders and why at Real Crime Profile we do our best to not name them. Lisa asks about the post execution conspiracy theory posited by some, that JG was part of a large child sex trafficking ring.&nbsp;</p><p>#DevilinDiguise</p><p>#Peacock</p><p>#VictimsMatter #SerialKiller #Profiling #BehavioralAnalysis</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS!

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Just over a month ago, a scathing report was released confirming that top health officials knew for years about a pedophile pediatrician sexually abusing Native American boys at at least two Indian Heath Service hospitals.&nbsp;Though many of his co workers reported their fears about him to their superiors, Stanley Patrick Weber was allowed to practice for almost 20 years, abusing untold numbers of young indigenous boys — some as young as eight years old — before his&nbsp;conviction in 2020.&nbsp;One witness who was finally called to testify in the trial, Nurse David Marsh, is our guest today. David talks to us about what it was like at the dysfunctional Pine Ridge Hospital in South Dakota with Weber.

      <title>#338: On-Set Gun Safety and the Death of Halyna Hutchins</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Today we talk about the tragic accident that took the life of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins while working on the set of the movie “Rust” in New Mexico.&nbsp;Hutchins was accidentally shot during a scene rehearsal by actor Alec Baldwin who had been handed what he thought was a “cold” gun, which discharged as he was practicing drawing the weapon from his holster. To help us understand on-set gun safety protocol, and what should or should not have happened in this case, is Jon Barton, who is an Independent Weapons Expert and Professional Military Consultant for Film and Television. Jon has worked on projects such as J.A.G., Punisher, NCIS, and Criminal Minds. Details are still emerging, and many questions still need answering but one thing is for sure — Halyna was failed miserably by many people who’s job it was to keep her, and everyone else on the set, safe. We want to express our condolence to Halyna’s family. She left behind a husband of 16 years, and young son. By all accounts she was a brilliant up and coming DP.&nbsp;Named one of the American Society of Cinematographers' (ASC) <a href="https://ascmag.com/articles/rising-stars-of-cinematography-2019" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rising Stars</a> in 2019, she told <em>American Cinematographer</em> magazine, "You need to develop your own vision, but the key to a successful film is communication with your director and your team."&nbsp;</p><p>Halyna was a graduate of the American Film Institute who have established a Memorial Scholarship in her honor.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.afi.com/halyna-hutchins-scholarship-fund/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.afi.com/halyna-hutchins-scholarship-fund/</a></p><p><br></p><p>SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS!!!</p><p>SIMPLISAFE - Imagine if every crime could be halted before it happened?

      <title>#332: Gabby Petito: Deconstructing the Body Cam Footage</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On August 12, 2021, Gabrielle Petito and Brian Laundrie were pulled over outside of Moab, Utah.&nbsp;The police officer, whose body cam was on, initially stopped their van for speeding and reckless driving.&nbsp;He realized Gabby was distraught and tried to establish what had happened and why Gabby was so upset. He was soon joined by another officer who had been responding to a possible domestic violence call in town where a witness said he saw a couple driving away in a white van, with a woman named Gabby.&nbsp;What happens next on the body cam footage is disturbing to watch. Jim and Laura breakdown the behavior of Gabby, Brian and the officers in that 1 hour and 17 minute tape and discuss the police interaction and other intervention opportunities and strategies that should have been considered. What these officers desperately needed was the DASH risk assessment tool, that Laura created, so they could have asked the most important questions, and really understood Gabby's answers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>DASH Risk Model&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.dashriskchecklist.co.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.dashriskchecklist.co.uk</a></p><p><a href="https://www.laurarichards.co.uk/deep-diving-coercive-control/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.laurarichards.co.uk/deep-diving-coercive-control/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sign the petition to criminalize coercive control in the US</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/domestic-violence-law-reform-coercive-control-usa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.change.org/p/domestic-violence-law-reform-coercive-control-usa</a></p><p><br></p><p>By Supporting our Sponsors, you make our podcast possible, and make educating and helping victims and survivors happen!

She talks about her numerous calls to other police departments, calls to the FBI, follow ups on other similar cases and complaints, collecting all kinds of evidence — yet many times her efforts were brushed off by the very people who should have been welcoming her leads.

      <title>#325: Victim F Part 8 - Sergeant Misty Carausu</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We interview former Sergeant Misty Carausu of the Dublin Police Department, who became instrumental in connecting the dots in Denise and Aaron’s case. While investigating a home robbery, assault and attempted kidnapping of a family in Dublin, California (40 miles away from Vallejo) , Sergeant Carausu became concerned that the suspect they had in custody for that crime might have committed other home invasions. One seemingly small clue that she noticed — a strand of blonde hair stuck to a pair of blacked out goggles — led her on a dogged search for more victims. Misty&nbsp;talks about searching the offender’s home in South Lake Tahoe and paraphernalia that she found which led her to ask more questions about other potentially linked crimes.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The clip used in this episode can be viewed in its entirety here:</p><p><a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/story/survivors-called-girl-case-reflect-life-changing-experience-77964075" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/story/survivors-called-girl-case-reflect-life-changing-experience-77964075</a></p><p><br></p><p>LINK TO VICTIM F BOOK</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3fPBbo2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://amzn.to/3fPBbo2</a></p><p><br></p><p>We are so thankful for our sponsors.

      <title>#322: VICTIM F Part 5- Denise Huskins &amp; Aaron Quinn Interview</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We wrap up our follow-up conversation with Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn with Jim and Laura digging deeper into their case. Jim discusses the unusual dichotomy of the offender’s behavior as both sadistic in nature, and also presenting as a power-reassurance rapist — which could also indicate multiple offenders in this crime. Laura talks about how dangerous perpetrators are able to get out of prison due to both the mistakes by law enforcement and also their cunning in gaming the system.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>You can read Denise and Aaron’s book, co-written with investigative journalist Nicole Weisensee Egan "Victim F" available now on Amazon.&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3dhzvCJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://amzn.to/3dhzvCJ</a></p><p><br></p><p>#VictimF</p><p>#DeniseHuskins</p><p>#AaronQuinn</p><p>#NicoleWeisenseeEgan</p><p>#believevictims</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>CLIPS PLAYED IN TODAY’S EPISODE CAN BE HEARD IN THEIR ENTIRETY HERE:</strong></p><p>Denise Huskins, Aaron Quinn Want Vallejo Police to "Make Changes to Be Better" | The View</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Z0Hc03N9l-E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Z0Hc03N9l-E</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Gone Girl' Case: Break in Bizarre Kidnapping – ABC News</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/IhZxY4cPOwo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/IhZxY4cPOwo</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS</strong></p><p><br></p><p>GROVE - Choosing products that are better for you and the planet has never been easier.

        <![CDATA[<p>We wrap up our follow-up conversation with Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn with Jim and Laura digging deeper into their case. Jim discusses the unusual dichotomy of the offender’s behavior as both sadistic in nature, and also presenting as a power-reassurance rapist — which could also indicate multiple offenders in this crime. Laura talks about how dangerous perpetrators are able to get out of prison due to both the mistakes by law enforcement and also their cunning in gaming the system.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>You can read Denise and Aaron’s book, co-written with investigative journalist Nicole Weisensee Egan "Victim F" available now on Amazon.&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3dhzvCJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://amzn.to/3dhzvCJ</a></p><p><br></p><p>#VictimF</p><p>#DeniseHuskins</p><p>#AaronQuinn</p><p>#NicoleWeisenseeEgan</p><p>#believevictims</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>CLIPS PLAYED IN TODAY’S EPISODE CAN BE HEARD IN THEIR ENTIRETY HERE:</strong></p><p>Denise Huskins, Aaron Quinn Want Vallejo Police to "Make Changes to Be Better" | The View</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Z0Hc03N9l-E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Z0Hc03N9l-E</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Gone Girl' Case: Break in Bizarre Kidnapping – ABC News</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/IhZxY4cPOwo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/IhZxY4cPOwo</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS</strong></p><p><br></p><p>GROVE - Choosing products that are better for you and the planet has never been easier.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Denise and Aaron continue telling us their harrowing story.&nbsp;&nbsp;They describe the humiliation and callous treatment that law enforcement put them through -- from interrogating Aaron for eighteen&nbsp;hours, to giving&nbsp;Denise the incredibly&nbsp;disrespectful (and FALSE) moniker of "Gone Girl". Aaron and Denise also talk about how they were saved by the determined detective&nbsp;work of Misty Carausu -- who was working in a&nbsp;completely different county on a different&nbsp;case.&nbsp;Yet she managed to connect the dots Vallejo&nbsp;police&nbsp;could not (or would not).&nbsp;Lastly, the&nbsp;couple talks about&nbsp;the&nbsp;healing process of writing the book "Victim F" together.</p><p>#victimsmatter</p><p>#denisehuskins</p><p>#aaronquinn</p><p>#victimfbook</p><p>#nicoleweisenseeegan</p><p><br></p><p>The clips you hear excerpted in our episode can be heard in their entirety&nbsp;here:</p><p>ABC - 7: Survivors of Vallejo 'Gone Girl' case respond after police apologize for calling them liars</p><p>https://youtu.be/I_SXgJFxSl4</p><p>ABC - 7: California police department apologizes more than 6 years after calling kidnapping a hoax</p><p>https://youtu.be/xUgkeuS-V68</p><p><br></p><p>AUDIBLE ORIGINAL - THE FIRST WIFE: JOHN MEEHAN'S REIGHT OF TERROR.

      <title>#317: VICTIM F (Part 1) - Denise Huskins &amp; Aaron Quinn Interview</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This episode is our first in a series about an extraordinary case called "Victim F." In March 2015, Denise Huskins and her boyfriend Aaron Quinn awoke at 3am to a nightmare. Armed men bound and drugged them, then abducted Denise, warning Aaron not to call the police or she would be killed. Aaron agonized about what to do. Finally he put his trust in law enforcement and dialed 911. Instead of searching for Denise, the police accused Aaron of her murder. Days later, when Denise was let go, instead of pursuing her abductors, they turned on her, accusing her of faking her own kidnapping. In their book, "Victim F" Aaron&nbsp;and Denise recount the horrific&nbsp;ordeal that followed. It is an unbelievable story that is all too true. You can read their book, co-written with investigative journalist Nicole Weisensee Egan "Victim F" available now on Amazon.&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3dhzvCJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://amzn.to/3dhzvCJ</a></p><p><br></p><p>#VictimF</p><p>#DeniseHuskins</p><p>#AaronQuinn</p><p>#NicoleWeisenseeEgan</p><p>#believevictims</p><p><br></p><p>The clips used in this episode are from ABC's 20/20 : Taken.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Today we begin our coverage of a horrific offender whom we are loathe to name, and a Netflix documentary series about his heinous crimes — who’s title we hate to repeat.

In 2013, Lisa cast actress Jan Broberg on an episode of Criminal Minds, as a mother in despair that her son had been kidnapped. What Lisa didn’t know was that in real life, Jan herself had been kidnapped, not once, but TWICE by a close family friend. Years later, Jan would tell her incredible story in the Netflix documentary “Abducted in Plain Sight”. Jim and Laura break down this offender’s behavior and his grooming of not only Jan, but of her family and an entire community. Laura teaches Jan a very important term she had never heard of before regarding her own case...“coercive control”. You won’t want to miss this.</p><p>You can watch the trailer here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLC-Fgfz6n4 " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLC-Fgfz6n4 </a></p><p><br></p><p>#hernameisJanBroberg</p><p>#netflix</p><p>#abductedinplainsight</p><p><br></p><p><strong>We are so thankful to our sponsors for their generous support that allows us to bring you our show.

Jim and Laura forensically deconstruct Fata’s behavior and the real motives behind his despicable actions.

      <itunes:summary>The full RCP team of Laura Richards, Jim Clemente and Lisa Zambetti reunite to interview co-directors Trey Borzillieri and Barbara Schroeder about the genesis of the Netflix show "Evil Genius: The True Story of America's Most Diabolical Bank Heist." 

We go behind the scenes and ask the documentarians the tough questions that are still burning after the final twist lands at the end of the four part docuseries. We debate the answers that Trey and Barbara give and the evidence to support it including material which did not make it onto our screens. 




In this episode, burning questions include how Trey and Barbara come into contact with this baffling case, the extent of Brian Wells's involvement, Brian's nonchalant affect, demeanour and behaviour at the bank, who was involved in the so-called scavenger hunts in Eerie and the context and detail of Trey's relationship with Marjorie Diel-Armstrong and Bill Rothstein.

      <itunes:summary>Laura Richards talks with special guest David Challen, the son of Sally Challen, who is currently in prison serving an 18 year sentence for the murder of Richard Challen in 2011.

During her trial jurors were told that she attacked him with a hammer whilst he ate his lunch at the kitchen table of the former marital home.




David is leading the charge to free his mother from prison and tells Laura about what it was like growing up at home and what his mother and father's relationship was really like behind closed doors.




Since Sally's conviction, the concept of coercive control has been introduced into law following the successful Domestic Violence Law Reform Campaign spearheaded byLaura Richards in partnership with Women's Aid and Sara Charlton Charitable Foundation. 




Given the advances in law and analysis of coercive control, Sally's murder conviction is now being looked at with fresh eyes and challenged in the courts setting a precedent in UK law.  To read more about Sally's case and to help support Sally go to:

      <itunes:episode>129</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>Laura Richards and Lisa Zambetti continue their interview with Melissa Moore, the daughter of Keith Jespersen, whose terrible moniker was “The Happy Face Killer”. 

He murdered at least 8 women during the early 1990s and at least one victim, Daun, survived.

Melissa talks about the difficult meeting with Michelle, Taunja Bennett’s sister, her discussions with her father about killing the victims and the impact it’s had on her life and family.

We ask the difficult questions about what was going on behind closed doors and whether were there any warning signs that he was a danger to women and girls? 

We re-balance the narrative by talking about the victims, honouring their names and lives, remembering them and learning from their deaths:

#HerNameWasTaunjaBennett

#HerNameWasClaudia

#HerNameWasCynthiaLynRose

#HerNameWasLaurieAnnPentland

#HerNameWasJane

#HerNameWasSusanne

#HerNameWasAngelaSubrize

#HerNameWasJuliaAnnWinningham

#HerNameISDaunRichert-Slagle

      <itunes:summary>Laura Richards and Lisa Zambetti interview Melissa Moore, the daughter of Keith Jespersen, whose terrible moniker was “The Happy Face Killer”. 




He murdered at least 8 women during the early 1990s and at least one victim, Daun, survived.




We ask difficult questions of Melissa about her life: what was going on behind closed doors; were there any warning signs that he was a danger to women and girls, and highlight the lessons to be learned.




We re-balance the narrative by talking about the victims, honouring their names and lives, remembering them and learning from their deaths:




#HerNameWasTaunjaBennett

#HerNameWasClaudia

#HerNameWasCynthiaLynRose

#HerNameWasLaurieAnnPentland

#HerNameWasJane

#HerNameWasSusanne

#HerNameWasAngelaSubrize

      <itunes:summary>The RCP team discuss the Belfast Rugby Rape trial, a trial that lasted 42 days and reached a conclusion last Wednesday 28 March 2018.

It took the jury just 3 hours and 45 of deliberations (the amount of time it takes to do one laundry cycle) to acquit the accused Paddy Jackson, Stuart Olding, Blane Mcllory and Rory Harrison on all counts.

Paddy Jackson, 26 and Stuart Olding, 25, were charged with rape after a night out in Belfast on June 28 2016.

Blane McIlory, 26, was charged with indecent exposure and Rory Harrison, 25, with perverting the course of justice and withholding information. All four pleaded not guilty.

The team debate the case, decisions taken and the evidence presented. The bottom line in trials always comes down to one question, particularly in rape trials - who do you believe?




Here's a sample of the text messages that passed between the men that night following the alleged rape. Source https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/inside-court-12-the-complete-story-of-the-belfast-rape-trial-1.3443620 




The prosecution concluded its case by reading the texts exchanged between the men on June 28th, 2016, some of which had been deleted and later recovered. Jackson, Olding and McIlroy were members of a WhatsApp group called JACOME, the jury heard. The name comes from their initials and the initials of other friends not before the court. In the group, Jackson and Olding boasted about “spit-roasting” the woman.

This word was a point of contention in the trial. The defence maintained “spit-roasting” could mean any sexual activity involving two men and a woman while the prosecution suggested it very specifically means a woman penetrated orally and vaginally by two men at the same time.

To prove this the prosecution had hired an expert in slang language to write a report on the exact meaning of the word, although this was never presented in court.

Just before noon on June 28th, McIlroy had asked in a message: “What the f*** was going on? Last night was hilarious.” A subsequent message was not recovered, however McIlroy followed that up with: “really f*** sake” and “Did U calm her and where did she live.” Harrison immediately replied; “Mate no jokes she was in hysterics” and “Wasn’t going to end well.”

Other messages gave an insight into the highly chauvinistic tenor of the men’s conversations. “Any sluts get fucked?” one friend asked Olding that day. “Pumped a girl with Jacko on Monday. Roasted her. Then another on Tuesday night,” McIlroy texted another person.

And “love Belfast sluts”– a text from McIlroy attached to a picture of Dara Florence and her two friends taken at the party. Those were the texts heard by the jury.

The texts were banter and immature boasting according to the defence, the words of young men who were egging each other on. O’Donoghue, for McIlroy, called them “a titillating sideshow” with no evidential value. For the prosecution, they were evidence of a complete lack of respect for women.

Last night was hilarious.” A subsequent message was not recovered, however McIlroy followed that up with: “really f*** sake” and “Did U calm her and where did she live.” Harrison immediately replied; “Mate no jokes she was in hysterics” and “Wasn’t going to end well.”</p><p>Other messages gave an insight into the highly chauvinistic tenor of the men’s conversations. “Any sluts get fucked?” one friend asked Olding that day. “Pumped a girl with Jacko on Monday. Roasted her. Then another on Tuesday night,” McIlroy texted another person.</p><p>And “love&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Belfast" target="_blank">Belfast</a>&nbsp;sluts”– a text from McIlroy attached to a picture of Dara Florence and her two friends taken at the party. Those were the texts heard by the jury.</p><p>The texts were banter and immature boasting according to the defence, the words of young men who were egging each other on. O’Donoghue, for McIlroy, called them “a titillating sideshow” with no evidential value. For the prosecution, they were evidence of a complete lack of respect for women.</p><p>WHO DO YOU BELIEVE?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Notes</p><p>Inside Court 12: the complete story of the Belfast rape trial</p><p>by Conor Gallagher - The Irish Times   https://twitter.com/ConorGallaghe_r</p><p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/inside-court-12-the-complete-story-of-the-belfast-rape-trial-1.3443620" target="_blank">https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/inside-court-12-the-complete-story-of-the-belfast-rape-trial-1.3443620</a></p><p><br></p><p>#WeStandWithHer</p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>The RCP team continue to follow the six-part Netflix event #Wormwood —a true-crime docuseries about the death of Dr Frank Olson —directed by Errol Morris.

Was Dr Frank Olson pushed, did he jump or was he thrown when he "went out the window" of a room in New York City’s Statler Hotel on November 28 1953?




There's some significant reveals in the next three episodes. The night manager at the hotel contacts Eric and tells him about a telephone call he overheard the night Dr Olson died. The telephone call is a game changer.




The family take a tough decision to have Dr Frank Olson's body exhumed - and the findings challenge the narrative that the family have been told over the years. 




There's only one logical conclusion that can be reached that makes all the evidence make sense by the end of #Wormwood - and true to its namesake, it leaves a very bitter aftertaste.

Urgent and swift action is now required learning the lessons from the UK and Australia.

      <itunes:summary>The #RCP team analyse and discuss the penultimate episode of season 1 of the Netflix show Mindhunter.

The FBI profilers interview another prolific serial killer who doesn't want to talk. Holden goes on the proactive and goes "off-script" to rapport with him, a tactic that has lasting repercussions. 

Our team debate the merits of his strategy and behaviour to gain insight and potentially useful and actionable intelligence to assist operationally. Or is Holden becoming a liability potentially putting their pioneering work at risk?

The team gets into it. 

This episode is dedicated to the memory of Robert Ressler and Roy Hazelwood, two great pioneers of profiling.




“He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster . . . when you gaze long into the abyss the abyss also gazes into you” - Friedrich Nietzche

      <itunes:summary>The #RCP discuss Episode #8 of the Netflix show "Mindhunter" and the case of the creepy foot tickler. The team profile Principal Wade's behaviour: is it something or nothing?

Professor Wendy Carr (played by Anna Torv), expresses outright confusion. “I can’t imagine why you would go after a respected school principal with no history of abuse,” she says. 

But what do our profilers conclude? We discuss the role of age appropriate and healthy relationships education with children and the importance of early identification, intervention and prevention.

        <![CDATA[<p>Laura Richards and Lisa Zambetti have a lot more to say about Dirty John; a serial stalker and domestic abuse perpetrator who coercively controls his victims and stalks them on separation.

Laura gives further insight and analysis about his behavior, his targeting of victims, Cindi's murder and the high risk factors to serious harm and homicide in domestic abuse and stalking cases.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode Laura (who is in London via Skype) and Lisa (who is at home in LA) discuss behavioral profiling and cases including James Bulger who was tragically tortured and murdered in February 1993 in Merseyside by two ten year old boys. This case has a contextual bearing and resonance with the Robin Hood Hills case. They then discuss Jessie Misskelley and his "confessions".</p><p>Please note that in this episode, we refer to 2 year old James Bulger as "Jamie Bulger" which is the name we had always heard in the media. However, we now understand that his family prefers him to be called James. While we can not go back and re-record this episode, we wanted to apologize for this error.</p><p>Health Warning: this podcast contains graphic material that maybe upsetting to listeners&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>#HisNameWasJamesBulger</p><p>#HisNameWasStevie</p><p>#HisNameWasMichael</p><p>#HisNameWasChristopher</p><p><br></p><p>New to Real Crime Profile?

      <description>
        <![CDATA[The Real Crime Profile team (Jim Clemente, Laura Richards and Lisa Zambetti) are honored to be joined by special guest, Bill Thomas, brother of Cathy Thomas.

Cathy and Rebecca Dowski were found strangled with their throats cut at a Colonial Parkway overlook on October 12, 1986. From 1986 to 1989, four young couples died at the hands of what the FBI long ago concluded was most likely the work of a serial killer, or killers. Nobody was ever arrested.

Our profiling team, Jim and Laura, dive deep into this case and offer insight into the cases that are linked and a profile of the killer.
