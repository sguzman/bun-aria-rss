      <title>Episode 132: Joakim Noah</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Our guest this week is none other than Chicago Bulls legend, Joakim Noah. This is about as meaty as a conversation gets with topics discussed from his childhood to prime Derek Rose and so much more. But first, JJ and Tommy talk about the early MVP race and how Giannis Antetokounmpo should be the favorite now. Then we immediately get to Joakim Noah. Topics include: Joakim's comments on Cleveland, Joakim's childhood and how he fell in love with basketball, how he landed at Florida and won two National Championships, why he returned to Florida after winning his first National Championship, his rookie season in Chicago where his team voted to suspend him, the nature of things leaking in a locker room like the Jordan Poole / Draymond Green situation, that classic 2009 playoff series between The Chicago Bulls and The Boston Celtics, what it was like playing with prime Derrick Rose, the hope Derrick gave to the city of Chicago, Joakim's recruitment of Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James, his thoughts on his ruthless competitiveness today, his time on The New York Knicks, fighting with his head coach Jeff Hornacek, getting another chance with The Memphis Grizzlies, finally retiring from basketball, the work he's doing now with The BAL (Basketball Africa League), Obama's 50th Birthday party game with Kobe Bryant and LeBron James and so much more.</p><p><br></p><p>Subscribe to The Old Man and The Three on YouTube and wherever you get your podcasts AND <a href="http://www.amazon.com/OM3_us_hfd_wiaa_110122" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Listen to OM3 Things on Amazon Music</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><em>If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL/IN/LA/MI/NJ/TN/PA/WV/WY), 1-800-NEXT STEP (AZ), 1-800-522-4700 (CO/KS/NH), 888-789-7777/visit ccpg.org (CT), 1-800-BETS OFF (IA), 877-8-HOPENY/text HOPENY (467369) (NY), visit OPGR.org (OR), or 1-888-532-3500 (VA).</em></p><p><em>21+ (18+ NH/WY).

      <title>Episode 131: Tyronn Lue: The Coaching Series</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We are proud to present a new installment of The Old Man and The Three's 'Coaching Series' where we dive deep into the insights and strategy of the top coaches in basketball. In this episode, we welcome former NBA player, form Head Coach of The NBA Champion Cleveland Cavaliers and current head coach of The Los Angeles Clippers, Tyronn Lue. Ty Lue has cemented himself as one of the best coaches in The NBA and we are so psyched to share this conversation. Topics include: Ty's brief time playing with JJ Redick in Orlando, how he first got into coaching, what he learned from Doc Rivers in Boston, what he learned from Phil Jackson on The Los Angeles Lakers, why he feels former players are uniquely suited to coach in The NBA, what it was like coaching LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love on The Cleveland Cavaliers, the unique way he inspired and motivated his team when they were down 3-1 to The Golden State Warriors in the 2016 NBA Finals, coaching Kawhi Leonard on The Los Angeles Clippers, his message to The Clippers going into this season, what he learned from playing with Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan and what makes those guys different from everyone else and of course we had to ask about the iconic Allen Iverson step-over. Also in this episode, JJ and Tommy discuss their initial takaways from the first week of the NBA season and JJ clears the air on a Lakers take that has since been aggregated and criticized.</p><p><br></p><p>Subscribe to The Old Man and The Three podcast w/ JJ Redick and Tommy Alter on YouTube and wherever you get your podcasts.</p><p><br></p><p><em>If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL/IN/LA/MI/NJ/TN/PA/WV/WY), 1-800-NEXT STEP (AZ), 1-800-522-4700 (CO/KS/NH), 888-789-7777/visit ccpg.org (CT), 1-800-BETS OFF (IA), 877-8-HOPENY/text HOPENY (467369) (NY), visit OPGR.org (OR), or 1-888-532-3500 (VA).</em></p><p><em>21+ (18+ NH/WY).

      <title>Episode 130: Donovan Mitchell</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode of The Old Man and The Three, we are joined by brand new Cleveland Cavalier, Donovan Mitchell.

      <title>Episode 125: Jalen Brunson</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[There are life changing moments in sports... and there are life changing moments in life itself. Jalen Brunson has recently experienced both with one crucial decision, as he signed a big contract to play center stage for the New York Knicks. Money from the new contract? Sure, that's life changing. Calling Madison Square Garden your home and satisfying Knick fans? That's your life changing sports moment. Only time will tell if the latter of those two statements comes true, but listening to Jalen speak, it's easy to come away with a healthy dose of confidence that he will get the job done on every level. In this conversation, Jalen shows the personal insight and basketball IQ that makes him so special on and off the court. And that should be music to every Knicks fan's ears.

      <title>Episode 121: Kendrick Perkins</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Wow. Sometimes there's not much more you can say than just... wow. On the court, Kendrick Perkins was a fierce competitor who backed down from no one. As a member of the media? Well, he's pretty much the same. There's really no subject that is off limits and there is virtually no team, player, or media member he won't take on. Which is a big reason why this interview is so damn good. Perk just tells it like it is, plain and simple. He speaks the truth as he sees it, and if it ruffles some feathers along the way, then so be it. It's part of the reason JJ and Tommy have been working long and hard to get him on the show, and now that he finally made it on, boy does he deliver. Sit back and enjoy.

It's part of the reason JJ and Tommy have been working long and hard to get him on the show, and now that he finally made it on, boy does he deliver. Sit back and enjoy.

      <title>Episode 120: Grant Hill</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's not often that you hear of a player who suffered a devastating injury that radically changed his physical ability (an injury that also basically broke new medical ground along the way), but still went on to have a successful career. Well, how about one that did just that and is in the hall of fame? Enter Grant Hill. The former Duke legend and NBA HOF member joins JJ and Tommy for an incredible discussion that covers just about everything he went through during his career. From his days at Duke and the iconic full court pass to Christian Laettner to beat Kentucky, the relationships with Laettner and Hurley during those championship runs, all the way through his NBA career and what it was like to be considered the next MJ, and the difficult road he had to travel to get through the demoralizing and crushing ankle injury that nearly ended his career. The conversation is just like Grant himself - real, honest, humble, and outstanding.

You’ve seen him and JJ go ​at it on First Take countless times, ​and his voice is heard just about everywhere sports are being discussed. Now it’s his turn to pay a visit to JJ’s home turf. ​However, this time it​'​s a little different. ​On ​today's episode of the ​O​ld ​M​an ​& the ​T​hree, ​Stephen A is not necessarily here ​​for hot takes ​and x' & o's, but to give us insight into what makes the man behind the camera tick. He delves into his beginnings as a writer, his short lived hoops career, his relationships with the players past and present and how he deals with criticism, as well as his feelings on the game today and future plans. It's a part of Stephen A you seldom see and an outstanding interview for someone who wants to get a glance of what's behind the 'Stephen A' curtain.  ​

      <title>Episode 118: Gary Payton and Mikal Bridges</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[If you're an NBA fan, then you know exactly who we're talking about when the words "The Glove" are uttered. That's right, on the pod today is NBA Hall of Famer and one of the greatest defensive players to step on the court, Mr. Gary Payton. He discusses his career in full detail - from making the jump from a draft disappointment to an elite player, his journey to try and win that elusive ring, his presence on and off the court and what made him such a special talent. He also breaks down his partnership with Hennessy and their "Unfinished Business" campaign to help small businesses as part of the NBA 75th Anniversary. Now, you would think that's enough, but there's even more great conversation to cover as NBA correspondent Mikal Bridges joins the program as well. He starts everything off by addressing the Suns devastating playoff exit to the Mavs and tries to make sense of what went wrong. Then, after the Payton interview, he returns for the OM3 draft, which focuses on the "Top 5 dishes served at chain restaurants". It's a can't miss double shot on the OM3.

        <![CDATA[Episode 116: Trae Young
Darth Vader. The Joker. The Terminator. Trae Young? Hey, being a villain isn't easy, but some people just do it so damn well. Enter Trae Young. He'll drain a three from the logo, tell the defender how good he looked doing it, all the while giving the crowd a little shimmy just to drive home the point. On the court, he fears no one and seems to relish the villain role. But has it always been that way? In this wide ranging interview, you'll learn much more about Trae Young than his edge on the court. He delves into topics such as how he creates so much offense for a relatively small NBA frame, or how he reacted the first time the vitriol really started raining down from the stands, or what really gets him going on the floor. Plus, the guys dig deep into the X's and O's of the game and nerd out for a while as well. It's an outstanding interview that shows you a side of Trae that people don't often see.

      <title>Episode 115: Jose Alvarado</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[What makes a good player? To the casual NBA fan, oftentimes the bottom line is scoring. And let's be honest... many of the top players in the game are indeed elite scorers. But if you look a little closer, and you know the game well, you know that so many other aspects of the game are just as important. And if you can find a player that does the little things - whether it's taking a charge, diving for a loose ball, coming up with a key defensive stop - chances are you have yourself a winner. Well, Jose Alvarado does ALL of those things, and combines all of it with an atomic force of energy that gives opponents fits, and his teammates confidence. Jose joins JJ and Tommy for this incredibly humble interview and shows what makes him so special on and off the court.

      <title>Episode 114: Tim Legler</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Ok let's be honest, there are some basketball conversations - whether it be on TV, podcast or whatever - that just don't deliver anything concrete or new. Well, it's pretty much an ironclad lock that today's episode of the OM3 won't leave you feeling that way. That's because joining the pod is former NBA 10 year vet and current ESPN and Sirius XM NBA analyst Tim Legler, and the sheer amount of hoops talk that is covered is staggering. From a complete breakdown of the playoffs thus far, to Legler's playing career, what it was like playing in the 90's, the evolution of the game, social media pitfalls, Kobe and MJ, and more, there isn't much that wasn't discussed. An amazing pod for any hooper, especially with the playoffs in full swing. Don’t miss it.

        <![CDATA[After an incredible and historic OM3 run of NBA guests, things get turned around a bit on this episode of the Old Man & the Three. The guest is still outstanding in every way - that doesn't change - but his job description is a little different in that he's one of Hollywood's finest actors and comedians, as well as an award winning producer and director. Ladies and gentleman, the OM3 welcomes Ben Stiller. After a long wait, JJ and Tommy finally get to sit down with the comedy giant to discuss his career, as well as his love for basketball and the Knicks, what it's like working with the icons of Hollywood, his best and worst performances, his current projects, and so much more.

      <title>Episode 112: RJ Barrett</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Bing Bong! We’ve got an exciting episode this week featuring one of our most requested guests ever, New York Knicks star RJ Barrett. But first, we open with a few takeaways from this week’s NBA playoff games including Joel Embiid’s game winner and The Boston Celtics’ smothering defense on Kevin Durant. Then we’re joined by RJ and get his personal perspective on that Boston defense and how defenses change in general during the NBA playoffs. We also dig into his childhood in Europe, obligatory Duke talk and Coach K stories, the emotions of his draft night experience, first impressions of Knicks fans and their interactions with Trae Young, his relationship with Tom Thibodeau, that unbelievable game winner against The Celtics and so much more. This is a fantastic conversation start-to-finish and we’re thrilled to share it with you all.

      <title>Episode 109: Bam Adebayo</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[There are all kinds of scary things in life... death, taxes, etc. - take your pick. But I would imagine one of the scariest things an NBA player can encounter is the prospect of driving down the lane and coming face to face with Bam Adebayo. At that point, the chances of success are pretty slim, with the most likely outcome being the ball ending up somewhere in the second row. And given the fact that he doesn't care whether you're a 1,2,3,4, or a 5, escape is not an option. Well thankfully, an interview with Bam is quite the opposite. He joins JJ and Tommy on this episode of the OM3 for an open and entertaining conversation about all things Bam - his defense, his early years, the Heat culture, playing for John Calipari, the bubble run, and so much more.

      <title>Episode 108: The ETCs w/ Kevin Durant and Eddy Gonzalez</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The best way to describe a great interview is with an analogy. Imagine yourself at a restaurant, and the table next to you is having the most incredible conversation. And all the while, you're listening and quietly taking in all the great information that is going back and forth. Now imagine it with four guys talking hoops and breaking down some of the most intricate basketball info you've ever heard. Oh and one more thing... one of those guys is a recently retired 15 year NBA veteran who has seen and heard it all, and another one just happens to be one of the best basketball players on the entire planet. Yep, that's today's episode on the OM3 as JJ and Tommy join forces with The ETC's podcast, which is hosted by Kevin Durant and Eddy Gonzalez, for an absurd hoops conversation that is loaded with unique and personal basketball info. It's an outstanding listen from start to finish.

      <title>Episode 107: Joel Embiid</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It’s no secret that JJ is very close friends with Joel Embiid. They go back several years and have formed a very tight bond on and off the court. It’s also no secret that Joel Embiid is a monster on the court and is enjoying a spectacular season, which could lead to him taking home the MVP. But besides all of that, he’s also a fantastic interview, as he has gone head to head with JJ and Tommy multiple times before, always bringing his 'A' game to keep the fellas on their toes. Well, this time is no different… except that it is. Because not only do you get a great interview, but a new OM3 approach as well. In showing him handpicked video highlights, JJ has Joel breakdown four integral aspects of his game, forcing him to give his own inside scoop as to how these very important parts of his game come to life. All that and, of course, the occasional haymakers that Embiid and JJ toss back and forth at each other.

      <title>Episode 105: Luka Dončić and Alex Caruso</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Luka. Dončić. Need we say more? While watching him on the court often leaves us all wondering "is there anything this guy doesn't do??", there IS one thing that he hasn't done that much of at all. Interviews. Well, at least not like the kind you'll hear on this episode of the OM3. Luka joins JJ and Tommy for a sit down discussion and quickly shows us all that there is much more to him than just his incredible basketball skills. Displaying a sharp, sarcastic wit and humor, Dončić dives in to several topics, including the Mavs red-hot run over the last half of the season, his matchups with the game's other elite players, comparing NBA players to EuroLeague stars, his days of hooping for Real Madrid, and much more. It's a special discussion with someone you certainly don't hear a lot from so don't miss this one. But, that's not all. In fact there's much more that follows as new OM3 correspondent Alex Caruso joins the pod to catch us up on his injury, the Bulls march into the playoffs, and also participates in the Top 5/Draft, which focuses on the 'best March Madness plays that you would have liked to have witnessed in the arena'. So, bottom line, it's a power packed episode of the OM3.

Need we say more? While watching him on the court often leaves us all wondering "is there anything this guy doesn't do??", there IS one thing that he hasn't done that much of at all. Interviews. Well, at least not like the kind you'll hear on this episode of the OM3. Luka joins JJ and Tommy for a sit down discussion and quickly shows us all that there is much more to him than just his incredible basketball skills. Displaying a sharp, sarcastic wit and humor, Dončić dives in to several topics, including the Mavs red-hot run over the last half of the season, his matchups with the game's other elite players, comparing NBA players to EuroLeague stars, his days of hooping for Real Madrid, and much more. It's a special discussion with someone you certainly don't hear a lot from so don't miss this one. But, that's not all. In fact there's much more that follows as new OM3 correspondent Alex Caruso joins the pod to catch us up on his injury, the Bulls march into the playoffs, and also participates in the Top 5/Draft, which focuses on the 'best March Madness plays that you would have liked to have witnessed in the arena'. So, bottom line, it's a power packed episode of the OM3.

      <title>Episode 104: Willie Green (Coaching Series #3)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Some people are just made for certain jobs. They meet the criteria so well that it just seems like a perfect fit. To go a step further, often times others who are close to this person can see the scenario playing out even before the individual can see it him or herself. And if you were to ask JJ directly, he'd likely admit that he knew Willie Green belonged in the NBA coaching ranks probably before Willie did. In this third installment of the OM3 Coaching Series, you find out how it all came to be. Going back through the years when JJ and Willie used to play hypothetical NBA GM's, it was pretty obvious that Green had a place in the game after his playing days were over. And that's just what he's done, as he's weathered the New Orleans Pelicans through a potentially disastrous 1-12 start to the season, all the way to a potential 'Play-In Tournament" appearance. Along the way he has garnered a whole lot of respect, admiration, and a few "Coach of the Year" rumblings as well. Pretty impressive for a guy who seems to be just getting started.

      <title>Episode 103: Pat Beverley</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[On the court, there are players who bring it... and then there are players who BRING it. Pat Beverley is one of those players. Backed by his tenacious defense - and an equally tenacious personality - Beverley is widely recognized as a premier defender in the NBA. But that aggressive approach isn't just limited to the court. In this spectacular in-your-face interview, you will quickly realize that when Pat Beverley wants to say something, he's going to say it - damn the consequences. The reason he can do this? Well, that's easy...the man can back it up. Join JJ and Tommy as they head straight into the storm with "Mr. 94 Feet". Trust us when we say, you won't be disappointed.

      <title>Episode 102: Matt Barnes and Mikal Bridges</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's not often in life that we're lucky enough to get something good for no cost at all. But here at the OM3, that rule doesn't really apply. Take today's episode for instance... it has not one but two great guests, and all you have to do is listen. Leading things off is very close friend and former teammate - as well as OG pod host - Matt Barnes. Now, it's no secret to anyone that Matt speaks his mind and takes no prisoners, and this discussion is certainly no different. Imagine yourself sitting at a bar and listening in to a conversation between NBA players in the next booth... that's the vibe for this one, no doubt. Then, as if that wasn't enough, JJ and Tommy welcome in the OM3's brand new correspondent - Mikal Bridges of the Phoenix Suns. He joins the show for some playoff talk, a little music discussion, and the Top 5 Draft. And if there was ever a draft that went off the rails in a hurry, this one is it. The finger is pointed at you, Mr Bridges.

      <title>Episode 99: Marcus Smart (Live Show from the Crystal Ballroom in Boston)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Let's face it... The OM3 live shows are fire. They're a perfect combination of great guests, great atmosphere, and a whole lot of fun. But the unfortunate aspect of having a live show in a specific city, is that only a select few get to experience it first hand. But thankfully, the boys always remember to hit the record button for these special occasions, and we're happy to share the latest OM3 event that took place this past Wednesday, live from the Crystal Ballroom in Boston. Marcus Smart of the hometown Celtics joins the crew for an amazing night of laughs, a bit of trash talk, some brutal honestly, and good ol' fashioned hoops x's and o's. It was a fantastic night on every level, and you can catch it all right here without getting out of your seat. Enjoy.

      <title>Episode 98: Desmond Bane</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[We've seen the story before right? An underrated player comes out of college, somehow hits another level in the pros, and then surprises everyone en route to becoming an NBA star. But what about the guy who hardly got a sniff in the recruiting game coming out of HIGH SCHOOL? Quite simply, that basketball story usually ends right there. Well, don't tell that to Desmond Bane, because getting overlooked coming out of high school only lit his fire to succeed even more. After paving his way through a solid career at TCU, he has taken the proverbial 'next level' leap in the NBA and has become a bonafide force for the Memphis Grizzlies. Teaming with Ja Morant and company, they've got the Grizzlies well on their way to creating some major havoc in the playoffs. Listen in as Desmond discusses his rise to the top, his struggles with the recruiting game, how his body type is the antithesis of the typical NBA shooter, whether or not he believes the Grizzlies can win a chip this season, and so much more.

      <title>Episode 97: Chris Paul 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[So... last week when Draymond Green visited the show, there were an awful lot of superlatives being thrown around. And why not? It was an incredible interview that was certainly deserving of high praise. Well, if this week proves anything, it’s that you can never have enough superlatives when it comes to the OM3, because joining the show this week is yet another surefire first ballot Hall of Famer, Chris Paul. And even though CP3 and JJ are the closest of friends and have gone through just about everything together on the court and off, this discussion has Chris breaking new ground on several topics. To say this conversation was spectacular on every level is an understatement. Once again, it’s a can’t miss interview on the OM3, so sit back and enjoy the ride.

      <title>Episode 95: Kevin Love</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Let's be honest, one of the aspects that makes the interviews on the OM3 so great is the fact that JJ and Tommy often cause the guest to dig a little deeper to answer questions and roll a bit out of their comfort zone. But somehow when Kevin Love joins the podcast, there's no need to try and pull info out of him or force delicate subjects into the mix because... well, he does that all by himself. And as usual, this interview is no different. Kevin displays his typical intelligence, humor, sarcastic wit, and basic down to earth nature as he digs into his current season with the Cavs and opens up about the team's past, present, and future. Oh, he also sticks around for the OM3 draft as they break down the worst things you can do on an airplane. Hmmm... I sense a campaign for OM3 correspondent coming on.

      <title>Episode 94: Dawn Staley (Coaching Series #2)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[As you go through the coaching ranks, you see all different types of personalities. On one end of the spectrum you have the coaches who have mastered the art of "coach speak", where they are able to get by with few words, even fewer emotions, and with what many would call a vanilla approach. Then, all the way on the other side of the spectrum you have... well, you have Dawn Staley. Never one to mince words, emotions, or temper her fiery personality, Staley has brought success and pride wherever she has gone - both on the court and controlling the sidelines. Coming from a person who didn't see herself as a coach, it's hard to imagine the game without her presence on the bench. From turning around a Temple program - while still starring in the WNBA as an all star point guard - to taking South Carolina to the pinnacle of the NCAA universe with the 2017 Championship, Staley has done it all. Don't miss a chance to listen to her incredible journey as she joins the show for this second installment of the "Coaching Series" on the Old Man & the Three.

      <title>Episode 93: Josh Hart and Jalen Brunson</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It’s a double shot of entertainment on this week’s Old Man & the Three as JJ and Tommy welcome in not one but two stars in Josh Hart and Jalen Brunson. After opening his home and having JJ live in his house for a large part of last year, (and also hounding him and Tommy for his chance on the big stage), close friend Hart kicks things off as he finally gets his shot to be the lead guest on the OM3. And deservedly so, as he brings his humor and intelligence to the table for a fantastic interview. He also has some comments on the size of the following guest’s head, but that’s beside the point. (You’ll understand when you hear it). Then, another friend of the pod Jalen Brunson joins the show for the return of the OM3 draft to give his take on the most unrealistic sports plays in movie history. Just like his game on the court, Jalen doesn’t disappoint.

      <title>Episode 92: Nick Nurse (Coaching Series #1)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[2021 was a great year for the Old Man & the Three as many of the NBA's brightest stars joined JJ and Tommy to present an intimate look at the players who make the league such an incredible force. But along with the NBA stars, there were also interviews that took a step outside the box to shed light on the different aspects of our society, business, and life in general. Those were encompassed in the OM3 Leadership series where the likes of Bob Iger, Stacey Abrams, Ben Winston and many more paid visits to the show. Now, to open 2022, we step forward with a new look at the league with the "Coaching Series", which will focus on specific coaches from around the NBA - and maybe some other sports as well. Who knows who will show up... that's part of the fun. And to kick things off for the first installment, JJ and Tommy welcome in Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse for an incredible interview where he breaks down his coaching journey and how he reached the top, what intangibles make a great coach, motivation in players, the preparation it takes to succeed, and so much more.

      <title>Episode 91: John Collins</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[For many NBA players, the ‘hoops' road to the NBA is often bracketed in a similar framework. Meaning, eyes were on them from a relatively early age, they were highly touted high school standouts from a strong program, and then expanded on that path in college and transitioned to the pros. But as we saw last week with Georges Niang, that’s not always the case. And that can certainly be said about John Collins, the guest on today’s OM3. Raised in a military family, Collins moved plenty growing up and although a basketball was always in his hands, he flew a bit under the radar. That is, until he got to Wake Forest and his game exploded. John breaks down his journey to the league in this honest and down to earth interview, and also touches on several other topics, including his recent posterizing dunk on Niang, what it actually feels like to be that high in the air, the present Covid situation in the NBA, and much more. 
Editor's note: There will be no OM3 pod next week for the holiday break. JJ, Tommy and everyone at ThreeFourTwo productions and Cadence13 wish all of you a joyous and healthy holiday season and a safe and happy new year. Enjoy and be well.

      <title>Episode 89: Joe Ingles</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[If you’re an OM3 regular, you know very well that JJ is not afraid to bust on his fellow players and break some major chops. And if you know that, then you also know there’s one player who has taken more heat from JJ than anyone else. I mean, let’s face it… there aren’t many episodes where Joe Ingles name doesn’t come up at one point or another, and suffice it to say the comments aren’t loaded with sunshine and rainbows. But if you listen a little closer, you become keenly aware that it's all in fun and comes from a place of great friendship. Well, finally, the time has come for JJ to face his so-called “nemesis” as Joe joins the show for an amazing discussion that bounces from hilarity to deep and thoughtful discussion. And that’s what makes Joe Ingles so special. You may start out hating him, but invariably you end up loving him - especially if he’s on your team.

      <title>Episode 88: Pascal Siakam</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Pause for a moment and imagine this scenario. You’re a teenager from another country, and someone says “hey, I want to introduce you to a game. It’s called basketball.” You pick up the ball and begin to play. Then fast forward 7 years down the road (a virtual blink of an eye in an athlete’s life), and you’re not only good at the game, you’re a superior talent. And you’re now playing in the world’s greatest basketball league, the NBA. Oh, and one more thing, you’re an All-Star as well. Wait, what? Sounds ridiculous, doesn’t it? Well, that’s pretty much exactly how it played out for Pascal Siakam, the former Camaroon teenager and present Toronto Raptors all star forward. His story is almost too crazy to believe, but he breaks it all down for you on today’s Old Man and the Three. In this incredible interview, Pascal not only tells the story of how his hoops career came about, but he also covers where things stand now with the Raptors, what it was like winning a chip, his relationship with his late father, and so much more. A true can’t miss interview.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[After starring at Villanova and winning an NCAA Championship along the way, the stage was set for Mikal Bridges to enter the NBA and keep the Philly dream going as he was picked by the 76’ers. But life doesn’t always work out the way we want or expect, and Mikal found himself involved in a draft night trade and the key piece of rebuilding Phoenix Suns team. From that point on, it’s been steady rise in both play and stardom as Bridges continues to forge his name among the league's most exciting players. And the best part? He’s only just begun. Teaming with CP3, he’s led the Phoenix Suns to a scorching hot start to this season as they ride a 13 game winning streak. JJ and Tommy talk to Mikal about that, as well as his crazy draft night, his years at 'Nova, the closeness of this Suns’ team, the influence Jay Wright and Monty Williams have had on his career, and so much more.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Kemba Walker has certainly gone through some ups and downs in his NBA career thus far. However, there are two things that remain consistent and stand out at all times - his spectacular play on the court, and his character off it. All that is on full display as JJ and Tommy welcome in the Knicks guard to talk about everything from suffering through extremely challenging seasons in his early years, to becoming a dominant player in the league, to his Boston years, and to where he is now with the New York Knicks. It's a great window into what makes Kemba the man and player he is, and he doesn't disappoint.

RUNDOWN
The guys start it off with an update on Alex's golf game
What's the most Chicago thing he’s done so far
Discussing the Chicago food scene
How he is sort of set up to be a hero in Chicago
Why does he think the public ‘latches' on to him
Does he feel his defense is still slept on
What makes a great defender
Thinking vs awareness concerning defense
On the knowledge that LeBron brings to the court
Where do the Bulls see themselves internally in terms of a ceiling
What has he learned about Zach and DeMar since playing with them
On the brilliance of Steph Curry
On Klay’s potential return to the Warriors
What would it take for him to actually fight someone on the court
What was it about the bulls that made him sign with them
Is he the highest paid “janitor” in the world
What do his years on the Lakers mean to him now
Breaking down Lonzo Ball’s game

      <title>Episode 83: P.J. Tucker (featuring Shea Serrano)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[On this episode of the OM3, JJ and Tommy welcome in yet another NBA Champion for a conversation - the Miami Heat's P.J Tucker. In this honest and hilarious interview, P.J. holds absolutely nothing back. (The wine might have had something to do with this). They discuss and breakdown several topics, including the long and winding road P.J. has taken to become an NBA Champ, his past history with JJ (41 points anyone?), the Bucks’ amazing run last year, and so much more. Then for the draft, the guys are joined by journalist and author Shea Serrano. Before they tackle the draft, they touch on Shea’s new book "Hip-Hop and Other Things” and what went into making it, as well as his brand new show “Primo". An outstanding episode from start to finish. FYI, the draft topic is “the top 5 movies where someone makes a terrible mistake”.

      <title>Episode 81: Gabrielle Union</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Well, if there is one word that sums up this particular interview on the Old Man & the Three, it’s “real”. As in, keeping it real. And the person behind that word is the one and only Gabrielle Union - the superstar actress, best-selling author, and wife and partner of Dwyane Wade. In this raw, brutally honest and often times hilarious conversation, she lays it on the line and doles out some truths on several topics, including what it’s like being a black actress in Hollywood, how her acting career got started, why she decided to write her books, how emptying her “fucks” basket changed her life, and much more. Plus, she talks about her new book “Got Anything Stronger?”, which is a follow up to her best-selling initial release “We’re Going to Need More Wine”. It’s a spectacular discussion that you do not want to miss.

As in, keeping it real. And the person behind that word is the one and only Gabrielle Union - the superstar actress, best-selling author, and wife and partner of Dwyane Wade. In this raw, brutally honest and often times hilarious conversation, she lays it on the line and doles out some truths on several topics, including what it’s like being a black actress in Hollywood, how her acting career got started, why she decided to write her books, how emptying her “fucks” basket changed her life, and much more. Plus, she talks about her new book “Got Anything Stronger?”, which is a follow up to her best-selling initial release “We’re Going to Need More Wine”. It’s a spectacular discussion that you do not want to miss.

      <title>Episode 80: Travis Kelce (Featuring Kenny Beecham and Marques Brownlee)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Last week it was the live show. This week the OM3 crew breaks some new ground once again as they welcome in their very first NFL player - Kansas City Chiefs All Pro tight end (and future HOF’er) Travis Kelce. Travis covers just about everything in this wide open interview as they tackle topics such as his golf game, his hoop skills, how his talents translated from basketball to football, what it’s like playing with Patrick Mahomes, and so much more. Then the gears switch to a whole new direction as JJ and Tommy are joined by YouTube megastars Marques Brownlee and Kenny Beecham to discuss all the hot new products and stories coming out the their worlds. (Editor’s note: this interview was recorded backstage at the OM3 live event with an iPhone, so it may sound a bit different than what you’re used to on the OM3. Still great either way, so don’t miss it).

      <title>Episode 78: Matisse Thybulle</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It’s no secret that Matisse Thybulle is a rising star in the NBA, developing into a bonafide defensive stopper in the court. But there’s another part of his game that's pretty damn strong as well - his YouTube game, that is. In this spectacular interview, Matisse shows not only why increasing success in the NBA seems like a forgone conclusion, but also why he will continue to be a winner in life as well. A humble and open individual, he’s very comfortable discussing all aspects of the game, as well as his personal ventures, making it easy to see why he’s well liked and well respected for such a young player. He, JJ and Tommy discuss subjects such as his budding YouTube career, life as a 76’er and dealing with their passionate fans, his draft experience, playing in the bubble, his upbringing, and so much more. Don’t miss this great conversation… all here on the OM3.

        <![CDATA[All good things must come to an end. It’s a cliche thats used often but rarely does it hold its true meaning. This, however, is not one of those instances. On this special episode of the Old Man and the Three, it is with a heavy heart that JJ Redick - after 15 years of excellence in the NBA, two national player of the year awards during a spectacular four year college career at Duke, and a state championship at Cave Spring High School in Roanoke - is finally calling it a game. Yes, you read that correctly, JJ Redick is retiring. In this candid, honest, and humbling statement, JJ addresses the people closest to him - his family, friends and fans - to explain the reasoning behind his decision and also offers a glimpse of what may lie ahead for him as he takes the next step of his journey.

      <title>Episode 76: Michael Porter Jr (featuring Sue Bird)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Michael Porter Jr. has always had the talent and drive to dominate with the ball in his hands, but injuries sometimes have a way of being the equalizer on whether or not that talent translates to success on the court. Well, it seems any questions that might have lingered have been put to rest as MPJ has taken his game to a new level over the last two seasons. And in this interview, it’s easy to see why as he speaks well beyond his years and touches on both the difficulties and successes he has encountered on his hoops journey. Following that up, JJ and Tommy welcome in OM3 correspondent and favorite Sue Bird to tackle another Top5/Draft. This may be the one that gets JJ off his recent slide as Tommy reaches for some highly questionable picks, putting the onus on Sue to come through in the clutch. Who knows how it will play out.  
RUNDOWN
On how great Denver and its fans are
What was his motivation to start his own podcast 
ON the atmosphere of playing the bubble last year
How his game took a leap during that time. What clicked
Does he look back at the bubble as his turning point
Discusses playing on the same AAU team with Trae Young in High School 
On having the freedom to play the game your way
When did feel playing the NBA was a possibility
With all the talent in his family, what were those backyard games like
On former players telling AAU players that most of them won’t make it
If he were in high school now, would his decision be to go to college or somewhere else
On what it was like being home schooled
How he dealt with the injuries he suffered along the way
What was draft night like dealing with the unknown because of his injury
What was his first impression of Nikola Jokic
TOP 5/DRAFT with Sue Bird

      <title>Episode 75: Blake Griffin</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It’s been a long time coming but JJ and Tommy accomplished two important things with this particular interview. One, they finally got everyone together in the same room. And two, they got Blake Griffin on the show. In this spectacular interview, Blake sits down for an intimate and honest discussion on several topics, including his years teaming up with JJ on the Clippers, his evolution as a basketball player, his move to the Nets and the pressure that comes with having all that talent, his confrontations with refs, battling injuries and so much more. It’s a can’t miss OM3 pod.
RUNDOWN 
JJ tells a story about an incredible golf feat that Blake pulled off
Discusses his new obsession with golf
The guys talk about how sometimes it’s ok to be an asshole
On his battles and confrontations with refs
On his decision to leave Detroit and join the Nets
What were his thoughts about the level of talent when arriving to the Nets
Why is it so acrimonious when I player leaves a team
What years does he feel were his peak in the NBA
How he evolved his game over the years
Does he think those Clippers teams he and JJ were on were good to win it all
Breaking down the “throw and go” technique and the effect it had on their games
Does he feel his intelligence as a player gets overlooked because of his athleticism. 
How the Nets playoff run was doomed by injuries
Concerning this upcoming season, does he feel that if they can just stay healthy they’ll win it all
Have the injuries ever put him in a dark place mentally
On the insanity of social media and how stories (or non-stories) blow up
What’s next with his comedy aspirations

      <title>Episode 73: Brook and Robin Lopez (featuring Mina Kimes and Shea Serrano)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Ok, we here at the Old Man and the Three don't usually toot our own horn, but we feel each OM3 interview is pretty damn entertaining. However, with that being said, JJ and Tommy reach some rarified air with this episode as they welcome in the Lopez brothers (Brook and Robin) to discuss everything from childhood fights, being teammates in the NBA, beating up NBA mascots, not being able to room together because their cats don't get along, and so much more. Honestly, it almost seems as though JJ and Tommy might have been able to sit this one out and just let Brook and Robin hash everything out for themselves. I mean, after all, Robin did punch Brook in the face when they were sleeping in bunk beds as kids. So, to say it was an entertaining interview is quite the understatement. Now, you would think that would be enough for one episode, but there's more. Joining the show for the OM3 Top 5/Draft is the lovely and talented Mina Kimes... and the equally lovely and talented Shea Serrano. Both add their incredible wit and humor to the draft, which focuses on "the top 5 fictional schools you would like to have attended". Get your pen and paper ready... it's go time.

      <title>Episode 72: CJ McCollum</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[At one point in his high school career, CJ McCollum stood at 5 feet 2 inches tall. Yet, at that same moment, he fully believed he was going to be an NBA star. That fact alone explains the mindset and determination that lies within CJ the player, the current PA President, the wine connoisseur, and all around great person. He brings that attitude with him on and off the court and it has paid its dividends, as he has gone from an overlooked player in college to a legit NBA star on every level. Join JJ, Tommy and CJ as they discuss everything from his early high school days, his accolades in the NBA, to being the voice of the players as president of the Players Association. Then settle in for even more out of the box discussions when they tackle an EAT PRAY DUNK segment and the OM3 TOP 5/Draft.   
RUNDOWN
On being elected the PA President
Does he feel it’s a thankless job
What are his first priorities as president
Who was he modeling his game after as a 5’2” high schooler
Was he thinking of the pros as a high schooler
The story of how he ended up at Lehigh 
Why is it an advantage - longterm - to be overlooked as a player
CJ breaks down his coming out party - Lehigh’s win over Duke in the NCAA tourney
On the jump he made from his second to third year in the NBA
Talks about what a great teammate Dame is
When Dame gets into his zone, what’s his thought process
How does he view himself amongst his peers
What is he expecting from this coming year with the Blazers
What moves over this offseason has he been most intrigued by

        <![CDATA[Anyone who listens to the Old Man and the Three knows that Jrue Holiday is not only a great player, but he’s also a very close friend of the pod and is universally known as ‘one of the good guys’ - on and off the court. And there’s no denying that he’s had a great career thus far. However, the last two months have brought his life and career to a completely new level, as he brought home an NBA Championship and then followed that up with a gold medal with Team USA in the Olympics. Suffice it say, things have changed just a bit, and thats what Jrue discusses today on the pod. It’s an incredible listen as he gives his account of the last couple months and what it was like going through these two unique and life changing experiences. Then, as if that isn’t entertaining enough, the OM3 crew welcomes in Chris Long to the pod for a draft that is sure to ruffle a lot of music feathers out there when they debate the "musical acts you would least like to be stuck in a festival crowd for”. Lots of options here… who knows how this one ends up.

      <title>Episode 68: Kevin Huerter (featuring Tyrese Haliburton and Kenny Beecham)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It’s a “3 for the price of 1” episode on the Old Man and the Three today as JJ and Tommy welcome in three great guests. Leading things off is Kevin Huerter, the Atlanta Hawks rising star. In an honest and candid discussion he delves into his ascension into the league, what it’s like to face off against the now NBA Champion Bucks, his favorite memes, and much more. Then it’s on to the mailbag and TOP 5/Draft with OM3 correspondent Tyrese Haliburton and close friend of the pod Kenny Beecham. The topic of the draft is “Movies you would like to see remade”, and not shockingly there is an immediate controversy surrounding Tommy’s picks. All solid choices, but as always, you’ll have to pick a side.

Discusses how roles can change from one playoff series to another
What was his team’s confidence level heading into the playoffs considering how everyone’s surprised by the Hawks run

      <description>
        <![CDATA[On this week’s OM3, JJ and Tommy are joined by long time friend, long time NBA vet, All NBA defender - not to mention 2015 NBA Finals MVP - Andre Iguodala. In this wide ranging interview, Iggy touches on just about everything as he discusses topics like the new breed of players and the important element they're lacking, his uncanny knack for being on great teams, his six year run of being in the finals, the brilliance of Durant and Curry, and so much more. And then to take it even further, he sticks around for an EAT PRAY DUNK segment. It’s a 'can’t miss' interview as Iggy plays it straight and tells it like it is.

      <itunes:summary>On this week’s OM3, JJ and Tommy are joined by long time friend, long time NBA vet, All NBA defender - not to mention 2015 NBA Finals MVP - Andre Iguodala. In this wide ranging interview, Iggy touches on just about everything as he discusses topics like the new breed of players and the important element they're lacking, his uncanny knack for being on great teams, his six year run of being in the finals, the brilliance of Durant and Curry, and so much more. And then to take it even further, he sticks around for an EAT PRAY DUNK segment. It’s a 'can’t miss' interview as Iggy plays it straight and tells it like it is.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[It’s a double shot on the OM3 as JJ and Tommy welcome in ThreeFourTwo family member and Miami Heat star Duncan Robinson and then follow that up with another close friend of the pod, broadcaster and journalist Taylor Rooks. Duncan digs in for some finals talk, his free agent status, his summer regimen, and even a little discussion about some shirtless IG pics of him that seem to be floating around. Then Taylor joins for the draft and some EAT PRAY DUNK where she divulges a little information about a college bar fight she got into, her hot food takes, plus the Hawks playoff run. Don’t miss it.

Check in on JJ’s golf game at the moment
Discusses game 1 of the finals
JJ comes clean - he didn’t watch game one of the finals
Is the pace of the Suns play a reason for their quick starts in each series
How impressive it is that CP3 is still playing so well even though defenders know what's coming
Where does he stand on the twitter talk that the Suns run has been a fluke
Is there anything that he’s noticed about the Bucks that’s different from last year
In a results driven league, context should matter - especially over the last two years
Has social media accelerated that kind of thinking
JJ confronts Duncan on his shirtless photos on the internet
Discusses his free agency situation
At what part of JJ's career did he start to feel control over where he wanted to play
Taylor Rooks
Discusses the Atlanta Hawks run to the conference finals
Does history remember the injuries (re the playoffs) 
EAT PRAY DUNK
If you could be endorsed by one business or product in college, what would it be (JJ’s would be “Shooters” bar at Duke)
Taylor breaks down a fight that she got into in a bar in college
Taylor gives her hot food takes
TOP 5/DRAFT - Best sports name drops in songs

      <title>Episode 63: TJ McConnell</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Sit back and relax, grab some wine, and order a nice meal because this conversation will surely put you in the mood to do all three. For this episode of the Old Man and the Three, JJ and Tommy welcome in close friend and all around great guy (and Pacers guard, of course) TJ McConnell for an incredibly fun and down to earth EAT PRAY DUNK discussion. They touch on a number of topics, like TJ’s wine obsession and how it came to be, whether or not JJ is a wine snob, and TJ’s favorite food picks. But for diehard hoopers, they also delve into the NBA playoff picture, give breakdowns of Trae Young and Ben Simmons (among others), and discuss what makes a great defensive player (and how TJ was robbed of an All NBA Defensive team pick). 
RUNDOWN 
TJ starts by explaining why he’s recording on his phone and not his laptop
Breakdown of the injuries to top players in the playoffs
Ben Simmons discussion and how the casual NBA fan only looks at his lack of shooting
The guys revisit the DPOY topic and how it’s often voted on in the wrong light
How people are complaining about the playoff parity after complaining for years it was too star driven
What makes Trae Young so impressive
On the career year TJ has had in 2021
Explains his knack for stealing inbounds passes
How TJ was snubbed for an all defensive team pick
JJ reveals that TJ is on his top 5 shit-talker list
How TJ goes from Mr. Nice Guy to fierce competitor as soon as he steps on the court
How was he able to block out all the noise this year and deliver his best performance to date
Which was tougher… this year or the years of going through “The Process” in Philly
What is the secret ingredient for an NBA coach for success
Has social media and its reach affected the coaching position
TJ tells the hilarious story of how he got into wine
When did his interest in wine turn into an obsession
The guys discuss JJ’s wine freak-outs and whether or not he’s a wine snob
What wines/regions does he want to explore more
The discussion turns to food as TJ picks his top restaurant, as well as the out of the way gem that he can’t miss

      <description>
        <![CDATA[This week on the Old Man and the Three, JJ and Tommy switch sports to golf by welcoming in one of the game's most exciting rising stars in Collin Morikawa. In this brutally honest and fun interview, Collin covers just about everything there is to cover on the course, including what it’s like to swing and miss (literally), the Bryson-Brooks rivalry, the difference between golfers out for a check and those who are there to win, his favorite course, and so much more. He then sticks around for an amazing EAT PRAY DUNK segment that touches on golf’s "extra curricular activities”, hidden food gems, his social life, and the one course he would spend the rest of his days on. It’s a gimme… you can miss this one.

JJ tells the story of taking a golf lesson and having Byron DeChambeau stand and watch him
On leaning into nerves when it’s your own sport but how they can crush you when it’s something you’re not familiar with
When did he realize he was really good at golf and could make it a career
Did he ever have any doubts among the way
What are his feelings on the Bryson-Brooks rivalry
During a round, is he playing against the course or other players

How to make the game more fun and approachable to our youth

        <![CDATA[This week on the Old Man and the Three, JJ and Tommy switch sports to golf by welcoming in one of the game's most exciting rising stars in Collin Morikawa. In this brutally honest and fun interview, Collin covers just about everything there is to cover on the course, including what it’s like to swing and miss (literally), the Bryson-Brooks rivalry, the difference between golfers out for a check and those who are there to win, his favorite course, and so much more. He then sticks around for an amazing EAT PRAY DUNK segment that touches on golf’s "extra curricular activities”, hidden food gems, his social life, and the one course he would spend the rest of his days on. It’s a gimme… you can miss this one.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Tim Hardaway Jr grew up watching his dad shoot the lights out as a star in the NBA. For most people, that would be a daunting figure to live up to. But not for Tim Jr. Not only has he lived up to his namesake, he's proven he can do it all on the court. On this week's OM3, JJ and Tommy welcome in the Dallas Maverick's shooting guard and delve into his career, as well as the red hot scoring streak he's on, the play-in game situation, what it was like having a dad who was an NBA star, how coach Bud saved his career, and much more.
RUNDOWN

Is it tough to follow all the seeding possibilities 
On the fact that Rick Carlisle still calls JJ “Redick”
Who’s potentially the most dangerous team in the play-in
On the run the Wizards are on and how they are going into the playoffs on a tear
Tim’s takeaways from the last year's Clipper series
On the unique and unconventional ways Luka scores
The crazy ridiculous shots that Luka hits in warmups
On Tim’s hot streak to end the season
JJ and Tim discuss the “8 for 12” approach to shooting
How having family close can help your mindset and game
The difficulty of not having a set amount of minutes or routine
On the difference between getting open shots because your playing with another shooter or having the plays designed for you 
Does he have a preference of being a starter or coming off the bench
How did he keep his mindset positive when he first came into the league and got moved around
How Tim credits “Coach Bud" with saving his career
Did he lean on his dad during the tough times in Atlanta
What did he learn from his Knicks experience
What was it like growing up as the son of an NBA player

      <itunes:summary>Interviews and conversations are unique. Some flow rather easily and others are a bit tough to get through. This particular discussion however, is a different animal altogether - and for all the right reasons. Joining JJ and Tommy this week is fellow ThreeFourTwo family member (and NBA sharpshooter) Duncan Robinson, and Hasan Minhaj - a comedian, writer, producer, political commentator, actor, and television host, just to name a few. The four of them join together for a conversation that covers just about everything and absolutely nothing is out of bounds. The topics range from lighter subjects like JJ and Duncan’s hair and their caffeine intake, to deep dives into the social media landscape, performance anxiety, and controlling the power of a celebrity’s public voice. Plus mixed into all of this is another spectacular EAT PRAY DUNK segment. It is an absolute can’t miss interview.

      <title>Episode 54: Jrue Holiday</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Jrue Holiday is a basketball star, plain and simple. He offers an all-around game and leads the defensive charge for the Bucks by anchoring their league leading defense with his lockdown abilities. But with all that being said, Jrue is so much more than just an incredible athlete. He gives back. He gives back to the community, his teammates, his family, and the game. He acknowledges and understands how lucky he is to be playing the game he loves and displays a rare sense of humbleness and empathy that few can match. All of this is on display during this spectacular interview where he covers everything from the recent Derek Chauvin verdict, to battling Covid, his close relationship with JJ, and the importance of family and community. 
RUNDOWN
Jrue expresses his feeling concerning the Derek Chauvin verdict
On his dedication and passion towards giving back to the community and supporting black business owners
What he would like to see from the league to help on these matters
On the challenge of helping change people’s lives in the best way possible
The importance of bringing economic empowerment to low income communities
After everything that has happened over the last year plus, does he see basketball in a different light
On the difficulty of this year’s NBA schedule and how the public and media don't fully understand the wear and tear the players are going through
What is was like coming back from Covid and how tough the journey was 
How remarkable it is that his numbers are better after his Covid diagnosis than before
On missing the crowds and packed arenas
How this is not the real NBA experience and how the young stars still haven’t experienced the real deal
Has there been a secret ingredient to his success this year
Reliving a JJ explosion in the locker room
How does being on the court with Giannis improve his game
Breaking down what a freak of nature Giannis is and what he can accomplish
On the confidence he has in starting every game with three of the best defenders in the league on the court
Does he take pride in hearing other players compliment his defense
As someone who is a top defender, what does he do when someone like Dame or Steph gets in there ‘zone’
Does he care about the awards and accolades - or lack thereof
On his contract and coming to the the Bucks
The thrill of playing on a contending team and being counted on to do what you do best
On being able to only play for a finite amount of time and enjoying your life

      <title>Episode 50: Collin Sexton and Tyrese Haliburton</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This is a special episode of the Old Man & The Three for a number of reasons. For starters, it’s episode #50! A big shout out to the OM3 listeners for taking this journey with us - many more to come! As for the show itself, JJ starts things off by answering the bell and addressing the big news of his trade to the Dallas Mavericks. Much more to this story than meets the eye obviously, and JJ covers it all. To follow that up, we have two spectacular guests on the show this week in Collin Sexton and Tyrese Haliburton. Sexton, as you’ll come to find out, brings his ‘A’ game because… well that’s what he’s always done - even going back to when he was young a boy asking his mom for an alarm clock so he can practice basketball early. Oh, did we mention he was probably around 7 when that happened? You see where this is going. And Tyrese as you all know, is the OM3 NBA correspondent and brings his usual honesty, humor, humility, as well as some great stories from the floor. Always a must listen. It’s a can’t miss episode from top to bottom.

      <title>Episode 49: Tobias Harris (Featuring Mina Kimes)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's a two for one special this week on the OM3 pod, as JJ and Tommy are joined by two guests who are not only great professionals, but great people as well - Tobias Harris and Mina Kimes. Harris, enjoying arguably his finest season of his career, sits down to talk hoops (of course), but also touches on so much more. For the hoop discussion, he opens up about the disappointment of not making the ASG despite the incredible season he's having, how and why playing for Doc Rivers has maximized his talents, the difference between the US professional model vs. the rest of the world, and how his NCAA tournament experience turned from a dream into a nightmare. Then he digs deeper and expands out of the realm of basketball when the guys discuss just about everything in the EAT PRAY DUNK segment. At this point, you would think things couldn't get much better... but you'd be wrong. Because to cap the show off, the guys welcome in the spectacular Mina Kimes for a draft that will have you packing your fictional bags. It's the Top 5 fictional TV/Movie towns you would like to live in for one week. Who knew JJ likes to hang out with pups? Never mind, you'll see.
Tobias Harris
Discuss the ongoing issue of inequality between men's and women's sports after the NCAA weight room fiasco
On the issues that run rampant within the NCAA
What would the 18 year old Tobias do if he were graduating high school right now
How the professional basketball 'model' differs in the US as compared to the rest of the world.
Tobias recants his NCAA tournament nightmare experience
How playing with Doc Rivers helps him maximize his talents and translate them to the court
On the positive impact of knowing your role within a team and what's expected of you
Is he surprised at how fast it's all come together for the Sixers this year.
Is Joel Embiid the MVP?
On the improvement of their defense this year and how it runs against the grain of the league
How it's foolish to try and compare different eras of the NBA
On his disappointment of not making the ASG and how JJ feels the rosters should be expanded for this exact reason
How getting the all star nod effects contracts
Discusses the similarities between him and Mike Conley in terms of fitting into the system you play in
Is there a harder place in the NBA to be a max player than Philly?
EAT PRAY DUNK (w/ Tobias)
TOP 5/Draft with Mina Kimes

      <title>Episode 48: Adam Mosseri</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Adam Mosseri certainly doesn’t shy away from challenges. It’s one of the aspects of his personality that led him to the top as head of Instagram. But along with that position also comes the added responsibility of facing the tough issues and difficult questions that accompany the social media giant. And he doesn't shrink. In this wide ranging interview, Mosseri tackles all the tough questions and more as he digs deep into subjects such as his desire to work at FaceBook so early in the social media game, managing the threat of mis-information and fake news on his platform, keeping a handle on the absolute power and influence that Instagram possesses, and much more.
RUNDOWN
JJ and and Adam recall the last time they hung out and the incredible meal they had
Adam breaks down his career path and what led him to this point
Discusses his early years at FaceBook
What as it about FaceBook that made him want to work there so badly
At what point did he realize FB was becoming the monster company it would eventually be
What lessons did he learn from the Trump years to get a better handle on mis-information and fake news
In this opinion, where has Silicon Valley gone astray in terms of culture or a disconnect with normal American life
How does he train his employees not to abuse the power that Instagram wields 
How much time and focus is spent on the ‘bad actors’ of Instagram
On the challenges of walking into a new situation at IG with the two founders leaving upon his arrival 
Adam asks JJ how leadership qualities translate onto an NBA team and who are the ones exercising those techniques
How wary does he have to be in making changes to the platform and avoid rocking the boat
What’s his approach to handling the delicate balance of “likes” and features of that nature that can negatively effect today’s youth
How hard is it for him to detach from social media
If someone was to pick up his IG feed, what would they find out about him
On the IG or FaceBook “life" that is portrayed through the platforms
On the popularity of IG in the NBA because of it versatility 
Leadership advice from the man himself

      <title>Episode 47: Nikola Vučević (feat. PFT Commenter and Arian Foster)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Well, to use a quote from JJ himself, this is one action packed episode of the Old Man and the Three. To begin, JJ and Tommy sit down with Nikola Vučević, the Orlando magic's all star center and mainstay on and off the court. After coming into the league in 2011, Vučević has steadily improved his game to become a highly respected player around the league, as well as an all star. But inexplicably, his game has also been highly underrated by the casual NBA fan. He talks about using that underrated tag as a motivational tool, as well as his experience in Orlando over the years, his college days at USC, and more. Then, the atmosphere changes juuuust a bit as the OM3 crew is joined by PFT Commenter and Arian Foster for a TOP 5/Draft you have to hear to believe: The top presidents you would want to play on your football team. Before they get started on that though, the guys talk about PFT and Arian's new podcast called "Macrodosing", where they explore conspiracies, conundrums, and the dark corners of the deep web. Definitely a pod you want to check out.
RUNDOWN
How different was this year’s all star experience
On the concern about the long layoff and quality of play
Did he worry about being the last pick on the all-star squad
Reflecting on the bombs that Dame and Steph were launching from 30+ feet
On being an “under the radar” type of player despite all his talent
Is there still a chip on his shoulder to drive him to be better
Does he feel he snuck up on people in the beginning of his career
Did he ever expect to go this long without being on a contender
On how the makeup of an NBA squad have changed over the years 
On his experience in Philly
Talks about playing at USC with the star talent they had at the time
TOP 5/Draft with PFT Commenter and Arian Foster

      <title>Episode 46: Zion Williamson</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Each era of the NBA has its transcendent players. The type of players that change the game simply by the manner in which they play, using their extreme talent to force opponents to change their approach. Can Zion Williamson be one of those players? Well, he's certainly on his way. In just his second season, he already has seasoned vets shaking their heads at the sheer talent and confidence he exudes on the court. And this week he sits down with JJ and Tommy and shows why he's just as impressive off the court as he is on it. He opens up about about several personal topics, including his feelings towards all the accolades and praise he has received so far, what it means to be named an all star, dealing with negative comments on social media, his progression as a player, and much more. 
**Note: there is no TOP 5/Draft in this episode. But tune in next week for an extra special draft with two guests that is easily one of the craziest OM3 drafts so far.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's a very special episode of the Old Man and the Three this week as JJ and Tommy kick the show off by welcoming in Tyrese Haliburton as their new NBA correspondent. Wise beyond his years, Tyrese will be reporting in to the show often to discuss news and notes around the NBA and, of course, to give his unique take on what's going on behind the scenes. Then, the episode makes a shift to the lighter side when the hilarious SNL legend and new sitcom star Kenan Thompson joins in. Kenan details the quirks behind the SNL curtain and takes a deep dive into his career and how far he has come. He also gives the breakdown of his brand new show on NBC called "Kenan". Then, as if that isn't enough, we go back to Tyrese for the TOP 5 / Draft. It's a packed show that you will not want to miss.

      <title>Episode 42: Julius Randle (featuring Kevin Love)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Julius Randle is known league wide as someone who doesn't take plays off, a tireless worker, and a very underrated player. But that last narrative might be changing a bit this year as he is enjoying the finest season of his career, leading the Knicks to a surprising 6th seed position in the east. In this humble and honest interview, Julius digs deep into such topics as what it's like playing for Tom Thibodeau and how he's helped change the culture in NY, how he mentally worked through his season ending injury in his rookie year, on developing his 3 point shot, playing with Kobe during his last year, and much more. It's easy to see why he's such a respected player around the league. Then, to cap things off, JJ and Tommy welcome in close friend of the pod Kevin Love for the Top5/Draft. **Important note: The new segment "Eat, Pray, Dunk" will be premiering on Monday with Kevin Love as the first guest. You absolutely will want to hear that conversation so be sure to listen.

        <![CDATA[Julius Randle is known league wide as someone who doesn't take plays off, a tireless worker, and a very underrated player. But that last narrative might be changing a bit this year as he is enjoying the finest season of his career, leading the Knicks to a surprising 6th seed position in the east. In this humble and honest interview, Julius digs deep into such topics as what it's like playing for Tom Thibodeau and how he's helped change the culture in NY, how he mentally worked through his season ending injury in his rookie year, on developing his 3 point shot, playing with Kobe during his last year, and much more. It's easy to see why he's such a respected player around the league. Then, to cap things off, JJ and Tommy welcome in close friend of the pod Kevin Love for the Top5/Draft. **Important note: The new segment "Eat, Pray, Dunk" will be premiering on Monday with Kevin Love as the first guest. You absolutely will want to hear that conversation so be sure to listen.

      <title>Episode 41: Steven Adams</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[​Steven Adams is a great player, no doubt. But his talent on the court almost pales in comparison to his salt of the earth personality. It's hard not to be impressed with his approach to basketball and life in general, and he accomplishes this by utilizing three simple words: keep it simple. Whether it's intentional or just the manner in which he is wired, Adams has little trouble putting all the craziness of the NBA lifestyle in perspective.  In this interview, he delves into topics ranging from his early days of playing youth basketball in New Zealand, where his minimalistic life approach comes from, to taking the court as a rookie with two of the biggest generational NBA talents in Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. It's an interview you simply need to hear. And don't forget about the TOP 5/Draft, because everyone needs a holiday. 
RUNDOWN

On what his game day prep in a normal season as compared to this year

Was there ever a time he was too into weight lifting and had to scale it back
Discusses why he wasn't a fan of college basketball
On his feelings during his draft not even thinking he was going to be picked
What were his aspirations growing up playing basketball in New Zealand
Who were the NBA players that he tried to emulate as he first started getting into hoops
Did he play rugby and did his size translate at all
What is it about New Zealanders that helped them accomplish such a successful coronavirus response 
Steven breaks down the beauty of his farm in New Zealand and his love of soil
On the billionaires buying 'doomsday' plots in New Zealand and is there any pushback by the natives 
What's his impression of Zion Williams 
Was it overwhelming to be thrust onto a team ready to win the championship coming out of college
Claiming the game 7 win against the Grizzlies as his own because Z-Bo punched him in game 6 and got ejected
What was Russell Westbrook like as a teammate
Was it hard to perform with the strong personalities on the Thunder
What his impression of Kevin Durant was like when started playing alongside him
Where does his minimalistic approach to life come from
On the culture shock of the NBA world
On the sobering prospect of becoming irrelevant 
Looking back at the 2016 series against the Warriors​
How great the people of Oklahoma were during his time there
Breaks down his incredible Hail Mary pass to Dennis Schroder 
Weighs in on some of the highs and lows of his eating habits

      <title>Episode 37: Tyrese Haliburton (featuring Josh Hart)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[​Playing successfully in the NBA is difficult enough, but excelling in the NBA as a rookie can be both a monumental challenge as well as an outer​-body experience. You'll see how both come into play when JJ and Tommy sit down with Sacramento Kings rookie point guard Tyrese Haliburton. He opens up about what it's like being a rookie, his 'welcome to the NBA' moments so far, his R.O.Y. chatter, the uniqueness of the 2020 draft, and much more. It's easy to see that the Kings will be in good hands moving forward on and off the court with Tyrese running the floor. Then, the episode closes out on yet another high note when OM3 favorite Josh Hart joins the show for the TOP 5/Draft. 
RUNDOWN

How did he prepare for the incredibly unique 2020 draft
Was he shocked falling down to #13 in the draft to Sacramento 
On gelling with his teammates and fitting in
Describing the rocket ascent that he's had over the last 3 years
Does he use negative chatter about him as a 'chip on the shoulder' motivational tool
Where does his efficiency as a player come from
Was there any player that he tried to emulate growing up
Has there been a 'welcome to the NBA moment' this year
On being able to consistently shoot threes from the logo like Dame and other NBA stars
Is he cognizant of the buzz around him for R.O.Y.
On being compared to LaMelo 
Managing the quick turnaround of the NBA schedule 
Coming up with his "call God" trash talk
On his relationship with Talen Horton-Tucker and Tyler Herro
Discusses how he addressed the insurrection at the Capital

      <title>Episode 36: Markelle Fultz (featuring Sue Bird &amp; Mero)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[On this episode of the Old Man and the Three, JJ and Tommy sit down with rising NBA star Markelle Fultz. **Disclaimer**: this interview was conducted the day before he unfortunately suffered a season ending knee injury in Orlando on January 6th. Despite that horrible circumstance, it'll be easy to see that the road that lies ahead of him right now is nothing he can't conquer. An incredibly mentally strong player, Fultz talks about his injury and recovery, dealing with pressure and the expectations of being a number 1 pick, and how it felt being the target of a negative media attack. If there's one player we know can get through a difficult situation and bounce back on his feet, it's Markelle. We wish him nothing but the best and know he'll be back on the court soon enough. Now, to lighten things up a bit, the episode gets capped off by a spectacular TOP 5/Draft with close friend of the pod Sue Bird, and 1st time guest Mero (from Desus & Mero). This one is a fight to the finish. Don't miss it.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's easy to see that J.J. Barea is a unique player.

Is there a difference between practicing dribbling and shooting
Winning the championship in 2011
Talks about all the run-ins he's had over the years
Whether he flopped or not and utilizing his defensive tactics
How Dirk took his game to another level in that 2011 Final

      <title>Episode 32: Brandon Ingram</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's no secret that Brandon Ingram's presence on the court is that of a multi-tool, all star talent. But when it comes to his presence off the court, "secret" might just be the most opportune way to describe him. A notoriously quiet star, B.I. sits down with JJ and Tommy and opens up about many topics on and off the court, including the NBA magic in his hometown of Kinston NC, his laid back persona, his transition from a small town to the global power of the Lakers, his awkward final season in LA, and much more. Plus, it's a very Merry Top 5/Draft that includes a highly questionable pick by Mr. Alter that once again leaves JJ in disbelief.
**Audio disclaimer: Due to some technical issues, Brandon's microphone unfortunately didn't bring it's 'A' game, but it's still a great interview so enjoy.
​What's behind his quiet and laid back personality 
What makes his hometown (Kinston) so special in creating NBA players
How did he end up at Duke
On the importance of Jerry Stackhouse to the Kinston community
How important is winning to him
When did he get a full grasp on the mental aspects of the NBA game
What it felt like being a small time kid going to a global franchise in the Lakers
On learning to lead and the process of reading players
Who his favorite player was and who he tried to emulate growing up
On the uniqueness of Kevin Durant and how the NBA fan might've taken him for granted
How strange was his last season in LA (first year of LeBron)
On finding out that he was traded
On being able to relate to his teammates in NO​
Putting basketball first over everything else
On improving his 3 point shooting over the last year
What were his emotions when he realized he was getting a 5 year max contract
Who are some of the young guys in the league that he watches and likes
The first time JJ met B.I. and how ​he's wired differently

      <description>
        <![CDATA[As a soccer superstar, Megan Rapinoe is beloved and admired worldwide. But as her millions of fans know, it's not just because of what she does on the pitch. A well known activist, she has been outspoken and a leading voice on several topics like salary payscales, gender inequality, and police brutality. She has also written a book titled "One Life" detailing her experiences in these particular areas, and in this episode she sits down with JJ and Tommy to discuss all of that and more. To cap it off, they all dig into a Top 5/Draft that will surely leave your mouth watering.   
​RUNDOWN
Megan discusses her motivation behind writing her new book
Was it difficult to truly open up during the writing process
On her and Sue's tweets that broke the internet
Reflecting on this personal wave of good fortune that she is presently​ experiencing 
Does she ever take a step back to recognize her legacy
What motivates her to keep competing 
When did she learn how to focus as a professional
Is it difficult to compartmentalize her life 
Breaking down the pay scale/inequality issue in women's soccer
Undertanding how the players fighting for equal pay today will likely never see the benefits in their careers
Did she fully understand/expect the backlash of siding with Colin Kaepernick 
Discussing inequality in sports in general
Has she ever second guessed herself and does she feel vindicated now
On being keenly aware of the noise around her and the release of running through it to win it all
How can the World Cup fandom translate over to the domestic league
What play or moment stands out the most in her career
TOP 5/Draft

How does he swallow the madness that is going on in the White House/Congress/etc.
Where would he say American stands right now in terms of division in his lifetime
How technology has made the spread of hate and misinformation worse
How does technology effect protocols in the CIA
On the secrecy on the CIA and not being able to share info like a normal member of society
Are there any movies or TV shows that have depicted the CIA correctly - or even closely
The most impactful/memorable event in his career
Discussing the bin Laden raid 
His feeling about Trumps tweets and re-tweets
Who are some of the best leaders he's been around and what are their qualities
PFT Commenter
Discusses Mt Rushmore and how it came about
Comparing Big Cat's place with JJ's
The story of how he came up with his handle

STAYME7O PROPEL Program
Earlier this month as part of New York Fashion Week, Carmelo’s fashion banner STAYME7O presented the PROPEL SS21 collection, “A Black Future”, featuring collaborations from seven Black designers as a way to honor the Black creative community. The STAYME7O PROPEL Program is an ongoing initiative that champions not just emerging fashion talent but honors a vision of Black excellence and reimagines the cultural landscape and creative spaces where diversity has been underserved, starting within the fashion industry. The immersive, virtual 3-D fashion show that launched the program’s debut collection focused on the movement for Black independence, freedom of expression and how Black creativity always has, and continues to move and change the world around us. https://stayme7o.com/ 
  
The Social Change Fund
This summer, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul launched the Social Change Fund, which is dedicated to investing in and supporting organizations that advocate for the Black community through long-term policy solutions, community representation, and narrative change. The Fund focuses on critical issues including ending police brutality, championing criminal justice reform and inclusion, advocating for the human rights of all Black lives, empowering communities of color by expanding access to voting and civic engagement, increasing Black representation in government, and building economic equity for Black people through investment in education, employment, wages, and housing. https://www.thesocialchangefund.org/ 
  
The Carmelo Anthony Foundation
Carmelo Anthony founded the Carmelo Anthony Foundation over 15 years ago as a vehicle for actionable change focused on community impact through a variety of outreach programs, disaster relief initiatives, and donations. The nonprofit has since established programs to refurbish basketball courts in underserved communities, provide families in need with food and personal supplies during the holidays, and provide much-needed disaster relief in the wake of tragedies such as super storm Sandy, the Flint Water Crisis, Hurricane Maria and more. The Carmelo Anthony Foundation has always been focused on initiatives for social reform and community impact, and continues today in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and championing open discussion and actionable change around protests, police brutality and progress. http://www.thecarmeloanthonyfoundation.org/

Carmelo Anthony founded the Carmelo Anthony Foundation over 15 years ago as a vehicle for actionable change focused on community impact through a variety of outreach programs, disaster relief initiatives, and donations. The nonprofit has since established programs to refurbish basketball courts in underserved communities, provide families in need with food and personal supplies during the holidays, and provide much-needed disaster relief in the wake of tragedies such as super storm Sandy, the Flint Water Crisis, Hurricane Maria and more. The Carmelo Anthony Foundation has always been focused on initiatives for social reform and community impact, and continues today in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and championing open discussion and actionable change around protests, police brutality and progress. http://www.thecarmeloanthonyfoundation.org/

        <![CDATA[There is only one Mark Cuban, and it's easy to see why in this fantastic interview with the brilliant Dallas Maverick's owner. Covering subjects ranging from the NBA Boycott and the future of rising star Luka Doncic, to winning a championship and what makes a leader, he presents it all in his brutally honest and unique way. Plus, controversy arises in the OM3 Top 5/Draft after a last minute change to the topic puts JJ in a hole. Was it a simple oversight, or a calculated move by Tommy? Enquiring minds want to know. Listen in to see how it all shakes out.
