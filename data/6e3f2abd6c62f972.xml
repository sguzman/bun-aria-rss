      <title>Justin Martin's Babies Shock Uncle Si with Their Tracking Technology</title>
      <description>Martin's wife, Brittany, found a new gadget to help with the twins' gas relief, and Martin learned the hard way how quickly it starts working. John-David's parents have decorated for Christmas, and the boys discuss how early is TOO early to put up the holiday cheer. Martin already has his idea for his boys' first Christmas card photo. Stone realizes Uncle Si and the twins have a lot in common. Martin has rediscovered all his old favorite sitcoms during 3:00 a.m. feedings. Si is blown away by how far baby technology has come. And the boys answer a fan question: Can you forgive someone even when they haven't asked for forgiveness?

      <title>Uncle Si Has a New Weight-Loss Method &amp; Godwin Is Down 28 lbs!</title>
      <description>Godwin isn't gonna stand for Jay making fun of his weight, and he decides to let him know exactly how much he's lost and how well he's doing. Si loves everything about the state of Mississippi, especially the Homes of Hope for Children. He recounts the time a prank was played on him at the Longleaf Plantation ... and how it took him a second to realize it. And why doesn't he like chicken pot pie? Stone knows exactly where Willie learned not to sit still and elaborates on all the customization he's had to do for Si's childproof, Si-proof, Willie-proof deer stand. Si and Jay take turns making fun of Willie for how he acts in the blinds. Jay wonders why people choose parking spots close to the door, and John-David explains the science of why it doesn't matter.

      <title>Phil Robertson Takes On a Motel Intruder</title>

Jay excites Si and John-David with a story of a "large black cat" running in the woods.

Godwin talks about his experiences at a renaissance festival in Texas. Martin gives advice for those moving to Florida, and Si talks about hunting in Phil and Kay's front yard. John-David is adamant that he will never try Miss Kay's squirrel brains.

      <title>Willie Thought Korie Was Growing an Adam's Apple!</title>
      <description>Korie Robertson says Willie was once absolutely sure she was growing an Adam's apple — and didn't tell her! She also divulges Willie's critical fishing mistakes and reveals how long John-David actually wet the bed. What do you like eating now that you didn't when you were younger? Martin talks about changing taste buds and they all agree on one thing: blue cheese is terrible. Si is still bitter at the squirrels who ate all his treasured strawberries one summer, plus that time his weenie dog, Merlin, beat him to his garden tomato. Martin doesn't miss the smell of wilted salad and hot vinegar dressing in his grandma's house. And Si describes his adventure in a mustard field in Germany that he — surprisingly — remembers quite well.

      <title>Uncle Si Almost Died Fighting a Redfish </title>
      <description>Si gets philosophical about life, death, and why he failed algebra. Martin debunks this with the REAL reason. Stone tells the story of Si almost dying while he reeled in a redfish. And is it worth it to pay for preassembled furniture? Si and Martin think so. Stone describes how the mind can twist specific events around ... like when it comes to "seeing" black panthers. John-David gets his own black panther hat — since he's the other believer in the room. Plus, the boys share encouragement for a fan who feels he's not doing enough for his wife and family.

      <title>Uncle Si Has a Love-Hate Relationship with Phil Robertson's Dogs</title>
      <description>Phil and Miss Kay are known for the pets they keep, be it the revolving door of Bobos and Bebes or their hunting dogs. Martin and Jay reminisce about Phil's great retriever, Blue, and his odd personality, and Si remembers being Blue's pee target whenever he tried to take a nap. Si has the boys howling about Jase's suggestion that Blue live in the house with Phil and Miss Kay for a few weeks. Jay talks about how protective the late Bobo was and even shows some videos in his honor. Martin shares the piece of advice he's plain TIRED of hearing and gives an update on how Brittany is doing in the final days of her pregnancy. John-David can't believe he's never heard Si tell the story of the time a squirrel bit him — and the subsequent lesson that squirrel quickly learned. And we're all praying for a friend of the show, Zac Stephens, who just went through a leg amputation after a terrible accident.

      <title>Uncle Si in the Spanish Dub of 'Duck Dynasty' Is AMAZING</title>
      <description>Uncle Si nearly busts a rib laughing at the Spanish dub of "Duck Dynasty." Martin gives his twins a pep talk ahead of their big debut. The boys think Si would be a strong addition to Life Alert ads. John-David has a close encounter with a time traveler at the Honey Hole. Martin can't take the utter stupidity of the Department of Agriculture's move to stop duck hunters from spreading avian flu. Godwin's blood sugar dips so he dives into a can of Vienna sausages ... much to John-David's dismay. And the boys share their tips for how new duck hunters should get started.

      <title>Uncle Si's Hospital Shenanigans</title>
      <description>Si is back, Jack!!! While he's new and improved, he's still recovering and feeling a little rough. Phillip and Si share some hilarious hospital stories, including stealing wheelchairs, putting on hospital gowns backwards, filling up bedpans, and accidentally calling for nurses 24/7. Si's wearing a cool black panther hat sent in by a fan — and all the boys are jealous. Martin and John-David help Si give advice on how to spend more time with your kids when you work a full week. John-David and Phillip talk about whether going to church is something you have to do. And thank you — everyone! — for keeping America's favorite uncle in your thoughts and prayers.

      <title>How Miss Kay Really Injured Her Hand </title>
      <description>Miss Kay busted her finger in the craziest way possible, but she's getting by in strange new ways. John-David tries to get to the bottom of why Willie still has blond hair. Miss Kay drops jaws with her tales of what Phil does in bed at night. Martin points out just how much Si there is in Willie.

      <title>Uncle Si Absolutely Terrifies People in NYC</title>
      <description>Uncle Si is scarier than a cannibal? People in NYC seem to think so, according to a new viral video. Godwin gives an update on what he can and can't eat with his newly diagnosed diabetes, and the boys share keto diet tips. Martin is horrified by John-David's discovery of a company that makes area rugs from your dead pets. And should John-David buy a replica of the Jurassic Park Jeep? Plus, the boys give breakup advice to a heartbroken hillbilly and send encouragement to a couple who suffered a miscarriage.

Si's kidneys may just be the eighth wonder of the world, and the scientist in Martin has questions. And the boys serve up advice on how to handle an in-law who overstays her welcome and how to quit a job.

      <title>Miss Kay Tricks Si with the Ultimate Regift</title>
      <description>Miss Kay gave Uncle Si a jacket he LOVED, but she may have neglected to mention why his name was really on it. Si has a new way to ride to the deer stand — powered by Stone. Si finally puts his big miss behind him with two more deer, and BK gets excited — in her own way — when she kills her first mallard drake. Stone demonstrates why Si's not allowed to blow a duck call when they hunt. Si believes the pristine mud of North Arkansas may have healing properties. John-David brings us a question from a sorority sister. And the boys weigh in on getting baptized a second time.

      <title>Why You NEVER Get in a Rig With Phil Robertson</title>
      <description>Phil Robertson is NOT someone you want to get in a boat with, and Jay Stone and some corporate bigwigs have the near-drowning story to prove it. Martin and Stone talk about the perils of navigating the floodwaters during duck season. Si sports his new hat, and John-David can’t tell if we're seeing a raccoon tail or Si’s ponytail. The boys tip their hats to a group of dads who went ALL IN on getting local high school kids back on track. Stone rants about litter and road signs getting shot up. And when John-David leads the boys into a conversation about how to handle the death of a loved one, Martin and Si drop a whole lot of wisdom.

      <title>Uncle Si Has a Secret to Smelling So Good</title>
      <description>Si's idea of a bubble bath is disturbingly hilarious. John-David gives a report from his first day in Jay Stone’s House of Pain.

The boys talk about the things you don’t want to find in your duck blind and Phil’s duck hunting strategy. Stone and Martin remember the greatest duck whacking of all time and reveal who killed the most banded ducks. And the boys encourage a listener on his incredible weight loss.

      <title>Uncle Si &amp; Godwin Go Full Gordon Ramsay</title>
      <description>Si and the boys are stunned by Godwin's surprise entrance. "Uncle Sí" chats with Alexa. Godwin rates fans' sandwiches, but we might have to DQ the winner. Martin urges people not to put goldfish into lakes. Si is delighted by a memory of farting deer, and he confirms that his signature blue Tupperware tumbler isn't the only cup in his collection. John-David reads listener emails about pickup lines, door-to-door candy sales, and Si's everyday carry. And heads up: It's probably a bad idea to put "former CEO of Duck Commander" on your résumé if you're not Willie Robertson.

      <title>Uncle Si Finds NEW Panther Proof on Phil's Land</title>
      <description>Si is convinced that Jay Stone’s trail cam picked up a panther on Phil’s land. Stone reveals the coolest thing he's ever captured on a trail cam and talks about the freakishly large "devil deer" he shot. John-David gives the boys a spelling pop quiz after Louisiana's own Zaila Avant-garde wins the National Spelling Bee. The city with the most authentic Cajun food is NOT New Orleans. Martin is the subject of the weirdest question ever asked on this podcast. Stone has advice for a man who recently got engaged. And when it comes to friends, how close is TOO close?

      <title>How Uncle Si and Godwin Met Their Wives</title>
      <description>Si talks about meeting his wife in an unexpected place, but it's hard to top Godwin's "Jerry Springer"-worthy story of how he met his woman. Martin has questions about hot dog eating contests and the people who enter them. Si recalls the time Willie became an accidental panhandler. Godwin made a top-shelf meal from the bread JD brought in, and now he's ready to rate your sammich. The boys talk about a venom-spitting snake on the loose, getting rid of pests, the best places to visit in West Monroe, and how to find people to date when church isn't working. And Si calls BS on Martin's biology lesson.

      <title>Uncle Si Goes to Prison</title>
      <description>Si is looking GOOD after getting talked into a salon makeover by a Paula Deen lookalike. Willie has finally turned into Phil Robertson. Si asks for your help after he visits an inmate who isn't quite ready to hear what he has to say. Phillip relives getting his tail whupped by a girl at the children's home where he works, and Si reminisces about breaking a guy's hand with his hard head. John-David can't get enough of permed mullets, but can he get Martin on board with the trend? President Si announces the first thing he'll do as leader of the free world. And the boys extend a heartfelt apology to their truck-driving listeners.

      <title>Uncle Si's Favorite Pickup Line</title>
      <description>Si and JD reveal their winning lines guaranteed to get a girl to go out with you, and the world may never be the same. But first, Godwin and Si can't get enough of the sourdough loaf JD's wife, Alyson, baked for them. A fan sends in Si's yearbook pics. Godwin is all about a 16-ounce bacon steak and the Martin-inspired sandwich he calls "Godwin's Goodies." Si tries to keep JD from going negative on his wife's cooking. The boys are seriously disturbed by almond milk and intrigued by deer milk. Si talks about his family's smokehouse and how he and his dad robbed a beehive. And the boys tackle roadkill and offer relationship advice to an engaged couple and a pair of retirees.

      <title>Uncle Si's Dating Advice for Loners</title>
      <description>Si Robertson ain't buying what Joe Rogan is selling when it comes to black panthers (but he still believes, boys). Si calls out dumb humans for trying to play God with wild animals. JD takes issue with pronouncing silent letters, tiny plates, and Willie's claim about Bella's wedding. Si and the boys consider crashing Phil, Jase, and Al's live podcast in Texas on Wednesday (shh, don't tell). Godwin, JD, and Si share their best fatherly advice. Si almost joined the Marines, but one thing stopped him. Martin nails his dating advice for introverts — complete with a seating chart. And if you're a loner who's having trouble meeting your special someone, Si has exactly what you need to hear today.

Godwin didn't know weekend fishing was a contest, but just so you know, Si won. Martin strongly objects to the concept of paying for chicken salad. Si's parents were mad scientists in the kitchen, and Willie takes after them. John-David explains the rules of the Chick-fil-A "my pleasure" game.

      <title>Uncle Si's Bathroom Antics Are LEGENDARY</title>
      <description>Si unintentionally gives new meaning to "potty humor," and Stone has been laughing about one particular incident for 15 years. Martin and Si kick off a VERY open dialogue about their recent bathroom misery, and that leads to stories about the Robertson family's personal hygiene and other tales from the duck blind that have never been told in public. It's possible Bullfrog has been hanging around Si too much, but is the world ready for a female Si? JD is amazed by 1980s bear wrestling at the mall, and Si and Stone have mixed reviews for ice fishing and dog sledding. Bonus: Stone does an incredible Si impression.

      <title>Uncle Si Is the Life Coach You Need Right Now</title>
      <description>Si is feeling spry and ready to rescue fans from terrible life advice. He NAILS his response to a guy who wants to know if his girlfriend is the one, and the boys address the elephant, er, edamame in the room: vegetarian baggage in a relationship. But first, Si reveals the "Duck Dynasty" pic he's signed more than any other. Godwin's house attracts all the neighborhood dogs, and Si's place attracts raccoons that look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. On a related note, JD won't eat anything known as a "trash panda." And the boys share their freakiest possum stories and give a BIG thank you to the police.

      <title>Uncle Si Catches Willie Telling Whoppers</title>
      <description>Si calls Willie out for spreading very fake news about the Robertson family. Johnny D is shocked to learn that grandmas spank people. Si broke a whole lotta butcher knives as a kid and ALMOST didn't live to tell the tale. Stone remembers his mom whipping his butt at basketball to teach him a lesson. Martin's grandmother put a unique (and possibly poisonous) spin on washing kids' mouths out for cussing. Si explains why he and Jase are practically the same person. Stone shares a pic of the homemade hazmat suit Jase wore when bats invaded his house. Si talks about how God brought him back to Louisiana when his wife said she'd never return. And the boys reveal their favorite Disney princesses.

      <title>Uncle Si Visits Some Very Naked Beaches</title>
      <description>Si isn't exactly sure what Dogecoin is, but he predicts it's going to the moon!  Godwin is judging JD HARD for wearing socks at the beach, and Si doesn't understand why anyone would hit the beach in socks when you're supposed to be ... nude? Godwin shows off his extremely flat feet in all their shoeless glory. Martin sings the praises of gas station fried chicken and hog head cheese. Si doesn't buy what the media's telling him about the skyrocketing price of lumber. The boys deliver a crash course on marriage thanks to Bill and Melinda Gates. JD gives Si literal chill bumps with a story about a humble hero who saved a little girl's life. Si reveals the one thing he won't eat from a fast food place, Martin lays down his one rule about fast food, and the Duck Call Room weighs in on favorite fast food joints (and which ones should be kicked to the curb).

      <title>Uncle Si's Greatest Fantasy Matchups of All Time </title>
      <description>Si Robertson was a football phenom back in the day, and oh, does he have stories. After reliving the near-death experience of going up against Steve "The Bear" Jones, Si, Martin, JD, and Phillip play a game of what-ifs. What if prime Muhammad Ali got in the ring with prime Mike Tyson? Who would win if Jack Nicklaus took on Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan took on Kobe Bryant? Could Walker, Texas Ranger beat Marshal Matt Dillon in a fight? And most importantly, would Si rather fight one Martin-sized duck or 100 duck-sized Martins? The boys try to come up with the toughest man who ever lived, and they debate which quarterback is the GOAT: Drew Brees or Tom Brady. Si also attempts to name a fan's baby and shares his advice on raising a daughter.

      <title>Uncle Si and the Loch Ness Bass </title>
      <description>Uncle Si is a Louisiana legend, but he's got some competition from the Loch Ness Bass of Toledo Bend. Major League Fishing pro Jacob Wheeler drops by and reveals the craziest thing he's ever caught (and why he had to call the police after he reeled it in). Johnny D is stunned by what the professional angler catches with his $500 lure. Wheeler shares the story of the one that got away — the infamous Big Ed. Si introduces Wheeler to the joys of mustard fried crappie. The boys weigh in on what bait they'd use if they were limited to just one. Martin gets Wheeler to tell the embarrassing story of how his boat almost made an escape on the interstate. The boys try to settle the corks vs. bobbers debate. And Wheeler breaks some BIG personal news.

      <title>Uncle Si Won't Go Fishing Alone EVER Again </title>
      <description>Si's got another wild one for you, boys! It's a battle of wills as America's uncle goes up against an unrelenting 15-pound bass, but only one will emerge victorious. Willie's 49th birthday party serves up the best rib eyes and even better opportunities to throw Sadie's husband under the bus. The hilarity is nonstop as the boys talk shorty shorts on men, party meat etiquette, in-laws, people who skim sausage from a pot of gumbo, and banana and mayo sandwiches. Martin gives a shout-out to a fifth-grade entrepreneur who makes fishing baits. Stone explains how his daughter got the nickname "Bullfrog" from Phil Robertson. There's a good reason Vienna sausages make JD gag. And Godwin is acing his new diet, but there's one problem.

      <title>Uncle Si Is Fixin' to Be Bad to the Bone</title>
      <description>You can't spell "silky" without "Si," and Si is determined to find a silky dragon jacket just like the one he wore when he met his wife. Is there a replacement to match his VERY specific wishlist? Miss Kay says Si stabbed her hand with a fork, but that's not how Si remembers it. Big Bird is NOT safe around Si and Martin. Godwin becomes the handyman during his trip to Al's southern lair. Si's favorite game causes a LOT of belly laughs. The boys remember the "Duck Dynasty" days and the explosive fallout from Si's "Vietnam Special," and JD tries to settle two of life's important questions: Waffle House or Cracker Barrel? And Bert or Ernie? And Si looks back on 50 years with Christine and the birth of his miracle babies.

      <title>Uncle Si Ain't Buying the Propaganda</title>
      <description>Si teaches a master class on how to hustle a skeet shooter, but then he loses a crisp hondo to Stone's 13-year-old daughter on their fishing trip. Si and the boys shake the Robertson family tree, and a whole lotta hilarity falls out, including what Phil did when Al had appendicitis, the time Phil had food poisoning and refused to miss a duck hunt, and the tale of Uncle Marvin the Lead-Eater. Stone brokers a compromise when his kid refuses to go to the daddy-daughter dance. Martin nails the two things everyone sucks at, and Si reveals the magic words every marriage needs. JD gets roasted for his truly hideous shirt. And Si says JD, Martin, and Stone can flush their theories on PED use in baseball right down the bidet — he knows the truth.

      <title>Uncle Si Lets His Freak Flag Fly</title>
      <description>Si may just have a thing for Shania Twain and Salt-N-Pepa, and there's a good reason he doesn't care who knows. Martin, Godwin, and Johnny D admit their favorite guilty-pleasure songs and rank the best sports movies of all time. After breaking down the Masters, Si throws down some fightin' words when he tells Godwin bull riding isn't a real sport. The boys talk eggs and sausage, the problem with hunting in Louisiana, the vileness of buttermilk, and the one vegetable Godwin would outlaw. And Johnny D shares a status update on his relationship with Willie.

      <description>Si really hates snakes. But when it comes to traumatic flashbacks, nothing compares to the horror of ... butterscotch ice cream? Confirmed: Martin is a snake-lovin' weirdo.

      <title>Uncle Si Gets Owned by an 11-Year-Old Girl</title>
      <description>A surprise guest defeats Si in a battle of skill, and then in true Duck Call Room fashion, she rubs it in. But first, Si and John-David bond over playing "Tiger Woods PGA Tour" on Playstation, and Si has a message for a fan who measured how many times he says "hey" and "no." Stone installs a canopy on his boat to protect Si, and Martin remembers the time Si burned his legs to a crisp in the Bahamas. The boys also tackle how to pronounce "crappie" the right way, why there are too many cities in the city of Dallas (not a typo), and what their favorite shotguns are.

      <title>Uncle Si Reveals Victoria's Secret</title>
      <description>Si is just about done with this "bunch of idiots" using the word "tumultuous" and forcing him to listen to the Hall and Oates emergency helpline.

      <description>Si relives the worst whuppings he ever got from his parents and shares the story of why he'll never forget his mama's switch bush. John-David realizes he's missing $1,250, and the culprit is his 7-year-old son. Si gets ready to take a belt to John-David to teach him a little Parenting 101. He also recalls all the butts that got torn up when Phil caught 16-year-old Al and his buddies drinking beer. And the boys delve into Si's free-spirited nudist days, laughing at Si's drill sergeant, Godwin's smoooooth answer to a question about his favorite trophy, Martin's philosophy on child discipline, and whether it's true that "it hurts me worse than it hurts you."

Then, Si and the boys answer your questions: Is a hot dog a sandwich, which actor would play you in a movie, and are hemorrhoids actually contagious? Martin and Godwin say Si can out-eat any of them and has proved it with a donut-eating contest. Si also holds the record for eating more of Phil’s burgers than anyone else. The number will surprise you!

      <title>Uncle Si, You Just Got Ghosted</title>
      <description>If Willie listens to this, things could get awkward fast. Si issues an apology to fans, but his remorse is short-lived. The boys try to solve the mystery of who sent Si 72 cans of Mr &amp; Mrs T. They also share stories about the time Godwin dyed his beard and the weirdness that happens when Si uses an iPhone. John-David slams into his friend's truck, and that reminds Martin of the time Godwin backed into his truck while they were on the phone. Si closes it out with golf tips, the secret to his famous tea, and a Bible verse (complete with sound effects) for people who mess with old folks.

      <title>Why Uncle Si's Beard Is Shorter on One Side</title>

      <title>Uncle Si's COVID-19 Story</title>
      <description>Si went to the hospital (under protest, of course). We knew something had to be wrong when he was quiet and wouldn't laugh or smile. He was diagnosed with COVID-19, drove everyone at the hospital nuts, came home, and took a turn for the worse. But as Martin said, "It ain't gettin' Si. Not on my watch." Many of you reached out to find out where Si's been, so we decided to share the whole story of his ups and downs with the coronavirus, along with some of our favorite memories of the often headstrong, always hilarious, one-of-a-kind Si Robertson.

      <title>Si, Godwin, and Martin React to the Last Man Neutered in West Monroe</title>
      <description>Godwin looks on in abject horror, and Si and Martin can't stop laughing as John-David shares his "neutering" story. "The Last Man Neutered in West Monroe" might make a terrible Western, but it's just another day in the life of John-David. Godwin drops some sound effects worthy of "Police Academy" and says his wife is a little lippy. Si explains how he knows it's Phil and Jase flaring the ducks. He also offers his advice for a long, happy marriage and gets ready to try out his DIY tummy tuck with spandex and some sort of gel. And the boys reveal what's in store for New Year's Eve and 2021.

      <itunes:summary>Godwin looks on in abject horror, and Si and Martin can't stop laughing as John-David shares his "neutering" story. "The Last Man Neutered in West Monroe" might make a terrible Western, but it's just another day in the life of John-David. Godwin drops some sound effects worthy of "Police Academy" and says his wife is a little lippy. Si explains how he knows it's Phil and Jase flaring the ducks. He also offers his advice for a long, happy marriage and gets ready to try out his DIY tummy tuck with spandex and some sort of gel. And the boys reveal what's in store for New Year's Eve and 2021.

      <title>Float Like an Uncle Si, Sting Like a Bee</title>
      <description>It all started with 27 bees dive-bombing Si Robertson's backside, but that's not his only buzzworthy tale. Godwin is back with a Christmas tree-eating contest, reindeer games, his best bull-riding story, and what happened when he didn't buy his wife a Christmas gift. Martin remembers his first Christmas with the Robertsons. John-David gives Si his very first Christmas Tree Cake. Si has a theory that Kiss isn't really a rock band and offers a brutally honest review of "Ted." The boys get into favorite Christmas songs and movies, gag gifts, a present as soft as mashed potatoes, and what you never knew about Godwin. And it's time to settle the two great Christmas debates of our time: Real trees or fake? And colored lights or white?

Check out Si's tale of Eagle the Twisted Pigeon, one of the funniest Bible-study pranks of all time, and how Si almost got Phillip killed.

Martin reveals who's building the duck calls now. John-David shocks everyone with the results of his Si fact-check. And if you're somehow still wondering: Si's not dead.
