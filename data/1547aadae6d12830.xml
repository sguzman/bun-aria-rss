			<title><![CDATA[375 - How to be a Christian Nationalist - with Kaitlyn Schiess]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>How to be a Christian Nationalist</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Today, we are joined by author, Holy Post CoHost, friend of the podcast and one of our favorite guests, <strong>Kaitlyn Schiess,</strong> to discuss Christian Nationalism and our place within it. What is a Pastor's roll in speaking on national events or issues? How do they establish trust with that? What is our expectation of them? How do those of us who are against the idea of Christian Nationalism engage? How do we understand and navigate the Holy Spirit? How do we know what is a prompting or how to understand or decipher it's movements??? This is a really wonderful conversation with Kaitlyn!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[374 - Man Up!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Man Up!</strong></em> &nbsp;There has been a resurgence of Christian rhetoric around 'Biblical Masculinity,' with conferences like Man Up! and books that speak to the 'Masculinity of Jesus,' railing against the effeminate, egalitarian, 'soft' Jesus. Today, we take walk through Genesis 1 to see what the Bible actually says about gender and the the imposed hierarchy of male and female. Why do Christians want to uphold the macho man, head of the house aspect of masculinity so much? How does the creation story unfold? Were women created solely as servants and the 'lesser' sex? How do the words during the human creation actually translate? What was our intended purpose and how did our 'curses' after the garden speak to that? How did everything get so twisted? There's a lot to unpack.</p>
<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to&nbsp;hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>Then we bring in <strong>Dr. Timothy Gombis</strong> to discuss ideologies and why it has become so difficult navigate these current waters.

			<title><![CDATA[372 - A Captive Mind - with Chris Nye]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>A Captive Mind</strong></em>. Today, Mike and Tim chat with new friend Chris Nye about his new book, "A Captive Mind: Christianity, Ideologies, and Staying Sane in a World Gone Mad." Chris is a former pastor and current author who lives in Portland, Oregon. We have a great discussion about ideologies and how we become subject to them. How does Christianity relate to this captivity? What do we do when folks let go of 'faith' for rhetoric? What role does patience and humility play in our relationship to the world, but also to a Church that has become captive to ideologies of their own?? Is Christianity an idea or an event and what is the difference? &nbsp;How does the Gospel of Jesus change this conversation? It's a really important conversation for us, today.</p>
<p>First, Mike discusses a letter and book that was sent to him on how to vote and Tim brings up the Herschel Walker fiasco as well as folks running for office unabashedly claiming the 'Christian Nationalist' title. How has holding these ideologies changed the way the conservative agenda is sought? How do we enter into conversation with folks who cling to their rhetoric despite its hollowness?</p>
<p>You can interact with, and find Chris's book: <a href="http://chrisnye.co/"><strong>HERE</strong></a></p>
<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to&nbsp;hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Captive Mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Today, Mike and Tim chat with new friend Chris Nye about his new book, &quot;A Captive Mind: Christianity, Ideologies, and Staying Sane in a World Gone Mad.&quot; Chris is a former pastor and current author who lives in Portland, Oregon. We have a great discussion about ideologies and how we become subject to them. How does Christianity relate to this captivity? What do we do when folks let go of &apos;faith&apos; for rhetoric? What role does patience and humility play in our relationship to the world, but also to a Church that has become captive to ideologies of their own?? Is Christianity an idea or an event and what is the difference? &amp;nbsp;How does the Gospel of Jesus change this conversation? It&apos;s a really important conversation for us, today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Mike discusses a letter and book that was sent to him on how to vote and Tim brings up the Herschel Walker fiasco as well as folks running for office unabashedly claiming the &apos;Christian Nationalist&apos; title. How has holding these ideologies changed the way the conservative agenda is sought? How do we enter into conversation with folks who cling to their rhetoric despite its hollowness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can interact with, and find Chris&apos;s book: &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisnye.co/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[371 - Having the Mind of Christ - with Ben Sternke and Matt Tebbe]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Having the Mind of Christ</strong></em>. Today, Mike and Tim sit down with Pastors, podcasters and leadership trainers Ben Sternke and Matt Tebbe, to discuss their new book "<em>Having the Mind of Christ: Eight Axioms to Cultivate a Robust Faith</em>." The group talks about their Gravity Leadership program, both the podcast and their leadership training, as well as the church they founded, <strong>The Table</strong>, in Indiana. What lead them to plant the church? What did they see in a previous church experience and how did they change those habits? What does it look like to 'have the mind of Christ?'</p>
<p>The book, through 8 'axioms' that offer a new set of lenses to see through, looks at common pitfalls within our well practiced discipleship efforts, with a focus on "<em><strong>practices</strong></em><strong> rather than doing the deeper work of learning a new </strong><em><strong>paradigm</strong></em><em>." </em>Sternke and Tebbe advocate for a new way of seeing ourselves, the World and God through each of these practices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike and Tim also spend time discussing an email sent in from a Pastor and listener of the pod who is struggling with wether or not to leave the pastorate. Where is the line between cruciformity and martyrdom? When is it time to leave? What is irreparable and what is worth fighting for? How can Pastors lead &nbsp;when congregates offer only ultimatums?&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Insulted - Part Three: Friend of Sinners</strong></em>. This episode we are venturing back into understanding Jesus through the insults that were hurled at him. Today, it's the claim that he was a '<strong>glutton, a drunkard and a friend of sinners</strong>.' As Jesus subverted what was expected of Him, He also provoked conversations about who was welcome and why. What was the cultural context of this? What did sinner mean? Who was calling Jesus this and what was the reason for it? What is the history that leads up to Jesus and what dis His actions say to the community? How was He a glutton and a drunkard and what did that mean both in action and cultural context?!?</p>
<p>First, Tim shares a new piece of '<strong>Timbits</strong>!' This is good the church is doing in the world, a counter to <strong>Tim's Troubled Times</strong>. A listener emails in and shares about her church in Canada and what it's doing to reach out to the community around them and lament the pain the church has caused there.&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[369 - In Your Attempt to Both Sides Everything...]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>In Your Attempt to Both Sides Everything... </strong></em>This episode, Mike and Tim attempt to tie up the conversation on Faithful vs. Effective. Mike brings some miserable musings on <strong>Al Mohler </strong>and his recent speech to 'pray, vote and stand' against the left and it's place amongst the marrying of the evangelical and politically right. This deepens the conversation on how we are to reimagine and think beyond the two dimensional political reality we live in. How can we usurp our 'two-sides' thinking to have a more nuanced and Christlike view of the world and our neighbors? Tim has a terrible time with the recent political stunt by Governors DeSantis and Abbott shipping immigrants to Martha's Vineyard. What do we do when human lives are used as pawns? If we don't fight, then what??</p>
<p>The bulk of the episode is centered on a critique Mike was given via email on both sidesing everything. Mike responds and a conversation is had about the true thesis of these last few episodes as well as most 'political' VOXOLOGY episodes. Is there a both sides? Is there life beyond the binary? How are we meant to resist? How do we advocate for change?</p>

			<title><![CDATA[368 - Not Over, But Alongside - with Suzie Lind]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Not Over, But Alongside.</strong></em> Today, Pastor Suzie Lind joins Mike and Tim to conclude a conversation that started two weeks ago about fighting back against a religious right that is looking for power in order to mandate morality. How do we approach this practically and not rhetorically? What does a cruciform life look like when we can see others in our tribe exerting power over? How do we not become that which we resist? What of the fear of Christians openly embracing and advocating violence?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike brings in some content on what it means to be not-of-this-world. How did Jesus speak to Israel resisting Rome? Who are we in that conversations and how do we apply Jesus's specific words then to now? How do we remain a people of hope when so many in our own tribe advocate fear???</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Over, But Alongside.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Today, Pastor Suzie Lind joins Mike and Tim to conclude a conversation that started two weeks ago about fighting back against a religious right that is looking for power in order to mandate morality. How do we approach this practically and not rhetorically? What does a cruciform life look like when we can see others in our tribe exerting power over? How do we not become that which we resist? What of the fear of Christians openly embracing and advocating violence?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike brings in some content on what it means to be not-of-this-world. How did Jesus speak to Israel resisting Rome? Who are we in that conversations and how do we apply Jesus&apos;s specific words then to now? How do we remain a people of hope when so many in our own tribe advocate fear???&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[367 - Masters of (Culture) War]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Masters of (Culture) War. </strong></em>Last week, Tim posed a question to Mike on how we respond to an Evangelical culture that seeks power over. It turned into an episode long conversation. Today, Mike and Tim read and interact with listener responses and questions on the topic. How do we avoid all the same trappings of culture warring and empty loving? Is loving your neighbor only within your community, passive? Is advocating a 3rd way just a practice of avoiding what the right and left are up to? How do we avoid rhetoric that is devoid of action, or, worse, rhetoric that removes involvement? What does it mean to turn the other cheek? Mike also brings in ideas from and discusses the book "American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving," by Christian Smith (Found <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo3683361.html"><em><strong>HERE</strong></em></a>) to further the conversation.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Faithful vs. Effective</strong></em>. Two words we possibly misunderstand or misapply to our lives, our 'calling,' and our relationships to both God and one another. Today, Tim hijacks the conversation to ask Mike about fighting back against a religious right that is looking to emulate Hungary and seize more governmental power in order to mandate morality. It is a very raw conversation. Tim is struggling with the 'focus on your community' approach and asks Mike about staying idle when people are being harmed in God's name. How far does staying on your cross extend? What is the actual cruciform posture? If we aren't meant to also seize power to help, what are we supposed to do? Do we allow people like Floridian governor Ron DeSantis to bastardize and weaponize scripture to rile up his religious base? Sean Feucht?? What was Jesus's approach? What of the early church?

			<title><![CDATA[364 - Insulted - Part One: Bastard]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Insulted - Part One: Bastard</strong></em>. Tim has been asking for a while about the human side of Jesus. While we celebrate and teach heavily on the deistic part of Jesus, being one with God, we know very little about the human part of Jesus. Mike and Tim begin a series today looking at part of that, through the insults and degradations hurled at Jesus in the gospels, and what they meant at that time. What do they show us? How was Jesus's lineage in question? What did His birth say about him, culturally? What was in question? Why did Jesus's birth play out the way it did? What are the cultural implications?</p>
<p>First, Mike and Tim read a couple of emails responding to the topic of being cruciform as Nurse Practitioners, etc. and prescription addiction, from two listeners who work in similar situations. And another that offers a different perspective to the Jordan Peterson/masculinity conversation, from a listener who has been made to feel unwelcome in church communities.&nbsp;</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insulted - Part One: Bastard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Tim has been asking for a while about the human side of Jesus. While we celebrate and teach heavily on the deistic part of Jesus, being one with God, we know very little about the human part of Jesus. Mike and Tim begin a series today looking at part of that, through the insults and degradations hurled at Jesus in the gospels, and what they meant at that time. What do they show us? How was Jesus&apos;s lineage in question? What did His birth say about him, culturally? What was in question? Why did Jesus&apos;s birth play out the way it did? What are the cultural implications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Mike and Tim read a couple of emails responding to the topic of being cruciform as Nurse Practitioners, etc. and prescription addiction, from two listeners who work in similar situations. And another that offers a different perspective to the Jordan Peterson/masculinity conversation, from a listener who has been made to feel unwelcome in church communities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Light - Part Five: Radar Love</strong></em>. JK! Last week wasn't the final installment of our 'Light' series. Today we (might) wrap it up, looking at our inherited understanding of evangelism, a play on ‘<em>This Little Light of Mine</em>…’&nbsp;Where does God exist? Is it He that arrives or us? Why do we use terminology like’Bringing Jesus to people,’ or inviting God? Are there certain areas or times God is present?</p>
<p>Also: Is Cracker Barrel ‘woke?’ How can or should a brother speak into a seemingly toxic relationship his sister is in? How can that be done in a cruciform way? How, too, can a Physician’s Assistant navigate patients who are in pain and want prescriptions that could be harmful? How can that conversation be had in a Christ like way?? These are real world, real time circumstances…</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Light - Part Three: Jordan Peterson, Masculinity &amp; ‘One Another.’ </strong></em>Yowza. Today, we continue our conversation on 'evangelism.' First, Mike and Tim discuss Sean Feucht's not surprising enormous pay day from his 'let us worship' shenanigans. How do people like Sean hide in plain sight and why do some gravitate to it? Also, Mike and Tim react to a new video from Jordan Peterson on the need to save masculinity and how it's dying out. Why aren't men coming to church as much anymore? What is healthy masculinity? What is it that needs to be saved or do we need to let it die? Is evangelism imposing our understanding of righteousness on others? Or is it something else? Is it the Church's job to influence society, or is it our job to be influenced by Christ?!? Mike gives us <strong>59 (!)</strong> '<em>one another</em>' statements from the New Testament and then he and Tim discuss what those mean for us as Christians and how they speak to our place in the world.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Light - Part Two: Fullness of the Fullness</strong></em>. Today we continue the series on the idea of Evangelism called ‘Light,’ a play on ‘<em>This Little Light of Mine</em>…’&nbsp;Jesus was the fullness of God. How did people in the 1st century witness as Jesus followers? How do we reflect Jesus? How do we reflect the fullness of God? What postures and attitudes do we embody in this world? How do we image the beauty of Jesus? And how does all that play into “evangelism?” If it isn’t arguing people in or convincing someone to pray a prayer, how does it actually look?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Abortion, Adoption &amp; Accommodation. </strong></em><u><strong>Rated PG-13</strong></u><strong> </strong>(Some topics in this episode may be too adult for young ears).

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Light: Bearers of the Name</strong></em>. Today we are starting a new series on the idea of Evangelism called ‘Light,’ a play on ‘This Little Light of Mine…’ We begin with what a name is. How were names used in the ancient world? How does it differ from now? How does God refer to Himself when asked? What does taking the name ‘Christian’ really mean? How does His name differ from how our names are used today? What of the name Jesus? How do we can bear His name individually; how can it rest over a place; how do we can walk in a way that can bear His name? What does ‘Hallowed be Thy name’ mean in this? How doe we profane His name? How does this set up the idea of Evangelism???</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mike and I sat down to record the podcast for next Monday but couldn’t escape the news today. What’s not lost on us, first of all, is that we are two white, middle aged men adding our voices to the conversation. So we attempt to do so humbly. This is very raw and in the moment. As we all try to navigate the spiritual, social and moral implications of today’s decision, we invite everyone to take a moment with us to listen and make room for lament and grief. How do we strive and really seek to love our neighbors in all areas of our lives? What does it really mean to emulate a God who serves and invests in the long term aspects of human daily life?</p>

			<title><![CDATA[356 - Jesus and the Forces of Death - with Dr. Matthew Thiessen]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Jesus and the Forces of Death</strong></em>. Today Mike and Tim are joined by Suzie P. Lind and Dr. Matthew Thiessen, who is an associate professor of religious studies at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, to discuss ritual impurity. Heyo! What is ritual impurity? How do ritual impurity and moral impurity differ, or do they? Can we fully appreciate how the Gospel writers communicate Jesus’s significance apart from an accurate understanding of the ways in which first-century Jews constructed their world? Do we often misunderstand the Gospel writers’ depictions of Jesus because we naturally force what we read through our modern lenses and definitions? &nbsp;How do we translate what we read into what we can understand currently? Was Jesus Jewish, but not that Jewish? Do we pick and choose as readers what Jewish aspects we want Jesus to have to support our narrative? Where do corpses and blood fit in?? This one is a wild ride into theologically nerdy territory.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus and the Forces of Death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Today Mike and Tim are joined by Suzie P. Lind and Dr. Matthew Thiessen, who is an associate professor of religious studies at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, to discuss ritual impurity. Heyo! What is ritual impurity? How do ritual impurity and moral impurity differ, or do they? Can we fully appreciate how the Gospel writers communicate Jesus’s significance apart from an accurate understanding of the ways in which first-century Jews constructed their world? Do we often misunderstand the Gospel writers’ depictions of Jesus because we naturally force what we read through our modern lenses and definitions? &amp;nbsp;How do we translate what we read into what we can understand currently? Was Jesus Jewish, but not that Jewish? Do we pick and choose as readers what Jewish aspects we want Jesus to have to support our narrative? Where do corpses and blood fit in?? This one is a wild ride into theologically nerdy territory.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>The Jewishness of the Gospel</strong></em>. Today, Mike and Tim sit down with Dr. Jen Rosner, to discus her new book “<em>Finding Messiah: A Journey into the Jewishness of the Gospel</em>.” Jen, who was born Jewish and later became a Christian, walks us through her own Journey and what she found in study as she reconciled the two traditions and bridges the ancient rift between Jewish identity and Christian faith. How do we so often forget that Jesus was Jewish? How did his Jewish identity inform his work, words, and witness? “When we begin to understand Christianity’s indelible relationship to Judaism, key aspects of the Christian faith come alive and the wonder of the gospel becomes clear in new and powerful ways. Rediscover the Jewish Jesus, and in so doing, experience a deeper and richer faith than ever before.”</p>
<p>Dr. Rosner is an Affiliate Assistant Professor of Systematic Theology at Fuller Theological Seminary. You can connect with Jen and purchase her book <a href="https://www.jenrosner.com/books"><em><strong>HERE</strong></em></a>.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[354 - Image - Part Nine: Works - with Dr. Timothy Gombis]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Image - Part Nine: Works - with Dr. Timothy Gombis. </strong></em>Gombis joins us again to offer his wisdom on the topic of ‘works,’ as we close out the Image series. What is the difference between works and deeds? How does that play out in day to day actions? How does ‘works’ play into ‘faith,’ ‘grace’ and ‘saved?’ We’re continuing our series on Imaging, focusing on the words of Ephesians 2:8-10: "For it is by <strong>grace</strong> you have been <strong>saved</strong>, through <strong>faith</strong>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by <strong>works</strong>, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.”</p>
<p>Mike and Tim also spend some time responding to a few listener emails: What are we saying when we speak of having grace for ourselves? Is that an accurate use of that word? Should Christians avoid public office or do we need to have “godly” people in government? What does a posture of learning look like when you’re an older parent and have held one posture of understanding for decades?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Uvalde, the SBC &amp; Prayers of the People</strong></em>. Mike and Tim are joined by Executive Pastor and Elder of Journey Church <strong>Suzie Lind</strong> to discuss the events of the past week, including the sexual abuse report from the Southern Baptist Convention and the mass shooting in Uvalde Texas. It is a very raw conversation as everyone tries to sort out postures and directions forward. At the end of the conversation, Suzie, Mike and Tim engage in another 'Prayers of the People.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lord, we pray for the people and children who have been subjugated and abused by institutions or those in power, but specifically within your church. Lord that you would bring healing and peace and freedom to those who have been hurt and who have been hiding or have been made to feel shameful by their abusers. Father, we pray that there would be Justice and a complete dismantling of the church that hides and protects those that prey on others, that marginalizes and exerts power over. Lord have mercy.</p>
<p>Father God, we pray for the families of Uziyah Garcia, Jose Flores, Amerie Jo Garza, Xavier Javier Lopez, Nevaeh Bravo, Alithia Ramirez, Tess Marie Mata, Alexandria Aniya Rubio, Layla Salazar, Makenna Lee Elrod, Jayce Luevanos, Jailah Nicole Silguero, Eliana “Ellie” Garcia, Eliahana Cruz Torres, Annabell Guadalupe Rodriguez, Jacklyn “Jackie” Cazares, Maite Yuleana Rodriguez, Rogelio Torres, Miranda Matthis, Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia. Lord, that you would hear their cries; That you would bring mercy; That you would sit with them; That others would walk in grief with them. Lord we pray that American hearts would be empathetic and would bring about the change necessary to keep our babies safe, to keep our neighbors safe, to keep our elderly safe. God, show us how to be peacemakers and not just peace keepers.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[352 - Culture War Refugees - with Dr. Timothy Freakin Gombis]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Culture War Refugees</strong></em>. Today, Tim Gombis beams in from his porch to discuss a theological understanding of the culture wars and how we're supposed to posture ourselves in these times. How nuanced is the conversation?

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture War Refugees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Today, Tim Gombis beams in from his porch to discuss a theological understanding of the culture wars and how we&apos;re supposed to posture ourselves in these times. How nuanced is the conversation? What is the history of these topics and where do we enter them? Why does the Church need to have enemies? How does that define us? If it isn&apos;t prudent or productive to engage in these &quot;wars,&quot; how do we respond? Where is Jesus in this conversation?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[351 - Image - Part Eight: What is Grace?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Image - Part Eight: What is Grace? </strong></em>Today, we talk about different understandings and interpretations of ‘grace,’ and how they’re to be understood biblically. Grace as God’s favor; as a gift or benefaction; as generosity. The American Understanding of Grace as free from prior conditions; without regard to worth or deserving. What is the OT understanding and how does it differ? What does Paul say? How does Santa fit into all of this? We’re continuing our series on Imaging, focusing on the words of Ephesians 2:8-10: "For it is by <strong>grace</strong> you have been <strong>saved</strong>, through <strong>faith</strong>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by <strong>works</strong>, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.”</p>
<p>Mike and Tim also spend some time reading listener e, ails regarding the abortion conversation.</p>
<p>And stay tuned for <strong>Voxology Radio</strong> this week. Mike and Tim take up new roles as DJ’s to soundtrack your day.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[350 - Culture Warring]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Culture Warring</strong></em>. Today, Mike and Tim discuss the idea of ‘Culture Wars’ in light of the leaked Roe V Wade decision. What’s the goal of a culture war? What does it mean to “win?” Does undoing a law such as this help to save lives? Or is it about the message? What does it mean to actually be ‘Pro Life?’ Is there Biblical permission for culture warring? It seems like Nobody wins a culture war. Either you lay down your weapons and seek peace together as neighbors, or you destroy the culture. The New Testament vision of the church is of these small and vulnerable communities, that venture out into the world to serve and that open up their communities and households to others (especially the marginalized) for encounters of mutual blessing.</p>
<p>At the end of the episode, Mike and Tim try something new in <strong>'Prayers of the People,'</strong> which is hopefully an active way of engaging in prayer and worship on behalf of brothers and sisters all over the globe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We realize the sensitivity of these topics and our intention is to walk in humility as we discuss.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[349 - Image - Part Seven: Gotta Have Faith, Faith, Faith]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Image - Part Seven: Gotta Have Faith, Faith, Faith. </strong></em>Today, Mike and a very sick Tim continue the conversation on Imaging, focusing on the words of Ephesians 2:8-10: "For it is by <strong>grace</strong> you have been <strong>saved</strong>, through <strong>faith</strong>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by <strong>works</strong>, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.” Previously, they established salvation as 'an embodied participation in the new heavens and new earth.' Today, the focus is on <strong>faith</strong>. How does it differ, scripturally, from the understanding most of us grew up with?</p>
<p><strong>What Faith is not:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>Not the opposite of evidence assessment</li>
 <li>Not a leap in the dark</li>
  <li>Not the opposite of works</li>
  <li>Not optimism or a positive mindset that makes us passive</li>
  <li>Not a profession of Faith</li>
  <li>Not good theology</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is faith? Faith has these three elements:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Mental affirmation/intellectual agreement: certain enough to yield</li>
  <li>Professed fealty to Jesus as Lord</li>
  <li>Enacted loyalty to the king, as in the obedience of faith</li>
  <li>Faith as Allegiance.</li>

			<title><![CDATA[348 - Deconstruction, Death & Depression]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Deconstruction, Death &amp; Depression</strong></em>. Today we take a break to digest all of the content from the <strong>Image</strong> series so far to sit with a few listener questions. First, Mike speaks to a comment that rubbed him wrong on his own 'deconstruction.' How do you talk about New Creation and the Gospel with someone on Hospice? If the idea of being '<strong>saved' </strong>is so important and supposedly so easy to understand, why did it take us so many episodes and so much research to unpack? Can the ideas of New Creation and center focus be dialed down to a "Romans Road" style message of the Gospel?? All that and one long critique of both Mike and Tim from recent episodes. So much good stuff from the VOXOLOGY Community!!!</p>
<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to&nbsp;hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[347 - Image - Part Six: Time]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Image - Part Six: Time. </strong></em>Today, we wrap up the first part of our series on 'Imaging,' focusing on the words of <strong>Ephesians 2:8-10</strong>: <em>"For it is by </em><em><strong>grace</strong></em><em> you have been </em><em><strong>saved</strong></em><em>, through </em><em><strong>faith</strong></em><em>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by </em><em><strong>works</strong></em><em>, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.” </em><em><strong>Saved</strong></em><em> </em>is about Space &amp; Time<em>. </em>As Jews thought about the Kingdom Of God, they used two grand eras: <strong>The Old Age</strong>, which was characterized by sin, death and evil, and the <strong>Age to Come</strong>, which was characterized by life, peace, justice and love. The Kingdom Of God was another way of talking about the age to come. In some ways, the two ages have overlapped. This is about <strong>Now and Not Yet</strong>. This is about how we <strong>Have Been Saved, We are Being Saved and We Will Be Saved</strong>.</p>
<p>As we dig into these ideas, we are encouraged to avoid:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Any theology that separates us from our bodies</li>
 <li>Any theology that is escapist</li>
  <li>Any theology that privatizes the way of Jesus</li>
  <li>Any theology that overemphasizes the now or the not yet</li>
  <li>Any theology that overemphasizes or underemphasizes the reality of wrath and judgment</li>

			<title><![CDATA[345 - Image - Part Five: Saved (From)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Image - Part Five: Saved (From). </strong></em>What is wrath?!?<em><strong> </strong></em>Today, we explore God’s judgment, here and now, as this reality where wrath is simply a self-consumptive dynamic. Do people who engage in the oppression of others initiate these cycles of violence and oppression themselves? All the sinful practices that we could possibility engage in humanity wide, they all have us in their grip, making sure that we are dehumanized and dehumanize each other; it’s all part of this cosmic network that is <strong>wrath</strong>. It is self-consumptive. The whole thing is set aflame and will consume itself. Where is God in this? How do New Creation dynamics play into this? What does Paul say in Romans on all of this?<em><strong> </strong></em>Today, we continue our series on Imaging, focusing on the words of Ephesians 2:8-10: "For it is by <strong>grace</strong> you have been <strong>saved</strong>, through <strong>faith</strong>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by <strong>works</strong>, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.”</p>
<p>Mike and Tim also answer a critique on an episode, as well as follow up questions on short term missions trips.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image - Part Five: Saved (From). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;What is wrath?!?&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Today, we explore God’s judgment, here and now, as this reality where wrath is simply a self-consumptive dynamic. Do people who engage in the oppression of others initiate these cycles of violence and oppression themselves? All the sinful practices that we could possibility engage in humanity wide, they all have us in their grip, making sure that we are dehumanized and dehumanize each other; it’s all part of this cosmic network that is &lt;strong&gt;wrath&lt;/strong&gt;. It is self-consumptive. The whole thing is set aflame and will consume itself. Where is God in this? How do New Creation dynamics play into this? What does Paul say in Romans on all of this?&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Today, we continue our series on Imaging, focusing on the words of Ephesians 2:8-10: &quot;For it is by &lt;strong&gt;grace&lt;/strong&gt; you have been &lt;strong&gt;saved&lt;/strong&gt;, through &lt;strong&gt;faith&lt;/strong&gt;—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&amp;nbsp;not by &lt;strong&gt;works&lt;/strong&gt;, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Image - Part Four: Space. </strong></em>Today we continue our series on Imaging, focusing on the words of Ephesians 2:8-10: <em>"For it is by </em><em><strong>grace</strong></em><em> you have been </em><em><strong>saved</strong></em><em>, through </em><em><strong>faith</strong></em><em>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by </em><em><strong>works</strong></em><em>, so that no one can boast.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Image: Part Three - Saved, Continued. </strong></em>This episode, we continue the conversation on what being "Saved" means, as we dive into Ephesians 2:8-10:<strong> </strong>"For it is by <strong>grace</strong> you have been<strong> saved, </strong>through<strong> faith</strong>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by <strong>works</strong>, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." Today, we park in Romans for a bit to pick apart salvific language. What are we saved to? How does restoration play in? How do we image creation back to God, rather than image God to creation?</p>

			<title><![CDATA[341 - Image - Part Two: Saved]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Image - Part Two: Saved</strong></em>. We're continuing this series, looking at the grammar of the gospel, in particular the key words used in <strong>Ephesians 2:8-10</strong>, words that have come to define our faith and understanding of the journey we're on with Yahweh. <em><strong>"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."</strong></em></p>
<p>In Genesis 1 and 2, God makes humanity in his image; that is, God constructs the world as God’s own temple and the <em>image</em> of God in the temple (just like an ancient temples, you go into the temple and there is the image of the unseen diety). In the temple that is creation, the image of the unseen God is humans. All of humanity. As we live lives of flourishing and continue to enjoy and spread the shalom of God within creation, God is glorified b/c that is what the 'Image of God' is meant to do: flourish, enjoy God’s good world, and foster flourishing in the great order of God’s shalom. That is what it means to live for God’s namesake.</p>
<p>How does Psalm 8interact with that opening in Genesis? <em><strong>"When I consider your heavens,&nbsp;the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them? You have made them a little lower than the angels&nbsp;and crowned them with</strong></em><strong> glory and honor</strong>. <em><strong>You made them rulers&nbsp;over the works of your hands;&nbsp;you put everything under their feet: all flocks and herds, &nbsp;and the animals of the wild, the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas."</strong></em></p>
<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to&nbsp;hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image - Part Two: Saved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. We&apos;re continuing this series, looking at the grammar of the gospel, in particular the key words used in &lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 2:8-10&lt;/strong&gt;, words that have come to define our faith and understanding of the journey we&apos;re on with Yahweh. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&amp;nbsp;not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 1 and 2, God makes humanity in his image; that is, God constructs the world as God’s own temple and the &lt;em&gt;image&lt;/em&gt; of God in the temple (just like an ancient temples, you go into the temple and there is the image of the unseen diety). In the temple that is creation, the image of the unseen God is humans. All of humanity. As we live lives of flourishing and continue to enjoy and spread the shalom of God within creation, God is glorified b/c that is what the &apos;Image of God&apos; is meant to do: flourish, enjoy God’s good world, and foster flourishing in the great order of God’s shalom. That is what it means to live for God’s namesake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Psalm 8interact with that opening in Genesis? &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;When I consider your heavens,&amp;nbsp;the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them? You have made them a little lower than the angels&amp;nbsp;and crowned them with&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; glory and honor&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You made them rulers&amp;nbsp;over the works of your hands;&amp;nbsp;you put everything under their feet: all flocks and herds, &amp;nbsp;and the animals of the wild, the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Image - Part One: Return of the King</strong></em>. We're starting a new series today that will help us renew the key words used in <strong>Ephesians 2:8-10</strong>, words that have come to define our faith and understanding of the journey we're on with Yahweh. <em>"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—</em><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em><em>not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."</em></p>
<p>To begin, what is the <strong>Kingdom of Heaven</strong>? How does it operate as an image of God himself? When the White House issues a statement, we all realize the actual White House isn't speaking. It is a symbol or image for the powers within. Everything Jesus said and did pointed to the Kingdom! “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!” Something is here that forces you to reckon and respond.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[338 - Unified - Part Six: War & Centered Relational Dynamics]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Unified - Part Six: War &amp; Centered Relational Dynamics</strong></em>. Today, Mike and Tim begin with a conversation about Ukraine and where we fit in. How are we to be peacemakers in this? What does that even mean? What does the Bible say about war? They then continue the series 'Unified,' and the dynamics of community in 'Centered' Churches <strong>(as first explored by Paul Hiebert, via Mark Baker).&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><strong>Security</strong>: Stuart Murray: <em>“Churches with healthy centers are secure enough to welcome those who are exploring faith and searching for authenticity."</em></li>
 <li><strong>How the Bible is Used</strong>: <em>Disintegrative shaming</em> vs. <em>reintegrative shaming</em> - not all shaming is the same. <em>Disintegrative shaming</em> focuses on making an example of guilty offenders and ensuring they get what they deserve. It stigmatizes. <em>Reintegrative shaming</em> acknowledges that the social bond has been damaged and draws attention to the shameful action, but its goal is to <strong>heal relationships</strong> and <strong>reintegrate</strong> the offender to the group. Stigmatization is shaming the person rather than the behavior and treats the offender like an outcast.</li>
  <li><strong>Membership: </strong>Bounded Church membership can contribute to anemic discipleship by communicating that if you meet certain requirements, you are “in,” even if you are solely a spectator. Bounded Churches tend to focus on certain requirements. How does membership point someone to Jesus? Centered Churches will highlight relational aspects over institutional ones through a sense of commitment to the body and others in the body. It will also feel like an invitation to join a mission. Membership must be described by using language of orientation to, alignment with, commitment to the center rather than the language of requirements and boundaries. Centered Church means we’re never finished or complete in our discipleship.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Gracious Initiative</strong>: The 'Center' reaches out to people and doesn't sit there passively waiting to be approached.</li>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Unified - Part Five: Defining the Center</strong></em>. This episode, Mike offers thoughts on defining the "center" of the 'Centered Set' focus <strong>(as first explored by Paul Hiebert, via Mark Baker). </strong>Defining the center is the most important task of a Centered Focused Church. For christians, the center is the God revealed by Jesus Christ. But, saying that Jesus is the center is not a complete definition. Who is God (our conceptions about God will influence whether we do church in a bounded, fuzzy, or centered way, and the paradigm of our church will influence how we view God)? Who is Jesus??</p>
<ol>
 <li>Jesus was <strong>Jewish</strong></li>
 <li>Jesus preached the <strong>Kingdom Of God</strong></li>
 <li>Jesus preached and embodied the <strong>'Great Reversal'</strong></li>
 <li>The <strong>Kingdom Of God</strong> created <strong>conflict</strong></li>
  <li>Jesus revealed the <strong>Father</strong></li>
  <li>Cruciformity</li>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Unified - Part Four: Earning the Right to be Heard</strong></em>. Today, Mike continues ‘church discipline’ via the Centered set <strong>(as first explored by Paul Hiebert, via Mark Baker). </strong>Jesus and Paul both make it clear that we must do more than simply avoid bounded practices, we must also confront and challenge them. Galatians, for example, is not a reaction to loose moral living but to bounded-church line drawing; Jesus repeatedly exposed and challenged bounded group religiosity. In challenging the bounded approach, we must attack the power of the paradigm rather than the people. We paint the picture of the possibility of being liberated from bounded ways. We seek to liberate people from a view of God that contributes to their bounded ways of judgment against others and themselves. If they see God as an accusing eye in the sky, then no amount of centered intervention will help. We must love extravagantly both through gracious embrace and concrete actions of accompaniment. We must embody centered values: relationship building, mutual learning and transformation.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Unified - Part Three: Treating Symptoms &amp; Roots</strong></em>. Mike continues with the concepts of ‘Bounded, Fuzzy &amp; Centered’ sets <strong>(as first explored by Paul Hiebert, via Mark Baker) </strong>and how they pertain to Church Discipline and leaving behind the judgment of Bounded Churches. Critiquing a Bounded Church is not a critique of boundaries; boundaries are often healthy expressions of care - without limits children do not thrive. While boundaries are good things, a Bounded Church twists and misuses them. A Bounded Church is one whose identity is <strong>defined by the boundary line</strong> and who uses the boundary line to self-righteously divide the included from the excluded.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Discipline in Bounded Churches: Focus is boundary. Not much grace for failure and the focus is on externals, not internals. Exclusion and Shame.</li>
 <li>Discipline in Fuzzy Churches: Avoid most judgment altogether (except for the people who do draw lines). Avoid making someone else feed bad.</li>
  <li>Discipline in Centered Churches: Deal with each case individually. Deal with roots, not symptoms. Relationship building; mutual learning and transformation.</li>

			<title><![CDATA[333 - Unified - Part Two: If I Should Fall Behind]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Unified - Part Two: If I Should Fall Behind</strong></em>. Today we broaden the conversation on unity and what it means to be ‘unified.’ Mike continues the concepts of ‘Bounded, Fuzzy &amp; Centered’ sets <strong>(as first explored by Paul Hiebert, via Mark Baker)</strong>, but furthers it to how they relate and manifest in the Church.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Bounded churches: One’s status in relation to the boundary line is communicated in a variety of ways. “We don’t believe/do that”; silence and shunning. Even hearing how others are talked about (unstated lines are no less real!!!!)</li>
 <li>Fuzzy Churches: Whatever-ism – People refrain from confronting someone else in regard to hurtful actions, but rarely describe beliefs and action as inappropriate.</li>
  <li>Centered Churches: The center is Jesus; Jesus is the focus, not the boundary line. To whom does the person offer their worship or allegiance? Are you living in the new creation? Are you trusting God for your security rather than rituals? Which direction are you heading?</li>
</ul>

			<title><![CDATA[332 - Unified - Part One: Lines and Erasers]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Unified- Part 1: Lines and Erasers</strong></em>. This is the first episode in a longer conversation on 'Unity.' We have received many questions about how we can have unity with people we vehemently disagree with... Here, Mike and Tim first discuss how we define unity, or what it means to be unified. Then, Mike walks us through different "sets" we use (as first explored by Paul Hiebert, via Mark Baker). What is a 'Bounded Set,' and how do we relate to and understand that way of living? How has a 'Bounded Set' been realized in our churches and communities? The next is a 'Fuzzy Set.' How does this relate to 'Bounded?' How might we overcorrect from one and land in the other? Lastly, Mike walks us through the 'Centered Set.' How is this characterized? How might we restructure our communal dynamics to better embody this mindset?</p>
<p>How does all of this relate to deconstruction and leaving the Church? There is so much to unpack here, hence the beginning of a longer conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike also reads a few more listener 'deconstruction' stories. We love this engagement!&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>A Conversation on the Death Penalty</strong></em>. Today, Mike and Tim are joined by new friend Renee Monzon. Renee is a public defender in Ohio who represents people on death row and is a part of our Voxology community. Along with her work in the law, Renee has a heart to educate, inform and tell people’s stories. What is the definition or heart of justice? How has this system fallen apart? Who is the most affected? Where does the Church lay historically within this conversation? Why? As a people who believe in the power of redemption, why are we so much more in favor of the Death Penalty? What can we do? What would Jesus have us do? It’s a tough and controversial topic, but one we need to be having.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[330 - Can We Have Unity Amidst Opposing Ideologies? with Dr. Timothy Gombis]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Can We Have Unity Amidst Opposing Ideologies?</strong></em> Dr. Gombis drops in to revisit a conversation on unity in the Church. We're one year removed from the events of January 6th at the Capital. As people within the Church continue to polarize, can we find unity with folks who have ideologies we radically disagree with? Are there two sides? What are we to do with doctrine or beliefs that have been made hollow? Where is the point to break communion? How are we to conduct ourselves within a polarized community? Are we to call out racism, misogyny and nationalism that uses the Lord's name in vain? It's a difficult topic.</p>
<p>First, Mike and Tim respond to a few more emails of listeners experiences with Christmas being demonized.</p>
<p>The Michael Heiser podcast episode on Christmas that was referenced is perhaps <a href="https://nakedbiblepodcast.com/podcast/naked-bible-195-is-christmas-a-pagan-holiday/"><strong>HERE</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[329 - Santa, Satan & the Unforgivable Sin]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Santa, Satan and the Unforgivable Sin</strong></em>. Happy New Year! This episode, Mike and Tim read and discuss more listener deconstruction stories that have been emailed in. Many have reached out to tell their stories and others have responded that they've found hope hearing like minded folks who are struggling with similar things. Then, Mike and Tim answer some big questions: what is the '<strong>Unforgivable Sin</strong>?!?' How is it framed? What is the context? Has it caused dread for others? How are we to interact with this piece of scripture (remember, Dan Kimball talked to us about not reading one verse by itself, out of context)? Then, a couple listeners wrote in asking about Tim's dislike of Christmas and his love of Halloween as well as whether or not Christmas is evil?!? Big topics, big convo.</p>
<p>0:00 - Seth Intro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3:40 - Thank yous and Mike's booster delirium. Tim recaps crazy dog adoption story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>13:00 - Listener stories.</p>
<p>43:00 - Listener Question on the <strong>Unforgivable Sin</strong>.</p>
<p>50:18 - Mazzy Interruption.</p>
<p>58:00 - Lister Questions on whether or not Christmas is evil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1:22:00 - Ramblings</p>
<p>The <strong>Andy Crouch</strong> article can be read <a href="https://andy-crouch.com/articles/christmas_is_for_everyone"><strong>HERE</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The<strong> Ryan Gosling, </strong><em><strong>Dead Man's Bones</strong></em><strong> </strong>record can be heard <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4xGTfawtEfy5f2yGYtRqlr?si=W1OaROUXSnSMT_TnHBiiog"><strong>HERE</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

			<title><![CDATA[327 - Deconstructing Deconstruction: The End]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Deconstructing Deconstruction: The End</strong></em>. Let's wrap this up, shall we? This episode, Mike presents six different categories that could be causes of someone deconstructing. Mike and Tim discuss how unhelpful it is to make a blanket “you’re deconstructing” condemnation of folks who could be found in any of these places. What are these different causes or places? How do we allow for journey and nuance in this? Is it more helpful to sit with someone in their doubt or questioning, rather than defining it for them? The six categories to consider, other than just Deconstruction: <strong>Disillusionment / Discipleship / De-conversion / Redefinition / Doubt / Disorientation.</strong></p>

			<title><![CDATA[325 - Deconstructing Deconstruction - with Joshua Ryan Butler]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Deconstructing Deconstruction</strong></em>. In what has become a miniseries of its own, today, Joshua Ryan Butler sits down with Mike and Tim to discuss his article for the Gospel Coalition on the causes and cures of deconstruction. How does Josh define deconstruction? Did he talk with anyone about their deconstruction while writing it? Who was the article written for and to serve what purpose? Has he himself ever deconstructed? This is a long chat but well worth the time.</p>
<p><strong>00:00</strong> - Mike’s son Nate sits down with Mike and Tim to discuss his lack of presence on the podcast.</p>
<p><strong>08:49</strong> - Tim kinda repents of his <em>“Troubled Times,”</em> and asks for help in naming a new segment that highlights the good things the Church is doing in the world. If you come across stories of the Church fulfilling it’s calling to serve the World, email them to <strong>hello@voxpodcast.com</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>20:00</strong> - <strong>Joshua Ryan Butler</strong> joins Mike and Tim to answer listener questions and broaden his thoughts on his article: <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/4-causes-deconstruction/" target="_blank"><strong>“Four Causes of Deconstruction.”</strong></a></p>

			<title><![CDATA[323 - What Causes Deconstruction?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>What Causes Deconstruction? </strong></em>In this episode, Mike and Tim respond to Joshua Ryan Butler's article for the Gospel Coalition called <em><strong>"</strong></em><a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/4-causes-deconstruction/"><em><strong>4 Causes of Deconstruction."</strong></em></a><em><strong> </strong></em>In the article, Butler lays out four different causes for deconstruction: <strong>1.</strong> Church Hurt <strong>2.</strong> Poor Teaching<strong> 3. </strong>Desire to Sin.<strong> 4. </strong>Street Cred.<strong> </strong>Each section is broken into a symptom and a cure, ie. "<em>Poor Teaching"</em> is cured by <em>"Good Teaching." </em>Is it wrong to deconstruct? Is it dangerous? Is it selfish? Can deconstruction be broken down this simply? Do we all fall into one of these categories when deconstructing our faith or culture? Is it all as simple as "symptom" and "cure?" If not, how are we to approach this all?</p>

			<title><![CDATA[322 - The Limits of Church Unity - with Dr. Timothy Gombis]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>The Limits of Church Unity</strong></em><em>.</em> Gombis joins us this week to talk about Church unity. We discuss the article <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/evangelical-trump-christians-politics/620469/">"THE EVANGELICAL CHURCH IS BREAKING APART: Christians must reclaim Jesus from his church,"</a> by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/peter-wehner/">Peter Wehner</a> in the Atlantic, which looks at the fragmentation of the Church and how we arrived here. For the most part we all see the brokenness of the Church on a macro level... what about on the micro level, within our own communities? How do we approach this topic? What duty do we have on both that macro and micro level? What does the Bible have to say? How do we un-disciple the last few hundred years that built this model? How do the "Powers &amp; Principalities" play into the equation? Gombis is here to sort through the mess with us.</p>
<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to&nbsp;hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

We discuss the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/evangelical-trump-christians-politics/620469/&quot;&gt;&quot;THE EVANGELICAL CHURCH IS BREAKING APART: Christians must reclaim Jesus from his church,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/author/peter-wehner/&quot;&gt;Peter Wehner&lt;/a&gt; in the Atlantic, which looks at the fragmentation of the Church and how we arrived here. For the most part we all see the brokenness of the Church on a macro level... what about on the micro level, within our own communities? How do we approach this topic? What duty do we have on both that macro and micro level? What does the Bible have to say? How do we un-disciple the last few hundred years that built this model? How do the &quot;Powers &amp;amp; Principalities&quot; play into the equation? Gombis is here to sort through the mess with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to&amp;nbsp;hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[321 - Understanding the Bible: Part Twelve - Interpretation]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Twelve. Interpretation</strong></em>. This is the end… for now. Today, we wrap up the series on understanding the Bible with a conversation about interpretation. So much of every aspect we’ve already covered ties into today’s conversation: Inerrancy. Genre. Context. Accommodation. How do we build the foundation necessary to begin a fresh pursuit of understanding? What role do we play own this divine conversation? Where do we begin with re-discipling?</p>
<p>As always, the complexity of the text is on display and it’s asking us to wrestle with it, to marinate in its mystery and wonder at God’s intentional back and forth with all of us. It’s beautiful in all of its chaos and intricacy.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[320 - How the Subjugation of Women Became Gospel Truth - with Dr. Beth Allison Barr]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>How the Subjugation of Women Became Gospel Truth</strong></em>. This episode is a conversation we've been looking froward to for a long time. Dr. Beth Allison Barr stops by the podcast to discuss her book "The Making of Biblical Womanhood: How the Subjugation of Women Became Gospel Truth." Dr. Barr talks to us about her upbringing and how she came to challenge the traditional understanding of women's roles in the Bible and in the modern church. How has culture influenced translations? What does the Bible, Jesus and even Paul actually say about male headship and the role of women? What can we see when we dive into the history of it all? If the teachings and translations on this topic are inaccurate, how do we have them and why? It's a long and messy topic.&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[319 - Knowing "God's Will" For My Life]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Knowing "God's Will" For My Life</strong></em>. Today we spend time talking about some oft used Christian rhetoric: <em>What is God's will for my life? God gave me a 'word' for you... God told me... I've been called by God to do such and such... </em>We've all heard them. We've wrestled with them. We've probably even said these phrases (Mike and Tim are both guilty). But what do they mean, being so rooted in our Christian lexicon.</p>
<p>Where do these come from? Does God have a 'will' for us? Is it individual? Is it communal? How does Jesus speak about this? How does Paul? How are we to discern God's voice form our own? Is that even the right question?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This topic becomes very touchy as it is very rooted in our beliefs and decision making. How can we best build from here in a responsible and intentional way? What is it that God has actually called us to? And what role does wisdom play?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Eleven - Inerrancy. </strong></em>Today, we're jumping back into our series on the Bible to discuss everyone's favorite buzzword: <strong>Inerrancy.</strong> What does it mean for something to be 'inerrant?' Where did the term come from? How do we qualify something to be inerrant? What are we to do with this in our pursuit of understanding the text? How does genre, context, interpretation etc. play into the inerrancy? How does the human &nbsp;/ divine dance play into this conversation? There is a lot to unpack in here...</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the Bible: Part Eleven - Inerrancy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Today, we&apos;re jumping back into our series on the Bible to discuss everyone&apos;s favorite buzzword: &lt;strong&gt;Inerrancy.&lt;/strong&gt; What does it mean for something to be &apos;inerrant?&apos; Where did the term come from? How do we qualify something to be inerrant? What are we to do with this in our pursuit of understanding the text? How does genre, context, interpretation etc. play into the inerrancy? How does the human &amp;nbsp;/ divine dance play into this conversation? There is a lot to unpack in here...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Feel free to email in questions to&amp;nbsp;hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[316 - Cruciform Church]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Cruciform Church</strong></em>. Mike and Tim have a conversation on what it means for the church to be "cruciform." What does and embodiment of the cross, and Jesus's life before it look like? How are we to navigate the world and our communities?&nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin that conversation, both Mike and Tim react to recent criticism they've both received via email to previous episodes. Tim apologizes for using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxiMrvDbq3s">Woody Guthrie</a> lyrics out of context and offers a bit of the larger conversation and Mike talks a little about 'right and wrong' theologies and whether or not one can take a firm stance on an issue or understanding of the text. How does time, reading, generational influence, intent etc. dictate or influence our reading? How should it? Can there be good readings or scholarship on differing sides of an issue?</p>

			<title><![CDATA[315 - God's Justice]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>God's Justice. Today, Mike and Tim take a detour from the 'Bible' series to discuss justice. After an introduction via 'Tim's Troubled Times,' in which Tim brings up the horrendous debacle with the Haitian refugees at the border (under a democratic administration), the actual trauma of active shooter drills in schools vs. kids wearing masks in the classroom, the lgbtq+ float and student pda vs. moms for liberty and the horror of school board meetings. Are we caught in a cycle of choosing self over neighbor? What does justice look like, biblically? How do we listen to our neighbors, especially those who are suffering? How do we keep it from always being caught up in the binary of left vs. right? Or, from terminology such as 'woke' or 'progressive?' How would Jesus have us look at justice in a social arena? What is our 'calling?'</p>
<p>Mike takes us on a journey through Ephesians and various other scriptures to see what God and Jesus have to say on the topic.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[314 - Understanding the Bible: Part Ten - Genre]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Ten. Genre</strong></em>. Today, we discuss genre and how it should inform our approach to the text. How is the Bible like a Barnes &amp; Noble? And, therefore, how do we enter into it? How does cultural and time/era specific language direct our understanding?</p>
<p>Mike walks us through the book of Revelation as an example of genre taken out of context.</p>
<p>The complexity of the text is on display and it’s asking us to wrestle with it, to marinate in its mystery and wonder at God’s intentional back and forth with all of us. It’s beautiful in all of its chaos and intricacy.</p>
<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to&nbsp;hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Wanderer - Episode 2: Grief, Grace and the Grotesque ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>The Wanderer: Grief, Grace and the Grotesque.</strong></em> Intriguing title, right? It reads like the title of Tim Stafford's autobiography.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Episode Two: Previously on <em><strong>The Wanderer</strong></em>, <a href="https://timgombis.com/" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Timothy Gombis</a> and <a href="https://www.timothyjohnstafford.com/" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Timothy John Stafford</a> discussed their personal histories with the band and how U2's journey in many ways mirrored their own spiritual development. Today, the Tims dive deeper into theme and some rich spiritual ideas that are discussed in a few songs in particular. How do grief and hope relate? How is it discussed outside of sentimentality? What is the mood on <em>'Silent Saturday,'</em> the day between the crucifixion and the resurrection? What is Jesus's relationship to the Grotesque? How can something be both twisted and beautiful at once? What is the grammar of the Gospel? What is the <em>logic</em> of the Gospel??</p>
<p>This will be a three episode mini series, and the first of several topical conversations that will be had under the moniker of the Wanderer. If <a href="https://apple.co/1Lla1Nj">Voxology</a> is the&nbsp;record, the Wanderer is the b-sides.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[313 - Understanding the Bible: Part Nine - Context Continued]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Nine. Context continued</strong></em>. Today, we continue the conversation on the context of the Bible and how to chart the varying understandings, or the work one must put in, to begin to approach the Bible. We spend time digging through all the layers that must be addressed, so that we can see clearly what the Bible is saying and to whom. Where do we, in 2021, fit into this narrative?</p>
<p>The complexity of the text is on display and it’s asking us to wrestle with it, to marinate in mystery and wonder at God’s intentional back and forth with all of us. It’s beautiful in all of its chaos and intricacy.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Eight - Context. </strong></em>This episode, we start the conversation on 'context.' How are we to approach this ancient text? What was the culture? How did the words written inform their world? How are we to relate to it in a responsible and intentional way? What is '<strong>Hermeneutical Humility</strong>?' How can we take on that posture? How is it at odds with our American Evangelical upbringing? How can we combat the individualistic posture we were raised in? Further, how has that individualistic nature informed our theology and approach to God??? Who knew we'd have so much to cover in regards to the Bible... and we have so much more. Thanks for walking the long road with us.</p>
<p>This is a chaotic time period that is placing huge loads on people's shoulders. From the crisis in Afghanistan and the mess in Texas to the consuming fires in California, the catastrophic weather in the South and the never ending pandemic, folks are struggling with immense depression and anxiety. If you feel this weight and the dark, isolating pressure it can bring with it, we want to encourage you to talk to someone. I (Tim) can often not even be aware I'm spiraling and I need to air out the mess before it consumes. Let's cultivate a community that holds each other up, that pulls our neighbor out of the muck and the mire and sits in grief and lament with one another :)</p>
<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to&nbsp;hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[311 - Understanding the Bible: Part Seven - Accommodation Continued]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Seven. Accommodation continued.</strong></em> Today, we continue the conversation on God’s accommodation to humans. Mike offers the spectrum of “the ideal vs. the real.” What does that mean? How does God navigate the ideal He set up with the reality of the human stumble? How does the text accommodate to the view points of the time in which it’s written? How does this effect and shape theology? How do we interact with that? How is the human mess worked in? What are we to do with all of this???</p>
<p>The complexity of the text is on display and it’s asking us to wrestle with it, to marinate in its mystery and wonder at God’s intentional back and forth with all of us. It’s beautiful in all of it’s chaos and intricacy.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[308 - Understanding the Bible: Part Four - with Bradley Jersak]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Four. </strong></em>This episode, we welcome back author and theologian Bradley Jersak to talk about his new book <a href="https://www.christianbook.com/more-christlike-word-reading-scripture-emmaus/bradley-jersak/9781641236522/pd/236523?kw=1240249200658606&amp;mt=b&amp;dv=c&amp;event=PPCSRC&amp;p=1215904&amp;msclkid=b994abed6004161f3e96cafc013b6593&amp;utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Dynamic%20Search%20Ads&amp;utm_term=%2Fpd%2F&amp;utm_content=DSA%20study%20bible%20detail%20pages"><em><strong>A More Christlike Word: Reading Scripture the Emmaus Way</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>With Bradley, we discuss approaching the Old Testament and how we are supposed to read the Bible. Is Jesus the full representation of God? How do Jesus's teachings correlate to seemingly oppositional texts in the OT? Does God change? What do we do with sections of scripture that we can't make sense of, that seem oppositional to the Jesus we have come to know and follow?

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the Bible: Part Four. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;This episode, we welcome back author and theologian Bradley Jersak to talk about his new book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.christianbook.com/more-christlike-word-reading-scripture-emmaus/bradley-jersak/9781641236522/pd/236523?kw=1240249200658606&amp;amp;mt=b&amp;amp;dv=c&amp;amp;event=PPCSRC&amp;amp;p=1215904&amp;amp;msclkid=b994abed6004161f3e96cafc013b6593&amp;amp;utm_source=bing&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Dynamic%20Search%20Ads&amp;amp;utm_term=%2Fpd%2F&amp;amp;utm_content=DSA%20study%20bible%20detail%20pages&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A More Christlike Word: Reading Scripture the Emmaus Way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;With Bradley, we discuss approaching the Old Testament and how we are supposed to read the Bible. Is Jesus the full representation of God? How do Jesus&apos;s teachings correlate to seemingly oppositional texts in the OT? Does God change? What do we do with sections of scripture that we can&apos;t make sense of, that seem oppositional to the Jesus we have come to know and follow? Why are &quot;conservatives&quot; and &quot;liberals&quot; throwing out sections of the Bible? How does Jesus help us to make sense of it all??? Bradley is a wonderful mind and walks with us through some difficult ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Three</strong></em>. This episode we continue our conversation on the complex and often confusing text, <strong>the Bible</strong>. Today, author / professor / biblical scholar, <strong>Dr. Amy-Jill Levine</strong> joins us once again to offer her thoughts and insights. How did the Old Testament come together? How does it inform the New Testament? How does the Jewish <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-tanakh-full-text">Tanakh</a> differ from the Old Testament? How do their individual canonical orders differ and what does that say? What does the Bible, and God, say about women and their role in authoritative and leadership positions within the church? What are we to do with all of this??? AJ, a self described ‘Yankee Jewish feminist,’ is University Professor of New Testament and Jewish Studies.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[306 - Understanding the Bible: Part Two - with Joshua Ryan Butler]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Two</strong></em>. Today we continue the conversation about the Bible with pastor and author <strong>Joshua Ryan Butler</strong>. Josh, who wrote "<a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780529100818">The Skeletons in God's Closet</a>" (which Mike referenced a few times throughout the '<strong>New Creation</strong>' series), sits down to chat about the complexities of the Bible and how we can approach it. Is the Bible 'authoritative?' What does that mean? How can God's word be manipulated and used for wrong? What are we to make of Old Testament violence, which seems to be God sanctioned? How do we read the Bible? Again, what are we to do with all of this???</p>

			<title><![CDATA[304 - The Nature of Spiritual Abuse - with Dan Koch]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>The Nature of Spiritual Abuse</strong></em>. Today we sit down with friend of the show, <strong>Dan Koch</strong> to discuss the nature of spiritual abuse within the church. Dan is a podcaster (<em>You Have Permission, Depolarize! &amp; Reconstruct</em>), musician, composer and is currently working on a doctorate in Counseling Psychology. Dan brings us the data and statistics he’s gathered in his studies to discuss spiritual abuse in the church, in its many forms, and the ramifications that it has had. What are the most prevalent forms? How do the varied versions effect our communities? How can the culture be changed?</p>
<p>You can learn more about Dan on his <a href="https://www.dankochwords.com/">WEBSITE</a> and social media: <a href="//twitter.com/dankoch">Twitter</a> &amp; <a href="//instagram.com/dancoke">Instagram</a>.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nature of Spiritual Abuse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Today we sit down with friend of the show, &lt;strong&gt;Dan Koch&lt;/strong&gt; to discuss the nature of spiritual abuse within the church. Dan is a podcaster (&lt;em&gt;You Have Permission, Depolarize! &amp;amp; Reconstruct&lt;/em&gt;), musician, composer and is currently working on a doctorate in Counseling Psychology. Dan brings us the data and statistics he’s gathered in his studies to discuss spiritual abuse in the church, in its many forms, and the ramifications that it has had. What are the most prevalent forms? How do the varied versions effect our communities? How can the culture be changed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about Dan on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dankochwords.com/&quot;&gt;WEBSITE&lt;/a&gt; and social media: &lt;a href=&quot;//twitter.com/dankoch&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;//instagram.com/dancoke&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our previous conversation with Dan can be heard on &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/voxology/id1049250910?i=1000385467403&quot;&gt;Episode 86&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[303 - Exiles in the Church]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Exiles in the Church</strong></em>. Today we discuss an email asking about reconciling feeling exiled <em><strong>in</strong></em> the Church, rather than <em><strong>from</strong></em> it. What does it mean to be “Christian exiles” within the body of Christ?&nbsp; Are there similarities to those in exile in the Old Testament? Is it a matter of disagreement? Nuance? Understanding of text and application? Or is it something more? Are we to remain loyal to that which with we’re in exile from? Where does our loyalty lay and how is it manifested?</p>
<p>We also discuss listener feedback to last episode in regards to LGBTQ+ and New Creation dynamics.</p>
<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to&nbsp;<strong>hello@voxpodcast.com,</strong> and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[301 - Masters of the Universe]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Masters of the Universe</strong></em>. What the what? Today we continue the conversation on New Creation dynamics with further exploration of the Heavenly Realm and the divine beings who occupy it. How important is all of this to understanding scripture and the overall narrative? What did Paul have to say in reference to all these beings? Did they play a role in his ministry? Are demons the spirits of fallen Nephilim (we don't know)? This stuff is all bananas.</p>
<p>First we spend some time on a listener email. We enter in to how we are to interact with mis-translations and agendas within Bible translations. Who do you trust? Who can you trust? How do we handle the concept of errancy and what does it really mean when approaching the Bible? Also, how does Gombis's critique of sentimentality relate to emotion, and the emotional response we feel as both worshipers and worship leaders? Does music not evoke this naturally? What are we to do with all of this?</p>
<p>There was a lot to talk about and we talked about it all.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>This is Voxology</strong>. Welcome to episode <strong>300</strong> and to the new podcast name, <strong>Voxology</strong>! We’re excited to start a new chapter in this continued journey with all of you!</p>
<p>Today in this mammoth, celebratory episode, we spend time talking about the Church, from postures of both lament and hope. We hear from beloved friend and old co-host <strong>Bonnie Lewis</strong> on why she feels she is ‘post-church,’ from friend of the show <strong>Shane Claiborne</strong> on actions the church needs to take to heal and grow and from the one and only <strong>Gombis</strong> on where we’ve been and hope for the future. Then, most importantly, we hear from many of you. You share your hopes and laments with us as we look further on down the long road.</p>
<p>First, Tim puts Mike on the hot seat to talk about why he started a podcast in the first place six years ago and what his hopes are for the next 300 episodes.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[299 - When Good gods Go Bad]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[When good gods go bad. Episode 299. The end of the chapter. The last of this era. The one before 300. This week we spend time with the Divine Council. The what? Oh, they’re just potential other divine beings that rule over different areas. What? That’s what I said. Heavenly Hosts? Sons of God? The Elohim?? How do these beings play into the biblical narrative? Has God, the God, been going to war with these beings? How does this spiritual realm play into the life and ministry of Jesus? The Sermon on the Mount?? What? When? How? Why? Holy moly.

First, we spend time answering questions about the absence of Bonnie and the potential of a future, female co-host., American holidays (such as Memorial Day and 4th of July being celebrated in church on Sunday mornings and  hypocrisy.

URGENT!!: Episode 300 is right around the corner and it is the moment where VOX evolves into its next iteration. As part of that, we want to include you. We will be discussing the future of the church, in both hope and lament. We’d like to have your voices as part of the conversation as a 30 second max message of hope or lament for the church, reflecting on what has been exposed over the last few years. We’d also love a bunch of one word responses, whatever they may be.

Either: Record a voice message on your phone and email it to tim@voxpodcast.com or call this Google Voice number and leave it as. A voice message: (530) 492-0382

As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram.

			<description><![CDATA[They Might Be Giants. Even old New York was once New Amsterdam. Today, we continue the conversation on the supernatural, spiritual elements of the New Creation vs. Old Creation dynamics. And this is some of the crazy stuff: the Nephilim! What are the Nephilim? How do they play into the narrative? Were they real? How do they correlate to the Seraphim, Satan and other spiritual entities? How do David and Goliath fit in? What about David and Bathsheba? And lastly and most importantly, how do these giants play into our understanding of Jesus, etc.??? Holy moly.

We also discuss some listener feedback over the previous episode, some pushback on the conversation over the church and those that choose to leave.

			<title><![CDATA[297 - Should I Stay or Should I Go - with Dr. Timothy Gombis]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Should I Stay or Should I Go? Is it just a great song by the only band that matters (The Clash), or is it the question posed by Tim on his membership to the Church? We discuss a recent interview with Brian Houston about the “moral failings” of pastors in their employ, like New York Megapastor Carl Lentz. Does the model make any sense? Has it been off focus from the start and where does that place us all now? Can it be corrected? Are Houston’s excuses or vision legit? With the Church seemingly more and more missing the intended mark, is it better to stay and help correct or is better to just build a community that follows what Jesus started? How does the Church play by Old Creation dynamics? Are we called to stay? What about this new ‘God Bless The USA Bible (!!!)’ from Zondervan?? Where are we? This is next level bananas… Much to his surprise, we beam in Gombis from his front porch where he was eating a burrito and pondering U2 theology to answer all our questions.

Houston interview: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/founder-hillsong-church-says-he-had-concerns-about-disgraced-former-n1267842

			<title><![CDATA[296  - The Myth of the American Dream - with DL Mayfield]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The Myth of the American Dream. Today we sit down with author D.L. Mayfield to discuss her journey and the road that led to her writing ‘The Myth of the American Dream.’ We talk about growing up as a pastor’s kid, missionary work and what it looks like to really love you neighbor. D.L. has had a rad and very practical undiscipling of the beliefs she was handed for what Jesus may actually have instead for her (and us). What does loving your neighbor look like with the people next door? What about refugees, immigrants and other displaced people? Who is it that God had in mind when advocating for the marginalized and the meek? What’s a ‘lock in?’ Who was Agnes United?

We also read some listener responses to “Jennifer’s” questions (from last episode) about how to reconstruct. This community continues to inspire and we are so thankful.

			<title><![CDATA[295 - This Present Darkness]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This Present Darkness. No, this is not a review of everyone’s favorite Christian fantasy book from the 80’s (though it is referenced here). Today we continue the series on Old Creation vs. new Creation by dipping our toes into the spiritual realm of the conversation. Mike begins an exploration of Genesis 1, and how we are to interpret the lights, Eden and the showdown in the garden. What are the areas where Heaven and Earth overlap? What are Cherubim and how do they play into all of this? How about the Seraphim? The serpent?? The Elohim??? Holy moly. The scene is broadening…

Tim continues to have oatmeal brain processing all of this.

We also answer a few questions dealing with masks and the loneliness epidemic, tools to analyze Old Creation response vs. New Creation responses and where to even begin with reconstruction. It’s a lot! So many good questions and comments to partner with us on this journey.

			<title><![CDATA[294 - Rethinking Sin & Salvation]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Rethinking Sin & Salvation. This episode is meaty. We start out by answering two questions that were sent in, dealing with different elements that have been discussed in this series:

On the topic of disagreeing over mask wearing, sometimes vehemently: How do we hold people in both love and accountability?

And then, how do we lead worship(and worship in general)within this understanding of new creation and the sermon on the mount?

Then we sink into the meat of this series... What is sin? Is it more than we've been fed over the years, as individual moral transgressions that anger a fickle God? What is the human vocation? How does sin effect us and our journey with God? What is wrath in this conversation? What is salvation? What are we saved from? What are we saved to? How do old creation dynamics play into this and what is the relationship with new creation dynamics?

This is a lot and gave Tim oatmeal brain for awhile after.

As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram.

			<title><![CDATA[293 - Misfit Tribe - with Shane Claiborne]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Author, activist and all around fun and great guy, Shane Claiborne is back! We sit down with Shane and talk about his journey and what brought him to the lifestyle he currently lives. We talk about everything from gun violence, sustainable living, clown school, modeling and Dolly Parton. What did Shane see when growing up that inspired him to be more active in the communities around him? How does he see where we all enter into the conversation that Jesus started?

We intro and outro this episode with reflections on Shane's reflections. Reflecting on reflections. Tim shares a new song at the end called 'Misfit Tribe,' a song he hasn't released yet that plays on some of these themes.

As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram.

			<title><![CDATA[292 - Darkness on the Edge of Town]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[“Darkness on the Edge of Town.” Gehenna. The “Valley of Hinnom.” The Lake of Fire. The Righteous and the Wicked. What does it all mean? How does the reference to the actual valley play out for those listening to Jesus? What was He talking about and warning us about? What role does this imagery of fire and burning play in the narrative of Jesus? What sense are we supposed to make of judgment and damnation, of the rhetoric of fire and separation? There are so many questions and so much to sort through, both in the text and our own Christian lineage.

			<title><![CDATA[291 - The Fires of New Creation]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[“The Fires of New Creation.” We’re moving forward with the conversation on the Biblical narration of the the whole story. The story. The one about God’s intent, the separation of Heaven and Earth and the hope of new creation. Today we talk about fire and water and how they’re used in the Bible. Where is Judgment in this text? How did Jesus talk about it? How did Paul? What role does Judgment play? Where did we get so much of our theology of Hell and damnation? Is the story about Heaven and Earth or Heaven and Hell? Is Hell used, by Jesus, to motivate people? How does all of this connect to the Sermon on the Mount?

We also spend a little time talking about an email we got from a listener who is wrestling with whether or not to leave his church because of a NO mask mandate (as a staff member, he has been told he will be punished if he wears a mask on Sunday morning, inside the Church). Mike has good advice and context. Tim gets riled up.

This is part two. We will follow it with a conversation on Hell and Sin.

			<title><![CDATA[290 - Making All Things New]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Making All Things New. Today, we sit down and discuss the version of Christianity we’ve been handed and the version that appears in the Bible. Mike offers a different take on the narrative, one where the goal is 'New Creation,' not the judgment —-> heaven/hell idea we were raised with. Is God’s goal to make new things or to make all things new? How does Jesus speak to and embody this idea of 'New Creation?' Where do we fit into it? What are the implications for evangelism & church? How are we to relate to our communities and the world at large within this ideology? 

This is part one. We will follow it with a conversation on Judgement and Sin.

			<title><![CDATA[289 - The Wheat & The Weeds]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The Wheat & The Weeds! Matthew 13:24. “Jesus told them another parable.” Mike had this parable sitting in the back of his brain poking at him, so we dove in. We are continuing to look closely at the Christian Nationalist vision and the bonds that have been made between Christianity and the world. This is Jesus answering the question of what we are to do with the evil in the world. What are the wheat and the weeds Jesus is referring to? How are we too relate and react to the weeds? How does Jesus tell us to exist amongst? Who is the enemy and what is their game? How do judgement and and the fires play into all of this? There is so much to look at in this short piece.

			<title><![CDATA[288 - Holding Space & Christian Nation-ism]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today, we spend a little time holding space for the victims of the shootings in Atlanta this past week. Tim’s wife, Shauna, joins to share some of the conversations they’ve had together and that she has had in her classroom about dehumanization. 

Mike and Tim read and talk about perhaps the best email response they’ve ever received, pushing back on some of the conversation they had on the seven mountain mandate and the David French article, “How a Rising Religious Movement Rationalizes the Christian Grasp for Power.” Mike shares about a new book he's reading and the author’s ‘Top 10 Indicators You’re Seeing Christian Nationalism.’ Are there ties between Old Testament Israel and America? Is America central to God’s plan? Where has this ‘Us vs. Them’ mindset come from?

			<title><![CDATA[287 - Power in Weakness - with Dr. Timothy Gombis]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Gombis’d. We’ve been Gombis’d. Today, we wit down with our good, good friend Dr. Timothy Gombis to talk through his new book, “Power in Weakness: Paul’s Transformed Vision for Ministry.” Gombis has left everything on the page with this one, looking closely at how Paul’s vision for ministry was transformed by his encounter with Jesus. Who was he before? How can we relate? Who did he become and how was his experience with Jesus manifested? How did Paul view ministry and how did he practice it? What did community look like in Paul’s churches?

It’s a great conversation with a great mind. We wrestle in real time with how to see Paul and Jesus’s vision for church and community realized, how to encourage both seasoned pastors as well as those in seminary coming up. 

As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram.

			<title><![CDATA[286 - The Road Less Traveled]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Sermon on The Mount: Chapter 19 - “The Road Less Traveled” Matthew 7:13-29. “Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.…” THIS IS THE END! We have arrived at the final section of the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus warns us against false prophets and easy routes. What is He saying with the narrow and broad gates? Sheep’s clothing? How can you differentiate the false prophets from the true? This is a complicated section, one where these wolves in sheep’s clothing drove out demons and prophesied and performed miracles… 

We also discuss the recent CPAC (The Conservative Political Action Conference), an article by David French on the Seven Mountain Mandate and the old Christian rock band Stryper.

So much of this is about playing the long game with one another, how we coexist as humans and how to actually love our neighbors as ourselves.

These threads are weaving a beautiful tapestry that speak to so much of how we are to be, both with one another and with God. Jesus is speaking with such intention that resonates so much with where we are today.

This is the FINAL section of the Sermon on the Mount! This has been a wild ride for us and we’re honored to have walked this road with you all.
 
We at VOX are committed to not only confronting all of this, first in ourselves, but also to wrestle with what Jesus would have for us in this time. We are committed to repentance and a pursuit of discernment.

As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram.

			<title><![CDATA[285 - How (Not) To Read Your Bible - with Dan Kimball]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[There is a saying that states that “The fastest way to become an atheist is to read the Bible.” In many circles, the conundrum that is the Bible has become a stumbling block for Christians and non-Christians alike. How do you reconcile things like violence and slavery inside? How do you approach a text written so long ago, to societies so unlike ours? Is the Bible outdated and harmful? How does one reconcile the odd and disturbing things within? Is the Bible the “Good Book?” Is it authoritative and what does that even mean?

Today, we sit down with author and Pastor Dan Kimball to discuss his new book, “How (Not) To Read The Bible.” Dan talks to us about approaches and understandings that are needed before you open the text. The Bible can be confusing and challenging…

			<title><![CDATA[284 - After Doubt - with A.J. Swoboda]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today, we sit down with author and professor of Bible and Theology, A.J. Swoboda, to discuss his new book, ‘After Doubt.’ We have a great conversation on deconstruction: the natural elements of it; and what’s helpful vs. what isn’t. How can we rebuild after tearing down the faith that was handed to us? What role do dead authors and past theologians play in the lineage of our faith and doubt? What does the Bible have to say about questioning? Is there room for anger and hate?

			<title><![CDATA[283 - What's Love Got To Do With It?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Sermon on The Mount: Chapter 18 - “What’s Love Got To Do With It?” Matthew 7:7-12. “Ask, Seek, Knock…” THE GOLDEN RULE. Again(!!!), another section of the sermon that has been taught a lot, but is often missing the point or full context Jesus was bringing. Discernment continues to be the word of the day (week, year, lifetime). Jesus is wrapping up the sermon here and is beginning to tie together all the threads he has laid out, in the most brilliant and intentional way. Who in this section is asking, seeking and knocking? What does it mean? How do these actions tie into the previous sections? How do these relate to our neighbors and how we should approach them? And, why?

So much of this is about playing the long game with one another, how we coexist as humans and how to actually love our neighbors as ourselves.

These threads are weaving a beautiful tapestry that speak to so much of how we are to be, both with one another and with God. Jesus is speaking with such intention that resonates so much with where we are today.

			<description><![CDATA[Sermon on The Mount: Chapter 17 - “Pearls, Pigs & Pushing Good Things on Others.” Matthew 7:6. “Do not give dogs what is sacred…” Again(!), another section of the sermon that has been taught a lot, but is often missing the point or full context Jesus was bringing. The word of the day (week, year, lifetime) is discernment. So much of what is said here is dismantling the place of condemnation the Church has taken. What is Jesus saying when using the terms ‘dogs’ and ‘pigs?’ Is it derogatory? What is sacred? What are the pearls? How are we to interact with those that need intervention? How does this section fit into and correlate with the previous parts of the Sermon? 

This thread is long, but Jesus is dissecting and confronting so much of how we interact and love as humans. How are we supposed to live life together both in community and in the world? We have much to learn from this section. Jesus understands the complexities of the issue, as well as the depth and uniqueness of each person listening.

What is judgment, really? What is ‘Krino,’ and how is it both good and bad? Is it a matter of how we judge or what we judge? How does discernment aide us in this? How is discernment made more palpable and effective? How can the ‘plank in our own eye’ teaching still be helpful and applicable for us if we have heard it so many times? Is there room for calling things or actions out in today’s world? There is so much to work through here.

			<title><![CDATA[280 - What We Can Learn From Flowers & Fields]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Sermon on The Mount: Chapter 15 - “What We Can Learn From Flowers & Fields.” Matthew 6:25-34. Holy moly. Let’s dig into worry and anxiety, shall we? Today we sit down with some critical responses to our last few episodes and discuss the balance between calling out certain things while celebrating others. Where is the line? 

Then we head back to the Mount, to pick up where we left off with Jesus’s sermon. Despite topical heading breaks the editors of the Bible unfortunately inserted, Jesus takes us into a conversation on worry that runs directly out of the last piece on treasures. What is he doing here? How has this section been grossly misinterpreted and taught over the years? How does worry connect to where our treasures lay? 

Many of us have been shamed in our depression and anxiety over the years, being told that we shouldn’t worry or fret, that it was sinful to be feeling the way we were. This is not what Jesus is doing here.  He is, again, helping us to reposture and to broaden our understanding. 
 
We at VOX are committed to not only confronting all of this, first in ourselves, but also to wrestle with what Jesus would have for us in this time. We are committed to repentance and a pursuit of discernment.

This is the second section of the Sermon on the Mount. We’re excited to walk this road with you all.

			<itunes:summary>Sermon on The Mount: Chapter 15 - “What We Can Learn From Flowers &amp; Fields.” Matthew 6:25-34. Holy moly. Let’s dig into worry and anxiety, shall we? Today we sit down with some critical responses to our last few episodes and discuss the balance between calling out certain things while celebrating others. Where is the line? 

Then we head back to the Mount, to pick up where we left off with Jesus’s sermon. Despite topical heading breaks the editors of the Bible unfortunately inserted, Jesus takes us into a conversation on worry that runs directly out of the last piece on treasures. What is he doing here? How has this section been grossly misinterpreted and taught over the years? How does worry connect to where our treasures lay? 

Many of us have been shamed in our depression and anxiety over the years, being told that we shouldn’t worry or fret, that it was sinful to be feeling the way we were. This is not what Jesus is doing here.  He is, again, helping us to reposture and to broaden our understanding. 
 
We at VOX are committed to not only confronting all of this, first in ourselves, but also to wrestle with what Jesus would have for us in this time. We are committed to repentance and a pursuit of discernment.

This is the second section of the Sermon on the Mount. We’re excited to walk this road with you all.

As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram.

			<title><![CDATA[279 - When Unity Isn't Enough - with Dr. Timothy Gombis]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Gombis stops by for a conversation on a theological response and reflection on the last couple weeks. Gombis, a Pauline scholar and seminary Professor, walks us through his thoughts and how Paul might have addressed the church in this time. Where should the outrage have begun? How do we process an Evangelical pursuit of power? How can we effect change in our communities? How can Matthew 25 fuel our understanding of politics? How has the Church's imagination been taken hostage? Who did Andre the Giant and King Kong Bundy wrestle at Wrestlemania? There is so much to sift through as we, collectively, try to look forward.

			<title><![CDATA[278 - Where Do We Go From Here?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[We are still processing the events of last week, as we’re sure many of you are as well. It feels like too big of a moment to gloss over, so we decided to crack it open. This is, again, raw and in real time, recorded this morning. We answer a question dealing with an undecided nature involving Church, and Nationalism spouted from the pulpit. How long do you stay in a Church that you feel is Theologically off-center? How has that rhetoric fueled what we saw last Wednesday, January 6th? Is this a false Gospel, a false Jesus? Is this Christianity, radicalized? Is it divisive to call all of this out?

			<title><![CDATA[So... About That Riot]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This is raw and in real time. We sit and have a conversation about the insurrection at the Nation's capital yesterday, January 6th, 2021. We, like all of you, watched in horror and anger, trying to process what we were seeing and how we as followers of Jesus are supposed to navigate the wreckage. All of it is emotional and wandering, but it is real.

Yesterday was the Day of Epiphany, the closing of the Christmas season and a reminder of Herod the narcissist and his kingdom being threatened by the hope of the coming Christ. We lament with the Nation and the Church as both have become fractured. How do we best love the Lord and our neighbor in this coming season? As always, we appreciate walking this road with all of you.

			<title><![CDATA[277 - A Singular Devotion]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Sermon on The Mount: Chapter 14 - “A Singular Devotion.” Matthew 6:19-24: “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy…” We’re picking back up the Sermon on the Mount in the new year! Today, we discuss the widely taught on but rarely enacted section or the sermon, dealing with money and possessions. While recognizing anger and lust seems easier and more well established, we tend to struggle a bit more in understanding the role our ‘treasures’ play in our Kingdom living. How does Jesus frame the conversation? What does He mean by “The eye is the lamp of the body?” What is the “mine-ness” of something? How does He structure parallel concepts to strengthen His illustrations and point? Is it a matter of selling all our possessions or is Jesus getting at something deeper?

We also spend time discussing our anger and frustrations with Sean Feucht and the worship concerts he has continued to hold around the U.S. during the pandemic, what he and others consider a form of protest against government restrictions on religious gatherings.

As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram.

			<title><![CDATA[276 - Requiem For 2020]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[A Requiem for 2020. What a year… In many ways, 2020 was apocalyptic as it unveiled and revealed much about society, the Nation and the Church. Today we talk a little about Christmas and what it looks like without the bows and garland and we answer a question in response to Gombis’s episode on Capitalism and the Church (Episode 273). Where do we go from here? How do we fix this mess we’re in? Should people still give to the Church? What does transparency look like for the Church? How can it become more trustworthy and renew its reputation? We’re excited to close out this difficult year and look to new things in 2021. A new name for the Podcast! New communities and connections with y’all! 
May the Lord bless you and keep you;
May the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;
May the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and in these days, may He give you peace.

			<title><![CDATA[275 - The Bible With & Without Jesus - with Dr. Amy Jill Levine]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This one is fun! Today we sit down with one of our favorite guests, Dr. Amy Jill Levine and discuss some of the theology and ideas behind her new book, “The Bible With & Without Jesus.” Dr. Levine, who is a University Professor of New Testament and Jewish Studies, Mary Jane Werthan Professor of Jewish Studies, and Professor of New Testament Studies at Vanderbilt Divinity School, presents a way for people with differing faiths to interact and learn from one another while not compromising their own beliefs. Is it possible for a Christian to grow a more robust faith and understanding of Jesus by interacting with the Jewish tradition? How can we re-approach scripture and tradition? How does context change understanding? How did Jesus’s Jewish heritage effect his teaching? How does interpretation, translation and even mood effect our reading and understanding of text? This was such a fun and enlightening conversation. 

You can purchase Dr. Levine’s book here: https://www.amazon.com/Bible-Without-Jesus-Christians-Differently/dp/0062560158/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&hvadid=78134114429055&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvqmt=e&keywords=amy+jill+levine&qid=1608574374&sr=8-2&tag=mh0b-20

			<title><![CDATA[274 - The Burden of Purity Culture - with Bridget Eileen Rivera & Tyler Chernesky]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today we sit down (virtually, from all over the country) with old friend of the Pod Tyler Chernesky and new friend Bridget Eileen Rivera, for a conversation on Purity Culture, the Church and being a Gay Christian. Tyler is a pastor of City Church OTR in downtown Cincinnati, a church that strives to be a safe place to be honest and feel supported. Bridget Eileen is an author, speaker and advocate, who speaks and writes on issues of faith, sexuality, and justice. Bridget and Tyler both share their stories of growing up in purity culture. What is a folk devil and what role does it play in society? How has Bridget’s study of criminology linked to her experience in Purity Culture? How has the conversation on sexuality consumed and pushed aside other topics in the church? This was a brilliant and heartfelt conversation.

			<itunes:summary>Today we sit down (virtually, from all over the country) with old friend of the Pod Tyler Chernesky and new friend Bridget Eileen Rivera, for a conversation on Purity Culture, the Church and being a Gay Christian. Tyler is a pastor of City Church OTR in downtown Cincinnati, a church that strives to be a safe place to be honest and feel supported. Bridget Eileen is an author, speaker and advocate, who speaks and writes on issues of faith, sexuality, and justice. Bridget and Tyler both share their stories of growing up in purity culture. What is a folk devil and what role does it play in society? How has Bridget’s study of criminology linked to her experience in Purity Culture? How has the conversation on sexuality consumed and pushed aside other topics in the church? This was a brilliant and heartfelt conversation.

			<title><![CDATA[273 - Christ, Capitalism & Critical Race Theory - with Dr. Timothy Gombis]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[We’re taking a little break from the Sermon On The Mount today to talk about a few conversations that are currently being had. Today we sit down with brother of the pod, our good friend and scholar Dr. Timothy George Gombis! The conversation begins with the Southern Baptist declaration that “Critical Race Theory (CRT), Intersectionality and any version of Critical Theory is incompatible with the Baptist Faith & Message.” Heyo! What is CRT? What functions does it perform? Why is there opposition to it? We segue from there into everyone’s second favorite Thanksgiving dinner topic, Capitalism. We wrestle with how Capitalism has made its way into the church and what the Bible has to say about it. Gombis has some thoughts… It’s a wild ride!

As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook, Instagram & Twitter.

			<title><![CDATA[272 - The Lord's Prayer]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Sermon on The Mount: Chapter 13 - “The Lord’s Prayer." Matthew 6:9-14. “This, then, is how you should pray…” Jesus walks us through a framework on how we might enter into prayer. The prayer itself is short, but as always, it is layered and nuanced and packed with so much. As we talked about last week, Jesus approaches God as ‘Father.’ What does he mean by in ‘Heaven?’ What does ‘hallowed’ imply? How does Jesus continue to use the ‘now and not yet’ structure? What does the ‘daily bread ‘ link to? Debt and debtors, temptation and delivery from the evil one… Jesus covers a ton. How then should we pray? If this is a framework, how does it apply and direct us? Brick by brick, the foundation of the Kingdom is being laid.

			<title><![CDATA[271 - Asking, Seeking & Knocking]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Sermon on The Mount: Chapter Twelve - "Asking, Seeking & Knocking." Matthew 6:5-8 & Luke 7:7-12. Today, we wade into the waters of prayer, an often misunderstood, confusing and difficult facet of the Christian faith. How does Jesus frame our relationship with prayer? What is our role? How should we approach God? How does Jesus set up the model for prayer? How does asking, seeking and knocking fit in to what Jesus is saying in the sermon on the mount? Remember the through line Jesus has been laying out during the entirety of the sermon, and where prayer fits into it as a whole. Brick by brick, the foundation of the Kingdom is being laid.

This is still the beginning of the second section of the Sermon on the Mount. We’re excited to walk this road with you all.

			<title><![CDATA[270 - Keeping Up Appearances]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Sermon on the Mount: Chapter Eleven - “Keeping Up Appearances.” Luke 12:1-7. Today we’re further unpacking Jesus’s teaching on hypocrisy and how we are to live in it. How does Jesus define it, in totality? What examples does he give and what are the implications? What role does faith play? How does the metaphor of marriage play into this? What was Jesus’s instructions to the layperson regarding the Pharisees? What impact does this have on American Evangelicalism and how many of us were raised? And more importantly, how can this change for future generations of Jesus followers? How can the Kingdom be manifested and known now and going forward? What is our role as citizens?

			<description><![CDATA[Tomorrow is Election day, 2020. It has been a long year of rhetoric and talking points, promises and accusations. Part of the Sermon on The Mount, part of what Jesus has been showing us, is to adopt the discipline of discernment. Today we have on friend and frequent guest of the show, Skye Jethani. Skye, who is a co host of the Holy Post podcast, recently released a video on Abortion. In the video, Skye presents the data and statistics from the last 40 years, as to what has and has not had effects on abortion rates. How has Roe v. Wade effected abortion numbers? Does a conservative President really lower those? What about the Supreme Court? What are we called to outside of voting every four years?

The sensitivity of this issue is not lost on us and we hope this conversation can be encouraging and thoughtful, not divisive.

			<title><![CDATA[267 - The Liturgy of Politics - with Kaitlyn Schiess]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today we have on author Kaitlyn Schiess, to discuss her new book ‘The Liturgy of Politics.’ Kaitlyn, a self described ‘Theology Nerd,’ has written for the New York Times, Relevant Magazine and Christianity Today. We have a great conversation about the tenuous relationship between faith and politics. What is liturgy? How do you define politics? How are we and the Church shaped by our habits and practices? We talk about recognizing how formative the political entities around us are, and how we may grow and reconcile them with who we are in the Kingdom.

Kaitlyn is currently finishing up her ThM at Dallas Theological Seminary. You can purchase Kaitlyn’s book here: https://www.ivpress.com/the-liturgy-of-politics

			<itunes:summary>Today we have on author Kaitlyn Schiess, to discuss her new book ‘The Liturgy of Politics.’ Kaitlyn, a self described ‘Theology Nerd,’ has written for the New York Times, Relevant Magazine and Christianity Today. We have a great conversation about the tenuous relationship between faith and politics. What is liturgy? How do you define politics? How are we and the Church shaped by our habits and practices? We talk about recognizing how formative the political entities around us are, and how we may grow and reconcile them with who we are in the Kingdom.

Kaitlyn is currently finishing up her ThM at Dallas Theological Seminary. You can purchase Kaitlyn’s book here: https://www.ivpress.com/the-liturgy-of-politics

			<description><![CDATA[Sermon on the Mount: Chapter One - Hope For the Church. In this episode we talk about the through line Jesus has woven throughout the first section of the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus has been leading the people at the mount on a journey. Everything He has said so far has been intentional and building. Where do we find ourselves after this first section? Where is He going from here?

We also answer a question about the role of Church and that of a Shepherd. And Mike has a special announcement at the end!

			<title><![CDATA[265 - Love Your Enemies]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Sermon on the Mount: Part 9. Matthew 5:43-48. Love Your Enemies. This is the last piece, of the first section of the Sermon on the Mount. Here, Jesus challenges the laws of reciprocity we’ve seen in the past few weeks, highlighting the embodied faith of the Kingdom. What levitical laws does Jesus confront? How does he expand the Jewish understanding of who was a neighbor? What is the understanding of an enemy? How are we to interact with those who oppose us? What does it mean to love your enemies? We have landed at a pivotal section of the Sermon on the Mount.

			<title><![CDATA[264 - Race, Abortion & Evangelicals - with Phil Vischer]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Race, Abortion & Evangelicals. Today we’re diverging from the Sermon on The Mount, to talk about the history of segregation and race relations in America. We’re joined by friend Phil Vischer from our cousin podcast, The Holy Post. Phil recently released a pair of videos on race that went viral and stirred up conversation. What is the history of segregation in the U.S.? What about within the church? What responsibility do we have today for the sins of yesterday? When did abortion become the singular issue the church rallies behind? How can we listen to one another first, before engaging in a posture of angry disagreement? We discuss being Christians with different life experiences coming to radically different conclusions on how each of us should vote and become active. 

You can see Phil’s video here: https://youtu.be/AGUwcs9qJXY

			<title><![CDATA[263 - An Eye For An Eye]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Sermon on the Mount: Part 8. Matthew 5:38-42. An eye for an eye. This one is fun. Jesus continues to flip the script on what we know and have held to be true. There is a lot, a lot here, so give yourself some time. Jesus is purposefully upending many common held practices in regards to revenge and reciprocity, resistance and passivity. What was Jesus saying when he tells them to turn the other cheek? To offer their cloak? To walk an extra mile? What does this say about the Kingdom that He is establishing? How is it at odds with the common practices of the time, and well as today?? Where does this fall in line with what He has said prior in this sermon about anger, coveting, divorce, etc.? This kingdom is a table with many seats and each sits as high as the next.

			<title><![CDATA[262 - Using Religious Language to Manipulate]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Sermon on the Mount: Part 7. Let your ‘yes’ be your ‘yes,’ and your ‘no’ be your ‘no.’ Jesus is pressing forward, with a topic that we still struggle with: Using Religious Language to Manipulate Others. What does it mean to swear or to take an oath? When is that permitted? What does Jesus say about truth telling and bolstering your claims with the name of Yahweh or Heaven? What does Let your ‘yes’ be your ‘yes,’ and your ‘no’ be your ‘no’ mean? The thread from the Beatitudes, through anger, lust and divorce has brought us here. How does this version of truth telling come in line with His previous statements? How does this play into Kingdom living? We look at the verses Jesus cross references here to find the roots of this teaching and what implications it has for them, then, and us today.

			<title><![CDATA[261 - Jesus, Divorce & Purity Culture]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Sermon on the Mount: Part 6. Jesus, Divorce & Purity Culture. Jesus is on a roll, with a thread running through Anger & Lust to Divorce. Here, He is pressed with an old argument between two differing Rabbinical ideas. Jesus offers another. What is He doing? Jesus answers one thing and flips the script on another. What is the ideal God set for the covenant of marriage? How is that broken? We look at Rabbinical ideas of gender structures and how they still play out today and how we might choose against them.

			<title><![CDATA[260 - Lust, Shame & Modesty]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Sermon On The Mount: Part 5. Lust. Shame. Coveting. Jesus, as He does, is cutting straight to the core. But what is He saying exactly? And to whom? What is lust? How does what Jesus is saying actually translate? How does sexual desire play into the equation? 

Our history with sexual desire and shame is a long and troubled one, too often dictated by voices and agendas that are made to cloud Jesus’s message. He is disrupting more than the idea of impure thoughts. Jesus is challenging the long history of the marginalization of women and how much objectification and imbalanced gender dynamics have influenced that. He is offering freedom, not condemnation.

			<description><![CDATA[Sermon On The Mount: Part 4. Anger. This week, we dive into the section where Jesus begins some of His ‘light & heavy' teaching. How is it that we should process anger? How do we show it? What does Jesus have to say about anger and its links to violence? How are we to conduct ourselves as Christians when we vehemently disagree with someone or something? These are are some of the foundational pieces of the Kingdom at hand, the now and not yet.

			<title><![CDATA[257 - Christians & QAnon - with Skye Jethani]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[QAnon. Pizzagate. Conspiracy theories. Why are humans drawn to these? How has a faction of the Church latched on to the dangerous and anonymous Q and the wild theories he purports. What effect does this have on theology and social engagement? How does all this fit into the Sermon on the Mount and our involvement with what Jesus was starting?

We are thrilled to have great friend of the show Skye Jethani with us today as we dissect and discuss. Skye is cohost of our cousin podcast, the Holy Post. Skye has a new book out on the Sermon on the Mount called “What If Jesus Was Serious?: A Visual Guide to the Teachings of Jesus We Love to Ignore.” 

As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram.

			<description><![CDATA[Sermon On The Mount: Part 3. Light & Heavy. Today we tackle one of the most important sections of the Sermon on the Mount, as what Jesus says helps to frame everything after. What did Jesus mean when he said he came not to abolish, but to fulfill? What was His relationship to the Torah? What is the definition of abolish? What did this mean to the crowd there? What does it mean to us now? What is the difference between light and heavy commands? So much to unpack!

			<description><![CDATA[Sermon On The Mount: Part 2. The Politics of Salt & Light. We’re continuing on through the Sermon on the Mount, with the oft quoted verses focusing on Jesus’s calling to the people to be both Salt and Light. What did Jesus mean when he called the folks at the mount to be Salt? What implications did that have? What of the command to be Light? To whom and how? How does this section play off of the Beatitudes that precede it? How do these commands relate to us, today?

			<description><![CDATA[Sermon On The Mount: Part 1. Of Such As These. Mike cracks open the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount, by dissecting the word ‘Blessed.’ How does the word translate? What was Jesus trying to say here and to whom? The context of these ‘Beatitudes’ helps us to understand the Kingdom Jesus was ushering in, and how we are to interact with the message He was delivering to those people at that time. What does it mean to be meek? What scripture was Jesus referencing and how would it be interpreted by the folks listening? These are the Politics of Jesus.

In a time where we are continually divided, even within the church, we take a look at a different affiliation, one that supersedes nation and location and informs how we exist within others: the Kingdom of God. In many ways, this is a series that will challenge much of what we hold tight within our identity (for Mike & Tim especially!), and we’re very excited to embark on with all of you.  

We have always viewed VOX as a community, despite it existing mostly within the digital realm. We encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram. 

The book Mike references is: https://www.amazon.com/Scandalous-Witness-Political-Manifesto-Christians/dp/0802877354/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=lee+camp+scandalous+witness&qid=1595170355&sr=8-1

			<description><![CDATA[Here we go! VOX receives many listener questions. While we try to answer as many as we can, every now and again we like to take an episode to discuss some big ones. Today, Mike and Tim answer a few. How do we know an apology is sincere when they’re always wrapped in buzzwords? Should the Church be inventive and let go of their current format during quarantine? Were there other people outside of the Garden in Genesis? Alway feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com.

			<title><![CDATA[249 - Timshel: Thou Mayest]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today we have all the feels.  After a year as co-host on the podcast, Bonnie will be leaving from her official role as co-host to focus on Timshel, her work with Radical Wellness and her own podcast.  

We are so very sad to see her go, but cheering her on and her work in this next season for her!

In today’s episode, we hear about her journey, why this work matters so much  and how you can find her new podcast and order Timshel for yourself! (As of TODAY it’s for sale!)  We dive deep and she answers the question “Why is it called a Translation?”, “What Does Timshel mean?”, along with a dash of Quantum Physics and the Divine Feminine.  

We know you will join us in supporting our beloved Bonnie! 

You can purchase your copy of Timshel here:  https://www.timsheltranslation.com

Keep with Bonnie on Instagram here: @bonniegaillewis or @timsheltranslation.com

			<title><![CDATA[247 - Understanding Racism 101 - with Brit Barron]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[We are honored to have Brit Barron with us on the podcast this week! Brit Barron is an author, anti-racism activist, pastor and public speaker who is dedicated to having honest conversations.  As a person of color, Brit grew up in predominately white spaces, and as a part of the American Evangelical church.  On today’s podcast we got the opportunity to reflect with Brit on the events of the past few weeks including George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter Movement.  Brit gives a poignant view of racism in America, the racial blindspot of the Evangelical church, practical steps for those who want to know more about historical context of racism in America and the truth that unless it’s personal to each of us, real change will not happen.  

In addition to her thoughtful and wise comments., Brit released an “Understanding Racism 101 Guide” to help us all become anti-racist.  You can learn more and purchase it here: https://britbarron.com/racism101

For more information about Brit, you can find her on Instagram: @BritBarron or her website at https://britbarron.com

If you’d like to see what her church is all about visit: https://www.newabbey.org/ or @newabbeychurch

			<title><![CDATA[244 - Beating Guns - with Shane Claiborne]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This we week we welcome theologian and activist Shane Claiborne. Together we discuss one of his recent books “Beating Guns” and wrestle with gun reform, and the 2nd Amendment in light of a Gospel-centered worldview. 

We ask questions about if it is a gun problem, heart problem or both. What about self defense? What should we do with out fear? How shall we interpret the 2nd Amendment? How shall we interpret the words of Jesus? 

Part of Shane’s work is working with RAWtools, an organization which accepts guns from those who have voluntarily unarmed themselves and turn these weapons into gardening tools. You can find out how to get involved here: https://rawtools.org/

			<title><![CDATA[242 - Daily Bread]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[After three heavy-loaded episodes regarding prayer, if God is in control or not, and the purpose of the Bible, we decided it was time for a long outro!  Mike, Tim and Bonnie sit down to discuss the lot of these things, but landed discussing the point and the practice of prayer.  Why do we pray?  Does it make any difference?  Is there a right or wrong way to pray?  What does it mean when God answers prayers, what does it mean when He doesn’t? 

If you have missed the past few episodes, we encourage you to listen first here: 

God is Not in Control, Part 1 with Tim Gombis: shorturl.at/qGJTZ

Wake up Dead Man, Part 2 with Tim Gombis: shorturl.at/ruvMR

How the Bible Works with Pete Enns: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/241-how-the-bible-works-with-pete-enns/id1049250910?i=1000473548696

All three of these episodes asked some hard questions and required us all to look at the commonly discussed topics of the Bible and prayer in brand new ways.  This week, on Tuesday May 12 we will also be meeting on Zoom with Tim Gombis (and all of you!) to further discuss these things.  You can find more information on our facebook page, here: https://www.facebook.com/voxpodcast/

			<title><![CDATA[241 - How the Bible Works - with Pete Enns]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[We are so excited about today’s episode in which we got the chance to interview Peter Enns.  Peter Enns is a professor at Eastern University and the author of multiple books including The Bible and the Believer, Genesis for Normal People, and How the Bible Actually Works.  In addition, Pete is the host of the Bible for Normal People podcast!

Today we dive into reading the Bible from different angles and looking for wisdom instead of viewing it as a rule book.  Pete discusses the importance of literary genres, language, and context.  Together we explore deconstruction and what part the Bible plays in the process of making our inherited faiths our own.

			<title><![CDATA[240 - Wake Up Dead Man: God is Not in Control, part 2 - with Tim Gombis]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This week we give you part 2 with Tim Gombis!  Together Mike, Bonnie and Tim sit down with Gombis to discuss if God is actually in control or if we read this (and other) doctrine into the text.  

If you haven’t already listened, we encourage you to listen to part one that began when Tim Gombis wrote a blog post asserting that God may not actually be in control.  

The arc of topics in these two episodes include God’s omniscience, the Church and the implications of control, the role of the Bible in our life of faith, and if it’s permissible to read doctrine into the Text.  

This is part 2 of a 4 part series in which we will do an outdo on many of the major topics discussed in this series.

			<title><![CDATA[239 - God is Not in Control, part 1 - with Tim Gombis]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[The one and only Tim Gombis is in the house today! On a recent blog post, Mr. Gombis asserted that “God is not control”, which spurred on many questions, arguments, disagreements and the like.  On today’s episode, we are discussing what he meant by this statement, if the Bible actually tells us that God is in control, and what we learn about ourselves from holding tightly to this theological statement.  

We realize that many questions may arise from this conversation which is why this is only Part 1 of our conversation.  We will not only follow up with a part 2 but have a series of podcasts along similar topics and we will follow up with one, long episode about all of it.  However, if you have pressing questions, thoughts or ideas, please email us at hello@voxpodcast.com

			<title><![CDATA[238 - Jesus Was Jewish - with Dr. Amy-Jill Levine]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today we sit down with Dr Amy-Jill Levine, professor and world renowned scholar for her work in New Testament Studies.  AJ (as she affectionally insists we call her!) is the author of over ten books about Jesus and his Jewish background.  AJ brings an authentic knowledge of Judaism in the first century, as well as her own Jewish heritage to inform her writings.  

In this interview, Mike and Tim converse with AJ all about the essential Jewishness of Jesus and why it matters to an accurate understanding of the text.  With wit and humor, AJ dispels some misconceptions about Judaism and how often a good picture of Jesus is built upon a poor view of Judaism.  AJ demonstrates how this is not only unnecessary, but calls into question one’s own Christology.  

If you want to know more about Dr. Levine and her work at Vanderbilt University, please click here: https://divinity.vanderbilt.edu/people/bio/amy-jill-levine

			<itunes:summary>Today we sit down with Dr Amy-Jill Levine, professor and world renowned scholar for her work in New Testament Studies.  AJ (as she affectionally insists we call her!) is the author of over ten books about Jesus and his Jewish background.  AJ brings an authentic knowledge of Judaism in the first century, as well as her own Jewish heritage to inform her writings.  

In this interview, Mike and Tim converse with AJ all about the essential Jewishness of Jesus and why it matters to an accurate understanding of the text.  With wit and humor, AJ dispels some misconceptions about Judaism and how often a good picture of Jesus is built upon a poor view of Judaism.  AJ demonstrates how this is not only unnecessary, but calls into question one’s own Christology.

			<title><![CDATA[237 - From Liberation to Wilderness - with Rabbi Nahum Ward-Lev]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[With Passover upon us, we sit down with Rabbi Nahum Ward-Lev who is also an author and Spiritual Guide to discuss the Passover and its impact on our spirituality.  Rabbi Nahum sheds light on three Jewish holidays in light of liberation and wilderness.  Together, we explore what it means to be a liberated people, and what to do when we find ourselves in the wilderness.  Rabbi Nahum brings an interesting perspective in light of the plague of the Corona Virus and the global wilderness we find ourselves in.  

Mike, Bonnie and Tim do an Outro to the episode and discuss how an understanding of the Jewish background of the text and Jewish spirituality impacts the Christian faith.  Together, we wade through an understanding of wilderness and how the point of the wild is to learn how to be free.

			<title><![CDATA[236 - Enneagram For Wholeness - with Annie Dimond]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[What do you know about the Enneagram?  Where did it start?  What does it mean?  How can we use it?  Does it have any place in our spiritual lives or is it all just a fad?  

Annie Diamond is an Enneagram Coach who teaches from the Narrative Method and in this episodes she explains the ins and outs of the Enneagram including it’s very early origins from the “9 Deadly Sins”.  Annie discusses how every number has a “sin” or a “fixation” which can pull them away from God or others around them, and how noticing these fixations can help recenter and realign our thoughts, emotions and actions.  In addition to these fixations, each number also has a door to the “higher self”, the part of the self that allows us to fully step into who God created us to be.  Annie leads us through a thoughtful discussion about each these crucial aspects of the Enneagram and how it can make a big impact in our lives.  

If you’d like to know more about Annie, you can visit her website at: https://www.enneagramforwholeness.com or on instagram at @enneagramforwholeness

The book she recommends to get started on the topic is called “The Complete Enneagram: 27 Paths to Greater Self-Knowledge” by Beatrice Chestnut

			<title><![CDATA[234 - Scars, Not Wounds - with Mike Erre]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[We are thrilled to have the one and only Mike Erre on back on the show today!  After three months dedicated therapy, healing and re-orientation, Mike is back to share more of his story.  In this episode, Bonnie and Tim talk with Mike as he updates everyone on where he has been, what he has been doing and learning.  Mike highly recommends OnSite Workshops, a therapeutic retreat center in Nashville, TN and has found great growth and solace in both the Enneagram and Spiritual Direction.  Mike also gives an update on Justina and the family, and 
Tim and Bonnie share some of their own learnings from the past few months.  

In addition, we also answer the burning question, “Is Mike back for good?”

If you are a newer listener and aren’t sure what we are discussing, you may want to visit Episode 224 “Together, In Process” which explains Mike’s reason for spending time away from the podcast.  

We are excited for the road ahead, and how the new growth of the team will help continue to serve you.  We can’t thank you enough for sticking with us these past three months and we are excited to all be recording together once again!

			<title><![CDATA[233 - Hell, Judgement & Ultimate Redemption - with Bradley Jersak]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[We sat down with Dr. Bradley Jersak to discuss his book on judgment and hell called "Her Gates Will Never Be Shut."  In this conversation, we explore the many differing views of hell and how they differ from one another, the question of judgment including who is judged and if it's eternal or temporal.  Dr. Jersak takes us through numerous Scriptures, definitions & Church history, as well as pastoral care.  We value these types of conversations as we believe they are essential in learning more about parts of our faith that may have been inherited, and giving ourselves and our community a chance to own them for ourselves.  For more information on Dr. Jersak and his work, visit: https://bradjersak.com and you can find his newest book, "In" here: https://www.amazon.com/Incarnation-Inclusion-Abba-Lamb-ebook/dp/B07VSP1J71/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Bradley+Jersak+in&qid=1584370073&sr=8-1

			<title><![CDATA[229 - Reconciling Purity Culture - with Dr. Celeste Holbrook (Rated PG13)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In today’s episode we talk with sexologist Dr. Celeste Holbrook and dive into the aftermath of purity culture.  We discuss the good things that purity culture left behind as well as what needs some repairing.  Dr. Holbrook believes that our inner feelings of shame and fear that was often taught to us within purity culture can continually impact our sex lives in negative ways unless we heal those wounds.  Dr. Holbrook’s life work is dedicated to helping people heal and find a healthy sex life that is based on pleasure, connection and belonging.  

This episode contains explicit language, and may trigger some deep wounds for some.  Please check out Dr. Holbrook’s site for resources to help heal some of this pain with a trusted professional.  Her work and the questionnaire referenced in the episode can be found here: https://www.drcelesteholbrook.com

			<description><![CDATA[Happy Monday! Bonnie and Tim had the pleasure of sitting down with Skye Jethani from the Holy Post Podcast, a frequent guest and part of the VOX Community. They have a fascinating conversation on "A Theology of Vocation." What does the Bible say about your work? What does it mean to be "called" to something? Does every job need to be under the umbrella of church and ministry? How do we know what we're called to? What about dreams and desires? All of this is covered and more! Thanks for listening!

We talk Trump, the band Skillet, the deconstruction of the Church, and a suggestion that maybe some people want to have a few tiers on Patreon to be named after Taylor Swift.

Also, Mike is still wearing all black. 😬😐

			<description><![CDATA[So many of you are launching micro communities with us around the world (yes, the world!!) and we couldn’t be more excited!  We’ve been getting lots of emails regarding different cities where you all are starting them, as well as a request for more information about what a micro community is.  Tim takes the lead (and the crowd goes willlldddd!!!…) on what his experience of a micro community has been, how it’s different from church, how it is formatted and their genius childcare plan.  If you think you’d like to start a micro community in your area, or want more information on the one in your city,  please email hello@voxpodcast.com

			<title><![CDATA[222.2 VOX Mini - Feedback on Frow]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[A couple of weeks ago we interviewed Alan Frow (Episode 219), a pastor from Orange County, CA who is also a Complementarian.  It was great to interview someone with an opposing viewpoint, but also who upheld kindness and a respectful demeanor towards women, unlike  recent examples of some well known Complementarians (Episode 218).  In this episode, we dive into a few emails we got in response to Frow including a question regarding planting a church with someone who holds an opposing view: Is it possible to do church ministry together while fully honoring both parties?  Take a listen to see what we say, as well as our answers to a few other questions on the Women in Leadership subject.

			<description><![CDATA[We are back with a few mini episodes this week as we dive into our mailbag.  First up is a great question in which a listener wants to know why God didn’t leave us detailed instructions on how to live, what to believe how to follow him, etc.  Mike, Bonnie and Tim answer this question by exploring the role of the Bible and the Holy Spirit, how community fits into the mix of things, and the necessary pursuit of God’s wonder.  

Mike also recommends a book about this topic by Dallas Willard called “Knowing Christ Today: Why We Can Trust Spiritual Knowledge”.

Then, yours truly does an outro in which Bonnie discusses Quantum Mechanics and we toss around a different name for "deconstruction".

			<itunes:summary>We are so excited about this week&apos;s episode with John Mark Comer in which we discuss his new book about eliminating hurry in our lives. He talks spiritual disciplines, enneagram, and more!

Then, yours truly does an outro in which Bonnie discusses Quantum Mechanics and we toss around a different name for &quot;deconstruction&quot;.

Thank you for listening, we can&apos;t wait to hear your thoughts!

			<description><![CDATA[A few weeks ago we discussed the John Macarthur/Beth Moore fiasco and urged that not all Complementarians behave in a way that is disrespectful and mean spirited. To this end, we interviewed Alan Frow who is a Complemetarian and is kind, respectful and a wonderful pastor to boot!

We also add out thoughts in the outro!

Hope you enjoy it!

			<description><![CDATA[It's all over the internet: the time where John Macarthur told Beth Moore to go home and that there was no place for women to preach.

WE HAVE SOME THOUGHTS.

Let us say from the outset: You can leave. If you are treated in a way that slanders you, places you on the margins and treats you as less than, you can leave. There are places for you in which you will be loved, cherished, accepted and even given a voice. I know, women that it doesn't always feel like that, but Im here on the other side of the storm to tell you that it's possible. And men: your voice here matters more than you think. Your apologies matter. Your reversal of this toxic chain of events that happens when people in platforms treat women like this is what will turn this thing around.

Women, in Jesus, in Church, in the Kingdom....at the pulpit: You are already home.

			<description><![CDATA[Ok y’all. THIS. Erre texted us with ALL CAPS about how this interview with Tim Gombis blew his mind. And he was SO RIGHT. 🤯
.
They dive deep into the atonement and the reason Jesus had to die. Spoiler alert: Gombis asserts it wasn’t for individual salvation but for the destruction of the present evil age and the cosmic enslavement we find ourselves in.
.
And it really was so much good stuff that we just hashed it out for an hour, even though it felt like 5 minutes. We are sorry this is two hours long....but it’s worth it. Can’t wait to hear your thoughts!

			<title><![CDATA[211 - Healing the Wounds of Sexual Abuse - With Elaine Heath]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[A new podcast is out, but this one comes with a trigger warning for Sexual Abuse. Erre spoke with Elaine Heath about how to read the Bible from the perspective of survivors and it was so good, but also heavy and authentic and real.

Today's outro to the episode, we get into all the things such as:
-What lens we read the Bible and why it matters,
-Bonnie asking Erre if it's theologically permissible and beneficial to talk about God with feminine pronouns,
-If patriarchal cultures are more likely to have women and children exploited.

We'd love to hear what you think! hello@voxpodcast.com

Her work began as a voice for sexual abuse survivors when she founded OneVOICE in 2003, an organization dedicated to creating awareness about sexual abuse and empowering survivors. She has since written several books and become an international activist. As many of the stories she heard of sexual abuse began to overlap with stories of trafficking, Nicole began to clearly see common threads and links and had an urge to be part of the solution to sex slavery founded  OneVOICE4freedom.

			<description><![CDATA[Wondering if Doubt is worthy of God's wrath upon you? Are we allowed to ask questions? Are you SLANDERING God if you doubt? This article from Desiring God seems to paint that picture. There is only one little kernel of truth that we think holds up in this article, but fundamentally confuses some critical points which, we think, can be incredible damaging. Enjoy!

			<title><![CDATA[128 - Andy Savage and #ChurchToo]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we offer commentary on the ongoing exposure of Andy Savage and the allegations against him made by a former youth group attender many years ago. Mainly, this episode takes a look at hypotheticals and how the church might respond appropriately when horrific acts like this occur in your church. As this is still a LIVE conversation, details are in the gray. However, many of these stories over the years have come out and made to be true, and that's worth discussing as we are shocked and horrified at his church's response over the matter.

			<title><![CDATA[126 - Politics; Do the Ends Justify the Means?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode, we present a recent article that attempts to bring reasonable defense to how you could support Roy Moore and still consider yourself a non-compromising Christian. We don't buy it. This however stems much further past Moore, he is merely a test case to present a perspective when looking at electing folks who are not being held in account to upstanding Christian character.

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we talk with Katie (Davis) Majors about her life and journey in Uganda, having become a young mother, and adopted 13 girls. 

Katie Davis Majors moved to Uganda over a decade ago with no idea that this would be the place that God chose to build her home and her family. Today, she is a wife to Benji and mama to her fourteen favorite people. Katie and her family invest their lives in empowering the people of Uganda with education, medical care, and spiritual discipleship. She is also the founder of Amazima Ministries, an organization that cares for vulnerable children and families in Uganda and the author of the New York Times bestseller Kisses from Katie.

			<title><![CDATA[123 - Roy Moore and Siege Mentality]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we discuss the recent events surrounding the bizarre and usual support of the allegations accused of GOP representative, Roy Moore. We've spent many hours wrestling with the cultural discourse of evangelicals in America and their marriage to identity politics. And this is just another level into the deep. Here is the article we reference in the show. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/opinion/roy-moore-conservative-evangelicals.html

			<itunes:summary>In this episode we discuss the recent events surrounding the bizarre and usual support of the allegations accused of GOP representative, Roy Moore. We&apos;ve spent many hours wrestling with the cultural discourse of evangelicals in America and their marriage to identity politics. And this is just another level into the deep. Here is the article we reference in the show. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/opinion/roy-moore-conservative-evangelicals.html

			<title><![CDATA[115 - We Are All Religious - Guest Skye Jethani]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Mike and Andy are back! Skype is up and running and we've got Skye Jethani on the show today. In additions to some fascinating writing in his new book, What's Wrong with Religion, Skye has many profound thoughts and opinion to share on the former state of the church and where we are heading today.

FYI, better audio quality is on the way for future shows in their totality. During the interview portion, we forgot to hit record on Mike's side for a raw feed. It's a tight ship people.

			<itunes:summary>Mike and Andy are back! Skype is up and running and we&apos;ve got Skye Jethani on the show today. In additions to some fascinating writing in his new book, What&apos;s Wrong with Religion, Skye has many profound thoughts and opinion to share on the former state of the church and where we are heading today.

FYI, better audio quality is on the way for future shows in their totality. During the interview portion, we forgot to hit record on Mike&apos;s side for a raw feed. It&apos;s a tight ship people.

			<title><![CDATA[107 - I Delight To Sit In His Shade- Sex, Love, And God, Part 2]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today we bring you the 2nd episode of our ongoing mini-series, "Sex, Love, and God." 

Over the past 4 years Mike has received so much response from these teachings that we've been wanting to post them here to the VOX Podcast. We please ask that you take into account that Mike would also nuance some of this differently, 4 years and many many conversations later. All that said, we're excited to offer these teachings to you and hope they are as helpful as they have been to so many others. This is 2/9 episodes that we will release out to you over time here.

Thanks!

Mike & Andy

			<itunes:summary>Today we bring you the 2nd episode of our ongoing mini-series, &quot;Sex, Love, and God.&quot; 

Over the past 4 years Mike has received so much response from these teachings that we&apos;ve been wanting to post them here to the VOX Podcast. We please ask that you take into account that Mike would also nuance some of this differently, 4 years and many many conversations later. All that said, we&apos;re excited to offer these teachings to you and hope they are as helpful as they have been to so many others. This is 2/9 episodes that we will release out to you over time here.

Thanks!

Mike &amp; Andy

			<description><![CDATA[We continue our mini-series exploring violence of the Old Testament with creator of The Bible Project, Tim Mackie. The Bible Project has taken the internet by storm with easy and short explanations of the Bible's most fascinating stories.  In this mini series, we have tried to offer challenging and insightful views from multiple personalities. Tim is no exception, bringing attention to the Hebrew texts that Jesus himself most likely referenced during his time.  We appreciate Tim's grace, finesse, and creativity in how he chooses to present the beauty of Jesus.

			<description><![CDATA[This week we welcome special guest Matt Carter of the Bad Christian Podcast. There have been a number of podcast episodes where Matt, Toby, and Joey discuss the overwhelming shortcomings of the modern church.  While we agree with many of the opinions expressed from Matt, we wanted to hear more from his opinions about what could make it better and really try to understand the future potential for the "Mega Church".

Matt also hosts the Break it Down Podcast and acts as Director and oversees Business development across Bad Christian's multiple divisions.

			<title><![CDATA[98 - LIVE Questions -  Scripture, Sinners, Women In Leadership, And Is The Bible Just An Epic Tale?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[VOX Questions - Scripture, Sinners, Women in Leadership, and is the Bible just an epic tale?

1. Thank you so much for recording this! I am understanding the importance of reading Scripture "in context" at a deeper level--with less of the blinders from my church experience. For example, this morning I read Matt 18:15-17 and realized we cannot take this as a step by step process for how to deal with sin in the church/excommunicate someone (as the church often does in my experience) without understanding the social context in which the passage was written--e.g., what were the standards for such issues at the time, and how did Jesus' instructions differ? My point in saying all that is this: What do I listen to/read along with my Bible to get that kind of crucial info?

2. Recently I saw a video clip of a well known pastor talk about the two lies that scare him the most. He says the first lie is that, "You are a good person." He references Romans 3:9-12 (which I believe comes from Ps. 14:3)as well as Ro. 3:23. Essentially he points out that the Bible teaches that no human is good, our hearts are evil. He even goes as far to say that when we speak of someone as "good" at a funeral, we're lying, because the Bible teaches that no one is good. He also used the flood as an example of God's wrath towards his creation that had turned evil. Most of my life, even after becoming a Christian I have struggled with depression and guilt. I guess my question is, even after Jesus, am I still a bad person? Didn't God call his creation good? While these verses that this pastor pointed out are clearly in the Bible, what about other verses that speak of God's great love for us? Is it a matter of seeing God's love for us despite our sin? Do we have an "old sin nature" that stays win us even after giving our lives to Jesus? I'm finding it burdensome to give myself over to Jesus and still be considered "bad" or even that when I sin, I'm constantly disappointing him. Maybe I watched the video with too much of my own insecurities in mind. Anyway, I hope this makes sense. Thanks for reading!

3. My background - As a believer for most of my life- I have grown up in churches, Hume Lake, Biola, and other great spots where the traditional role of women is to submit, not be pastors or teachers (except to children) and not be on elder boards. I have been relatively ok with this (it's tradition) but have really had my eyes opened with your teachings. The biggest issue I now see is that the gospel is becoming ugly to those on the "outside" of church and I know of friends who would never darken the door of my church simply because of how women are viewed. It now only seems to me to be discrimination. I can see that Jesus took a very different role with women- one for which has made me feel loved and respected, and I am so thankful - My question - what do I do in my current church to encourage any kind of light to be shed on this topic in a respectful way- when in essence I'm not even sure my concerns and perspective will be valued simply because I'm a woman? Any advice? I want to lovingly share my concerns- but honestly my foot is out the door of this church (for many reasons- women in leadership being only one.)

4. Love the podcast keep up the good work! Wondering if you have ever responded to the argument that goes: "since the Bible reads like an epic story, than that's all it is - an epic, fictional story." The example I've heard given to explain this is: "why would Emperor Augustus call for a census, especially one where you had go back to your ancestral home? It only makes sense because, like all good fiction, it makes Jesus' birth more dramatic." This feels very Jesus Seminar-ish to me, but it also works to turn the normal genre-based understanding of the books of the Bible against us. Thoughts on this?

			<title><![CDATA[96 - LIVE Questions - Prayer, LGBTQ, Suffering, Personal Change, And Religious Differences.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[VOX Questions - Prayer, LGBTQ, suffering, personal change, religious differences. - June 22, 2017

1. Why do you pray to Jesus when He clearly instructs us to pray to God his father?

2. Will LGBT ever receive the same grace & full inclusion in the church as people that have been divorced? It's very confusing & irritating that while divorce is very clearly against God's, Jesus' & other biblical leader's teachings; we allow them grace & fully include them in church,(which is awesome!) leadership & even allow remarriage (also a biblical no no) All the while LGBT people deeply desire to be a part of the church community yet barely are allowed to come inside & if they are, they are told they cannot be full members, share their stories publicly, married or serve in leadership.

3. If we are going to suffer our whole lives, why should we put time and energy into following God? Why not just be kind to others and distract ourselves from the pain? It's disheartening to "follow"'someone who doesn't help with the pain.

4. How do we go about changing our hearts to want for something better, like wanting broccoli over ice cream? Is that change something we should strive towards ourselves, is that only done through prayer, or is it a combination of the two?

5. I was excited to learn more of Christ's fulfillment of the law from Jesus' teachings, especially as it is the final week of Ramadan. This past Fri-Sat, I had the honor of staying with a Muslim family and fasting with them. In becoming closer these past few months, each time I leave their home in awe of how there is no dichotomy with faith & life, yet at the same time a complete brokenness for their life without Jesus Christ. I have received mixed responses from "Christians" saying that i should be more bold with our differences, or not respond so openly. Is that right? Should I be more moved in anger by their misinterpretation of God?

			<title><![CDATA[95 - Angry God and Peaceful Jesus - Guest Greg Boyd]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Author and Pastor of Woodland Hills Church joins us this week to share about his view and on the Old Testament and the significance of Jesus' act on the cross.  In our time together, Greg goes into great detail about how we can understand a God the presumably commands genocide and consider how a people carried it out.  His extensive research and authorship makes way for many challenging ideas about the Bible for us to wrestle with and test.  

This episode is 2 of 3 conversations we have prepared with some folks who carry an educated and challenging view of the Old Testament Our hope is to hear the best of their research, ask more about it, and offer it to you an extended conversation in your faith circles for growth and process.

			<title><![CDATA[94 - LIVE Questions - Hell, Water To Wine, What Is Faith?]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[VOX LIVE Questions - Hell, Water to Wine, What is faith? - June 15th, 2017

1. So often I have found church after church and pastor after pastor who teach and claim their own anxiety based insecurities.
I understand that the Church is an imperfect system run by imperfect people to serve a perfect God and will never be complete until the second coming. However, I do not understand why there is rampant denying of the core message of Jesus; hope, love, and grace offered to all.
I struggle with trusting pastors and churches because of this. How can such love be offered yet continuously erroneously conditional? How can a pastor/church claim such power in Jesus yet directly go against said power? Sorry for the rambling.
2. What are your feelings on hell? Some believe it's a place of eternal torment, but others believe it's a place of annihilation where evil ceases to exist. Some also believe it's a state of purgatory, and eventually everyone becomes reconciled with God. Do you believe in the possibility of universal reconciliation?
3. Why was the first miracle water being turned into wine when people were probably already pretty drunk?
4. I know we idealize many OT prophets' faith in God, but I hardly think stories like Abraham show any extraordinary faith. An honest critique is he jacked it all up trying to figure out and do for God what God said He was going to do for him. I mean the collateral damage from Abraham sleeping with Hagar is disgusting, yet the Bible says he has great faith. If anything I think this story shows us the reality of God doing for us what we can't fathom or begin to do for ourselves. So what is belief/faith then? Can God take the disjointed, obscured and jacked up faiths of those who have some idea of a God and what He's like, yet don't get it all quite right including how they practice or even knowing about Jesus? Can He take our pathetic efforts and also count us as righteous because of Christ doing for us what we can't do for ourselves?

1. So often I have found church after church and pastor after pastor who teach and claim their own anxiety based insecurities.
I understand that the Church is an imperfect system run by imperfect people to serve a perfect God and will never be complete until the second coming. However, I do not understand why there is rampant denying of the core message of Jesus; hope, love, and grace offered to all.
I struggle with trusting pastors and churches because of this. How can such love be offered yet continuously erroneously conditional? How can a pastor/church claim such power in Jesus yet directly go against said power? Sorry for the rambling.
2. What are your feelings on hell? Some believe it&apos;s a place of eternal torment, but others believe it&apos;s a place of annihilation where evil ceases to exist. Some also believe it&apos;s a state of purgatory, and eventually everyone becomes reconciled with God. Do you believe in the possibility of universal reconciliation?
3. Why was the first miracle water being turned into wine when people were probably already pretty drunk?
4. I know we idealize many OT prophets&apos; faith in God, but I hardly think stories like Abraham show any extraordinary faith. An honest critique is he jacked it all up trying to figure out and do for God what God said He was going to do for him. I mean the collateral damage from Abraham sleeping with Hagar is disgusting, yet the Bible says he has great faith. If anything I think this story shows us the reality of God doing for us what we can&apos;t fathom or begin to do for ourselves. So what is belief/faith then? Can God take the disjointed, obscured and jacked up faiths of those who have some idea of a God and what He&apos;s like, yet don&apos;t get it all quite right including how they practice or even knowing about Jesus? Can He take our pathetic efforts and also count us as righteous because of Christ doing for us what we can&apos;t do for ourselves?

			<description><![CDATA[Author, speaker, and former Pastor Rob Bell joins us to answer some questions we have about the Bible.  While Rob has been a controversial character among certain circles of Christianity, our hope was to capture some of his best thoughts and antidotes that best convey the conviction of his work.  This episode leaves a lot to consider and wrestle with.  Spoiler alert: Andy cries and Mike runs out of jokes.

			<title><![CDATA[92 - LIVE Questions - Soulmates, Who Does God Answer?, And Masturbation.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[LIVE Questions - Soulmates, Who does God Answer?, and Masturbation.
1 I'm am a Christian woman and in my mid thirties and have been single for a long time and the fact that I'm not married is really hard to deal with sometimes. I want to be married more than anything to take away the sting of loneliness I unfortunately have become addicted to masturbating. I'm scared to death that because of this God won't bless me with a husband. Can and will god still bless me with a godly man even if I'm struggling in this area
2. I have a boyfriend that is so self-less and has demonstrated the kind of things that you mentioned in your podcast about being the head sacrificer (?) and not giving into the stereotypical roles of the man and woman. However, he thinks that soul mates exist. He thinks that we are really good for each other and that we have helped each other become a better person, but he wants the "feeling" in his soul that we are soul mates. I don't believe in soul mates. I think that God puts people together and love is what you make of it with work. There are feelings between both of us, but he says not "that" feeling. I can't believe in soul mates because what happens if you miss them? We have both been divorced and the thought of soul mates to me just says I wasn't good enough to be given that soul mate and if I was married when I met my soul mate, did I miss that and now just have no one? What are your thoughts biblically about soul mates and marriage and even relationships and what are relationships for if not to help each other be the best possible version of themselves they can be?
3. I'm struggling with how to resolve things during times when tragedy strikes. For example, many kids were killed during the Columbine tragedy. Parents lost kids and other parents' kids were spared. For the ones that were spared, the parents thanked God for watching over their kids and protecting them. For the parents whose kids were killed...does this mean God wasn't watching over their kids and didn't protect them? On the surface it seems like it is easy to give God credit for the good things, but what about the bad things? How can one give God credit for the good and yet not blame him or hold God responsible for the bad? I'm working to resolve this, but it seems to take a lot of mental gymnastics to get there.

			<description><![CDATA[LIVE Questions - God's Plan, Depression, And Waiting On God

1. Does God have a plan for our lives? It seems pretty hopeless to think that we're the victims of other people's free will, or that everything is just up to us. Some people say God has plans and purposes, while others say we have the freedom to choose. Which one is accurate?

2. How do you deal with depression and anxiety?

3. Why does God so often make us wait for things that are really important to us?

			<title><![CDATA[88 - Embarrassed By The Bible: Wives Submit To Your Husbands]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This week we begin a new mini series, "Embarrassed By the Bible".  To clarify, no we are not embarrassed by the Bible.  What we can say however, is that there is a whole truck load of content written though that cause us some major confusion and deserves a much deeper dive into context.  

We've received so many questions regarding what the Bible actually says about wives submitting to their husbands. Given our modern day context where women are regarded as leaders and influences, not only professionally but in the home as well, we figured we better explain whats going on in the book of Ephesians.

			<title><![CDATA[87 - LIVE Questions VOX Podcast - Rob Bell, Embarrassed By The Bible, And Judgement.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[1. Hi mike again - thank you for answering my question on your podcast.
My question is, what are your thoughts on Rob Bell? With a new book coming out and a successful podcast, Were you a part of the evangelical voice to excommunicate him or do you understand his perspective and theological journey?

2. First of all, I was disheartened by the joke regarding a future podcast about your embarrassment with the Bible, when speaking in the context of the Noah story. That "slippery slope" may cause seekers to doubt the inspired Word of God. But then, when discussing the virtues of the meek from the Sermon on the Mount, you referenced Psalm 37 which is filled with God's righteous judgement towards evil/wicked people. Is that not the Noah story ( the one that embarrasses you), God's destruction of evil/wicked people to allow the meek or righteous to inherit the land?

3. Can you help me understand Matthew 18:8, does judgement last forever? If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away, it is better for you to lose part of your body and live forever than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the fire that burns forever.”

			<title><![CDATA[85 - LIVE Questions - What was Paul, Trusting God, And Toxic Relationships.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[VOX Podcast LIVE Questions - What was Paul, Trusting God, and Toxic Relationships.

1. On the podcast #ThingsOnlyChristianWomenHear you said the 12 disciples that turned into the 12 apostles represented the 12 tribes of Israel, so what was Paul then? He's the 13th apostle... maybe Melchizedek (totally guessing here)? High five on the podcast btw!

2. I have heard people say things like "your faith will unlock what God has for you." This doesn't seem to be theologically accurate, but it makes me anxious because there ARE passages in the Bible about how faith pleases God. Do you think it's true that our words/level of faith have an impact on whether our prayers get answered? - How is it possible to trust God when there are so many other "wills" being done on earth? - What do you when you don't hear from God and need to make a big decision?

3. I feel like there is this unspoken spiritual/emotional/psychological pressure or expectation to keep toxic people in our lives because Jesus suffers long with us and so we're expected to do the same. But I'm not Jesus and I've let go of several relationships because of their toxicity and there is honestly an emotional and psychological relief. I mean I cut them out after 15-20+ years of trying so it's not like I didn't try. Why do I still feel conflicted spiritually like God is mad at me for not being a good Christian? Where is the balance? I feel like I absorbed some bad theology along the way that makes me feel like this. What do YOU do as a pastor in situations like this?

			<title><![CDATA[83 - LIVE Questions - Gospel Of Paul, Wives Submit To Husbands, Satan, And Bible Canonization]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[VOX LIVE Questions - Gospel of Paul, Wives Submit to Husbands, Satan, and Bible canonization - May 4th, 2017

1. Hi Mike - you spoke in a podcast recently about having a faith based on Paul vs having it build on Jesus and the gospel. Can you expound more on this and the implications of each?

2. Can you explain submission/ the love and respect dichotomy described in Ephesians 5? I want to follow and obey God, but I have seen many poor examples of men abusing their power and women being disrespected in marriages. What does it mean to submit to a husband? Should love and respect go both ways? Does a man actually have the final say? As a single person, marriage doesn't sound that appealing if in the end my opinion isn't as important as a man's. Shouldn't all disagreements be discussed and both parties compromise at times? I would think having a mentality of submission/authority would be detrimental to healthy and functioning relationship.

3. Can God destroy Satan? If so, why hasn't he? If not, why can't he?

4. Can you talk about the canonization and why some books of the bible are in there and why others like Gospel of Thomas is not in there?

			<title><![CDATA[81 - Live Questions - Sabbath, Essential Oils, Free Will, And Marriage.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[LIVE QUESTIONS - Sabbath, Essential Oils, Free Will, and Marriage. - April 27th, 2017

1. What is your take on keeping the Sabbath day Holy? It is one of the 10 commandments of the "old" covenant and I know Jesus is the "new" covenant, however Jesus said he had not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it. I can find scriptural arguments for both sides.

2. I work in an intensive care unit. Why do christians place so much faith in essential oils and so little faith in science? Thanks

3. Do we really have free will? If so how does God know which decision we are going to make? I guess I struggle with the idea of pre-destination. How can we believe in someone being pre-designed to be a murderer, rapist, mental health issues, commit suicide, and any other bad things in the world. Does that mean if someone commits suicide or does something bad they have no choice in the matter. I really struggle this idea. Please help clarify.

4. What do you do when you really want to get married, but it doesn't seem like you're able to meet someone good for you? Does God care about this at all?

			<itunes:summary>LIVE QUESTIONS - Sabbath, Essential Oils, Free Will, and Marriage. - April 27th, 2017

1. What is your take on keeping the Sabbath day Holy? It is one of the 10 commandments of the &quot;old&quot; covenant and I know Jesus is the &quot;new&quot; covenant, however Jesus said he had not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it. I can find scriptural arguments for both sides.

2. I work in an intensive care unit. Why do christians place so much faith in essential oils and so little faith in science? Thanks

3. Do we really have free will? If so how does God know which decision we are going to make? I guess I struggle with the idea of pre-destination. How can we believe in someone being pre-designed to be a murderer, rapist, mental health issues, commit suicide, and any other bad things in the world. Does that mean if someone commits suicide or does something bad they have no choice in the matter. I really struggle this idea. Please help clarify.

4. What do you do when you really want to get married, but it doesn&apos;t seem like you&apos;re able to meet someone good for you? Does God care about this at all?

			<title><![CDATA[78 - LIVE Questions - Tithing, Apostle Names, And Lust]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[VOX Podcast LIVE Q&A - Tithing, Apostle Names, and Lust- April 13, 2017

Is tithing strictly an old testament command? I was raised believing you should give at least 10% of your income based on this command. Do you agree?

I saw this question in a meme on Facebook but it got me thinking... how did guys with the names Matthew, Mark, Luke and John end up in the Middle East?

Hi Mike, I struggle with the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus equates lust and anger to adultery and murder. This seems unreasonable to me. If my spouse were to say "I've had lustful thoughts about a coworker" I would calmly say "ok, let's take steps to avoid that." But if they were to say "I slept with a coworker" I would go through the roof. Similarly, if I were to cut someone off in traffic, I would never equate them giving me the finger to them pulling out a gun and trying to shoot me. I understand that sin begins in the heart, and that is where the issue needs to be met. But this 1 to 1 equation doesn't make any sense to me. Care to clarify?

			<title><![CDATA[74 - LIVE Questions - Suicide, God's Voice, Masturbation, And Adam]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[VOX Podcast LIVE Questions from Facebook Live March 30th, 2017

1. I am curious. What do you say to a parent whose son committed suicide and this has produced real sorrow and anxiety re whether their child will go to heaven or not.

2. Does God speak to us? If so, how do we discern His voice?

3. I have always heard masturbation is wrong because it causes a person to lust and so I was always scared to do it. I recently discovered the benefits of it and I literally do not think of sex at all. Why is it wrong to want to feel pleasure?

4. I hear a lot about how Eve was the first sinner, yet the Bible states over and over that it was Adam. My belief is that because Adam was right there and watched his wife be deceived and did nothing, that his passiveness and lack of concern in protecting her from deception was the first sin. I think this shows us our responsibility in warning others when we see them being deceived. Thoughts?

Tune in  to Facebook LIVE on Thursday mornings around 1130AM and say hello or ask a question. Also, submit your questions to hello@voxpodcast.com

			<itunes:summary>VOX Podcast LIVE Questions from Facebook Live March 30th, 2017

1. I am curious. What do you say to a parent whose son committed suicide and this has produced real sorrow and anxiety re whether their child will go to heaven or not.

2. Does God speak to us? If so, how do we discern His voice?

3. I have always heard masturbation is wrong because it causes a person to lust and so I was always scared to do it. I recently discovered the benefits of it and I literally do not think of sex at all. Why is it wrong to want to feel pleasure?

4. I hear a lot about how Eve was the first sinner, yet the Bible states over and over that it was Adam. My belief is that because Adam was right there and watched his wife be deceived and did nothing, that his passiveness and lack of concern in protecting her from deception was the first sin. I think this shows us our responsibility in warning others when we see them being deceived. Thoughts?

Tune in  to Facebook LIVE on Thursday mornings around 1130AM and say hello or ask a question. Also, submit your questions to hello@voxpodcast.com

			<title><![CDATA[72 - LIVE Questions - Cool Pastors, Jesus, Judgement, And Exclusiveness.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Join us LIVE on Facebook on Thursday mornings, answering questions from VOX Community and submissions to hello@voxpodcast.com, or in the comments during the LIVE Q&A.

VOX Podcast Facebook LIVE Q&A March 23, 2017

1. Is there a way to become a cool/wise/urban teaching pastor like Mike Erre, Tim Mackie, John Mark Comer, Francis Chan & Dave Lomas without paying thousands of dollars at a seminary school?

2. Are you really a follower of Jesus, if you don't follow Jesus' teachings? Or rather, if you don't live your life with love, like Jesus did, are you really a follower of Jesus? For instance, will you go to heaven only if you are a follower of Jesus? If you say you believe in Jesus, but don't live as his witness through Love are you saved?

3. So you say the church exists to love and serve the world, not to sit in judgment of it, how should the church respond to sin within the church? In my experience, we judge not only those on the outside but are really good about judging those inside too.

4. What would you say to Christian's who use II Corinthians 6:14-18 as a reason for excluding non-Christian friend's and "the world"?... what is your take on this section of the Bible especially in light of the "safe to belong" idea this church is founded on?

			<title><![CDATA[70 - Power Under Vs Power Over - LIVE From Monkey Business Café]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[We're LIVE from Downtown Fullerton at Monkey Business Café this week! Thank you to our Patreon supporters for making it possible for 75 folks to join us for free and listen to us talk about Power Under(the Cross) VS Power Over People.  Jesus demonstrated a version of power that would look neither democrat or republican. And demonstrated through great humility and observation of the future of kingdom of God, that weakness would be the way of love. Holding power over people was never the way of Jesus, contrary to how many of our contemporary churches demonstrate their views to the the public.

			<title><![CDATA[69 - Judgment & Hell]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we offer an approach on judgement and hell. At VOX Community, we have spent the last couple months teaching about hell and the concept of perish, and this episode sums it all up.  You can listen to all of those teaching in the playlist here: https://soundcloud.com/voxcommunity/sets/teachings-about-hell

There is a long standing traditional view in the evangelical Christian genre that suggests that when you die and have no relationship with Jesus, that you will be eternally and consciously tormented.  However, the Bible seems to offer a different take on that.  Here's the books referenced on the show:

			<title><![CDATA[68 - The Porn Episode]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[*EAR MUFFS* For our more sensitive listeners, please be warned. Today  we discuss issues with porn, a theology of sexuality, and sexual reconciliation.  You might find it surprising that in this episode we are saying much much more than "Stop looking at porn." Mike openly and tenderly shares his walk with this struggle with this issue. We sincerely hope that what is offered in this episode can help.  Like second hand smoke, everyone is effected by this issue.  Moreover, many of us in church are wrestling with a fallout of programming to simply stop the behavior, without addressing the deeper issue, what does God really think of sex?

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we visit a question submitted from VOX Community regarding prayer.  When does God answer prayer? Why does He answer other prayers and not yours?  Why does he seem to answer our small prayers, and not answer those in the trenches of tragedy like Aleppo.  We offer a couple bad answers to these, and perhaps the right one.  Looking forward to your comments and thoughts!

			<title><![CDATA[64 - Safe To Lament]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we expand the conversation on spiritual maturity by observing Walter Brueggemann's "Spirituality of the Psalms."  We ask; How do we as a church celebrate so much of God's goodness when the current generation is being so disoriented by the chaos around them?  There is so much to learn from how David spoke to God.  Often, many of us would never be as honest as he was.  Especially after this week of political events, we (the Church)have so much to consider.

			<title><![CDATA[63 - The Mystery of Spiritual Maturity]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we adopt a view on human spiritual formation and transport it over to spiritual maturity in the Christian Faith.  This observation became a critical tool that has helped me when speaking to audiences publicly and among groups.  Most importantly, wherever you find yourself on this spectrum, the goal for us is to hold grace across all types.  We'd really love you're thoughts on this episode, where you think you might be in these phases, and if this tool was helpful. Comment below (On Soundcloud) or on our Facebook page!

			<title><![CDATA[61 - Why Pastors Have Affairs]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[We couldn't ignore an email that arrived asking our thoughts on why so many pastors commit affairs.  It seems odd that commonly when a pastor needs to step down, their is this immediate subconscious wonder; is there sexual scandal involved? This is not always the case, but is also not so rare.  We take some time to unload a couple ideas on how and why this might be commonplace.

We take some time to unload a couple ideas on how and why this might be commonplace.

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode, we share some great feedback that was presented to us (Mike more specifically)via email about the impression we are presuming to make upon our listeners.  The email was thought provoking and worth spending some time on as it drastically illuminates either a problem we have and an opportunity to make a few things very clear.  Looking forward to your thoughts and comments!

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we respond to an email on a topic we have not yet covered!  That the perceived exclusivity of Christianity or others religions as a whole.  In other words, is there one way to Heaven? Or what happens to people who never hear about Jesus? Does God only work through those who have chosen to follow him?  If there are the type of questions you find yourself wrestling with, then this episode might help provoke more discussion for you to consider! Enjoy!

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we share our view on how our church welcomes our friends in the LGBTQ community. We take some time to respond to an article that suggests when it comes to marriage, Christians cannot agree to disagree.  We weren't sure if we agreed with that. In May we started a church, www.soundcloud.com/voxcommunity, that offers an alternative approach to the exclusive nature this article embodies.

			<title><![CDATA[56 - Heaven, Hell, And Climate Change]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Brad Erre, Mike's brother made us aware of a Facebook discussion group he hosts where they discuss issues on the VOX Podcast.  One issue, we have not discussed is the Christian responsibility to take care of the earth.  Should we care about Climate Change?  Should we care about animals?  This episode is for you, Brad.  And anyone else who cares about this sort of thing.  Oh, and we talk about what Hell is really like.

Here's the links to the diagrams mentioned on the show.

			<title><![CDATA[52 - Kingdom Of God & Politics - The VOX Podcast LIVE Show]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This week's podcast was recorded LIVE from Villain Studio in Placentia, CA to an audience who showed up, drank a couple beers with us, and asked great questions about how Christians might respond in this political season.  We look forward to doing more LIVE shows, please check back at www.voxpodcast.com or email us hello@voxpodcast.com for more details in the future.  

In the episode we discuss what the Christian response should be in this energized and controversal election season.  We challenge our audience to consider that if you can hold a passionate and unwavering opinion only once every 4 years when a candidate is advocating your moral world view, you better be as passionate about that agenda the rest of the time in between.  We also spend time answering great questions from our live audience.

Thank you everyone who came out on Thursday night! We had an incredible time and hope to see you again soon!

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we examine what it means to forgive.  We feel we cannot fully appreciate the weight or forgiveness from God, but for those of you intend to follow Jesus, it should look a lot like him.  There is much that forgiveness is not and furthermore to completely forget the injustices against us isn't quite the picture Jesus had in mind.  Looking forward to you thoughts!

			<title><![CDATA[46 - Women in Leadership - Guest Bonnie Lewis]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode Bonnie Lewis offers to discuss emails she received about the topic of 'women in leadership'.  It becomes clear as the conversation moves forward, the she has clearly faced opposition in the evangelical/non-denominational church culture where she is not treated as an equal teaching leader among men.  The stance of the complementation view is still held by many.  And while respected, we would feel that holding fast to this view could offer a hurdle for many to see our beautiful Jesus, who delights in the gifts of both his discipled men and women. Some people out there say, "why aren't there any good women (Biblical) teachers out there?"  We'd say because, no one will them teach. Bonnie is an exceptional teacher, and available for booking as you may have a need.   And were not talking about your cookie decorating, cute, and crafty women's ministry event.

			<title><![CDATA[44 - How to Read the New Testament - Women, Islam, Slavery and Homosexuality]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we kindly observe some iTunes reviews, discuss deeper issues regarding Pearl Jam, and offer a thought experiment and observation about a way that we can approach the New Testament through the life of Islam, a woman, slaves, and consider homosexuality in our day.  In light of such suggestions like; Jesus failed to present his mission of grace and love clearly during his time (Ref: How to talk with an Atheist - Guest Godless), we would build a case to suggest that it was quite the contrary.  What began as a small movement among 1 messiah and 12 followers that became 3 million over approximately 3 years, might suggest Jesus' revolution to bring freedom to the oppressed and exist beyond the demise of the Roman Empire, was indeed successful and very clear.  What seems unclear, contradicting, and confusing is when we take our western American worldview and try to apply it to the shame and guilt culture of the middle east.  So, today we look at the cultural narrative of the New Testament, and consider truly what made Jesus so radical to the peers and status quo of his day.

			<itunes:summary>In this episode we kindly observe some iTunes reviews, discuss deeper issues regarding Pearl Jam, and offer a thought experiment and observation about a way that we can approach the New Testament through the life of Islam, a woman, slaves, and consider homosexuality in our day.  In light of such suggestions like; Jesus failed to present his mission of grace and love clearly during his time (Ref: How to talk with an Atheist - Guest Godless), we would build a case to suggest that it was quite the contrary.  What began as a small movement among 1 messiah and 12 followers that became 3 million over approximately 3 years, might suggest Jesus&apos; revolution to bring freedom to the oppressed and exist beyond the demise of the Roman Empire, was indeed successful and very clear.  What seems unclear, contradicting, and confusing is when we take our western American worldview and try to apply it to the shame and guilt culture of the middle east.  So, today we look at the cultural narrative of the New Testament, and consider truly what made Jesus so radical to the peers and status quo of his day.

			<title><![CDATA[43 - Seismic Mike Responds to Godless Part 2]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we uncover the next hot religion that has A LOT to do with Harry Potter.  In Pt. 2 of "Seismic Mike Responds to Godless" we discuss the sermon on the mount and present it's critical context to see how Jesus offers correction to the way the laws of the Torah were being upheld.  While there are many conversations to be had in regards to the questions left on the table by Godless, the claim that "Jesus failed to communicate what it is that he wanted to communicate.",  is especially important to address because, if we go as far to consider the depth of the contextual value of Jesus' Jewish heritage and identity it may possibly clear up many misconceptions, across the entire Bible, held not only by atheists but also Christians who've presented a less beautiful Jesus.

Disclaimer*: We clearly understand the perceived unfairness of this format in which we are having the chance to respond to very big questions asked by our friends here, without them present on the show.  However, this day and age it seems rare that we get to listen to a complete thought before it is interrupted by your opposing debator.  Furthermore, permission has been granted to respond in this way in which we will offer the last word for our guests as they have the opportunity to digest these thoughts in full presentation while not  engaged in partial conversation.

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we re-visit some questions asked by our agnostic atheist friend Godless, from our previous podcast with him.  In addition, we also read an email response from "Jeremy", who was the topic of our last episode responding to his questions around the controversial non-affirming opinion used against folks in the LGBTQ community.  Mike has never heard of the movie RAD from 1986, also mentioned in this show.  It's reference is below for your enjoyment in the producer notes.

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we take a moment to respond to an email advocating for the defense of the affirming LGBTQ view.  We read an email from a Christian, 20 year old, homosexual male who presented some great thoughts and insights to one of our earlier podcasts, "Was Jesus Pro-Gay? And the Difficulty with LGBTQ Questions" (https://soundcloud.com/user-188492964/5-was-jesus-pro-gay-and-the-difficulty-with-lgbtq-questions) In addition to his thoughts, his story captivated us and we felt honored to take the time to comment and push the conversation forward by sharing his experience on the podcast.

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we enjoy the pleasure of speaking with Godless, co-host on the the Metal Sucks Podcast and writer at www.chuckandgodless.com.  Godless identifies as a agnostic atheist and after an explosive podcast episode with He and Mark Salomon in heated debate on the https://soundcloud.com/pastor-with-no-answers podcast, we discussed the interaction with Mark and thought it would be exciting to talk to Godless ourselves.  While we left many things unsaid, we look forward to going further on the issues and challenges discussed in this show.  Please, leave your thoughts and comments below! Enjoy!

			<title><![CDATA[40 - We're Not Voting for a Pastor]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we visit the message I wrote on social media on July 22nd.  Here is the complete message below:

Dear World,

Myself, and many of my fellow Christians, are adamantly opposed to Trump and what he stands for.

HE DOES NOT SPEAK FOR US.

I simply cannot, in good conscience, vote for someone whose platform appeals to our basest fears.

You would think that following a rabbi who conquered death would cause Christians to be the least afraid people on the planet, and the last ones to be taken in by fear. I am ashamed of Trump's boast that evangelical Christians are a large part of his success.

Instead of political activism based on faith, hope and love, many of my brothers and sisters have opted for fear, threat and scarcity.

I have never - ever - publicly stood for or against a candidate - but evangelicalism's wholesale embrace of trump demands countering voices.We lose the ability to speak the reality of hope into the world when the world sees us so fearfully and viciously protect our comfort, security, and wealth, and compromise our convictions simply b/c some say Trump is the lesser of two evils.

Mike Erre

Due to the amount of comments, shares, and overall conversation this post generated it seemed absolutely necessary to address it with the nuance that podcasting offers as social media offers none.  My hope is that we can close the door on the question about where my stance is regarding the issue of the Evangelical Christian marriage to the fear being sold in this election season.  Truly as it seems, the lesser of two evils is not one candidate or another, but rather to vote or NOT to vote.  As always, we'd enjoy your thoughts below.

			<title><![CDATA[38 - Jesus, Race, and Privilege]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we discuss God's version of justice in light of the national uproar around Jesus, race, and privilege in our current age.  #TheBlackLivesMatter movement began almost a year ago in response to the death of Mike Brown Jr., killed by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. And either things have gotten worse or we just know more now because of social media and expanded communication platforms.  How God presents justice in not how America presents justice.  God calls upon his people to be a whole existence of forgiveness, reconciliation, and voice for the marginalized of our days.  In these days, we must be bearers of peace in His name. We think it's highly unlikely that any policy or social campaign will ultimately resolve these issues without a body of people primarily committed to reconciliation, while celebrating our differences, as an outworking of the embodiment of a radical, graceful, and beautiful Jesus.

Producer Notes

To my Filipino brothers and sisters.  I apologize for each time I am asked if I speak Tagalog, and reply that I do not.  I believe that I am a second generation bi-product to post mid century Americanization where people of multiple ethnic origins wanted to be more accepted by American culture by opting out of raising their children in their cultural traditions and languages, for fear of being perceived as "different" and unable to thrive in our country.  Because of this I am greatly detached from my heritage, and I often personally lament this fact.  I can barely make adobo well...I think I'll try tonight. Yum.

			<title><![CDATA[37- Does God Cause Suffering - Part 2]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we revisit the challenging question, "Does God Cause Suffering?" through observing the poetic narrative of the book of Job.  In recent weeks I have been in a discussion on Twitter regarding this topic in response to The Gospel Coalition video posted at the end of this summary, that suggests that God not only causes suffering but, ordains it.  Job is a commonly misunderstood book in it's writing style and is often used to defend the stance that God ordains evil works. We actually believe it presents a convincing counterpoint.  Enjoy! We're looking forward to your thoughts and comments below.

			<itunes:summary>In this episode we revisit the challenging question, &quot;Does God Cause Suffering?&quot; through observing the poetic narrative of the book of Job.  In recent weeks I have been in a discussion on Twitter regarding this topic in response to The Gospel Coalition video posted at the end of this summary, that suggests that God not only causes suffering but, ordains it.  Job is a commonly misunderstood book in it&apos;s writing style and is often used to defend the stance that God ordains evil works. We actually believe it presents a convincing counterpoint.  Enjoy! We&apos;re looking forward to your thoughts and comments below.

			<title><![CDATA[36 - Trump and Evangelical Inferiority Complex]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we talk about the politics of fear, again.  Recently I had tweeted "I'm glad the version of Christianity represented here will soon perish: Trump Announces Evangelical Advisory Board shar.es/1JQvI5", as a reference to the appointing of a republican supported evangelical board of advisors.  Since then, a "neutral" closed-door meeting of 1000+/- evangelicals were gathered to discuss issues with Donald Trump, and we take the time to read through some of the transcript of the items addressed.  We strongly believe someone was not represented at this gathering, and His name is Jesus.  However, strongly present in the meeting were comments of how inferior the church is, and how we need to get our "power" back, according to Trump.  Looking forward to you thoughts!

In recent weeks I have been in a discussion on Twitter regarding this topic in response to The Gospel Coalition video posted at the end of this summary, that suggests that God not only causes suffering but, ordains it.

			<title><![CDATA[34 - Orlando, Outrage, and the Lost Art of Lament]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we discuss the term of lament and it's great value in public display.  Orlando, Kenya, Chicago, and many more experienced horrific violent tragedies within the last two weeks. We felt it necessary to step back and consider how Jesus might have us pause, observe a world filled with grief and sorrow, and stand along side them and reflect that the world is a much different place for them now. And will never be the same.  Andy and I have taken the action to black out our profile images on our social media accounts as a symbol of our pause for the next 7 days in lament for these horrific events and the thousands of people it effects.  We invite you to join us if you should feel so led.  Even then, it still does not feel like that is even enough.  We hope it starts a conversation.  And a way for the church to make Jesus beautiful as we weep, stay present, and offer our time and acknowledgement for those who have lost so much in these events.  Jesus come quickly.

			<title><![CDATA[33 - Angry Jesus and Outraged Christians]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we talk about the angry Jesus and Christians who blow up the internet when something bad happens.  In a handful of episodes, Jesus is at odds with situations in which he reveals incredible solutions.  In relationship to the weekend we are deeply saddened by the events in Orlando both the mass murder at Pulse and the murder of Christina Grimmie.  We want to preface that this was recorded prior to those events, so please consider this is a conversation around anger relating beyond these events and are not limited to them.  Our prayers go out to the families and people effected by these tragic events, and hope to see Jesus' love, association, and overwhelming grace extended to those who need, patience, time to grieve and empathy in these very moments.

			<title><![CDATA[25 - How NOT to Talk to an Atheist - Guest Mark Salomon]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we feature our friend Mark Salomon, who emailed us for help after a crash and burn debate with an atheist on another podcast he was a guest on, The Pastor with No Answers (https://soundcloud.com/pastor-with-no-answers).  We'd encourage you to go and listen to both (yes, both) episodes where, unexpectedly, Mark finds himself in a debate with an atheist, and not a conversation.  We've all been there.  Mark Salomon sings for the band Stavesacre and was a leading archetype for the birth of the "Christian" punk and hardcore scene in the 80's and also hosts his own podcast, Never Was.  We also uncover really what the Ohio State colors represent for Mike.  Share and enjoy.  All links for this show are in the producer notes below.  Warning, there is mild profanity used in this episode.  Kids and Moms, EARMUFFS!

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we explore a God who disappoints everyone.  There are gaps between our moments of fulfillment, and we've bought into the informercial Jesus product that's supposed to satisfy all of our deepest needs and desires. How do we reconcile living with disappointment? We also offer the "#6 Blessing", Andy doesn't know his Bible, and Mike reminded us that hockey is not important.  We'd love your thoughts and look forward to your comments below!

This involves mentioning Christian bakers, Christian photographers, Kim Davis, and how easy it is for us to make Jesus ugly when we make our way, the Christian way.  Mike also yells at Andy again, forgetting our small office space and sensitive microphones.  Mike and Andy also attempt a Justin Beiber duet.  Prepare for disappointment.

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we blow up the myth of a soulmate.  Where did we come up with this crazy idea? It's not in the Bible. So, why has the idea of the "one just specifically designed for you" idea, permeated and driven our culture to believe such a lie?  We also expose some sinful behavior, and Justin Beiber is to blame.

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we uncover yet another, heartfelt email. "What authority does the Bible have over your (Mike Erre) life?" and "I don't hear you use the word inerrant (infallible), why is that?" are two great questions we wanted answer.  Listen, and find out the reason why I avoid the phrase biblical inerrancy. We've been raised on the phrase "The Bible Told Me So."  The question is for us though, how did it tell us so.

			<description><![CDATA[In this episode we answer a follow up email to Faith and Doubt with questions like, "How do I know the Bible is true?" and "I don't understand the Holy trinity...God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are ONE. I don't get it. So if I don't understand, than how can I say I am a believer?".  We felt compelled by this and other notes in this email and wanted to share with you our thoughts.  If you have difficulty understanding what seems easy for others to understand about the Bible, you're not alone.  And that's totally ok.  Let's talk about it.

Producer Notes*
Apologies to my fellow Anaheim Ducks fans.  I wanted to correct my comment at the end of this episode where I make claim to a winning streak.  That was not correct as we already lost that streak on New Years Eve to Vancouver.  Also, I am posting this after our game with Toronto tonight...as I furiously type this due to the nightmarish turnout of that game.  I said "We should win...it's the Maple Leafs!" #Eatingmywords  Please feel free to leave your comments below or reply to me on twitter @andy_lara.

			<title><![CDATA[5 - Was Jesus Pro Gay? And The Difficulty With LGBTQ Questions]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this week's episode we consider; Would Mike allow folks who are homosexual on a church staff or as church members?  Was Jesus Pro-Gay and what would he say? The Anaheim Ducks are winning and Andy can't help himself, and Mike writes a public statement on Gay marriage. As always, please leave your thoughts and questions in the comments below!

Read "A Statement About Gay Marriage" below:

Since we’ve started VOX The Mike Erre Podcast we’ve fielded many questions and comments in regards to the Church’s stance on Gay marriage and the LGBTQ conversation.  In the midst of this and  over the years I have begun to process a lot of these thoughts and I thought it would be appropriate to provide some more information about my stance on this topic.

I have recently been seeing an increasing number of  ‘public statements’ on this issue from communities of faith, and most of them are resoundingly negative. I wanted to try a different approach. Let me know what you think.

– Mike Erre

A Statement About Gay Marriage

Section (1)

We see Jesus of Nazareth as the supreme revealer of what God is like (Col. 1; 2; Heb. 1- seen me you have seen the father.)

Through his miracles, Jesus demonstrates compassion for the poor, the outcast and the marginalized.

Through his table fellowship, Jesus demonstrates the power of grace and acceptance of those deemed sinful and unfit by the religious authority.

Through his teaching, Jesus reveals the inner workings of the Kingdom of God: it is both now and not yet; it starts small, but is ever growing; it looks weak but is unconquerable; it brings both grace and truth to the human situation, and summons all to repentance.

Through his anger, Jesus demonstrates his disdain for heartless, graceless and self-righteous religion – religion that shows neither mercy nor compassion for those who are on the outside of community of faith.

Through his suffering, Jesus demonstrates the unbreakable power of self-sacrificial love and non-violence. He both commands and models what it means to love one’s enemies.

Through his death, Jesus takes upon himself all that is bent and wretched, opening up the possibility of redemption and forgiveness to anyone.

Through his resurrection, Jesus launches God’s future new creation in this present world; so much so that all who come to Christ in faith are called “new creation.”

Section (2)

On this basis we joyfully affirm the following:

We will prayerfully respect the prevailing law of the land and ensure our LGBTQ friends, family and neighbors have equal rights under the law.

We will prayerfully and sacrificially love our neighbors, regardless of their sexual orientation, preferences or views.

We will prayerfully and sacrificially love our enemies, regardless of their sexual orientation, preferences or views.

We will be good news people – seeking to proclaim and demonstrate the good news of Jesus by being people who are loving, kind, and compassionate.

We will continue to wrestle with the scriptures and their enduring influence and authority in our lives; acknowledging the great diversity of opinion regarding many matters of theology.

We will support the rights of communities of faith to follow their own judgments regarding matters of sexuality and marriage.

We will continue to be good neighbors, respectful citizens, and promoters of human flourishing.

We will continue to invite anyone and everyone to study the teachings of Jesus and surrender their life to him.

			<title><![CDATA[1 - Why Gay Marriage Is Good For The Church]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[We launch the VOX podcast by discussing the church’s response to the Supreme Court ruling regarding same-sex marriage and the challenge of Jesus to his followers to move beyond the polarities and politics of the “issue” and back to loving and serving people. Much of the church’s approach to the “cultural wars” is not of Jesus; a better way forward must be found.
