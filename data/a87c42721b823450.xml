      <title>Better Call Saul S:1 | E:10 Marco | Slate TV Club</title>
      <description>In the latest episode of Slate's TV Club podcast about Better Call Saul, June Thomas and Seth Stevenson recap the season finale, "Marco," reflect on the past 10 episodes, and predict what will happen in Season Two.
 
Also, Seth uses the word "telos" liberally throughout the podcast. 
 
Plus, the hosts tally up the responses to last week's listener challenges, and Seth recklessly issues a new listener challenge, despite this being the final podcast of the first season. (Oh, what the heck. Send your responses to podcasts@slate.com. They're due sometime in early 2016.)

      <title>Better Call Saul S:1 | E:9 Pimento | Slate TV Club</title>
      <description>In the latest episode of Slate's TV Club podcast about Better Call Saul, June Thomas and Seth Stevenson recap last week's listener challenge – and then arbitrarily issue two more. First, what's the significance of office suite 312? And, is that a urinal or a sink in the opening credits? Email us at podcasts@slate.com
 
Also, June and Seth eventually get around to recapping Episode Nine, "Pimento," and the major development in its final moments. Plus, Seth recounts his experience using so-called "close-in" protection services (a bodyguard, to the rest of us).

      <title>Better Call Saul S:1 | E:8 Rico | Slate TV Club</title>
      <description>In the latest episode of Slate’s TV Club podcast about Better Call Saul, June Thomas and Seth Stevenson summarize last week’s listener challenge—and issue another: If Harold’s copier code relates to the year a certain dictator rose to power, what’s the significance of Chuck’s copier code (1868)? 
June and Seth recap Episode 8, “Rico,” which contained major developments in Jimmy’s relationships with Kim, Chuck, and Harold. Later, they discuss Jimmy’s professional behavior with Nicole Hyland, a New York–based ethics attorney who’s producing a Tumblr called The Legal Ethics of Better Call Saul. 
Plus, June issues a bold prediction about the endgame for the entire series.

      <title>Better Call Saul S:1 | E:7 Bingo| Slate TV Club</title>
      <description>In the latest episode of Slate's TV Club podcast about Better Call Saul, Slate's June Thomas and Seth Stevenson rave about the scene in the corner office, a funky instrumental, and Jimmy's ongoing struggle to do the right thing. Later, the hosts try to leave an answering machine message for Saul and issue a listener challenge (identify anyone in the mugshots seen in this episode's first scene).
Plus, Seth addresses an inconsistency with the train featured in Episode Six, which inspired his rant in last week's episode.
