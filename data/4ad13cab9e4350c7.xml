What Went Wrong with DreamWorld? Pretty much everything from the start. From millions in funding to then setting up a Kickstarter, only to be exposed relentlessly online and to be labelled a scam by most. 

This is a long video but with the DreamWorld story ongoing, multiple parts are required. This video covers mostly surface level things and the story only gets deeper the more you explore.

DreamWorld is beginning to show signs of improvement at least from what we saw in the Alpha release but I will remain sceptical until they deliver on what they promised.

What Went Wrong with CodeHatch, Starforge, Reign of Kings and Heat? This is a &quot;short&quot; look into the portfolio of an indie development studio who has dropped the ball massively over the past decade. CodeHatch have been called many things, scammers, con-artists, but to me they seem incapable of making good decisions and have succeeded in abandoning every game besides Play Form: Human Dynamics.

CodeHatch, failed the following projects.

Starforge: This game had promise but only on paper, they boast a lot of experience in game development but none of it showed. Starforge released as an unforgivable, unforgettable and unfinished disaster that was so bad that it had to be taken off of Steam.

Reign of Kings: This was a fun game that a lot of people enjoyed, but was just abandoned. Left to waste by hackers due to how poorly built the game was. Reign of Kings could've been something if they stuck to it or sold it on.

Heat: This game is what happens when you copy and paste a game, hoping for the same results. Typically unoptimized and barely playable to most. This game clearly shows that they prioritise looks over substance with &quot;better&quot; graphics. Failing to see that people just wanted another RoK, not Heat.

I apologise that this isn't a What Went Wrong video but it's an announcement I had to make and I thought it was about time to give a sort of Face Reveal. 

Going full time on YouTube is a massive risk and one that I'm willing to take. It could go completely sideways but after the success of the What Went Wrong series and the community that came from it. I've decided to stay and commit to this. 

Thank you all for the support!</media:description>

Starbase started off with a promising concept but things went sideways quickly after launch. After being out for just less than a year, it now remains on life support with reduced development. Starbase does have a supportive and committed community who are welcoming enough to help new players out, but with the way that Starbase is right now, it's struggling to take hold on new players joining in for the first time.

For something that calls itself an MMO it's lacking in both players and PvE content. It is a sandbox MMO not your traditional &quot;theme park fantasy&quot; MMO. But it does have a pretty in depth ship and station building system, that is ideal for fans of engineering.

This is not a What Went Wrong video, if this was a What Went Wrong video it'll be more of a conclusion rather than a running dialogue. I hope you enjoy this new What's Wrong With series, it's less granular and more general but serves to</media:description>

What Went Wrong with Biomutant? Another not so astronomically terrible game but instead a disappointing end result for many fans. Biomutant is a Kung Fu fable set in a post apocalyptic world which is ruled by rodents. 

There is so much to do in Biomutant but a lot of it feels basic and the game overall becomes quite repetitive. Questing is most just fetch this talk to that. Combat is easy to cheese with kiting even though it's quite comprehensive with all the unique move sets to unlock. It's kind of unbalanced, you'll become too powerful early on so most of the loot you find is useless. And so on.

Is Biomutant worth it in 2022? It's not necessarily a bad game, it's just a bit lacklustre and was clearly an ambitious project from the start. I expected more from a game with a triple A price tag.

What Went Wrong with We Happy Few? Well it's not a terrible game but it suffers some odd design choices that really bring down the overall experience. The launch didn't go well and it was a massive disappointment for a lot of people who dished out triple A bucks on what is essentially an Indie game.

I found that the story was the one major thing that got me through We Happy Few. Like I say in the video, it's brilliantly voice acted and the animations are clean as hell and the plot twists were unexpected. I wish I talked more about the story in this video but I didn't want to spoil much of it because We Happy Few is worth a go if you manage to find it on a massive discount.</media:description>

This is what went wrong with Firefall, an MMO that had a lot of promise but suffered behind the scenes with an a toxic work culture, identity crisis and a CEO with questionable marketing ideas. Firefall fell due to the failure to both keep an audience but due to funding issues later down the line. Firefall was a great MMO for a short time and it'll be missed by many who had the chance to play it. 

Red 5 Studios was the company behind this game. But unfortunately Red 5 Studios was shut down shortly before Firefall was. All in all it's a shame.</media:description>

This is what went wrong with Hello Neighbor, a game that had a lot of promise at the start and hype between mid 2016 - 2017. However Hello Neighbor was not perfect. With many bugs, overly complicated puzzles and a story that's too deep for it's own good and an ending that left more people feeling confused than anything else, Hello Neighbor was doomed to be overshadowed by something else.</media:description>

Cube World had a lot of promise and gained a lot of hype, but unfortunately with developers going missing and a Steam release that nobody expected, this game flopped hard and fast.

What happened to Cube World? That's what we're having a look into today. Cube World is one of those games that took the world by storm, yet struggled through an 8 year cycle that ended with a lot of annoyed customers.

Edit: There's also a game called Veloren that is very similar to this. I'll keep an eye out for Veloren as it's free to play and seems to be made as a sign of hope for all the cube world fans. Veloren may just be the game that everyone wanted.

Ever wondered why Starforge failed? An early access game that went from bad to worse and then even worse. Starforge was created by a company called CodeHatch, well known for creating and then abandoning games such as Reign of Kings and Heat. 

Starforge was so bad that they had to remove it from Steam entirely. Games by CodeHatch have been considered scams ever since. If you look into the history of CodeHatch then you'll know why Starforge failed along with reign of kings and Heat.</media:description>

Cryptomines economy crashed, the game died and people feel scammed from this Crypto game. The crypto currency $Eternal saw a massive dump after a steady rise in value.

Cryptomines is a Play to Earn game. The game consists of you minting NFTs of workers and ships inorder to build a fleet of which you use to mine planets for profit. The reward for a successful mission is limited or set in stone and you have a chance to fail the mission meaning that you don't make any money back. 

Everything you do requires investment using their now failed crypto currency $Eternal. 

Play to Earn isn't the right word for this, Pay to Earn is.</media:description>

Are NFTs actually worthless? It seems as if they are, it's as if the only thing holding NFTs up in value is the hype surrounding them, the perceived value, which is fragile to say the least. What happens when the hype dies down?

Videos mentioned:
Why are NFTs so Ugly?: https://youtu.be/wDtt24RxdLk
What the hell are NFT's?: https://youtu.be/XwMjPWOailQ

People also have the opinion that NFTs are stupid, or dumb and I feel the same way instinctively, but only time will tell if any of that is true. Large companies are now minting NFTs like Ubisoft Quarks, McDonalds with the McRib and many more. NFTs are plaguing the gaming industry and that's something that we will need to look into in more detail.</media:description>

   <media:description>I did it, I actually watched James Corden in Camila Cabello in Cinderella 2021.

Big thanks to Noble Lucy for watching Cinderella 2021 with me.

It was painful to watch, twice... Had to remake the video nearly 3 times. The last video I did called &quot;How James Corden Went From &quot;Lovable Brit&quot; to Intolerable Brat...&quot; became a massive hit on this channel. I went into detail about James Corden became a bit of a brat.

But I did say in that video that I'd watch this film if that video got over 500 likes. Safe to say that goal was achieved.</media:description>
