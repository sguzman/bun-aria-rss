We so often think it is about feeling good, successful, or attractive. The truth is, that confidence is about trusting yourself boldly. Nicole and Ash discuss building trust within yourself and taking action from this part of your being.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are struggling to believe in yourself or are looking for ways to build upon your sense of confidence, there is something powerful in this episode for you.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get your own copy of Ashley’s new book You Turn at</span> <a href= "http://youturnbook.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">youturnbook.com</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">!</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you feel about spending versus saving money?</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a very different week! Ash switches topics up and brings on Paula Pant, the host of the Afford Anything Podcast to talk all about how to be debt-free and financially free.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The topic of money can feel really uncomfortable to talk about, but Paula’s mantra</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can afford anything, but not everything</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sparks a beautiful conversation around how to enjoy your relationship with money.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you taken the time to compare what you make, versus what you save? This gap is where the juicy opportunities for financial freedom lie. Paula and Ash talk through the various ways you can begin to grow the gap between these values and how to create consistency in your finances. And if you are an entrepreneur or small business owner unsure of how to pay yourself, here lies a path to create a stable and supportive income for yourself. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budgeting can feel restrictive and negative. But it doesn’t have to be this way! In this episode, Paula talks through her anti-budget strategy, how to enjoy saving and spend and even plan for retirement.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever feel dissociated from your physical body?</p> <p>Join Ash this week to talk through how to heal and release sexual trauma. She sits down with Julianne Vaccaro, a holistic life coach and somatic sexologist who helps women heal their trauma and get back into their bodies.</p> <p>Sexual trauma can show up in your life in a handful of ways, many being physical.  Julianne and Ash talk through indicators of suffering from trauma and practices to help you heal.  Learn not only the emotional side of trauma but also the effects sexual trauma has on your body.  There are three physical effects that occur during trauma and Julianne outlines what they each look like.  And, if you experience pain during consensual sex, listen in to learn why and how to relieve this.  </p> <p>Sex is something, with or without trauma, that we all carry certain thoughts and ideas about.

Drew destroys the flawed definition of leadership that we have been taught, insisting that we step away from evaluating our accomplishments over blocks of time, and instead narrow down leadership through the lens of our daily existence. Once we can reframe what moments of leadership are, then we can recognize that there is no such thing as a “little” impact, and we can truly understand the importance of self-respect, keeping obligations to ourselves, and recognizing our insights, experience, and knowledge as it relates to our happiness. At the end of the interview, Drew shares a clear set of questions you can ask yourself each day so that when the future arrives, you will be the type of person you want to be.</p> <p class="p1"><strong>LINKS:</strong> </p> <p class="p1">Drew’s website: <a href= "http://www.drewdudley.com/"><span class= "s1">www.drewdudley.com</span></a>  </p> <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Drew’s Book: <a href= "https://amzn.to/2ytiwsu"><span class="s3">This is Day One – A Practical Guide To Leadership That Matters</span></a> </span></p> <p class="p1">Follow Drew on Instagram & Twitter: @dayonedrew </p> <p class="p2"><span class="s2"><strong>Book Mentioned:</strong> <a href= "https://amzn.to/2CYKb8z"><span class="s3">“Turning Pro” by Steven Pressfield</span></a> </span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever grapple with the sense of being purposeless when it comes to your career? It’s the biggest challenge people face at work, and it comes from not knowing how to truly find your spark. On this episode of the You Turn podcast, author and founder of The Good Life Jonathan Fields teaches you how to find that spark, and how to discover your purpose and what drives you. There is a pretty small set of fundamental drivers that are universal to most people, and they can be found by looking deeper, asking bigger questions, and getting more connected to yourself through awareness.
