    <copyright></copyright>
    <description>An unlikely conversation at a birthday party sends two friends on a madcap quest to find out if a salacious sports rumor is true. As their investigation circles the legacies of baseball Hall of Famer, Cal Ripken, Jr., and Hollywood legend, Kevin Costner, they find themselves re-examining their deepest-held beliefs about belonging, believing, and what makes a hero. While the truth proves more elusive than a well-thrown knuckleball, one thing is certain: their lives will never be the same.</description>

      <title>The Four Keys</title>
      <description>Fresh off a bizarre convo with the guy who designed the electrical system at Oriole Park, Sam and Mac reach some other guys who were charged with fixing the tower power the night of the outage. And with the clock ticking on their investigation (yes, we know there's no clock in baseball), Mac and Sam light out for the Pacific Northwest to get the Seattle side of the story. While tangling with the memories of a wild pre-rumor brawl, they hear a new theory about August 14, 1997.

      <title>The Old Box</title>
      <description>To finally uncover why exactly the lights went out that fateful summer night in Baltimore, Sam and Mac search deeper, down in the basement of Oriole Park at Camden Yards. There, the ballpark’s head electrician gives them a tour of the elaborate system that keeps the lights on—and turns them off. Feeling as much like invaders as investigators, Sam and Mac learn who had access to the lighting controls back in 1997, and they stumble upon a key detail in the case.

      <description>Sam and Mac go around the horn with three of Cal’s teammates who were there the night everything went down—especially the lights. And they obsessively scrutinize an intriguing piece of evidence from Oriole Park on August 14th, 1997. Does it contain definitive proof of an elaborate conspiracy? Or will obsessively examining it finally unravel Sam and Mac’s already-tenuous grip on reality?
