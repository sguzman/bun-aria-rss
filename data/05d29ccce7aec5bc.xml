      <itunes:title>Fast-Tracking Your Kids To Financial Success #587</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Most Americans didn’t have an inkling about Formula 1 racing for most of its existence, <em>until</em> the Netflix show Drive to Survive came along. It’s amazing what a docuseries can do for a sport that was typically relegated to Europe! But an interesting thing about F1 is that the driver with the fastest lap time in trials the day before gets the pole position which is the best starting position at the beginning of the actual race. It turns out that the driver who gets that crucial advantage right out of the gate wins more than 42% of the time. Where you start matters! And similarly we think there is a <em>massive</em> advantage gained in life when kids have the basics of financial literacy as tools and lessons that they can draw on from a young age. Not only will their wealth compound over the years but so will their knowledge and the positive behaviors that they build upon. Listen as we discuss a number of lessons you can implement now, the behavior you’ll model, and the accounts you can open in order to fast-track your kids to financial success.</p>

      <itunes:title>Dying Destitute: Should You Spend All Your Money Before You Die? #584</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The fact that money is so <em>measurable</em> is both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing because your budget, your salary, how much you have set aside in investment accounts- basically all dollar amounts in your life are very quantifiable. And because of that it’s not difficult to make some tweaks in order to see some movement with your net worth. Awesome! But at the same time it’s a curse- <em>because</em> these are measurements that are so readily available, we can often overly rely on these numbers to let us know how we’re doing in life. If you’re overly focused on the numbers and if your life satisfaction is purely determined by how much you’ve got in the bank, then we’d argue that you’re incorrectly using your wealth as the main measurement of life satisfaction. So hear us out: the argument we’re putting forth today is that maybe we should all consider dying destitute! We discuss some great reasons to consider spending all your money, how to spend your money in a way that brings you the most joy and happiness, whether you should give money away before or after you die, and some thoughts on leaving money to your kids.</p>

      <title>Is Crypto Going Extinct? with Stacy-Marie Ishmael #583</title>
      <itunes:title>Is Crypto Going Extinct? with Stacy-Marie Ishmael #583</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There’s a decent chance that during the pandemic and the ensuing months, that you were stuck at home with some extra cash on hand, but with no way to spend that money. So you got into crypto- and unfortunately, there’s a very good chance that your holdings are worth much less and you might be a little concerned. And you’re not alone because a recent Bankrate survey showed that only about 30% of millennials are comfortable investing in crypto which is down from 50% a year ago. There’s just not as much confidence and excitement as there used to be and so we’re excited to be joined by Stacy-Marie Ishmael. For years Stacy used to work at the Financial Times where she started the blog Alphaville, she’s worked as a senior editor at Apple, and now she’s a writer &amp; podcaster at Bloomberg where she dedicates nearly all of her time to cryptocurrencies. Listen as we discuss why crypto exploded the way that it did in recent years and why everyone thought it was going to the moon, why crypto hasn’t acted as an investing hedge, why countries are struggling to implement it as their national currency, and what the future holds in the realm of crypto!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We’re glad Ikea exists. The ability for a vast majority of the population to get their hands on some incredibly functional, well designed, and affordable furniture is a good thing. But, you’re also unlikely to pass Ikea furniture down to your kids or for that matter, use it for more than a handful of years. Compare that to a campaign dresser from the 1800s! It’s true that they don’t make them like they used to. The same is true when it comes to modern financial advice. There’s a lot of ‘wisdom’ floating around out there that is self-serving at best, and deceptive and predatory at worst. So in today’s episode we pull some ancient wisdom from the Bible, Stoicism, and other wisdom traditions from hundreds to thousands of years before our time. Then we connect that ancient wisdom to our modern times to help you to determine what you should be doing with your money.</p>

      <title>Biking is a Money &amp; Life Hack #578</title>
      <itunes:title>Biking is a Money &amp; Life Hack #578</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“Spend less than you make.” This is a maxim that is not only true but, if followed, will allow you to accomplish so many other goals that you might have in life. It’s a foundational concept. Similarly, we also think the same can be said for biking. Get this one thing right in your life- pedal your way to wherever you need to go, and so many other aspects of life will automatically fall into place. And we’ve actually been able to put our commitment to biking to the test since we’ve moved out of the city- you might be surprised to hear the results! Listen as we discuss the many different reasons we believe biking is a money and life hack, the positive impacts on our health, communities, and environment. And we also touch on how you can make biking more accessible in your community as well as how you can get started, even if you haven’t ridden a bike since you were eleven!</p>

And we also touch on how you can make biking more accessible in your community as well as how you can get started, even if you haven’t ridden a bike since you were eleven!</p>

      <title>Buying Existing Businesses to Make Millions with Codie Sanchez #577</title>
      <itunes:title>Buying Existing Businesses to Make Millions with Codie Sanchez #577</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We’re pumped to talk with entrepreneur extraordinaire Codie Sanchez today. And while Codie is busy buying businesses today, the truth is, it took her a while to get there. Years ago, right out of college, Codie was working 70-hour weeks for a paycheck. And even though she had a great education and an elite job, she felt like her life was out of control. Who cares about prestigious job titles when somebody else controls your day to day?! Now, things are different: Codie is financially independent, she owns 26 small businesses, and she’s the founder and CEO of Contrarian Thinking- where she’s on a mission to free the minds of individuals who are hanging onto traditional careers, as well as the common narrative of what it means to be successful. And oftentimes this can be accomplished via buying existing businesses- which is more feasible than you might think! Listen as we discuss life as a second generation immigrant, why Codie believes we’re in a golden era of acquiring others businesses, ways to go about finding a business to buy, her views on passive income, what it means to utilize your ‘unfair advantage’, when she’d consider selling a business, and much more!</p>

      <itunes:title>Responding to Rate-Hike Hysteria #575</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Whether you like it or not, higher interest rates are going to have an impact on your money! We liken it to the first Lord of the Rings book, the Fellowship of the Ring. Frodo was living large in the Shire- it seemed he was going to be the new heir of his uncle’s comfortable Hobbit-hole. He had no worries at all. That is until Gandalf showed up and turned Frodo’s world upside down. Gandalf explained how an evil force was on the move and that they were no longer safe. Well simply put, rising interest rates also have as wide an impact on our economy! Have a listen as we discuss the Overnight Federal Funds Rate and examples of changing rates in recent history. But then we also get into the ramifications of these rate hikes on our ability to earn, spend, save, and invest.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you like it or not, higher interest rates are going to have an impact on your money! We liken it to the first Lord of the Rings book, the Fellowship of the Ring. Frodo was living large in the Shire- it seemed he was going to be the new heir of his uncle’s comfortable Hobbit-hole. He had no worries at all. That is until Gandalf showed up and turned Frodo’s world upside down. Gandalf explained how an evil force was on the move and that they were no longer safe. Well simply put, rising interest rates also have as wide an impact on our economy! Have a listen as we discuss the Overnight Federal Funds Rate and examples of changing rates in recent history. But then we also get into the ramifications of these rate hikes on our ability to earn, spend, save, and invest.</p>

      <itunes:title>EOY Deadlines: Reduce Your Taxes &amp; Maximize Your Money #572</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>With all that we’re trying to accomplish in our everyday lives- we find that reminders are a necessity. For instance, your car’s low gas indicator light that flares up when you’re nearing an empty tank. More power to ya if you’re driving an EV (see what I did there…), but for the rest of us still driving internal combustion vehicles, the low fuel light is a life saver. When it comes on, you know you only have so many miles left to find a gas station before you’re going to end up stranded on the side of the road. Well this episode is here to function similarly to that low fuel light, as kind of a warning because you’ve only got 3 months left in 2022. You can use them to your advantage and attain some of the financial goals you set out to achieve in January. Or you can attempt to coast into 2023 running on fumes. There are some hard and fast deadlines approaching and once that window of time closes, there’s no going back. Today we’re talking about student loans, workplace benefits, taxes, retirement savings, and more so listen up- the clock is ticking!</p>

      <itunes:title>Jet-Setting for Little to No Money with The Points Guy Brian Kelly #571</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Brian Kelly, The Points Guy himself, is joining us today on the podcast! If you’ve ever attempted some research on airline miles or credit card reward points, then there’s a good chance you’ve read an article or two over at ThePointsGuy.com. Bryan has an entire staff of writers who are all travel experts- from offices in Austin, to NY, all the way over to London. Which of course frees Bryan up to be able to spend even more of his time participating in his favorite activity- traveling. Listen as Brian shares why he’s willing to pay annual fees on 25 credit cards, what you should do if you have existing airline points, what he thinks about cashback credit cards, how to maximize the number of points you can earn, his favorite perks and benefits of travel cards, and finally his thoughts on traveling with a new baby!</p>

      <itunes:title>Achieving Balance In a World of Work Domination #569</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Up until the 1500s, everybody thought that the earth was the center of the universe- the sun, moon, and planets all orbited around <em>us</em>. But over the course of a century as more folks accepted the belief that we are a part of a heliocentric solar system, this updated view significantly changed everyone’s perception of planet Earth. No longer were we at the center of it all! Our planet Earth is still important of course, but everyone began to see that we were a part of a larger system. We were put in our proper place. And similarly we feel that work and career tends to be at the center of the <em>American</em> universe, negatively impacting our lives via workaholism, lack of other interests, and higher levels of stress. Not that work can’t be fulfilling! We’ve always held a high view of work- it provides a sense of meaning and structure, not to mention a necessary source of income. But when our lives <em>revolve</em> around work, when it’s the center, we think it throws everything out of balance. Listen as we discuss the many reasons why work dominates our lives, as well as how you can find more work-life balance!</p>

<p>3 - What interest am I forfeiting if I pull money out of my I bonds early?</p>
<p>4 - When buying solar, am I just exchanging a loan payment for my monthly electricity bill?</p>
<p>5 - I’d like to be a long-distance landlord- is that a wise move and what else should I keep in mind?</p>

      <itunes:title>Strategic Debt Use To Catapult Your Finances #566</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Some folks will <em>swear</em> that taking a nap is bad for you. “It’ll throw off your circadian rhythm!” or “You’re being lazy- maybe it’s time to be more productive with your time!”. And of course, like many things in life, you could take it too far. For instance taking a nap while your friends are visiting or climbing in bed for 3 hours in the middle of the day will likely lead to poor outcomes- there will be negative downstream effects. But the reality is that a well-timed nap <em>can</em> bring a lot of benefits for many folks- it can boost your memory, increase your job performance, and ease your stress levels. Well, in the same way that naps are misunderstood, so is debt. Indiscriminate use of naps <em>or</em> debt could easily create a mess. But the strategic use of debt is an incredibly nuanced topic that we’re venturing into. Today we discuss how you can determine if you’re using debt strategically by looking at your finances holistically, how folks use debt as a crutch, why it’s important to understand opportunity cost, evaluating your own personal debt tolerance, and much more!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the same way that being able to read is a critical component of learning and furthering your education, budgeting is essential to managing your money well and building wealth. It’s foundational! And that’s why we’re pumped to have Sarah Wilson joining us on the podcast today. Today we discuss why the Budget Girl started publishing her own budget for the entire internet to see, how granular you should be getting with your budget, as well as some of the lowest hanging fruit everyone should consider. And we also hear how Sarah paid off all of her student loans in just 3 years on a meager income, her foray into house hacking, charging her boyfriend rent, the future of her very successful site and YouTube channel, plus a bunch of other topics as well!</p>

      <itunes:title>The Key Characteristics of Great Investors #563</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There’s been a massive proliferation of micro-transportation devices in recent years. Everything from Segways and electric skateboards to Onewheels and e-scooters. But as cool as some of those futuristic devices are, none of them hold a candle to the ultimate classic- the bicycle. Advances in technology have made bikes lighter, safer, and easier to repair, but the basic bicycle remains unchanged and is still the most affordable and dependable personal transportation device. And we’ve seen similar changes when it comes to what it means to be an investor. There really are a ton of crappy investments out there <em>and</em> the spread of not-so-awesome investment advice has been on the rise as well. It’s a constantly changing space and there are a wider range of options available as well as ‘gurus’ telling us how we should be investing. These fancy options can throw us off our game and so we wanted to make sure that you’re able to cultivate and embody the characteristics of a great investor so that you’ll be able to make wise decisions with your investments.</p>

      <itunes:title>Subtle Marketing Maneuvers That Stymie Your Money Momentum #560</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><em>How</em> something is communicated to us can have a major impact on the reception of that idea. For instance, Joel’s wife has been known to offer great advice to him over the years- but he often only comes around when a friend makes a similar remark! He suddenly sees the light because even though the advice is the same, the context is different. It’s only then that he takes action. And similar patterns emerge when it comes to our susceptibility to advertising and marketing. Our subconscious often coalesces to marketing tactics that we tend to think we’re impervious to. We’re not quite as rational as we think we are, and those marketing tricks often nudge us towards buying things we don’t need and spending money we hadn’t planned on parting with. So listen as we identify some of these marketing maneuvers and the steps you can take to avoid becoming a mindless consumer.</p>

      <itunes:title>Tackling Personal Finance with NFL Linebacker Brandon Copeland #559</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest today, Brandon Copeland is an NFL player, but he’s also so much more than that. He most recently played for our local team, the Atlanta Falcons, last season but he’s won the Alan Page award for community service and we find his off-the-field activities even more fascinating. He runs a non-profit football camp called Beyond the Basics that not only teaches kids the technical skills of being a great football player, but also helps them to reach their full potential off of the field as well. He has a financial literacy course called Life 101 that he teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. He has a couple of real estate companies that he runs with his wife as well- it’s safe to say that Brandon is truly an entrepreneur! We talk about personal finances in the NFL, resisting the cultural pull to consume, setting our kids up for success, and much more in today’s episode.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our guest today, Brandon Copeland is an NFL player, but he’s also so much more than that. He most recently played for our local team, the Atlanta Falcons, last season but he’s won the Alan Page award for community service and we find his off-the-field activities even more fascinating. He runs a non-profit football camp called Beyond the Basics that not only teaches kids the technical skills of being a great football player, but also helps them to reach their full potential off of the field as well. He has a financial literacy course called Life 101 that he teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. He has a couple of real estate companies that he runs with his wife as well- it’s safe to say that Brandon is truly an entrepreneur! We talk about personal finances in the NFL, resisting the cultural pull to consume, setting our kids up for success, and much more in today’s episode.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Gen Z listeners might not get this reference, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Gladiators_(1989_TV_series)">American Gladiators</a> in the early 90s was the original American Ninja Warrior. The show was a series of events where a couple of really fit young folks would compete through a number of obstacles to win a cash prize. The only thing standing in their way? A roster of some incredibly ripped athletes who just wanted to punish you. The gladiators were literally slamming you down or jousting you off a raised pedestal- they were the biggest obstacles the competitors faced. And similarly, there are money obstacles that pop up out of nowhere that knock the wind out of our finances. Some obstacles are more external like the influence of our friends or unplanned expenses, but others are internal like a short-sightedness we might have towards our money or a lack of knowledge. So we’re going to spend this episode running through some of the different obstacles that are attempting to derail you on your path to financial freedom- and specifically, what to do about them.</p>

      <itunes:title>Negotiation as a Winning Everyday Tactic #554</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>A couple years ago Matt got really into tracking his time for an entire year. Virtually every minute, there was an app running in the background as he was cataloging how he was spending his hours- all in an attempt to better utilize his time. And while 99% of folks will think that’s completely insane, they’ll likely admit that there might be some serious benefits to managing their time more efficiently. Similarly, we’re here to argue that negotiating is something that can benefit you regardless of what stage of life you’re in- whether you’re a student, a stay-at-home parent, or a CEO. Unfortunately there are a few misconceptions about negotiating that we’re going to tackle. But then we’ll go through a number of different factors to keep in mind that are going to make you a more effective negotiator in your day-to-day life. Factors like market research, your tone and non-verbals, the role of emotion during an interaction, and plenty more that’ll help you to earn more and spend less.</p>

      <title>Ratcheting Up Your Risk Tolerance with Allison Schrager #553</title>
      <itunes:title>Ratcheting Up Your Risk Tolerance with Allison Schrager #553</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We’re getting a little nerdy on the show today with Allison Schrager who is our favorite author on the subject of risk. She’s an economist, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a columnist at Bloomberg Opinion, and co-founder of LifeCycle Finance Partners which is a risk advisory firm. Allison has had a varied career from working in finance, policy, and media with her byline often appearing in many different publications like the Economist and Wired. She’s also written a book, “An Economist Walks into a Brothel: And Other Unexpected Places to Understand Risk” that we’re diving into as well. And we’re going to discuss what risk looks like in our world today- how we should be interpreting it as individuals, as investors, and whether we should be exposing ourselves to more risk in a world that seems obsessed with the pursuit of safetyism.</p>

      <itunes:title>Is It a Terrible Time to Buy a Home? #551</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>They say that timing is everything. For example, Nascar and F1 drivers need perfect timing in order to make a move and pass their competition. An ill-timed attempt can result in falling further behind, or even worse, in a crash that takes you out of the race completely. Well, the housing market has been shaken up in a big way as prices have risen substantially and now higher rates are making things <em>even more</em> unaffordable. That being said, the market is beginning to feel like it’s stalling out and maybe even correcting- though we would be pretty shocked if the current market oddities ended up in something resembling the 2008 crash. But there’s still a lot of uncertainty when it comes to the housing market. If you were making offers last year and missing out consistently, is now the time for you to finally be able to buy? During this episode we talk about timing the housing market, what the current market conditions look like, how you should be thinking about the rent vs buy debate, as well as some practical steps that you should take if you determine that you <em>are</em> ready to buy a home.</p>

      <title>Is College For Dummies? #548</title>
      <itunes:title>Is College For Dummies? #548</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Now we know that baseball is America’s pastime, but is there any other sport that is more ingrained in our culture than football? And is there anything more wholesome than parents encouraging their kids to play football in order to learn teamwork, develop their athletic prowess, and develop friendships while having a great time? That may have been true 30 years ago, but the rise of CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) has given parents pause as we’re now seeing something close to 35% fewer kids playing the sport now than played 10-15 years ago. The value proposition has changed as we’ve learned what the longer-term impacts of all of those hits to the head means for athletes.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now we know that baseball is America’s pastime, but is there any other sport that is more ingrained in our culture than football? And is there anything more wholesome than parents encouraging their kids to play football in order to learn teamwork, develop their athletic prowess, and develop friendships while having a great time? That may have been true 30 years ago, but the rise of CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) has given parents pause as we’re now seeing something close to 35% fewer kids playing the sport now than played 10-15 years ago. The value proposition has changed as we’ve learned what the longer-term impacts of all of those hits to the head means for athletes. Well we believe the same thing is true when it comes to higher education. Due to the higher costs of college, the massive student loan burden, and other false assumptions about going to college, we want all high school grads to think long and hard about whether college is the right choice for them. Listen as we discuss the factors to consider to maximize your ROI of attending college, some great alternatives to going straight from senior year to a university, and then some questions to ask yourself to help you decide.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the episode you need to listen to if you’ve been making excuses for not getting into real estate investing. Our interview today is with Brandon Turner who quite literally wrote the book on investing in real estate.

He was also a former host of the Bigger Pockets podcast with over 100 million downloads and of course that’s a show that’s all about real estate. And today our conversation covers Brandon’s story- how he first got into real estate, how as an entrepreneur he keeps work from overtaking his life, how you can choose an investing strategy, how you should approach cash flow vs appreciation, what to do about current housing market conditions, if being a landlord is ethical, and more!</p>

      <itunes:title>The Middle Class is Shrinking: What That Means for You! #545</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We, as human beings, avoid pain. Nobody likes to break their collarbone while snowboarding, cut their finger while chopping up some veggies, or even stub their toe on the leg of the high chair. And of course that immediate pain communicates to us that something is wrong- it keeps us from further hurting ourselves. But then oftentimes there is some inflammation or swelling that occurs after the fact. And that’s not a sign that you’re hurting yourself, but it can actually be the first steps that your body is taking in order to heal your injury. So in a way that ongoing pain from any swelling could be seen as a good thing! Though uncomfortable, it can be a sign of forward-looking health. And similarly, we’re attempting to take a more positive approach to what seems like the disconcerting problem of a shrinking middle class. We actually think there is more good than bad happening with a middle class that seems to be hollowing out. Listen to find out why this seems like a bad trend at first glance, who has been climbing the financial ranks, who is actually considered ‘rich’, what this means for you, and then finally what you can do to get ahead with your finances.</p>

      <itunes:title>Streaming Sucks! Eliminating Expenses as Costs Creep Up #542</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We talk a lot about finding free stuff on the side of the road, in HTM parlance, curb alerts! It’s a great way to reduce waste and save money if you’re able to find something that you’re needing, and it just so happens to be sitting there on the curb for you. But if you find yourself driving around town for a few hours every night after work in hopes that folks have abandoned a neat tchotchke that you may or may not actually need, then you might be dedicating too much time to the pursuit of free stuff. Similarly, streaming subscriptions can be a wonderful thing- they’ve been able to deliver some amazing content to hundreds of millions of people. But if you have too many streaming companies set to autopay, not only is it consistently draining money from your bank account but it’s also stealing your most limited resource- your time. Listen as we tackle why it is we stream in the first place, how to cut the cost of streaming, how to stream for free, and contemplate what else you could be spending your time doing as we challenge ourselves to spend less time on the couch to begin with!</p>

      <itunes:title>Living Life with the End in Mind with Jordan Grumet #541</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>For a certain subset of HTM listeners, it might be easy to not see the forest for the trees. You might naturally be drawn to the finer details of personal finance like expense ratios and Excel formulas in an attempt to ensure that you’re living the most efficient and optimized life that you possibly can. But, that’s when the subtle shift can take place. That’s when the <em>means</em> to the end begins to overshadow the actual end, which for many is to simply live a good and happy life. Instead, we should live our lives with the end in mind and that’s why we’re talking with Dr. Jordan Grumet, also known as Doc G. Jordan was an internal medicine physician when he discovered the personal finance community. Since then he started an award winning podcast and is now the author of Taking Stock: A Hospice Doctor's Advice on Financial Independence, Building Wealth, and Living a Regret-Free Life, which will be published in a couple of weeks. Listen as we discuss meaningful work, resisting the traditional American work culture, what it takes to set priorities in life, and much more!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>A friend of ours writes a daily newsletter, and he recently featured a 74 year old named Paul who has lived inside of an iron lung since he was six years old. Paul was completely paralyzed due to polio from the neck down, and his disability means a life that most of us could barely imagine. But that didn’t stop Paul from achieving many goals over his lifetime- he taught himself to write with a pen in his mouth, he earned a college degree, and even went on to become a lawyer! We share this to highlight that there are a number of factors outside our control, and we should instead focus our energy on the things that we do have control over. There’s little that we can do when it comes to the economy, recessions, and inflation. But we do have a say over our personal finances- the financial foundation we build for ourselves, the money we spend, the money we invest, and the ways that we ensure a healthy and steady income. Listen as we cover all of that and more during this episode!</p>

      <itunes:title>Fractured FIRE: Early Retirement, Not So Hot Right Now! #536</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Some things <em>sound</em> really good... until they aren&rsquo;t. Like when your kids say they&rsquo;re going to spend all of their money at the candy store and how they&rsquo;re going to eat ice cream every night of the week. Sure that sounds tempting now, but the reality isn&rsquo;t quite as rosy. As you grow older you realize that there are constraints that prevent you from a diet like that- namely the health issues that would arise! We think that something similar is happening to the Financial Independence Retire Early movement. An idea that sounds really compelling when the market is kicking butt doesn&rsquo;t feel the same once a bear market has ravaged those early retirement portfolios. Not to mention that with inflation on the rise, your dollars aren&rsquo;t getting you quite as far as they used to! So we offer a few alternatives to those who are striving after early retirement, how we would recommend that you think about your work and career, and then we highlight why we think the FIRE movement still has its merits.</p>

      <itunes:title>Becoming a Financial Samurai with Sam Dogen #535</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Happy Independence Day! We’re marking the occasion by talking with Sam Dogen- one of the pioneers of the Financial Independence Retire Early movement. Sam is the founder of Financial Samurai which he founded over 10 years ago. He retired at age 34 after a career at Goldman Sachs, but then came out of retirement as retired life was a bit too boring for him! He has written over 2,100 articles at his site and now his new book “Buy This, Not That” is about to be released very soon which is an excellent guide on how you can optimize your money to build wealth and live life on your own terms. During this episode we talk about why Sam isn’t a huge fan of the 25x rule, maximizing your earning potential, engineering a layoff- we’re excited to talk about all of that and more today!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Daily Serving by Trillium- and thanks again to Sean for sending this one our way!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You can&rsquo;t escape summer! Whether you&rsquo;re baking under the sun at your local pool on the weekends, or setting off on adventures with your kids during their summer break, the changing season and warmer temperatures signal that it&rsquo;s summer break. Just like summer impacts basically everyone, so does the price of a gallon of gas increasing at a previously unseen rate. Even electric vehicle owners aren&rsquo;t immune to the rising prices- though there&rsquo;s gotta be a palpable sense of relief every time you plug your car in! The US crossed the $5 a gallon threshold a couple weeks ago and who knows where the prices are headed from here?! But we&rsquo;ll talk about why gas prices are unrelenting right now, we&rsquo;ll share some of our thoughts on fossil fuels in general, and then we&rsquo;ll the majority of this episode talking through the many steps you can take to lessen the pain you&rsquo;re experiencing at the pump.</p>

      <itunes:title>It’s Not JUST Inflation: Defying Higher Prices in Your Life #527</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s an understatement to say that the political discourse in our country is a mess! And the problem isn&rsquo;t that you just disagree- that you think someone on the other side of the political aisle has the wrong opinion. That&rsquo;s certainly a part of it, but the major political issues of the day that Americans are rightly discussing require patience and a nuanced understanding of different ideas to make progress. Instead, we have anonymous accounts on social media, partisan media, divisive rhetoric from leaders, and the pandemic which further polarized the political divide. All are factors that have contributed to politics being a hot button topic. Similarly, it&rsquo;s not <em>just </em>inflation that&rsquo;s causing everything to feel like it&rsquo;s costing us more money- that our dollars aren&rsquo;t getting us through to the end of the month. Inflation is a major culprit and we&rsquo;ll definitely talk more about that today. But there are some other factors as well and we think by zooming out and looking at the entire picture, that we&rsquo;ll be able to better understand the many different reasons that everything seems to cost us more than it used to. And then we&rsquo;ll share what steps we can begin to immediately implement in order to start defying these higher prices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 - How detailed should we get with our monthly budget - should we break out individual items on receipts?</p>
<p>2 - What kind of pre-tax-post-tax balance should I strike when contributing to retirement accounts?</p>
<p>3 - Should I seek higher returns by investing more into my side business?</p>
<p>4 - For my retirement - should I continue building up towards my state pension or switch to a 401k with a match?</p>
<p>5 - Is it a good idea to tap equity in my current home for a down payment on an investment property?</p>

      <itunes:title>Going Minimalist To Save More w/ Joshua Becker (Bestie Ep) #525</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard about the minimalist lifestyle- maybe you&rsquo;re picturing a bearded hipster drinking coffee in his perfectly white dining room or an Instagram worthy, perfectly styled modern kitchen. It turns out that&rsquo;s <em>not</em> what minimalism is all about- it&rsquo;s about priorities. We felt that that summer is a great time to hit reset on a number of things in life, including the vast amount of clutter that many of us surround ourselves with. Here to talk with us today about minimalist living is Joshua Becker. While beginning the process of removing possessions from his life, Joshua started the site Becoming Minimalist and has written several fantastic books over the years including The More of Less<strong>, </strong>The Minimalist Home, as well as the recently published Things That Matter. Not only can a minimalist approach to life allow us to spend less and save or invest more, but it can have a positive impact in lots of areas of our life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this episode we enjoyed an I Feel It All by Monday Night Brewing! And as we ramp up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!

      <itunes:title>We’re Moving! Our Advice For Finding A Great Place To Live #524</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Think back to when you were a kid- can you remember an instance where you asked your parents a question, and instead of explaining the actual answer, they just said &ldquo;Because I said so&rdquo;. How frustrating! Or maybe in middle school you were horrified to even be seen with your folks in public because of something they were wearing. You&rsquo;d say to yourself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never going to be like parents!&rdquo;. Well that was us to a T, and we always thought we&rsquo;d be intown city dwellers. Well times have changed and so we&rsquo;ll share why it is that we&rsquo;re moving (yes&hellip; both of our families!), but we realized this is also an incredibly relevant topic for a lot of folks out there. Of course housing is everyone&rsquo;s top expense, but there are many reasons why moving is top of mind for a large percentage of Americans. Listen as we discuss a healthy framework and factors to consider when you&rsquo;re debating a move. Not only financial considerations like cost of living and increasing your earning potential, but also lifestyle considerations like relationships and schools. And we&rsquo;ll also leave you with a few tips to help ensure you&rsquo;re making this move without breaking the bank.</p>

      <itunes:title>Cashing Out To Build Wealth On Your Own Terms with Julien &amp; Kiersten Saunders #523</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re joined by fellow Atlantans- our friends Julien &amp; Kiersten Saunders! They started their site Rich &amp; Regular back in 2017 after they threw themselves into the financial independence movement and paid off $200,000 in debt. They&rsquo;ve been featured virtually everywhere- the Times, the Atlantic, Bloomberg. They&rsquo;re successful speakers, created a fantastic Youtube series called Money on the Table, and now they&rsquo;re about to be published authors! Their book &ldquo;Cashing Out: Win the Wealth Game by Walking Away&rdquo; comes out next week. In the book they write about creating your own career path, making peace with your finances, and building wealth on your own terms. During this interview we discuss Julien &amp; Kiersten&rsquo;s introduction to the FIRE movement, avoiding imposter syndrome when creating content, and how to actually know if it&rsquo;s time to cash out by quitting your job.</p>

      <itunes:title>Friday Flight - Perpetual Quitting, A Second Hand Surge, &amp; Debt Management Plans #522</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Time for our Friday Flight! These episodes are a sampling of the week&rsquo;s financial news and the impact on your personal finances. There are a lot of headlines out there, but we distill it down to specific takeaways that will allow you to kick off the weekend informed and help you to continue to make smart money moves. In this episode we cover some relevant and helpful stories like: perpetual quitting, the second hand surge, stepping away from social media and work, going prairie style to combat higher water bills, why a master&rsquo;s degree can lead to a negative return on investment, avoiding crapcoins as payment for anything, fighting back against shrinkflation, and debt management plans.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time for our Friday Flight! These episodes are a sampling of the week&rsquo;s financial news and the impact on your personal finances. There are a lot of headlines out there, but we distill it down to specific takeaways that will allow you to kick off the weekend informed and help you to continue to make smart money moves. In this episode we cover some relevant and helpful stories like: perpetual quitting, the second hand surge, stepping away from social media and work, going prairie style to combat higher water bills, why a master&rsquo;s degree can lead to a negative return on investment, avoiding crapcoins as payment for anything, fighting back against shrinkflation, and debt management plans.</p>

      <itunes:title>Is The Stock Market Broken? #521</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine hopping on a flight to visit your parents on the other side of the world. You don&rsquo;t avoid flying by plane because there&rsquo;s likely going to be some turbulence- a few rough patches are to be expected. You take advantage of the modern marvel of a transatlantic flight and you go and see your family! Similarly, the stock market is the greatest wealth creating machine in history- it&rsquo;s amazing! Investing in the market to achieve millionaire status has become possible for a much wider swath of folks but the path comes with its fair share of corrections and bear markets. To go back to the analogy- what if it's starting to look like air travel is no longer safe? You start to consider that upcoming flight! Sure, we&rsquo;re seeing some market volatility now but future market predictions aren&rsquo;t looking all that rosy either. Is it time to consider pulling out of the market? During this episode we&rsquo;ll discuss why the market saw massive gains over the past 2 years, why we&rsquo;re optimistic about the future of the stock market, what you should be doing if we experience a future of weak returns, and how you should be investing regardless of what&rsquo;s going on with the stock market.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The CDC definition of a parasite is: an organism that lives on or in a host and gets its food from or at the expense of its host. They&rsquo;re not necessarily out there to completely destroy you- at least not immediately. Instead they want you to go on living your life, so that they can leach as much as they can while they get fat and happy, hopefully without you even noticing. And that&rsquo;s exactly how we feel about crappy financial products except they&rsquo;re not feasting on your blood, they&rsquo;re feasting on your dollars. Their ability to thrive comes at your expense and it&rsquo;s abundantly clear that these crappy financial products don&rsquo;t have your best interest in mind. So today we&rsquo;re going to run through a number of the worst culprits out there, why they&rsquo;re the worst, and then what you can do in order to make sure that you avoid getting fleeced.</p>

      <itunes:title>Why You Need a Money Coach in Your Corner with Ericka Young #517</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s time to get your financial butt in shape! Our guest today, Ericka Young, is the financial coach that <em>she</em> never had! As a newlywed couple, Ericka and her husband discovered that it&rsquo;s actually pretty easy to become just like the average US household that now has over $150,000 in debt. It&rsquo;s the norm and if you don&rsquo;t have a plan to avoid debt, you will likely find yourself falling into that trap! But that&rsquo;s <em>not</em> the path that Ericka continued along- she was determined to change her family tree, and now helps others who are seeking financial freedom in their lives. Ericka started her company, Tailor-Made Budgets where she creates custom plans for her clients that give them the tools and the knowledge to cut their stress levels by <em>increasing</em> their savings and <em>decreasing</em> their debt. We get to hear Ericka&rsquo;s debt story, how she was able to leave a high paying engineering job, signs that someone might need a financial coach, what it looks like to face your financial reality, how she helps her clients think through making trade-offs, and why friends may not be enough of an accountability partner.</p>

      <title>The Nasty Debt Comeback &amp; How To Counter It #515</title>
      <itunes:title>The Nasty Debt Comeback &amp; How To Counter It #515</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Everyone loves a good comeback story- exceeept when it&rsquo;s the villain who is making the comeback! That's basically how we feel about the mullet. We can all pretty much agree that mullets are the most villainous hairstyle. It had its heyday back in the 80s and is now back in full-business-in-the-front-party-in-the-back-force. Similarly, that&rsquo;s how we feel about consumer debt. Credit card debt levels drastically dropped with the onset of Covid lockdowns and for a minute we thought this might be the start of a personal finance reawakening! But unfortunately that was the exception rather than the norm. In February, American consumers increased their borrowing by a record $42 billion as credit card usage was up 20% in Q1 alone according to the major credit card companies. This is bad news of course, but there are strategic ways to use debt to your advantage. The types of debt you sign up for, what you&rsquo;re spending it on, your debt to income ratio, and resisting the &lsquo;immediacy premium&rsquo; are all elements of debt that we discuss today.</p>

      <itunes:title>Starting A Business is Easier Than You Think #512</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Inconceivable!&rdquo;. There are certain tasks in life that feel virtually impossible. One that comes to mind is painting your house- &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that, I&rsquo;m not a professional painter!&rdquo;. When in reality, that&rsquo;s a project you actually <em>could</em> perform well. Or another one might be something like baking some biscuits- &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not some culinary magician who can whip together some homemade biscuits from scratch!&rdquo;. When fact, that&rsquo;s something 6th graders learn how to do in middle school. And the same thing is true for starting your own business- there seems to be this special aura surrounding small businesses that lead many to think that they don&rsquo;t have what it takes. That it takes some special wizardry to run your own business. But we think that you do, in fact, have what it takes, that the pros outweigh the cons, and that the financial upside is worth leaving the &ldquo;safety&rdquo; of a W2 job. Listen as we cover the many reasons we believe starting a business is actually easier than you think.</p>

      <itunes:title>Cutting the Financial Umbilical Cord with Bobbi Rebell #511</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re talking today about how to avoid screwing up your kid&rsquo;s relationship with money. As parents, our job is to raise amazing adults to one day replace us! And even if you don&rsquo;t currently have kids, or maybe you know that you never will- today&rsquo;s conversation will do a great job shedding some light on why you think and feel the way you do about your personal finances. Bobbi Rebell is a Certified Financial Planner, she&rsquo;s host of the Money Tips for Financial Grownups podcast, and she&rsquo;s also the author of &ldquo;Launching Financial Grownups&rdquo;. The book is a call to action for parents who want the best for their kids, but who are beginning to realize that their <em>own</em> pursuit of financial independence has to become a priority as well. We talk about parenting styles, the increasing trend of boomerang college students, ways that we can strategically help our kids with money, and personal finance conversations between parents and adult children as well.</p>

As parents, our job is to raise amazing adults to one day replace us! And even if you don&rsquo;t currently have kids, or maybe you know that you never will- today&rsquo;s conversation will do a great job shedding some light on why you think and feel the way you do about your personal finances. Bobbi Rebell is a Certified Financial Planner, she&rsquo;s host of the Money Tips for Financial Grownups podcast, and she&rsquo;s also the author of &ldquo;Launching Financial Grownups&rdquo;. The book is a call to action for parents who want the best for their kids, but who are beginning to realize that their <em>own</em> pursuit of financial independence has to become a priority as well. We talk about parenting styles, the increasing trend of boomerang college students, ways that we can strategically help our kids with money, and personal finance conversations between parents and adult children as well.</p>

      <itunes:title>Quitting Your Job The Right Way #509</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s a right way and a wrong way to do all sorts of things. For instance we think that the right way to load toilet paper is with it dispensing over the top of course! Or, sometimes you see guys at the beach and they&rsquo;re beet-red but they&rsquo;ve still got their shirt off and they&rsquo;re likely not wearing any sunscreen- what&rsquo;re they doing?! And similar to quitting your job the right way, getting burned seems to be a lesson that many folks don&rsquo;t often learn until they are older, or until after they&rsquo;ve learned the lesson the hard way. But when it comes to your professional career, we want you to realize that quitting poorly can have very negative long-term ramifications. And the flip side of the coin is true as well- higher pay, more work flexibility, and better opportunities in the future await! Learn what you should be doing before you quit your job, how to ensure that you&rsquo;re not leaving money on the table when you leave, and how you can best transition out of your current job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

      <itunes:title>Cashing in on the Home Equity Explosion #506</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When your home&rsquo;s value increases by over $50,000 in 2021 alone- you take notice! The average homeowner has access to well over $150,000 in tappable home equity while still maintaining 20% equity in their homes. But just because you <em>can</em> cash out, does that mean you <em>should?</em> As you&rsquo;ve witnessed your home equity continue to balloon, you might be tempted to do something with those newly discovered funds. You might start getting the itch to finally spend some of that &lsquo;hard earned money&rsquo; on a boat or maybe even a lavish vacation. Or maybe you&rsquo;re more of a money nerd and you just hate seeing that equity sitting there underutilized- doesn&rsquo;t it just feel like a waste with those funds sitting around doing virtually nothing? Either way, you might be facing a money decision with five zeros after it, and we want to help you think about it well.</p>

      <itunes:title>Navigating the New Era of Cheap Travel with Scott Keyes #505</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest today is Scott Keyes- founder of Scott&rsquo;s Cheap Flights, a travel platform with over two million members around the world. It&rsquo;s been called &ldquo;the travel world&rsquo;s best-kept secret&rdquo; by Thrillist and received praise in The New York Times among others. But before he became our favorite expert on ways to keep vacation costs down, Scott worked for years as a journalist, with bylines in The Washington Post, The Atlantic, and plenty of other publications. And now, he&rsquo;s published a book titled, &ldquo;Take More Vacations&rdquo;, which we&rsquo;ll discuss today as well. With virtually everyone out there clamoring to take a vacation, we&rsquo;re really excited to be talking about this timely topic. We discuss why we&rsquo;re living in the golden age of cheap flights, how to get across the ocean for as little money as possible, change fees, and then we also discuss long travel and the changing culture of travel here in the US.</p>

      <title>Prepping for a Looming Recession #503</title>
      <itunes:title>Prepping for a Looming Recession #503</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been to a Broadway show? It&rsquo;s amazing- whether you&rsquo;re drawn to the storyline, the music, the costumes- but of course the cast is pivotal. And for any major theatrical production, not only are there the performers you see on stage, but there are also countless understudies. The backup cast members who learn all the lines, and know exactly what to do in case one of the performers gets sick or can&rsquo;t perform. They&rsquo;re preparing for the worst. We think of prepping for a recession in a similar way. We don&rsquo;t know exactly when it&rsquo;s going to happen. In fact, we hope that we don&rsquo;t experience one anytime soon! But when it does, you&rsquo;re going to be able to weather that storm much better if you take the proper precautions ahead of time. And with more talk of a recession on the horizon, we figured now was a great time to discuss what you should be doing. We&rsquo;re going to get granular on this one and give specific steps that you should take in order to be prepared whether we enter recession territory later this year, or if it takes an entire decade! Either way, you&rsquo;re going to be ready.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this episode we enjoyed an Altbairisch Dunkel by Ayinger! And please help us to spread the word by letting friends and family know about How to Money! Hit the share button, subscribe if you&rsquo;re not already a regular listener, and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-to-money/id1337718773?mt=2">give us a quick review in Apple Podcasts</a> or wherever you get your podcasts.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s time to celebrate the fact that we&rsquo;ve now officially recorded and published 500 episodes of How to Money! And what better way to mark the occasion, than to hear some of the best money tips from all of our listeners. From making more money with real estate, to getting on the same page as your partner with money convos, to spending less on groceries and smarter ways to budget- we had more voice memos sent in to us than we had time to get to during this episode, but we&rsquo;re excited to share a bunch of them with you today. And thanks to everyone for sending in their best money tip for us to share! We couldn&rsquo;t do this show without the listener support and love that we receive every day- either as an email or simply by the fact that you listen to the show. So thank you for helping to make How to Money what it is today!</p>

And what better way to mark the occasion, than to hear some of the best money tips from all of our listeners. From making more money with real estate, to getting on the same page as your partner with money convos, to spending less on groceries and smarter ways to budget- we had more voice memos sent in to us than we had time to get to during this episode, but we&rsquo;re excited to share a bunch of them with you today. And thanks to everyone for sending in their best money tip for us to share! We couldn&rsquo;t do this show without the listener support and love that we receive every day- either as an email or simply by the fact that you listen to the show. So thank you for helping to make How to Money what it is today!</p>

      <itunes:title>Just Keep Buying with Nick Maggiulli #499</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest today is Nick Maggiulli. Nick is the Chief Operating Officer for Ritholtz Wealth Management and regularly writes over on his site: Of Dollars And Data. But he wasn&rsquo;t always steeped in the world of finance and investing- before that he was a successful litigation consultant. And even though Nick has always had a heart for personal finance, it&rsquo;s only been in the past 5 years that he began to seriously write about money. And his new book, Just Keep Buying, actually comes out tomorrow! We were lucky enough to get an early copy and couldn&rsquo;t recommend it enough. Nick weaves insightful stories with actionable advice that is going to help anyone who reads it. During this discussion we talk about timing the market, Nick&rsquo;s definition of dollar cost averaging, spending less time on investments and more time on growing income, and much more!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this episode we enjoyed a La Folie by New Belgium! And please help us to spread the word by letting friends and family know about How to Money!

      <itunes:title>The Perils of Investing in Individual Stocks #497</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Think about the last novel you read that included a dangerous quest. If it’s a fantasy like the Hobbit, there might be giant spiders, goblins, and dragons- but in the end, it’s worth it because of the unfathomable treasure and riches that await them. The thing is, when we’re talking about investing in single stocks, the chance that this perilous journey ends up with a happy ending is much less likely, but folks continue along in their quest. Why? Maybe it’s because of the sophisticated tools that we have at our fingertips, or because it’s more accessible than ever with apps like Robinhood where you can buy and sell for free, or maybe you just think you’re smarter than everyone else. And sure you’ve heard of individuals who have crushed it by investing with a company like Tesla, but we’re still not fans of this type of approach. So in this episode we tackle some of the most common arguments advocating for investing in single stocks, why we ultimately disagree, and how you should invest your money instead. Single stock investing is unnecessary and can often be problematic.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed another classic: Trappistes Rochefort 10 by Brasserie de Rochefort!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Your birthday comes around every year- and you never forget because it’s something that you look forward to! But we’d argue that there are certain financial tasks that we should also revisit at least once a year, but we’re less than enthusiastic about knocking them out. This neglect is compounded by the fact that our finances have gotten more complicated than ever. You likely have accounts everywhere: you might have multiple 401ks, savings accounts, credit cards- it might feel like there’s too much going on as you juggle more logins than you can keep up with. Now these are tasks that don’t need to become ongoing obligations, but we do think they will help you make your personal finances more manageable. Whether it’s something as straightforward and practical as making some tweaks to your budget or if it’s the beginning of a season of reevaluating your life goals, we have a number of tasks that will allow you to spring clean your finances.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a classic: Saison Dupont by Brasserie Dupont!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we are joined by Naseema McElroy! Naseema is an RN with a master’s degree in healthcare administration, who also founded the website Financially Intentional and launched the podcast, Nurses on FIRE. Both of these resources exist to help nursing professionals achieve a sense of financial freedom in their lives. Given the demand for healthcare workers, there are a lot of career opportunities available so we’re excited to touch on that. Naseema also wrote the book, Smart Money, to give folks a step-by-step plan to crush their debt. But most impressively- Naseema has paid off over one million dollars of debt which doesn’t even seem possible- don’t worry, she explains her story! She details how she climbed out of massive debt as a single mother, the turning point in her journey towards financial independence, nursing as a cheat code to earning more, keeping lifestyle inflation in check, and much more.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Dosvidanya Rye Barrel by Destihl Brewery!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s time to go Parks-and-Rec on this episode and talk about treating yo self while still being a responsible adult and not breaking the bank. There’s nothing wrong with the occasional treat- we all want to be able to splurge every now and again. But we also need to make sure that we’re not going overboard to the detriment of our financial health. Companies are waging war against our credit cards and checking accounts with advertising agencies at their sides. Our attention has been hijacked by marketers and this often leads to us buying more stuff that we don’t actually need. Couple that with rising prices due to inflation and higher levels of consumer debt and we realize that it’s going to take a healthy combination of wisdom, discipline, and intentional spending. Listen as we tackle all of this and as we propose some rules that will help us to be effective, but not excessive when it comes to treating ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Cherry Livelihood Jackie O's!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our mental state has so much to do with how we handle our money- this is one of the many things we talked about with Paco de Leon. Paco founded The Hell Yeah Group which is a financial firm focused on inspiring creatives to engage with their personal and business finances. She started this work after her experiences in small business consulting, financial planning, and wealth management. Paco’s work has been featured in The New York Times, Forbes, and NPR and her new book “Finance for the People” was published earlier this month. Not only is she the author, but Paco is also the illustrator- her drawings do a fantastic job driving home the different points she makes in her book so we’re recommending it for all the visual learners out there. During this episode we talk about what Paco learned from being a debt collector and her time in the marijuana industry, what it takes to be a creative freelancer, the role our emotions play, how she keeps her consumption in check, and plenty more!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Lager Hell Rugenbrau- a big thanks to Julia for donating these delicious beers to the show!

      <itunes:title>Is Capitalism A Force For Good? #479</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sure you’ve heard the term- you know that capitalism is the primary economic system here in the United States, but is it the best option? And especially as of late, capitalism seems to be getting dragged through the mud. Depending on what you’re reading and who you’re listening to, you might be beginning to think that capitalism is the worst! However, we believe it’s actually a force for good and is an idea and concept that many fail to appreciate. Similar to the undervalued baseball players that Billy Beane scouted for the A’s to turn around their club, or something as simple as dental floss when it comes to taking care of your teeth- capitalism isn’t sexy, but it gets the job done. While we don’t think it’s the perfect solution, we’re going to spend this episode breaking down capitalism, why we think it works, and then what this means for us as individuals.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Bourbon Barrel Brick Kiln by Jackie O’s!

      <itunes:title>Buying or Renting in an Insane Housing Market? #476</itunes:title>

Of course you know it’s a possibility, you have the head knowledge that you should be careful and alert, but it’s another thing completely to have experienced it firsthand. The same thing can be true when it comes to investing in the stock market- we <em>know</em> that occasionally there are going to be corrections, but until we actually <em>experience</em> those downturns ourselves, we’re not totally sure how we’re going to react. Our fear and emotions might cause us to do something we’d later regret.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Some of the most important financial decisions we make are done infrequently. So because of that we feel a little rusty every time we perform that task. Buying a car is one of those infrequent decisions that can oftentimes blindside us if we’re not prepared. On one hand this can be an exciting time, but on the other it can be really nerve-wracking since the average person buys a car every six years. That’s plenty of time to forget how to do it by the next time you need to buy a car. And that problem is compounded by the fact that we’ve seen a huge shift over the past 18 months in pricing and purchasing dynamics. Supply chain issues have led to much higher prices! Since so much is at stake, it’s crucial that you take the proper steps to make sure you’re going about buying a car the right way.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Pothole City Rocky Road Stout by Pipeworks Brewing!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Let’s talk about ways to cut your rent! A recent stat showed that over 44 million American households are renters- that means there are more folks renting now than at any point since 1965. With increasing rents we felt that it was time to focus on some proven ways to reduce that monthly expense. Justin Pogue is our guest today and he’s an author and real estate consultant where he works with property management companies and investors. Since 2003, he has developed and managed apartments, rental homes, and student housing across the United States. ApartmentTherapy, Realtor.com, and FOX News have featured his insights, and we’re glad he’s now here with us on HTM to talk about ways to reduce rent. We talk about entering into a negotiation mindset, the best times of year to get a deal, putting yourself in the shoes of a landlord, protecting your deposit, and more!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Speltz Wrong by Dssolvr!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you remember the Seinfeld ‘car reservation’ episode? It’s one of the best. Jerry gets to the car rental counter and they don’t have a car for him. He says “See you know how to take a reservation, you just don’t know how to hold the reservation. And that’s really the most important part of the reservation, the holding!” That’s what we’re talking about today because you might know how to get <em>out</em> of debt, but do you know how to <em>stay</em> out of debt? You might find yourself digging out of debt every year when January rolls around. Holiday spending has a habit of sneaking up on most folks and you might be dealing with that financial hangover right now. Listen as we tackle concepts like lifestyle inflation, stoicism, accountability, and other practices that will allow us to kick debt to the curb for good.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Empress Rising Mole by Birds Fly South!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Better know a podcast host! Oftentimes here on the podcast we talk about our daily lives.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Few things change your life as much as finding out you're pregnant- it’s an exciting period of time, but it’s also slightly stressful! One of the reasons is because the clock is ticking and you know you’ve got less than 9 months to get your act together. It lights a fire under you and it’s an amazing period of transformation, for all parties involved! And similarly when it comes to our money, a special circumstance can often be the stimulus we need to make wiser financial moves, but what if it’s not enough? Or what if you don’t have any unique excuses to get your financial house in order? Well that’s where money challenges come in handy. Sometimes the reason that we’re not able to make any progress with our money is because we don’t have clear actionable steps that we can immediately take. Maybe you don’t have any accountability or you think it’ll be a load of drudgery. Whether you’re looking to spend less, boost your earning, or invest more of your money, this episode is all about jarring you out of your typical habits and routines. Sometimes what you need is a challenge that can serve as a wake up call to further you along in your financial journey.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Double Barrel Wild Sinister Kid by Trillium Brewing - a big thanks to Ali for donating this delicious craft beer to the podcast!

Her new book “My Money My Way” comes out next month, where she helps readers identify a uniquely personal plan that you’ll stick with, which will allow you to crush your money goals. For Kumiko, one of those milestones she achieved was paying off over $77,000 of debt in just 8 months early on in her financial journey and she also recently purchased her dream home with cash!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>LET’S PARTY! A financial festivus is in order here at the end of the year and we’re excited to share a bunch of listener wins from the How to Money community. Unfortunately at times we can be overly driven to the point that we fail to celebrate milestones. And when we achieve something great and move right on from it, we lose something in the process. Celebrations improve our well-being, they’re fun, and can provide inspiration for others. So during this episode we share a couple of our personal money wins, but then we have a chance to hear from listeners who have paid down credit card debt, massively boosted their savings rate, purchased their first home, started house hacking for the first time, taken their side hustle full-time, invested insane amounts of money, &amp; more. Thank you to everyone who shared their money wins and we’re excited about what 2022 has in store for the HTM community!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Coconut PM Dawn Trillium Brewing - a big thanks to Ali for donating this delicious craft beer to the podcast!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Having a glass of wine most days can be a healthy activity that we incorporate into our lives. Many studies have concluded that the moderate consumption of wine doesn't have negative long-term effects while simultaneously it could be beneficial in providing antioxidants as well as protecting against heart disease and inflammation. But, if that habit goes unchecked it could take on a tyrannical component in our lives if we’re not careful, and it could lead to severe consequences. The same is true with our money. And so on the show today we are de-emphasizing something that is at the very core of our show! We believe that money is a helpful and necessary tool, but we also believe that beyond a certain point, more money isn’t going to solve all of our problems. And in fact, money is only one component of our overall health and happiness levels. So during this episode we cover the struggle between achieving financial health and many of the other different facets of overall health like our physical, mental, social, and spiritual aspects as well. And then we end with a litmus test to help you determine if you have placed money in its proper place in your life.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Hay-Z by Temblor Brewing - a big thanks to Ryan and our friends there at the brewery for donating this delicious craft beer to the podcast!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What does it take to become a professional gambler? That’s the overarching question we’re asking our guest today: Chris Hanna. Chris graduated with a degree in finance and economics, but then he turned down a solid job on Wall Street in order to become a legit blackjack player. Less than 24 hours after he graduated, Chris hit the road and began counting cards for a living. And of course we believe that investing is a far cry from gambling, but a lot of folks are treating them more similarly than they’d like to admit. So where should we draw the line between gambling and investing? During this episode we unpack Chris Hanna’s story, talk about his shift to personal finance, and share how we can strategically use our money to build an exciting life.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Almond Brown Ale by Temblor Brewing- a big thanks to Ryan and our friends there at the brewery for donating this delicious craft beer to the podcast!

As humans we’re not the most rational and self-aware beings. We often believe that we’re incredibly objective but it probably depends more on the day of the week, how hungry we are, and who we’re talking with. But we believe that by understanding and naming some different behavioral science and economic terms, that we can better realize our tendency to make irrational gut reactions and think differently about how and why we make decisions in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Volume Integral by Pontoon Brewing- a big thanks to Miguel for donating this one to the podcast!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if you never had a disagreement about money with your partner ever again? Oh the bliss! Even just imagining this conflict-free future might be causing the tension in your shoulders to relax or that headache to fade. Unfortunately, that’s a paradise that’s lost and not something we can promise! Since most Americans report having major conflicts concerning money, it’s important to engage in healthy ways so that we avoid destructive patterns in our relationship as well as with our money. We want to work towards not only growing our wealth but growing and strengthening our relationships as well. During this episode we cover some of the common patterns of arguments we often hear about and what to do about those arguments. We also offer some tips that we believe will allow you to keep simple disagreements from escalating into knock-down-drag-out money fights.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an HDHC CananDANKua by Other Half Brewing- a big thanks to Jason for sending this one our way to enjoy!

Her book presents strategies to help us to resist the clever marketing and cultural expectations that this season often brings.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>To DIY or not to DIY… you can almost hear that being said in the voice of Hamlet (the Kenneth Branagh Hamlet not the Mel Gibson one, of course.) But while this question is not nearly as existential as the one Hamlet poses, it’s one that we all increasingly find ourselves asking. On one hand you DIY everything in order to save as much money as possible and in the process you also gain a tremendous amount of knowledge- but do you have enough time to live your life? And on the other hand you outsource and hire a pro as often as you can and for the most part you know that the job is being expertly performed by a professional- but do you have enough money to live your life? So we’re establishing a helpful framework for you to make better decisions in today’s episode. We’re focusing on better decisions because there isn’t going to be a right or wrong answer. That’s up to us as individuals and our own specific situations, but we can all go about asking ourselves the right questions when it comes to whether we should DIY or hire a pro.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Bell’s Two Hearted Ale- a big thanks to Chris and all of our friends at the brewery for donating this one to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Investing isn’t as simple as just throwing some money in the market and crossing your fingers. Yes, we do want you to invest. And yes there’s a chance you could probably invest more than you currently are. But there are a host of additional considerations that we want you examining before you open a brokerage account on your phone, initiating a transfer, and hitting purchase. Do you know what you’re investing in? Can you easily explain it to a friend? How do you feel about volatility, fees associated with that investment, illiquidity, and your time horizon? We like to think of it like taking a road trip- there are a number of things to do keep in mind like: do I know where I’m going, does my boss know I’m taking time off work, how long am I going to be gone, and can my car even handle a road trip of this magnitude? We’re not trying to dissuade you from investing, but we do want you to think twice before investing.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed an Emergency Drinking Beer by Wild Heaven!

Money is front and center, and even though we’re not going to dive into the specifics of the show and give away any details, there are still a ton of different lessons that we can learn.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Fear is an emotion that is hard-wired in us as humans, and so we naturally want to avoid the things that frighten us. But the biggest problem with this survival instinct is that there are times when we <em>must</em> face these fears in order to move forward and get ahead in life. We have a natural desire to avoid pain but if we don’t address it head-on, it’ll often lead to worse pain and problems down the road. This is often true when it comes to relationships, with our physical health, and it’s definitely true when it comes to our money. It’s a serious issue when we let fear get in the way of taking action. During this episode, with Halloween just around the corner, we cover some of the most common money fears that lurk in the back of our minds, and how to face them down in order to get one step closer to financial freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Hopfenweisse by Schneider Weisse- a massive thanks to Zach for sharing these with us!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s time to do a deep dive on raising financially savvy kids! We’re joined by Liz Frazier who is a fee-only, Certified Financial Planner and she is also the author of “Beyond Piggy Banks and Lemonade Stands: How to Teach Young Kids About Finance.” Liz is all about kids and finance, and to get specific, it was when Liz was pregnant with the first of her three children that she was setting up a 529 acct and preparing her will, that everything clicked. That’s when she realized that she wanted to be a financial planner because, like so many new parents, she realized the overwhelming need to make sure her family was financially prepared. And raising children who are equipped with financial knowledge is an important part of that role as a parent. During this episode we talk about having money conversations that stick with our kids, the way Liz does allowance with her 3 kids, how to get kids excited to save, spend, and share, among many other helpful topics.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed an Baerlic Beer Co Pioneer Fresh Hop ESB- a massive thanks to Brandon for sending us these beers that were fresh off the vine!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Joel doesn’t like to eat at fancy restaurants- not only because paying a ton of money isn’t his jam, but also because there are all these rules of etiquette that fine diners are just supposed to know. What’s he going to do with that 3rd fork anyways?! The same is often true when it comes to our money and the social situations we find ourselves in. Splitting the bill with friends when we go out- what should we keep in mind there? How should we talk about money with our co-workers, friends, and family? When you’re on a date, who pays for what and how quickly should you dive into money conversations with someone you’re serious about? And because we’re all unique individuals, we argue that there are no hard and fast rules that dictate our actions when it comes to our money. Instead there is a lot of nuance and it takes a lot of emotional intelligence in order to get your money etiquette right. It’s not always clear what path we should take and so during the episode we provide a helpful framework to help you decide. And we also share our thoughts on some common scenarios so that we can all avoid that awkward tension that might arise.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed Paranormal Electricity of Trans-Pacific Airwaves IPA by Burial!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Anytime you see a commercial for prescription meds, everyone always looks so happy- they’re 100% living their best life! But what about those insane side effects?! If you’re considering taking those medications you’ll have to seriously consider whether or not it’s going to be worth it for you. And we believe similar considerations need to be given when it comes to gig work. On the surface gig jobs seem like they could provide you with all that you’re looking for- flexibility, income, autonomy! And with an easy to use app on your phone you could be earning an income before it’s time for lunch. But we believe there’s a darker side to gig work as well. So during this episode we’re going to address both sides of the argument, we’re going to help you to determine if gig work is right for you, and then we’ll help you to think through choosing the best one for your life.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Fluffo Sando by Pipeworks Brewing!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you know anybody who’s <em>never</em> broken the speed limit? Even just a single person- in your entire life?! And if you’re being honest you’re less likely to treat it as a speed <em>limit</em>, and more like a speed <em>minimum</em>. We think we should be going at least that fast, if not more! For better or worse the speed limit is one of those rules in life that consistently is not followed. We break that rule because we believe we can still drive safely, even while exceeding the speed limit. Well the same is true with our personal finances and the money moves that we make. There are a lot of financial rules out there that many believe must never be broken or even challenged, while we believe a certain amount of liberty can be taken. It’s not that we believe that the rules should be done away with altogether- they’re important rules of thumb and reference points that we should definitely pay attention to, especially early on in our financial journey. But as you gain more knowledge and experience there are some financial rules that were made to be broken. Listen as we cover some of those rules as well as why it’s ok to be a conscientious objector!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Indefinite Staycation by Dogfish Head- thanks Ryan for donating this one to the show!

      <itunes:title>The Unspoken Rules Of Career Success with Gorick Ng #415</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Excelling in your career depends on more than just doing a great job. Just because you’re a decent software engineer, or you get the job done as a nurse- that doesn’t mean that you’ll quickly rise through the ranks. Nor does it mean you’ll automatically see big raises or year-end bonuses! That’s because there are things that managers and bosses expect of you, but they’re never explained to you. This is the basis for Gorick Ng’s best-selling book, “The Unspoken Rules: Secrets to Starting Your Career Off Right.” Gorick is a career adviser at Harvard, focusing on coaching first-generation, low-income students. But before that, he gained plenty of professional experience from working in management consulting, investment banking, and as a researcher with the Harvard Business School. Regardless of your specific job, there are plenty of soft skills and unspoken rules that you need to discover, in order to find success in your career.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Belgian Aloha by Olentangy River Brewing- thanks Scott for donating this one to the podcast!

      <itunes:title>Can We Count on Social Security or is it Busted? #413</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Climate change used to feel like one of those things that was <em>way off</em> in the future. But then we see the headlines of extreme weather, or perhaps you’ve experienced it first-hand, and we realize that it could be more imminent than we used to think. It’s no longer an abstract concept but a concrete reality. And so it is with our perception of Social Security- it used to just be an annoyance that shrunk our paychecks as teenagers. But now as more responsible adults, we’re looking ahead and wondering if Social Security will even be a thing by the time we’re retirement age. And recent reports say that the Social Security fund will be insolvent by 2033?! That’s why today on the show we’re asking- whether or not we can count on Social Security retirement benefits and the additional steps we can start taking now to ensure a comfortable future.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Roosevelt Coffee Stout by Olentangy River Brewing- thanks to Scott for sending this one our way!

It’s no longer an abstract concept but a concrete reality. And so it is with our perception of Social Security- it used to just be an annoyance that shrunk our paychecks as teenagers. But now as more responsible adults, we’re looking ahead and wondering if Social Security will even be a thing by the time we’re retirement age. And recent reports say that the Social Security fund will be insolvent by 2033?! That’s why today on the show we’re asking- whether or not we can count on Social Security retirement benefits and the additional steps we can start taking now to ensure a comfortable future.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Roosevelt Coffee Stout by Olentangy River Brewing- thanks to Scott for sending this one our way!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Winning the lottery shouldn’t be a part of your financial plan- but why are we so enthralled by the idea of winning the lottery?! On average, Americans spend over $1,000 every year for the chance to strike it rich. That’s a lot of wasted money that could be going towards literal investments. But even though we’re not going to win millions, statistically speaking, this exercise can provide some insights about the ways we want to spend our money and our time. This is helpful because there is a <em>much higher</em> likelihood that we would experience some sort of windfall in our lives whether that be a bonus at work, proceeds from a home sale, or even an inheritance. And if we haven’t taken the time to think through what we would do in these scenarios, there’s a good chance we could make the wrong decision in the heat of the moment. We’re going to get personal and share what we would do if we won the lottery, and we’re also going to explain how you can come up with your own money mission statement.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Crucial Crucial Taunt Taunt Enhanced by The Veil Brewing!

Marshall has been investigating the healthcare industry for 15 years, including over a decade at ProPublica. He also teaches investigative reporting at the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.

Between trying to get ahead at your 9-5 and pursuing side hustles, chances are really high that you feel like your work-life balance is out of whack. That doesn’t even take into account that more of us are working from home. We find ourselves chronically fatigued and exhausted because we give too much to our work, leaving little left for ourselves and those around us who we love. For instance, as a result most Americans don’t take all their vacation time- and when they do, they find it impossible to actually stop working! This ongoing cycle of never-ending work is leading more folks than ever to despise the work they once loved while other important areas in their lives like relationships, health, and hobbies continue to suffer. This is an important topic for us to cover as we seek to implement some practices to restore that work-life balance and then create boundaries to maintain that balance.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an I Learned It by Watching You by Burial Beer Co and Other Half Brewing - a big thanks to our friends Waffles on Wednesday for donating this collaboration beer to the show.

      <itunes:title>Valuable ATLien Money Lessons #404</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Since this is episode 404, we’re talking all about the money lessons that we can learn from our city Atlanta (which is sometimes referred to as the 404). You can learn lessons in unintended places- there are things to be learned all around us, if only we’re keeping an eye out for them. For instance, one of the impacts of the Covid lockdowns last year was that we couldn’t go anywhere and our calendars were pretty much wiped clean. And the unintended lesson that many Americans learned was that we probably had way too many events on the calendar to begin with. We quickly learned that less activities and more family time was a good thing. And so when it comes to Atlanta, there are a ton of different personal finance lessons that we can learn- from specific things like terrible traffic, the cultural diversity we find in the city, tax breaks being offered to the film industry, our sports teams, and plenty more! So be sure to listen in order to learn some valuable ATLien money lessons.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed BBA Siberius Maximus 10th Anniversary Cuvee RIS by Wrecking Bar Brewpub!

      <title>Is Real Estate Investing Right For You? #401</title>
      <itunes:title>Is Real Estate Investing Right For You? #401</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>You should consider investing in real estate! If your personal finances are in a solid position and you’ve already taken advantage of the tax advantaged accounts that are available to you, we believe that it could make a ton of sense for you to become a real estate investor. There are many great benefits from owning long term rentals like experiencing a higher return on your investment, monthly cashflow, tax benefits, and others that we’ll get to during this episode. But just because we’ve found investing in real estate to be a boon in our lives doesn’t mean that you should automatically go out and purchase your first rental. There are a number of different factors that you need to consider, before you start making offers! We tackle some of the common excuses that some folks give for why they don’t want to invest in real estate, in order to help you decide if real estate investing is right for you.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed Corn Grisette by Cruz Blanca Brewery- thanks to Dennis and our friends at the brewery for donating this one to the podcast!

If your personal finances are in a solid position and you’ve already taken advantage of the tax advantaged accounts that are available to you, we believe that it could make a ton of sense for you to become a real estate investor. There are many great benefits from owning long term rentals like experiencing a higher return on your investment, monthly cashflow, tax benefits, and others that we’ll get to during this episode. But just because we’ve found investing in real estate to be a boon in our lives doesn’t mean that you should automatically go out and purchase your first rental. There are a number of different factors that you need to consider, before you start making offers! We tackle some of the common excuses that some folks give for why they don’t want to invest in real estate, in order to help you decide if real estate investing is right for you.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed Corn Grisette by Cruz Blanca Brewery- thanks to Dennis and our friends at the brewery for donating this one to the podcast!

      <itunes:title>How To Tackle Your Student Loans with Lauryn Williams #397</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Today on the show we’re joined by gold medal winning, Certified Financial Planner, Lauryn Williams. And we’re not even joking with you- Lauryn was an Olympic athlete and was the first American woman to medal in both the summer and winter Olympic games which is an incredible feat. So not only is she a CFP with her own business, not only has she won gold as an Olympic athlete, but Lauryn is also a Certified Student Loan Professional, a CSLP, so she also has a high level of expertise when it comes to all things student loans. We’re going to hear Lauryn’s Olympic story but we’re also going to dig into some important details that student loan borrowers need to keep in mind when it comes to things like forbearance, student loan forgiveness, and the different income-driven repayment plans.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed The Donkey and the Thistle by Mad Fritz- thanks to our friend Cal for donating this one to the show!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today on the show we’re joined by gold medal winning, Certified Financial Planner, Lauryn Williams. And we’re not even joking with you- Lauryn was an Olympic athlete and was the first American woman to medal in both the summer and winter Olympic games which is an incredible feat. So not only is she a CFP with her own business, not only has she won gold as an Olympic athlete, but Lauryn is also a Certified Student Loan Professional, a CSLP, so she also has a high level of expertise when it comes to all things student loans. We’re going to hear Lauryn’s Olympic story but we’re also going to dig into some important details that student loan borrowers need to keep in mind when it comes to things like forbearance, student loan forgiveness, and the different income-driven repayment plans.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed The Donkey and the Thistle by Mad Fritz- thanks to our friend Cal for donating this one to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dick Fosbury changed the sport of high jumping forever the first time he jumped <em>backward </em>over the bar. Until then, every competitor had launched themselves into the air going forward, belly over the bar. I’m not sure the last time you watched a high jumping event, but now <em>every</em> high jumper uses Dick’s technique. He essentially exploited a flaw in the high jumping world that no-one else was paying attention to. In a way that’s basically what arbitrage is when it comes to our personal finances- it’s about thinking creatively about the different financial hurdles in our lives. It’s about challenging the assumptions we’re faced with. We’ll cover some very clear forms of arbitrage that you might already be implementing, some problems with arbitrage, and then how you can begin developing more of an arbitrage mindset today.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Newgrass Brewing Co Pineapple Upside Down Shake!

But some of his more impressive accomplishments have been via the work he spearheads in Atlanta and the surrounding communities, including his partnerships with Habitat for Humanity, and his annual Clark’s Christmas Kids broadcasts which have helped ensure that over 150,000 kids received presents on Christmas morning that otherwise wouldn’t have.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Self Unaware by Newgrass Brewing Co.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You might be saying “Yea, yea- we know Joel and Matt love biking…”, but did you realize that you’re literally missing out on millions of dollars by driving instead of biking? We crunch the numbers for you in this episode. So if you’re not biking, you should really give it another shot. People change- you’re not set in stone are you?! Just because at some point in time you decided that biking wasn’t for you, that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t reconsider. And on top of the massive financial benefits there are a host of other additional advantages of riding more. Plus, we disprove a bunch of common excuses that are given as to why some folks can’t bike more, or bike to work. Then we round things out and share how you can begin incorporating cycling into your life, and how you can get riding today!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Double Fruited Boysenberry Blackberry Raspberry Hill by Southern Grist!

Just because at some point in time you decided that biking wasn’t for you, that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t reconsider. And on top of the massive financial benefits there are a host of other additional advantages of riding more. Plus, we disprove a bunch of common excuses that are given as to why some folks can’t bike more, or bike to work. Then we round things out and share how you can begin incorporating cycling into your life, and how you can get riding today!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Double Fruited Boysenberry Blackberry Raspberry Hill by Southern Grist!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Here on the podcast we often talk about <em>how</em> to do smart things with your money, but we also try not to neglect the <em>why</em> behind our actions as well as our <em>attitudes</em> that have a massive impact on our overall approach to personal finance. Today on the show we’re talking with Ken Honda about his book “Happy Money” which is all about the mindset and attitude that we bring to our money which directly impacts our happiness. After a very successful business career, becoming an author was essentially a second career that Ken discovered and developed after retiring before he was 30. Ken’s writings bridge the topics of finance and self-help, focusing on creating and generating personal wealth and happiness through deeper self-honesty. Happiness and handling your money well takes more than just understanding the nuts and bolts, so listen as we talk about the art of gaining peace with your money!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Black Widow by Original Sin Cider- thanks to the folks there at Original Sin for sending this one our way!

Today on the show we’re talking with Ken Honda about his book “Happy Money” which is all about the mindset and attitude that we bring to our money which directly impacts our happiness. After a very successful business career, becoming an author was essentially a second career that Ken discovered and developed after retiring before he was 30. Ken’s writings bridge the topics of finance and self-help, focusing on creating and generating personal wealth and happiness through deeper self-honesty. Happiness and handling your money well takes more than just understanding the nuts and bolts, so listen as we talk about the art of gaining peace with your money!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Black Widow by Original Sin Cider- thanks to the folks there at Original Sin for sending this one our way!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. You’ve heard phrases like this your entire life but are they true? And how can we specifically apply them to our personal finances? We had fun talking about some common money phrases earlier this year, but since then we’ve realized that there were a <em>bunch</em> of good ones we didn’t cover! So we figured it was a good idea to hit up even <em>more</em> common money phrases that we’ve all heard and dissect them. And the reason we feel this is surprisingly important is because the sayings we hear can often bore into our brains and if we hear them enough we believe them as fact. But many of these common sayings have flaws in them or are just downright wrong. So have a listen as we think through some more money sayings and how they apply to our personal finances.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Elderberry Northwest Sour Ale by Cascade Brewing!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode is all about FIRE which stands for Financial Independence Retire Early. This movement came about as an entire generation began to push back against the notion of traditional retirement- working hard in a job you hate so that you can kick back when you’re 65. Thanks, but nah. We have friends who have completely rejected that idea and have retired in their 20s and 30s, but the most important thing to keep in mind is that the pursuit of financial independence doesn’t have to look a specific way. Just like those books we loved in the 90’s you get to choose your own adventure! From leanFIRE to fatFIRE and everything in between, there are a variety of lifestyles we can aspire to. So we’ll talk about the different types of FIRE and then some of the most important tactics to consider on your path to achieving financial independence.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Smells Like Bean Spirit Double Maple by Mikerphone Brewing!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>During today’s episode we’re going to explain how you need <em>more</em> financial stress in your life!.. Well, not quite, but we do think that the <em>proper</em> amount of stress in our lives can be helpful in achieving the money goals we’re pursuing. All things in moderation though- just like you want to avoid having too much of a good thing, we obviously want to avoid overwhelming stress in our lives. But the thing is, it’s oftentimes not even the stress itself that is bringing us down, but the negative coping mechanisms and habits that we turn to that can be the most destructive, and that can cost us the most. We believe that by reframing how you view stress and by putting it in the proper light, you can use financial stress to your advantage. Listen and we’ll explain how!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Coconut Stout by Easy Chair Brewing Garage- thanks to Jess for donating this one to the podcast!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>For most financially responsible parents out there, it’s not a question of <em>if</em> they should be saving for their kid’s college, but <em>how much</em>. Oftentimes parents are wondering how much they need to save in order to be performing their proper parental duty. But we’re taking a more counter cultural stance and are asking the question: <em>should you be saving for college at all</em>? We’re all about thinking in advance and ensuring that we’re properly saving and investing our money, but for a lot of folks, the answer is that they shouldn’t be putting <em>any</em> money towards their child’s future college expenses. Listen as we discuss the benefits of not saving for your kids college, when you can actually start putting funds away in a college fund, and then ways you can go about it properly.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Coconut Stout by Easy Chair Brewing Garage- thanks to Jess for donating this one to the podcast!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Who are you trusting with your money? We’ve all received some crappy advice at some point in our lives, but when it comes to our personal finances we need to make sure that we’re listening to the right folks. One of the reasons it can be so difficult today is due to social media and entertainment- there are a lot of self-appointed “experts” these days and it can be difficult to tell the difference between sound financial advice and an account or a show that’s meant to just amuse you. For most folks, it might be easier to sniff out a blatant scam where someone is out to swindle you. But potentially even more dangerous- what about the instances of friends or family members who think they’re giving us good advice? Those are situations where they probably have good intentions, but it’s just not the right advice for you. We run the gamut between headlines and social media to financial advisors, and we also discuss how <em>you</em> can determine if the advice you’re hearing is right for you.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Return of the Tripping Dead by Tripping Animals!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We’re seeing one of the hottest housing markets in recent history! Bidding wars are driving up prices, homes are going under contract after just one week on the market, and mortgage rates are near historic lows.

Are we going to see prices come crashing down like they did just over 12 year ago? We share our thoughts as we discuss a bunch of different reasons for residential real estate being on fire. And if you <em>are</em> ready to buy a home, we also cover a number of different tactics that you should implement to ensure that you get the home you want without overpaying.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Rhyming Numbers- thanks to Eighth State Brewing for donating this one to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Just like how we can idolize ‘finding the right one’ when looking for a partner or spouse, the same can be true of passive income as we’re talking about our personal finances. We can be tempted into thinking that if we only find the right person then it’s smooth sailing. But as anyone who has been in a long-term relationship knows- the work has only just begun! The same is often true of the different passive income opportunities that we hear pitched in social media or hawked in YouTube videos. Passive income is a legit and real concept, but the way it’s often presented doesn’t include the full story, or they leave out some crucial details. There are very few sources of 100%, purely passive income and so that’s why we are dispelling the myth that there are opportunities around every corner, but have a listen because there <em>are</em> ways you can begin establishing your own future streams of income, today.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Radix by Halfway Crooks!

Since there is so much pent-up demand, it’ll really be easy for us to fall prey to poor spending. It’s important for us to keep that behavior in check and there are a host of alternatives for us to consider instead of making that purchase.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What does it take to win with your money and achieve your financial goals? During this episode, we make a case that the most important factor is grit. It’s not earning six figures, or knowing the exact right investment moves to make. Though both of those are important, they’re not nearly as vital as grit. As Angela Duckworth writes, “Grit is perseverance for very long-term goals”. We begin to succeed when we truly commit to the goals that we’re pursuing. Luckily the amount of grit we possess isn’t static and there are ways for us to cultivate more grit in our lives that will allow us to get ahead with our finances. Passion, practice, and other people are just a few of the really important ways that we can develop more grit and start winning with our money.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Pales in Comparison by Edmund’s Oast!

Unfortunately, those ideas are often what we base our decisions on if we don’t have a tax professional in our life.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Here’s a saying that we’ve all heard- don’t put all your eggs in one basket. That makes a lot of sense but does it apply to investing? Is one fund enough if you’re invested in a diversified index fund? Or maybe you’re thinking- forget index funds, what about bonds? Shouldn’t I be invested in those as well? These are all questions that we’re going to address during this episode where we discuss asset allocation and how it is that we personally invest. Everyone wants to make wise investing decisions, but in an attempt to diversify we can easily become overwhelmed with the pure quantity of different investing options that are available. For example crypto, REITs, and NFTs just to name a few. Spending <em>some</em> time thinking about asset allocation is smart but simplicity has its advantages. Listen in as we do a deep dive on asset allocation today to put your mind at ease and help you think through what a solid diversification strategy looks like.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Haptic by Halfway Crooks Beer!

During this episode we talk about some of the most common money phrases that we hear and dissect the truthfulness of those phrases. If something we hear about money is incorrect or flawed, we need to correct our course!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>How big of a role does luck play as we handle our money? Or does it only come down to our ability to work hard and advance our station by sheer will, focus, and determination? Some individuals out there might feel a little shortchanged if you don’t credit them with their good fortunes. But luck and hard work are two of the hardest ideas to dissociate but that’s what we’re doing today. A proper perspective on the role that luck and hard work play in our lives is really important for a number of reasons that we’ll discuss. And most importantly, it’ll inform us as we’re doing things like setting out to land a new job, spend money more wisely, and invest for our future.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a SLUSHY XL Fruitmine by 450 North Brewing Company, thanks to neighbor Mark for donating this one to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Your annual salary is not the only thing you should consider when it comes to your compensation at work- you also need to take a serious look at your other benefits. Some of them are straightforward line items on your paystub like retirement plan contributions, but others might be offered more as informal company perks like wellness classes. Hopefully you’re taking full advantage of all of those offerings. But if you’re not, realize that not utilizing those benefits to their fullest potential can be akin to leaving money on the table (and possibly even more money than you realize due to their tax advantage)! You may not be interested in every single option, but it’s at least worth doing a little digging to see what is available so that you can make the best informed decision possible when it comes to compensation.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Koko Buni by Creature Comforts.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Patrice Washington is a number one best-selling author who has a unique philosophy about money that not only determines how she coaches others, but it shapes how she lives her own life as well. After her own personal struggles with money that culminated with bankruptcy where she lost everything, she has been able to work her way back to a place of financial well-being. She has been the personal finance expert on both Steve Harvey’s radio and television shows since 2014, and has appeared in dozens of media outlets like Dr. Oz and Fox &amp; Friends. Patrice teaches folks how to handle their money in a disciplined manner, while simultaneously living a fulfilling life. She wants you to build up wealth, but she teaches you how to build it with peace and purpose as your foundation. We redefine wealth in this episode and talk about Patrice’s new book “Redefine Wealth for Yourself”.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Wake-n-Bake by Terrapin.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>More (costs) than meets the eye! Housing is easily the largest budget item that we have here in the US, and so we’re dedicating an entire episode to the seemingly endless line of expenses that accompany owning a home. There are costs associated with purchasing, maintaining, and selling a home so we want to make sure you know what you’re getting into ahead of time. Many first-time homebuyers think that they are just swapping out a rent payment for a mortgage but it’s not that simple or straightforward. Owning a home will likely cost you more than you think so it’s important to start budgeting now, so you can purchase and maintain a home with a lot less stress later on.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Derby Juice by Anderby Brewing- thanks for donating this one to the show Aunt Sal-Sal.

      <title>Mind Altering Effects of Simple Money Tricks #320</title>
      <itunes:title>Mind Altering Effects of Simple Money Tricks #320</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Little money tricks alone won’t get us all the way to our financial goals. As we discussed recently, just a couple of bigger money moves can have more of an impact on our bottom line than a bunch of small ones. However there are some small tricks, that when paired with a new perspective, will lead to massive change over the years. So for example we’re not just talking about the $5.00 you’ll save today because you’re doing a no spend week, we’re talking about your ability to question your overall view towards consumption. We’re not just encouraging you to start saving towards retirement, we're asking you to imagine what your life might look like 40 years from now so you can truly connect with your future self! There’s not just the immediate monetary benefit, but there’s also the lasting mental benefit as well. THAT’S a powerful combo and we want you to be thinking about both aspects when it comes to your money.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Bound by Time by Edmund’s Oast. And as we’ve kicked things off with a bang in 2021, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money! Hit the share button, subscribe if you’re not already a regular, and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-to-money/id1337718773?mt=2">give us a quick review in Apple Podcasts</a> or wherever you get your podcasts.

      <itunes:title>Should Women and Men Handle Money Differently? #317</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Whether men and women should handle their money differently is an important question to ask. There are a lot of different studies and surveys out there that show that your gender has a pretty large impact on how you earn, spend, save, and invest your money- but should it? After all money is money! And of course there are generalities made in these studies because obviously we’re all individuals and handle money in our own unique ways. But that being said, there are still things we can learn from the data about the views, tendencies, and actions of each gender in the realm of personal finance. Recognizing these things will allow us to understand others better, we’ll do a better job at raising our children to handle money well, and we might even gain a better insight of ourselves along the way.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an On Cassette by New Anthem.

Whether some friends are getting together but you’re stuck finishing up a project, or maybe you haven’t been able to get your hands on the latest gaming console (or craft beer!). Well, FOMO has an ability to work its way into many different aspects of our lives, including our financial lives as well. You might feel some serious FOMO seeing individual stocks like Tesla skyrocket this past year while you are investing in plain old index funds. Or maybe with mortgage rates being at all-time lows, you feel like you are the only person in your peer group not buying a house right now. And you don’t want to miss out! This episode is about how to deal with and fend off FOMO so that we don’t make moves that mess up our ultimate goals due to distractions in the world around us.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we shared a Daaank Daniel by Heist Brewery in Charlotte NC.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Just a few years before he died, author David Foster Wallace gave a now-famous commencement speech at Kenyon College. Here’s a small snippet of what he said. “There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says ‘Morning, boys. How's the water?’ And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes ‘What the hell is water?’” Wallace then went on to argue that we tend to live our lives according to values and rules that are hard to see. Similarly, we live in a culture that pushes us to go into debt for everything! It’s the message we are constantly bombarded with - it’s the water we swim in. So on today’s episode we’re going to push back on that line of thought and give the real reasons we should all be striving to avoid debt.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a EMO-J by Heist Brewery in Charlotte NC.

For many reasons we tend to immediately focus on and get bogged down with the little stuff- it’s the small money moves that often get much of the attention. For example how often do we hear about cutting out a latte or the proverbial avocado toast.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s time to party! During this episode we’re going to hear how many of y’all were able to get ahead with your personal finances this year. The ability for us to slow down and take the time to celebrate our money wins is going to have a lot of positive effects on all of us. Not only does it motivate you personally, but it gets others pumped who might be in a similar situation! And this is even more important after a rough 2020- considering that over 68% of Americans have reported experiencing financial setbacks this year, we need to hear some uplifting personal finance stories! Often we don’t celebrate after we’ve worked hard to achieve something. Sometimes there’s a tendency to have that onward and upward mentality, looking for that next best thing, but not today. Today on the show, we share our money wins for the year and we’re going to feature some of the awesome moves from the How to Money community as well. Thanks to all of you for being a part of this super fun episode!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Winter Welcome Ale 2020-2021 by Samuel Smith.

Regardless of your current views toward work, we want you to know that work is a wonderful thing and yet work isn’t everything. Viewing work in a healthy way takes intentionality and balance!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You only have two options when it comes to saving more money- you can either earn more or you can spend less. But which of these is more important? Depending on your personality, you might find it easier to focus on making more money without too much concern for being frugal. And other listeners are all about more tips to live frugally, but they rarely give much thought to how they can increase their earnings in the coming years. Which side of the fence are you on? In this episode we discuss the importance of both of these areas in our financial lives.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This show exists to make sure that you know the best ways to earn, save, and invest your money so that ultimately you’re in a great financial position down the road. And a part of that journey towards financial independence includes making sure that you have the right attitudes towards money and that you’re not only looking to your own desires, but that you’re looking to the needs of others as well. This is why giving away money is such an important practice to begin implementing ASAP. It’s not a principle or stage of enlightenment that you might reach someday. Rather it’s like working out- the earlier in life you get started, the better off you’re going to be in the long run.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Even though there are likely going to be fewer individuals actually going shopping in person the Friday after Thanksgiving this year, Black Friday is still a majorly important time for deals. These days Black Friday has transcended time and place- it includes multiple days and even an entire season of scoring really low prices on gifts. This can provide some relief to our bank accounts as we search for gifts for friends and family for less than we can normally get these things the rest of the year. But on the flip side of the coin, this time of year can really strain our personal finances. There’s the temptation to overspend and consume more than we need to and because of this, many American’s end up with boatloads of debt come January. There are a number of different problems that arise during this consumption-driven time of year. In this episode we highlight some of these ‘Black Friday Foibles’, why they’re a big deal, and then we discuss what to do about them.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Caliente Aqui by Tripping Animals!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We all make the occasional money mistake. Some missteps are small and the impact they have is a tiny blip on our radar. Other money mistakes can be like an albatross weighing us down for years to come. But whether our mistake is more of a bump in the road or if we’ve made a mistake that will impact us for a long time, it’s important to learn how to overcome these mistakes so we can move on and start kicking butt with our money again. In this episode we cover some common mistakes we make, why we make them, and then how we can pivot to handling money well in those circumstances. And then aside from specific mistakes, broadly speaking there are some important steps to take that will allow us to move forward more quickly when we’ve made an error with our money. This is a great episode for anyone who has ever had some money regrets!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Hydrus Double IPA by Two Tides Brewing!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Should you work for the man or work for yourself!? There’s a lot to consider when asking yourself that question and there’s certainly not a one size fits all answer. At the same time, it seems that entrepreneurship has been put on a bit of a pedestal in our society causing it to be inaccurately represented. And this question is even more relevant given the high levels of unemployment plaguing our country right now. A lot of folks have been laid off or furloughed while other sectors are doing really well- there are a lot of factors to consider. There are meaningful tradeoffs depending on the choice you make, so during this episode we’ll cover some of the important things you should consider as you think about your future career. We’re here to help you to decide whether or not you should be starting your own business or whether you’re better off in a traditional nine to five!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Realities by Dssolver!

A lot of folks have been laid off or furloughed while other sectors are doing really well- there are a lot of factors to consider. There are meaningful tradeoffs depending on the choice you make, so during this episode we’ll cover some of the important things you should consider as you think about your future career. We’re here to help you to decide whether or not you should be starting your own business or whether you’re better off in a traditional nine to five!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Realities by Dssolver!

We want potential investors to know that there are steps you can take to ensure that you’ll have a positive experience investing in real estate and managing properties, while simultaneously making money every month and building wealth.

      <itunes:title>Developing a Home Buying Strategy #263</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>How should you approach purchasing a home? With more millennials buying a home for the first time ever, there is a ton of room for mistakes. And there is a lot on the line as well- the average price of a new home now exceeds $300k, so there are a lot of things to consider in order to make a wise purchase! At the same time, mortgage interest rates are at all-time lows. That creates a feeling like you have to move quickly before those rates start to creep back up. But if you move too quickly, you could end up overpaying for that house or not considering the bigger financial impact. We’re going to answer some questions like ‘Does renting make more sense?’, ‘What’s the purpose of this house?’, and ‘What’s your timeline?’. This episode is all about what it looks like to have a solid home buying strategy in place, so that you make a smart buy.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a La Bonte with Figs by Wicked Weed! And as we’ve ramped up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>On average, housing costs easily account for a third of our monthly expenses. That’s why it’s so important for us to cover how we can cut housing costs to zero, and even make some money while we’re at it! Here to tell us how she did it is Zeona McIntyre. Zeona went from earning minimum wage to becoming financially free in two years with real estate- specifically with Airbnb. Zeona now owns 7 properties and manages 20, all over the world. She also consults by working with her clients and helping them achieve their short-term rental goals: from finding an ideal rental property to purchase, tips on furnishing, all the way through to management. Zeona is using real estate to design the kind of life she wants to live, and hopefully after this interview you’ll be inspired to do the same.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Chocolate Peanut Butter Porter by Lupulin Brewing!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are secondary costs associated with almost all purchases that we make in our lives. It’s important to consider all of these additional costs that tag along when making purchases, and not just the initial sticker price. In this episode we explain how there are hard secondary costs and then how there are soft or lifestyle secondary costs which are similar to lifestyle creep. And then finally, we go over some helpful and specific tips to remember when making purchases. Keeping all this in mind will help us to manage our money better, specifically when it comes to our spending because everything really does cost more than you think.</p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Pretty Willie’s Imperial Stout by Against the Grain!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's time for a Friday Flight! These episodes are all about the week’s news and the effects of Covid-19 on your personal finances. There are a lot of headlines out there, but we are distilling it down to specific takeaways that will allow you to not just weather this health and financial crisis, but to come out on the other side even stronger. In this episode we cover some practical topics like the rise of fake podcasts, the increased number of new books to be published this fall, digital coupons, what the payroll tax holiday means for you, and how much money working from home is saving our country. After all of that we touch on what airlines are dropping their change fees, the rush of speculative day traders, and the high cost of money therapists.</p><p>Also, don’t forget this is your chance to raid our bookshelf! You can win 3 of the dozen books we’re giving away and we’re talking about books of previous guests who we’ve had on the show. Titles like <em>I Will Teach You to be Rich</em>, <em>The Behavioral Investor</em>, <em>Can I Have Your Attention?</em> as well as several others. And the way to be one of the 4 winners is by leaving us a written review over at Apple Podcasts. Once you’ve done that, email us at <a href="mailto:howtomoneypod@gmail.com">howtomoneypod@gmail.com</a> with your screen name, and you’re good to go! We’re taking entries until Wednesday September 9th at noon.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We could share the best money tips out there with you every single episode, but it would never really matter if you haven’t identified proper money goals for your life. What good is it to know the best ways to earn more, spend less, and invest your money if you don’t even know <em>why</em> it is that you’re doing those things? And unfortunately if you haven’t identified your money goals and the ‘why’ behind your money, then it’s easy for money itself to become the end goal. Gaining more wealth can become the default metric that you <em>think</em> will make you happy, but in reality that happiness is fleeting. So this episode is all about discovering our passions, figuring out what we want to spend our money on, and thinking through how we want to spend our days. And then we talk through the SMARTER approach to goal setting to ensure that we are taking the steps to get us where we want to be.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Alpha Abstraction IPA Vol 13 by Wild Leap!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Convenience (and the products and services that make it possible) has infiltrated it’s way into our daily spending - so much so, that it’s become our default option. Who doesn’t want things to be a little easier and a little more accessible? Convenience <em>can </em>be a nice perk of our modern economy, but it can also come at a high cost. And the big problem here is that American consumers are spending more money than ever on different conveniences without giving it a second thought. We’re being parted with our money without even realizing it! So our goal for this episode is to shine a light on the different reasons that we often go with the more convenient option. And then we’re also going to suggest some simple solutions for us to overcome these costly options. By recognizing our natural tendencies, hopefully we can resist these urges which will also allow us to save money. We don’t want to take the easy and more expensive way every time we’re faced with a decision.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Chimay Grand Reserve!

Most of the lessons we’re going to discuss in this episode aren’t brand new, but due to the health crisis, they’re more important than ever. It’s vital to reflect on those lessons so that we don’t forget them - not only do we need to put those lessons to work now during the pandemic, but we also need to continue to implement that knowledge in a way that continues to help us for years to come.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Modus Vivendi by The Wild Beer Co out of England!

      <itunes:title>Choosing Name Brands Over Generics #236</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We’re all looking to spend less money, especially during these difficult coronavirus days, and one of the best ways to accomplish this is by going with generic or private label brands. Name brands have worked their way into our lives but they come at a cost. And then there’s the big question of: what products or purchases should I go generic with and when should I just stick with the name brand that I know and am more familiar with? During this episode we talk about why we’re fans of generics as well as some categories where it makes sense to make the switch and how to go about making the switch. But we’ll also make an argument for choosing name brands over generics as well- there are some purchases where we can cross over into the territory of cheap in an attempt to become more frugal.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Spotted Cow by New Glarus- thanks to James for donating these beers to the show! And as we’ve ramped up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!

      <itunes:title>Why You Are Probably Underinsured #233</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of different types of insurance out there and it can be tough to know which types of policies you should look into and which ones to avoid. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed with the amount of information related to insurance, and that can lead you to not making any decisions at all. The end result is that things remain the same- and you’re underinsured. And then you might hear an anecdotal story of when a warranty or insurance policy came in handy for someone else, so you feel that should be a product to look into, but should you? You don’t want to end up overinsuring and paying too much every month for something you don’t really need! In this episode we’ll cover the role that insurance should play in our lives and then dive into the specifics of which plans we should absolutely have, the ones we should just consider, and then the ones we should completely avoid altogether.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a PB&amp;J Sour by Shades Brewing- a big thanks to Andy for donating this one to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Covid has impacted lots of areas of our lives - including our summer travel plans. So now is a great time to get a little creative if you are hoping for any sort of vacation. Many of us have had our getaways cancelled, or even if not, there’s a chance you may not feel great about being cooped up in an airplane for hours on end. Even if it’s relatively safe, it still isn’t something many of us want to do these days. But if you already have planned for a week off from work it’s important to still take that time off, even if your plans end up looking a lot different than you had originally planned. Don’t abandon that vacation altogether - listen as we explore some creative options for summer travel that will be affordable as well as fun.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Phinizy Swamp Thing by Savannah River Brewing- thanks to Jeff for donating this one to the show! And as we’ve ramped up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!

So in this episode we’ll be encouraging you to envision what you would want your ‘post-work’ life to look like- do you picture a more lean or luxurious retirement? And then beyond that we’ll get practical with the financial moves you need to be making now- things like where to invest your retirement, how you’ll know you’ve saved enough, and then how to draw on that money without penalty.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Speedway Stout by AleSmith Brewing Co!

      <itunes:title>Modern Frugality and Massive Debt Reduction with Jen Smith #223</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We have a really inspiring interview today that will encourage anyone who is looking to change their life by paying down debt. Jen Smith is a personal finance expert and she has the experience to back it up. Jen and her husband paid off $78,000 of debt in less than two years making well under 6-figures. She's been featured in Kiplinger, U.S. News &amp; World Report, Money Magazine, and she's co-host of the Frugal Friends podcast and blogs over at ModernFrugality.com. Getting out of debt and frugality go hand in hand, so we spend some time talking about why frugality is so important and what it means to be frugal. We also cover some of Jen’s favorite tactics and strategies that she used in order to become debt free.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed a cold brewed coffee since we recorded this episode in the morning (back with craft beer on Wednesday)! And as we have ramped up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>As the repair costs of owning an old car begin to add up, you might be wondering if it makes sense to ditch it. Many folks make the decision to abandon their still solid vehicle based on the desire to drive something newer instead of an actual <em>need</em> for something more reliable. The costs of upgrading your car could blow a hole in your personal finances since transportation costs are typically the second line item on most budgets. But we also understand that a vehicle is more than just a way to get from point a to point b - for many, there is an emotional component as well. Today we’re going to cover when you should repair a used car and when you should consider getting rid of it and opting for something newer. And we'll also touch on how to sell your old car and how to go about making that purchase if you do decide to upgrade.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Zombie Dust by 3 Floyds Brewing Co - thanks to Doug for sending this one our way! And as we ramp up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!

It’s a sad irony that applies to many of us- whether because we are overwhelmed with the convoluted nature of our personal finances, or maybe due to the fact that we lose interest as we’re distracted by the next cool piece of technology that promises the results we want to see. For the vast majority of us, the simplest approach is often the best. So we’ll cover the importance of simplicity by highlighting the issues with complexity, and we’ll also discuss how to make your personal financial life a winning mix of straightforward yet thoughtful at the same time.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Scorpius Morchella by Toppling Goliath- thanks to Kelsey for donating this one to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Is everything in life negotiable? It depends on who you ask. We all enjoy paying less than we have to and getting a deal, but there are certain instances where it makes more sense than others. Just because you <em>can</em> negotiate a bill to get a few bucks off doesn’t mean it’s a good use of your time, when there might be a different bill that you should focus on instead. There are several areas in our personal finances that we often overlook to the detriment of our bank accounts. And then one of the other problems is knowing how to go about the process of negotiating- what strategies to use and what steps to take in order to make the biggest impact. And so we’re going to address, not only <em>how</em> to negotiate, but also <em>who</em> to negotiate with<em>,</em> in order to make it worth our time.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Tampa Timeshare Grapefruit-Basil Gose by Wrecking Bar Brewpub- one of our favorite local breweries.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are professionals who can help us in almost every aspect of our lives. In some cases it’s a slam dunk easy decision, but there are other times when we can, and should, handle it ourselves. The problem is knowing <em>when</em> to DIY it and when to call in the big guns, the professionals, in this case- the financial advisor. There are a lot of aspects of our personal finances that don’t require professional help. You don’t need a financial advisor to tell you that you need to start paying down your debt and get that employer match in your 401k. But there are some more complicated issues that might arise when it would make sense to hire a pro. Listen to this episode and see if you should be considering hiring a financial advisor or going it alone.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Catharsis by Treehouse Brewing- thanks to Bryan and Caitlin for donating this one to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we have the honor of speaking with Richard Cordray, who served for six years as the first Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB. Since his time at the CFPB, he has written a book, WATCHDOG: How Protecting Consumers Can Save Our Families, Our Economy, and Our Democracy. In his book, Richard shares stories of individual consumers in order to show how the Bureau quickly became a powerful force for good. WATCHDOG tells a hopeful story of how our system can be reformed by putting government back on the side of the people. And we don’t just stop at government help, we also dive into how we as individual consumers can take steps to remain vigilant, especially during this modern pandemic.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Von Pilsner by Crooked Stave- thanks to our friends at the brewery for donating this one to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Why is it that when a consumer item like a new phone is on sale, we pounce, but when the stock market is on sale, we run? Buying and holding are both far more difficult to do in a volatile market for most investors. And when we see terms like ‘bear market’ and ‘recession’ in the headlines, it makes it even harder for many of us to continue to invest. But what is important to remember is that buying into this market volatility is the source of future returns. The overall American stock market has returned roughly 9.7% over the past 90 years. And those 90 years have included difficult events like wars, depressions, deflation, and various politicians. So while it might feel a lot safer to not invest at all, know that American capitalism has continued to produce results for decades on end despite real challenges. Investing in an economic tailspin, although it feels a bit counterintuitive, is the best thing you could be doing over the long-term.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Athena Paradiso by Creature Comforts!

      <itunes:title>Where to Turn for Debt and Budget Help with Thomas Nitzsche #199</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In his early 20s, Thomas Nitzche found himself in loads of debt. Like so many folks, he didn’t learn how credit cards really worked, and so the charges began to add up, and before he knew it he had an overwhelming balance that he could barely make minimum payments on. Couple that consumer spending with student loans, a car payment, a mortgage, and the final kicker- getting laid off and losing his income. Thomas found himself in a really stressful spot, but he was able to move from a place of desperation to using his experiences to help others. He now works for <a href="https://www.moneymanagement.org">Money Management International</a>, which is the largest provider of nonprofit financial counseling and education in the United States. He’s all about conversations around money and destigmatizing debt, and so that’s what we’ve tackled in this episode.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Experimental IPA Vol 13, by Easy Chair Brewing Garage- thanks to our friend Jess for brewing this one up and donating it to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Money anxiety is something we have all experienced in one way or another. Whether it’s student loans, trying to save up enough for a car, or even having enough money to make it to the end of the month- this stress is a very real thing. Covid-19 and its effects on our economy and our jobs have only exacerbated the issue. According to a recent Qualtrics report, 67% of people say they have higher levels of stress since the beginning of the health crisis. And money anxiety doesn’t just plague low-income earners. More personal stories and accounts have been shared in recent years of “rich” people willing to admit their own money anxieties: individuals making $100k or more are just as susceptible to living paycheck to paycheck. So in this episode we dive into some of the symptoms of money anxiety and then we recommend some practical steps we could all implement into our lives to reduce the amount of stress surrounding our personal finances.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Sour Opal by Firestone Walker- thanks to our friend Josh for donating it to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>With the Great Lockdown continuing to take its toll on the economy, mortgage rates are at near all-time lows so now is a great time to consider refinancing. Pouncing on these lower rates can lower our monthly mortgage payment, allowing us to free up some money that was being funneled towards housing. But what else should we consider? Are you a good candidate for a refinance? And then on top of that there are also costs involved in refinancing that can make it prohibitive. In this episode we discuss what you need to consider, some great reasons to refi, and how to make sure you are refinancing effectively.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Old Tuffy by New Belgium- a big thanks to Maggy for donating this beer to the show this week!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest on this episode is personal finance expert Farnoosh Torabi who has transformed what most would consider setbacks, into the very things that drive her forward. She found herself living in NYC at the age of 22 with over $30k in debt, but it was through the process of climbing out of debt that Farnoosh realized her desire to help others with their money. She has done it all, from reporting for Money Magazine, to hosting her own podcast, to writing multiple books including ‘Psych Yourself Rich’ &amp; her latest bestseller ‘When She Makes More’. We’re excited to talk with Farnoosh about couples and all things related to money, but in particular how personal finance is so much more than just understanding the nuts and bolts.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed Petite Sour Raspberry by Crooked Stave- thanks to our friends there at the brewery! And as we ramp up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!

So in this episode we’re talking about the chorelike, everyday money disciplines that are often skipped over. These are the kinds of money moves you may not be paying attention to, but they still have a big impact on your personal finances.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Adambier by Crooked Stave- thanks to our friends at the brewery for donating this one to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Friday episodes are all about the coronavirus and your money. There’s a lot of news and information out there, but we are distilling that down to specific takeaways that will allow you to weather this surreal health and financial crisis.

Our modern workforce has been heading towards working remotely for years, but of course the coronavirus has all but eliminated the ability for non-essential offices to continue to function as they had previously. The problem is that most of us don’t have home offices, or if we do, there are still countless distractions in our home that we’re not used to. And additionally, many of us have kids at home as well- while they are wonderful, they are likely distracting us from the other myriad tasks at hand! How do we work from home and do it well? We can’t continue with a system that hampers our ability to actually get work done, so we’re going to speak to how we as individuals can work from home without going crazy.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Same As It Ever Was by Monday Night Brewing, makers of some of Atlanta’s best craft beer.

      <itunes:title>Behavioral Money Tendencies that Wreck Us #179</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It doesn’t matter if the market is flying high, or if it’s dropping faster than we’ve seen in history, each one of us is capable of making the occasional dumb decision, and it’s simply because we’re human! There are certain tendencies ingrained in us that can cause us to approach the world and our personal finances in an irrational way. Some of the hardest money mistakes to correct are ones that we make habitually because we don’t recognize the patterns that may have led us there. In order to break those bad money habits, sometimes it means taking a step back and figuring out what those behavioral tendencies are! The better we are at identifying these behavioral tendencies, the more likely we are to be able to make better decisions that will have a positive impact on how we view and handle our money.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an IDKFA by Ellipsis Brewing - thanks to Joel for picking this one up while he was down in Orlando.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn’t matter if the market is flying high, or if it’s dropping faster than we’ve seen in history, each one of us is capable of making the occasional dumb decision, and it’s simply because we’re human! There are certain tendencies ingrained in us that can cause us to approach the world and our personal finances in an irrational way. Some of the hardest money mistakes to correct are ones that we make habitually because we don’t recognize the patterns that may have led us there. In order to break those bad money habits, sometimes it means taking a step back and figuring out what those behavioral tendencies are! The better we are at identifying these behavioral tendencies, the more likely we are to be able to make better decisions that will have a positive impact on how we view and handle our money.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an IDKFA by Ellipsis Brewing - thanks to Joel for picking this one up while he was down in Orlando. And as we ramp up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Feeling overworked?! Between trying to get ahead at your 9-5 and pursuing side hustles, chances are really high that you feel like your work-life balance is out of whack. We find ourselves chronically fatigued and exhausted because we give too much to our work, leaving little left for ourselves and those around us who we love. For instance, as a result most Americans don’t take all their vacation time- and when they do, they find it impossible to actually stop working! This ongoing cycle of never-ending work is leading more folks than ever to despise the work they once loved while other important areas in their lives like relationships, health, and hobbies continue to suffer. This is an important topic for us to cover as we seek to implement some practices to restore that work-life balance and then create boundaries to maintain that balance.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an I Learned It by Watching You by Burial Beer Co and Other Half Brewing - a big thanks to our friends Waffles on Wednesday for donating this collaboration beer to the show.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Working hard for money isn't a foreign concept, but working hard to receive good customer service often is- we so rarely advocate for ourselves! The first step when you're looking for great customer service is to be sure to do business with a reputable company. After that, there are plenty of additional elements to consider to not only save you money, but allow you to walk away from a transaction completely satisfied and raving about how great of an experience you had when you needed assistance. Listen as we help you to make the best use of your time when advocating for great customer service.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed an Atrial Rubicite by Jester King.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest today, Doug Nordman starts every morning by checking the surf forecast to see how he’s going to spend the day. He and his wife are financially independent and live on the island of Oahu, which is a surfer’s paradise! Doug was able to achieve this amazing life by taking advantage of the financial benefits offered to him by the military, as well as through standard practices like budgeting and investing extra money towards retirement. He was enlisted in the Navy where he had a career as a submariner, and now he writes about money over at The-Military-Guide.com. And while most all of us have a chance to become financially independent, Doug believes members of the military are even better positioned for financial success. We’ve never had a member of the armed forces on the show before so we’re excited to hear some of the unique money challenges and advantages that members of the military experience.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Bodhizafa by Georgetown Brewing Company - a big thanks to Richard for donating this beer to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>There will be declines in the stock market, and you’ll likely see the amount of money you have invested begin to drop. This is normal during a bear market- stay calm! It’s also OK to feel a little nervous. We are emotional creatures after all, and while it’s fine to feel a little anxious if you’re hemorrhaging money in your investments, it is NOT fine to react to these declines by selling and getting out of the market. It doesn’t help that the 24-hour news cycle and media outlets are fueling any uncertainty you might have by proclaiming doom and gloom. So in this episode we’re going to discuss what actions we should take, before and during a market crash, and how to harden ourselves to weather the financial storms that accompany a major market decline.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Bretta Weisse by Firestone Walker - a big thanks to our friend Josh for donating this beer to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We live increasingly busy and complex lives and the same is true of our money. Repeatedly making smart money moves is hard. It’s easy for us to forget or just get plain lazy when it comes to doing the right thing with our funds. Between our different bank accounts, multiple credit cards, and debt obligations, it can be difficult for us to take action on a consistent basis that will have a long-lasting effect on our personal finances. That’s where automation comes in- it helps us to engineer money success ahead of time, instead of trusting ourselves in the moment to continually muster the willpower to make it happen. But like many of the financial tools at our disposal, it’s not all puppies and rainbows. So, in addition to the clear benefits, be sure to listen and learn why you should also be careful when it comes to employing automation in your personal finance life.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Dayglow IPA by Elysian Brewing Company - a big thanks to Joe in Minnesota for donating the beers to the show this week!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>For most normal people, personal finance is boring! There are many reasons why Americans have a really difficult time getting their money act together, but today we’re addressing the fact that we’d rather spend our time doing almost anything else. This is a problem as it takes intentional action for the rubber to meet the road and for our hopes and dreams to be turned into a debt slaying, wealth building reality. Gamifying our personal finances can help us to <em>actually</em> achieve some of those goals when it would otherwise be something we wouldn’t do at all. When we can figure out what it is about a particular game that we love, then we can bridge that gap and take some of the elements from the games we love and apply them to our personal finances. We really believe that gamification will level up your money game.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Astral Prism by Modern Times Beer- another big thanks to our friend Craig there at the brewery for donating this one!

      <itunes:title>Waking Up Early and Intentional Living with 5am Joel #154</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s probably going to be hard, but waking up earlier this year can help you to get your personal finances in order!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Merry Christmas and happy holidays! In the midst of all the festivities, now is a good time to ask ourselves: “Buying new stuff makes us happy, right?” Well if you have a need that is now being met, there is certainly some value that item is now providing. But value isn’t the same as happiness. Hedonic adaptation, or the hedonic treadmill, helps us understand the effect of consumption. Coming to grips with that can help us end unhealthy cycles of mindless consumerism and set us on a path to a healthier way of thinking about money, spending, and saving for the future. Listen to the full episode to learn how hedonic adaptation can be terrible, how it can actually be a good thing, and then finally to learn how to hack it and truly control how happy you really are.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Mangifera Flux by Marz Community Brewing- a huge thanks to our buddy Andrew for bringing this beer all the way back from Chicago.

      <itunes:title>Don't Mess Up Your Taxes, with Keith Schroeder #150</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our guest today is Keith Schroeder who began working in the backwoods of Wisconsin on a family farm fixing silo unloaders- not the kind of job most of us had growing up! But his passionate distaste for that work led him to file tax returns on the side and that hustle led to Keith being able to retire at age 22 however he didn’t stay retired for long. His tax preparation business exploded into a full on accounting firm where at his busiest, he was serving over 2,000 clients. He started his own blog in 2016 called The Wealthy Accountant to inspire people to “live life well” and also help them not screw up their taxes. In this episode we’ll cover Keith’s thoughts on the best tax advantaged retirement accounts, whether your side business should really be a hobby, and some important considerations as you begin to get your 2019 tax forms together!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Alpha Abstraction Vol. 9 by Wild Leap which you can learn all about on Untappd!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When 99% of American companies are small businesses, it’s no exaggeration to say that these businesses are the backbone of our country. These startups have been responsible for almost all new job creation over the past 3 decades! And not only are small businesses important to our economy but they’re important to us on a personal level as well. These are the storefronts and people who make up our communities and neighborhoods- they’re a part of our identity! However as technology marches on, small businesses also need to adapt and utilize this innovation to continue to reach their customers where and how they want to be reached. We’re going to cover some of our favorite ways that small businesses are able to use technology to stand out in really cool ways and contribute to their local community.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Double Purple Chroma by Other Half Brewing.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are times in our lives as consumers, that we’re faced with a decision: even though I can’t afford it, do I buy this thing that I really want? “Ohhh, that new iPhone looks really awesome” or “It would be a ton of fun to take a trip to the mountains next month!”. We often already know that the answer to these questions should be “No, I don’t have the money” because we know it’s not worth going into debt for these types of expenses. But sometimes the answer isn’t always as cut and dried as we’d like it to be. What if, as someone looking to invest in yourself, you’re thinking about taking out some student loans? Or what if you’re considering purchasing a home and you don’t have hundreds of thousands of dollars set aside? Occasionally, we find ourselves in these situations where debt might make sense. Listen as we talk through some of those scenarios as well as what else to keep in mind when you’re considering taking on debt.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Czech Pilsner by yEAST Atlanta Brewers- a big thanks to our beer brewing friend John Francis for donating this beer to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine that you have a well paying job but otherwise it sucks and you wish you could leave. And now imagine that an amazing opportunity comes along for you to start your dream business- that thing you’ve always wanted to do, but the problem is that you know you won’t be able to pay yourself for a solid year. What you need is peace out money to keep you afloat! Or maybe some family or health issues have come up and you want to be able to spend time with family, or maybe you just want to take some time off and road trip it for 6 months. Either way, the answer is peace out money! We’re defining this as having enough money on hand to leave situations or jobs where you could technically stay, but you’re choosing not to because you’d rather do something else. You have that peace out money to bridge you to the next job or opportunity that you really want to pursue. Listen to the full episode to hear the additional benefits of peace out money, how it's different than reaching financial independence, and then finally the steps you can take to make sure you have your own peace out money set and ready for when you need it.</p><p>And during this episode we enjoyed a 2014 Oud Bruin by yEast Atlanta Brewers which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. A big thanks to our friend John for brewing, aging, and donating this beer!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Countless Americans don’t have a plan for how much they will spend or who they will be buying for this holiday season. What results is we end up with that all too familiar spending hangover with folks paying off those “unforeseen” expenses well into the New Year. Instead, we can avoid that debt by beginning to think and save now (even starting to save now for next year!), and creating a spending plan that includes things like gift budgeting, making cuts to your list of who to include, and tracking your spending. And while you’re making these changes, it’s really important to communicate the reasons why you might be cutting back- you don’t want your friends thinking you hate them! Talking about it with those you care about is an important step and we dive into how to do that effectively.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Timely Surrender by Archetype Brewing- another big thanks to Brad and Corina up at Archetype for donating the beers to the show this week!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s vitally important to discuss financial optimism because a LOT of folks have negative money scripts floating around their heads. Their pessimism hurts their current view of their money and their future financial wellbeing. How can we combat that? Financial optimism. We need to understand the good that currently exists in our lives and cultivate a hopeful attitude towards our finances. When we’re pessimistic about the current state of our financial health, it leads to inaction and that creates a cycle that secures that pessimism for the long term. It’s time to flip the script, change how we view our finances, and start doing awesome things with our money!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Caramel Macchiato Stout by Old Bust Head- a big thanks to Matt’s in-laws for donating this beer to the show this week!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What do you do for fun? This might seem like a trivial question, but discovering your hobbies can have some pretty large impacts on your financial health and overall well-being. Of course we want to ensure that we’re pursuing frugal hobbies and that we’re being intentional by curating our interests. The mindless pursuit of expensive hobbies is never a good thing- but reaching the end of our working career and finding ourselves bored and restless sounds like a nightmare scenario! We live in a work driven culture, and so we need to cultivate these hobbies and interests now so that we have something to look forward to in retirement other than just ‘not working’. We talk long-term about our money all the time, so this week we’re talking long-term about our hobbies.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed a Bourbon Barrel Peach Cider by Tieton Cider Works- a big thanks to Jenna there at the cidery for donating this one to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode is chock full of personal finance gold. Sure, we spend a good amount of time talking about negotiating, but we also cover intentional spending, the psychology behind being smart with your money, and rethinking the money ‘truths’ we’ve grown up with. We are stoked to have Ramit Sethi join us as we cover all those topics and more, which can also be found in his book ‘I Will Teach You to be Rich’ (and stick around to the end as we’re giving away a few copies as well)! Ramit has written about personal finance for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and is a veteran in the personal finance community. Living a rich life is different for everyone and we’re glad to have Ramit Sethi on this episode to remind us to dream big.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed a cold brewed coffee since we recorded this episode in the morning (back with craft beer next week)!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you have a difficult time setting aside money for the future and saving towards retirement, then identifying why it is that you’re saving might be what you’re missing. Studies have even shown that we will save more money for retirement when we’re able to see an older version of ourselves- so maybe trying out FaceApp is a good thing after all! Even though we all might have different motivators, it’s healthy to remind ourselves of why it is so important to save and invest. And actually realizing and understanding that we’re going to be old one day is crucial when it comes to maintaining a high savings rate in our 401k, IRA, and other investment vehicles.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Christmas Bomb by Prairie- a big thanks to Jeff for donating this beer to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The leading cause of bankruptcy in America is the inability to pay medical bills- an estimated half a million people file for this reason every year! Almost no one is immune to the rising cost of healthcare, and fellow podcaster Dan Weissmann is here to commiserate. Dan’s podcast, An Arm and a Leg, is part journalism part personal narrative as he dives into real life experiences of Americans with their health coverage. Healthcare is definitely confusing, and based on the fact that our country spends almost 20% of our GDP on medical spending- it is also clear that costs are out of control. </p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed an SKB IPA by Sun King Brewery- a big thanks to James for donating this beer to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Many of us have our own personalized, specific goals when it comes to our money, so it’s no surprise that we also have many different views of what financial independence means to each of us. Since tomorrow is the 4th of July, we wanted to take a moment and reflect on how our views of financial independence have changed over the years. We also posted this question in the How To Money Facebook group, and we look forward to digging into and sharing your wisdom regarding what financial freedom means to you! Just like we often discuss regarding knowing the ‘why’ behind our money, when we’re able to identify why it is we’re seeking after financial freedom, we can endure almost any ‘how.’ Happy 4th!</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed an Order of Magnitude by Edmund’s Oast which you can find on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>So many of us grew up without any sort of formal or informal education about personal finance. Few states offer a personal finance course in their public schools and even fewer participate in any sort of standardized testing for the courses they do offer. That’s why we’re really excited to have Dan LaSalle join us for this episode. Dan saw a need for this type of education in the high school where he was teaching and four years ago he took it upon himself to create a personal finance program that not only teaches students the importance of budgeting, saving, and investing, but also gives them the opportunity to earn up to $5,000 a year, and put that money into a bank account of their own. We truly believe that this kind of approach could be the future of financial education!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Happy Trees by ANXO which you can find on Untappd. A big thanks to good buddy Andrew for donating another tasty beer cider to the show!

      <itunes:title>Rules for Mindful Spending #095</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Here on How to Money, we often debate the merits of a purchase, not because we hate spending money and try to avoid doing so at all costs, but because we are constantly checking ourselves to avoid the MINDLESS spending of our money. It is a challenge to make every financial decision with the same level of intentionality but we find we are often more wasteful when we are feeling too tired or lazy to be intentional. But just being aware of some of the triggers and circumstances that lead us to spend in ways that don't align with our financial goals can help us see it and own it when it happens, and lead us to effectively change our habits for good. Being excited to spend our money mindfully on a purchase that aligns with our financial goals is a good, healthy feeling- whereas impulse spending can leave a spending hangover, often accompanied by debt. Listen as we run through several rules that help us be mindful spenders.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a National Cherry Blossom FestivAle by Old Ox Brewery which you can find on Untappd. A big thanks to our good buddy Andrew for donating this beer to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>How much are you paying to invest in your 401k or IRA? You might see fees as an unavoidable cost of investing, but even a 1% fee could easily cost you more than a half million dollars over your investing lifetime. Fees not only erode how much money you have to invest now, but they lessen the amount of money that is compounding in your account year after year- the impact is twofold! Listen as we discuss the different types of fees, how to look for them, and then where to go in order to avoid fees altogether.</p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Bent De Garde by Braindead Brewing which you can find on Untappd. A big thanks to Jerrod and our friends out there in Dallas for donating this beer to the show!

We are really excited to have time management expert Laura Vanderkam on the podcast as she helps people spend more time on what matters, and less on what doesn’t. We discuss her latest book, Juliet’s School of Possibilities where she says that “Expectations are infinite, time is finite, you are always choosing, choose well.” In this conversation we dive into ways to be more efficient at work, how we should be thinking about our time at home while we’re ‘off the clock’, and some tips on how we can better manage distractions.</p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed an Infinity Bloom by Newgrass Brewing Co. which you can find on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What is the best way to pay down debt? Americans are in tremendous amounts of debt (think over 400 billion on just credit cards alone)! Not only is this debt keeping folks from reaching their financial goals, but it’s also taking a toll on the mental health of borrowers. Knowing the best strategy to get out of this debt is a big deal and could be the difference between living paycheck to paycheck or achieving financial freedom. Listen as we cover both approaches so you can decide which is better for you: the debt snowball (popularized by Dave Ramsey) and the debt avalanche (also known as debt stacking).</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Maple Vanilla Copra Kai by Southern Grist Brewing which you can find on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We think it’s a great decision for almost everyone to invest in a Roth IRA.

Because we automatically set up these policies, we tend to forget to continually shop them around- which may mean we’re significantly overpaying! Loyalty with a particular insurer doesn’t save you money over the years so continually shopping your provider is one of the best ways to get your rates down. Listen as we cover several other ways to save big on car and home insurance, plus we answer the question: When should I even use my insurance?!</p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Uroboros Stout by Anthem Brewing which you can find on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What kind of life do you really want to lead? Does consumption and stuff dictate your life more than you’d like? It is so important to examine your own life to discover the small changes you can make right now to give you more freedom to do the things that truly matter most to you. For this interview, we sat down with Chris and Cristi from Life Opted Out to talk about how and why they chose to leave a life they loved in NYC for a much simpler, more affordable life traveling the country in their van. They share that so many of the lessons they’ve learned are not specific to life on the road, and can be applied to anyone looking for more purpose and fulfillment.</p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Nothing Left to Give by Orpheus Brewing which you can find on Untappd.

      <itunes:title>The Truth About Debt Consolidation #077</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>US households owe a total of $420 billion in credit card debt so it’s no surprise that everyone is looking for an easy solution. Debt consolidation (and debt settlement) companies offer a quick fix but they often cost you a lot, wreck your credit score, and they may even completely scam you without performing any of the promised work. Rather than consolidation and settlement companies, consider the sure route- ‘manually’ consolidating your own debt and, if needed, utilizing loan companies like Lending Club or SoFi- just make sure to do your homework and read the fine print! In the end, make sure you have a plan to keep yourself from taking on new debt- you don’t want to end up back in the same situation!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Secret Lovers - the Sequel by Wilmington Brewing Company which you can find on Untappd. A big thanks to Naomi for donating this beer to the show!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Even though the federal government published a report that determined the average cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 is $233,000- that doesn’t mean you HAVE to spend that much! When calculating how much YOU will spend on a child, start by asking yourself: what are my current expenses? Because really the best indicator of how much you’ll spend on your kids is how much money you are already spending on yourself. The cost of children will be an extension of your values and what you’re already spending money on. Listen as we cover how much kids cost, ranging from specifics like the cost of car seats to a broader, principled approach towards entertainment and spending in general.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed a Heavy Hands DIPA by Spindletap Brewery which you can find on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 80% of Americans wouldn’t be able to pay their bills if they missed a paycheck. When you’re used to living paycheck to paycheck, the idea of setting aside some extra money is almost laughable. How do you even consider setting financial goals when every dollar you make is already going somewhere necessary? In this episode we talk through how to choose to set goals regardless of your financial situation. The goal of an emergency fund for some breathing room and financial cushion is the very thing that will allow you to still pay your bills if you miss a paycheck! Even saving $1,000 can be enough to end the cycle and allow you to escape that paycheck to paycheck lifestyle.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed a Roast Beast by Modern Methods which you can find on Untappd.

      <itunes:title>Small Time Real Estate Investing with $Pro Chad Carson #060</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>You don’t have to be a millionaire to be a successful real estate investor. Chad Carson, our $Pro this week, is here to explain how even a small, effective real estate portfolio can lead to reaching your financial goals in a short period of time. He illustrates this with an example of a couple reaching financial independence with only five properties, not hundreds! Having greater financial freedom and flexibility with your time will be the natural outcome of focusing on your goals, and carefully investing in real estate can take you there.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Primordial Noir by Cascade Brewing which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. A massive thanks for Alex in Oregon for donating this beer to the show!

In addition we cover the high points of financing, architects, whether you should attempt any DIY, as well as some of the other finer points of renovating your home.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Apple Brandy Barrel Noir by Prairie Artisan Ales which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

Listen as Grant shares his thoughts on our inability to reclaim lost time, and as we discuss what steps we can take to change the belief: time is money.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Tritonia Gose with Pineapple &amp; Lemon by Creature Comforts which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>***We are pumped to start releasing an additional episode every week that we’re calling our money pro episode, or $Pro for short! Every Monday we’ll hear from a $Pro as they discuss a topic that they’re passionate and knowledgeable about, and then we unpack it even further and discuss the impact that topic has on our financial lives.***</p><p>Too often in life it’s like we’re sleepwalking- as if we’re drifting through life without any clear guiding principles. Due to that, our day-to-day is filled with different people, companies/advertising, and events having more sway over our lives and money than we do. Scott Rieckens is here to change that with his approach to creating a personal mission statement and to remind us to proactively take control and start directing our own future! This is a topic that is near and dear to his heart. After realizing that his growing family was in a state of overconsumption, he and his wife re-assessed their family’s priorities which then led them to cancel their boat club membership, sell their BMW, and move away from pricey Coronado, CA. They didn’t <strong><em>have</em></strong> to do any of this, but they <strong><em>chose</em></strong> to do all of this after creating a personal mission statement! Listen as we break it down and go through how you can create your own mission statement- plus we share our personal mission statements as well.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Cold Mountain by Highland Brewing which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The new tax law nearly doubles the standard deduction which means even fewer folks will be itemizing deductions on their tax returns this year- however, there is still an important way to massively cut our tax bills! Regardless of whether we take the standard deduction or if we itemize deductions- we can still reduce our tax bill by ‘above the line deductions’. These are technically not actual deductions but adjustments to arrive at our adjusted gross income which we typically want as low as possible in order to pay fewer taxes! Listen as we cover some of the best ways to cut our tax bills and why you’ll likely want to do the same.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Karate in the Garage by Southern Swells which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>How amazing is it that we live in a world where there are so many ‘free’ things all around us? And how unfortunate is it, that we don’t even see these ‘free’ resources because we’re so used to purchasing and consumption- we don’t even think to make use of them. Our technology and culture steers us in the direction to spend. Chances are there are times when we're not taking advantage of this ‘free’ stuff and we're overspending because maybe we haven’t thought about it recently or there are some things you’re not even aware of yet. Putting these resources to use will make us smarter, save us money, and will overall lead to a healthier and more balanced life.</p><p>During this episode we shared a Sticky Hands IPA by Block 15 Brewing Company which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. A special thanks to Dale in Portland for bringing down this IPA for us to have on the show (even after our Atlanta United gave his team a walloping at the MLS Cup)!

Listen to the full episode to learn how hedonic adaptation can be terrible, how it can actually be a good thing, and then finally to learn how to hack it and truly control how happy you really are.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Mangifera Flux by Marz Community Brewing which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Nobody ever wants to be called cheap- it’s an insult and brings all sorts of negative connotations with it. However, being frugal is a badge of honor and something worth striving towards. There is a temptation to become cheap when you are looking to get your finances in order, but instead we would encourage frugality over being a cheapskate. In this episode we break down the differences between the two as well as share some stories from when we’ve attempted to be frugal but it ended with us being cheap! In our lives, we’ve found it’s pretty dang hard to label something as cheap vs. frugal because one person’s ‘cheap’ is another’s ‘frugal’. That’s why we discuss our 5 principles or guidelines that will help you determine: are you frugal or are you cheap?</p><p>And during this episode we enjoyed a Stiegl Grapefruit Radler which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Over half of Americans don’t have a will- and this is a huge problem. You might think you don’t really need a will, but if you have any assets, a spouse, or kids you most definitely do. Wills aren’t just for old people! Most often people feel that they can always put it off until a little bit later, but the best time to go ahead and create a will is right now. It can be an unsettling topic as most folks don’t enjoy talking about their mortality, but having the peace of mind in knowing that your children and assets are in the right hands after your untimely death is worth any short term discomfort. In this episode we cover the big reasons why you need to have a will, why you likely don’t need a lawyer involved, and how to create a will for free.</p><p>And during this episode we enjoyed a Sweet Leilani by Cherry Street Brewing which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine that you have a well paying job but otherwise it sucks and you wish you could leave. And now imagine that an amazing opportunity comes along for you to start your dream business- that thing you’ve always wanted to do, but the problem is that you know you won’t be able to pay yourself for a solid year. What you need is peace out money to keep you afloat! Or maybe some family or health issues have come up and you want to be able to spend time with family, or maybe you just want to take some time off and road trip it for 6 months. Either way, the answer is peace out money! We’re defining this as having enough money on hand to leave situations or jobs where you could technically stay, but you’re choosing not to because you’d rather do something else. You have that peace out money to bridge you to the next job or opportunity that you really want to pursue. Listen to the full episode to hear the additional benefits of peace out money, how it's different than reaching financial independence, and then finally the steps you can take to make sure you have your own peace out money set and ready for when you need it.</p><p>And during this episode we enjoyed a 2014 Oud Bruin by yEast Atlanta Brewers which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. A big thanks to our friend John for brewing, aging, and donating this beer!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Most folks are paying more than twice as much as they need to for cell phone service! The biggest reason for that is because they haven't shopped around- they're blindly paying the overpriced plans from 5 years ago. The average monthly cell phone bill is $73 and by the end of this episode, you’ll know how to get that down drastically- closer to the $25 per month mark which is the new golden standard. Plus, you’ll be able to do that without having to be on a massive friends and family plan like we are (seriously, it’s like we’re playing a game of sardines!).</p><p>And during this episode we enjoyed a Zarza Marrón by Casa Agria Specialty Ales which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>After the Equifax data breach where 148 million people’s personal information was compromised, it's especially easy to see how vulnerable we are as consumers. So now more than ever, is the time to freeze your credit! A new federal law has made it completely free to freeze and thaw your credit, so you don't have any more excuses. In this episode we talk about why this is so important, we cover what a freeze does (and what it doesn't do), and then we tell you exactly how to do it. Seriously it's so incredibly easy that it shouldn't take you more than about 5 minutes from start to finish!</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we enjoyed a Focal Banger by the Alchemist which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. A huge thanks to our friend and pastor Matthew for donating this beer and supporting the show!

In a time where we’ve seen wage growth stagnation, workers want to make more or in some cases, they can’t seem to get out of the cycle of living from paycheck to paycheck. Side hustles are the answer! There are lots of pros and cons which we cover, but not all side hustles are created equal. In our new sharing or gig economy, oftentimes the default response to just go drive for Uber or Lyft, or even charge Bird scooters- but we argue that these are dead end ‘hustles’ and aren’t much better than punching the clock at a traditional job. Listen to the entire episode as we list some options and discuss what a better, scalable side hustle looks like.</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we enjoyed a Tears of My Enemies by Monday Night Brewing which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

This week we’re answering a listener’s question as he specifically asks if he has enough life insurance in place, as well as how important is his age when it comes to his annual premiums. These are some awesome questions (thanks Josh) so listen to the entire episode to hear our thoughts on life insurance!</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we each enjoyed an Intergalactic Juice Hunter which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>“Don’t rent, you’re just throwing away money. Buy a house instead, it’s a great investment!” - says almost everyone who purchases a home. It’s often accepted as a gospel truth that purchasing a home as a primary residence is always a great investment. This is just not true. We promise you, unless you’re house hacking, chances are your house makes an awful investment. It could possibly be a good lifestyle choice, maybe a great decision for you and your family, or perhaps you're getting a great deal, but that doesn’t mean you should consider it to be a great investment. In this episode, we cover all the different reasons why your primary residence is an awful investment, and then we also give some tips to consider to make your home a ‘less bad’ investment.</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we enjoyed a Rueuze (2015) by Bruery Terreux which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

My wife and I both work at colleges (she’s a professor, I’m a counselor) and we’re actually not sure what college will look like in 15 years and what the value proposition will be. Also will our kid(s) even want to go to college? We haven’t made decisions on a 529 or other account but starting to have the discussion. Thanks, fellas!” Mark is asking all the right questions and this was a great excuse for us to cover an important topic.</p><p>In this episode we cover some of the pros/cons of 529 plans, discuss how you should prioritize saving for your kid's college in relation to saving for your own retirement, cover some alternative views on college, and then we share whether or not we're planning to save for our own kid's college.</p><p>At the beginning of this episode we popped open and enjoyed a Champs de Fraises by Firestone Walker, a barrel aged wild ale fermented with strawberries, which you can learn all about on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Conventional wisdom tells us that getting out of debt is smart. And while generally that might be true, we're here to explain how that approach may not be the best decision for you! Oftentimes keeping low-interest debt around while you're able to invest and maximize your returns elsewhere will easily make the most sense when you're looking at the numbers. In this episode we cover the characteristics of good debt and bad debt, and then we talk through some helpful pointers on how to manage your current debt.</p><p>Remember this one thing: somewhere around <strong>7% is the magic number that separates low interest debt from high interest debt</strong>. That's the interest rate that acts as a divider in our current market. Anything higher than that you'll want to pay off sooner than later, and anything lower than that, there is a good chance you can take those extra payments and invest to make a big enough return to make it worthwhile. Listen to the entire episode to hear us break it down because it's a very nuanced topic!</p><p>At the beginning of this episode we each cracked open and enjoyed a beer called Infusion A - Coffee Porter by Hoppin' Frog Brewery, a peanut buttery porter which you can learn all about on Untappd.

Considering the lack of any sort of margin in our lives today, it shouldn't be a surprise that Americans treat their money any differently than they treat their time.

Living paycheck to paycheck has unfortunately become the norm and it's a problem that needs to be addressed.</p><p>The answer is to create an emergency fund! Having an emergency fund allows us to weather these small storms, and most importantly reduces stress. In this episode we discuss what an emergency fund is, what it is for (and not for), and how to get started on your own- including where to put that money! Listen to the entire episode to learn what steps you can take today, regardless of your financial situation.</p><p>At the beginning of this episode we each cracked open and enjoyed a beer called Liliko'i Kepolo by Avery Brewing, a Belgian-style white ale which you can learn all about on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Commuting to work sucks! It’s likely one of your least favorite things to do everyday assuming you’re an individual commuter, driving along in your own metal box that costs you thousands to own and operate. It’s stressful dealing with traffic and not to mention our cars encourage us to be lazy and perpetuate the lifestyle of excess and consumption. I mean does it really require a $15,000+ luxury vehicle that weighs over 4,000 lbs to transport a single individual to work and back?! In this episode we discuss the alternatives to traditional commuting, and specifically how these alternatives benefit employees, employers, cities as a whole, and obviously the environment. Listen to the entire episode to learn what steps you can take today, regardless of your situation.</p><p>At the beginning of this episode we each cracked open a couple beers from John, a local home brewer here in Atlanta- sorry, you won't be finding this one on your local grocery store shelf. It is called A Splinter in the Mind by Little Cottage, a flanders red which we've dubbed our favorite beer of 2018!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Asking for a discount isn't something that most people enjoy doing, but we'd be willing to wager that you don't ask for discounts enough. It's your money after all- hang onto it! In this episode we discuss haggling, rejection, and some reasons why asking for a discount should be a healthy part of your financial life. We also go through some practical steps we take when asking for a discount and share a few stories of when we've gotten that sweet discount or when we've had to say 'thanks for considering!' and walk.</p><p>It's an overused maxim, but that doesn't make it any less true: If you never ask for a discount, the answer will always be no.</p><p>At the beginning of this episode we cracked open a couple beers that Joel brought back from Paris- we are so incredibly cultured y'all! Specifically we were a fan of the Blanc by Gallia Paris, which you can learn about on their website but good luck since it's in French!

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Community is so incredibly important! In a culture today that values self-sufficiency and where it's every man for himself, we felt it was necessary to spend an episode covering one of the key fundamental values in our lives: community. Specifically we discuss how <strong>community can save you money</strong>, how it can <strong>help you out in a pinch</strong>, and how it <strong>contributes to a healthy and balanced life</strong>. Even though we love to talk about saving money, there are things you just can’t purchase that community provides, and we really had a great time covering those topics.</p><p>We also spend a minute talking about digital communities and how they are awesome… but they shouldn’t replace physical and neighborhood community in your life.</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we shared a bottle of Hello Beautiful by Monday Night Brewing, which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Credit cards can be a double-edged financial tool, and in this episode we cover how you can use them like a pro. Do you find yourself carrying a balance from one month to the next? Or are you tempted to overspend when you know you can just put it on credit? If so, then credit cards are NOT for you. For everyone else there are awesome benefits like earning cash back and scoring huge sign up bonuses, not to mention it's easier to track your expenses (which is an important step when creating a budget). Listen to the full episode to hear us weigh the pros and cons of using credit cards!</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we popped open a bottle of Boulevard's Love Child No. 8, which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

There are some key factors that you need to know since they make up your credit score.<strong></strong></p><p>The 5 factors that make up your credit score:</p><p></p><p>Payment history, 35%Credit utilization or amount owed, 30%Length of credit history, 15%Credit mix, 10%New credit, 10%</p><p>And some good sites where you can check your credit score for free are Credit Sesame and Credit Karma. Most credit cards are also offering a free credit score, but Joel and I are both fans of Discover's Credit Scorecard. And at the beginning of this episode we both opened a bottle of Oak-Aged Vanilla World Wide Stout by Dogfish Head, which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Investing for your retirement is way simpler and easier than you think- and I'm going to prove it. Do these 2 things and you'll be a millionaire by the time you retire (I'm not even exaggerating one bit!):</p><p><strong>1. Open your retirement accounts:</strong>401k – If your employer offers a retirement plan like a 401k, especially with a match, start contributing immediately!!! Since a ton of employers offer a 50% match, you won't be able to find a better return on your investment anywhere. At the very least contribute up to your employer match, or you can really get after it and fully fund it at $18,500.IRA – Next thing to consider is opening an IRA (individual retirement account), specifically a ROTH IRA given the recent changes in tax law. This is not an employer offered retirement plan, so anyone can open one of these accounts. It's as easy as opening a savings account online, no joke. The only downside to the IRA is that your contributions are limited at $5,500 per year (but don't forget you can open a spousal IRA too, so $11,000 combined!). We <strong>highly</strong> recommend <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/home/">Vanguard</a>.<strong>2. Start investing:</strong>Take Warren Buffett's timeless advice and only buy funds or etfs that are widely diversified and have low expense ratios (like around .05%).Joel is 100% invested in <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0585&amp;FundIntExt=INT&amp;from=mfsResults&amp;funds_disable_redirect=true">VTSAX</a> and I'm 100% invested in <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0968&amp;FundIntExt=INT&amp;funds_disable_redirect=true">VOO</a>. Again we are both big fans of Vanguard but both Fidelity and Schwab have some good low-cost funds as well.Keep investing and don't stop. That's it!And at the beginning of this episode we cracked open a couple local brews by Ironmonger Brewing Company- Damascus IPA and Anvil DIPA which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We spend this entire episode covering what you should do with your tax refund! First of all, you shouldn't be receiving a big refund when April 15th rolls around- if you are, talk to HR and have your tax withholding decreased so the IRS is taking a smaller bite out of your paycheck. We would rather see you proactively do something with that money on a regular basis as opposed to waiting on that 'windfall' once a year. So do that first. Next, here are the top 5 things you need to be doing with your tax refund:</p><p>Pay off high interest debt - any debt with an interest rate approaching double digits, or higher, wipe it out.Emergency fund - at least have $1000 for an emergency fund, preferably 3-6 months of living expenses.Invest it - put that money to work whether it be in a 401k, real estate, or small business!Give it to charity - be generous. Check out Give.org and become a better giver.Treat yo self - but avoid those pony expenses.And at the beginning of this episode we popped open a barrel aged saison- Joie by Westbrook Brewing which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to subscribe and review us in iTunes, Stitcher, or wherever you get your podcasts!</p><p>For specific links and additional information about this episode, head over to our site: <a href="https://www.howtomoney.com/">HowToMoney.com</a> .
