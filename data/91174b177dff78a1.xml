			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you find yourself having a rough go with your business? Or maybe you haven’t even started yet because you don’t know what your business should be? Well today Zach is going to help you get in your lane by figuring out 4 simple areas. Figuring these things out will help us get crystal clear on our mission, we’ll be able to map it out, and give it the time it deserves to flourish.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, you need to find what you’re passionate about. If you want to be able to do something for the long haul, it needs to be something you’re passionate about. You don’t want to do something you hate day in and day out, even if it is making you money. Next, it should be something that has purpose, that fulfills us. Ask yourself if it makes you feel accomplished, or like you’ve given something back. That will tell you if you’re on the right path. Third, you simply have to be skilled at it. Whether you’re naturally good at it, or it’s something you have to build on, skill is necessary to compete. Which brings us to the last area, opportunity. You can be passionate, fulfilled, and skilled, but if you’re not able to make money at it, it’s not really a business. So, is there a market for it that you can see yourself fitting into?</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, all of these things are simple, but they’re not necessarily easy. You’re going to have to put time and effort in. When you do find what your thing is, run with it. However, don’t forget to occasionally stop and appreciate where you’re at and how far you’ve come. Sometimes people fall into the trap of thinking they have to constantly be moving the goal post, otherwise they’re complacent.  There is a difference between complacency and being okay with where you’re at right now. You can keep that drive and that fire, but you can also celebrate your wins.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How to identify what you’re passionate about.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Why fulfillment is so important in business.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What mistake Zach has made in growing his business.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Why you need to sign up for the Alpha Underdog newsletter.</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Business is all about helping people, and you do that by having good character and having good skills.” -Zach Babcock</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get podcasting help</span> <a href="https://podcastpowertrain.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how to grow your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><br /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!

You’ll learn what content, product, or service to focus on to better service your clients. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What 4 questions you should be asking.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How to ask those questions to get honest feedback.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Why you need to sign up for the Underdog Empowerment newsletter.</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s like being a waiter, you make your customers feel comfortable, and you serve them.” - Zach Babcock</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get podcasting help</span> <a href="https://podcastpowertrain.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how to grow your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><br /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!

He often sees people searching for the next best marketing hack or sales tactic, and while you should always want to sharpen your saw, he recommends another way to really set yourself apart.

Zach had to issue some refunds and scramble to put together a new lineup. It would’ve been easier to just reschedule, but Zach said he was going to do something, so he was going to do it. Staying true to his word is one of Zach’s core values, so he’ll always do it, even when it’s difficult. He’s found that the long-term gain of staying true to your word outweighs any temporary setback. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s also staying true to working on himself, recently adding EMDR therapy to his journey.

He’s become a better husband, dad, friend, entrepreneur, and human being.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to give back, Zach is currently working on redoing his whole newsletter.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha Underdog Empowerment has hit 350 episodes, a huge milestone. Starting the podcast 4 years ago, Zach was broke and clueless, but he was determined. Since then, the brand has grown into something truly incredible. With a successful first live event this year, pulled together in just 45 days, Zach was feeling ambitious. Even though he was maxed out after that event, he decided to host another just 50 days later. The goal was to do a smaller event every 90 days, leading up to the one big yearly event. The second event, the Alpha Dog Pound, took place recently and was a learning experience. Zach decided one big event every year is good. So, with a full 10 months to plan his next big event, Zach is ready to knock it out of the park. He already has one guest speaker confirmed. It’s a big name that he’ll be dropping in the next couple months. However, if you’re looking to network and grow with a group that’s aligned with you and your core values, the Alpha Dog Pound may be a good fit. It’s a group that Zach is growing slow and methodical. With only about 10 more spots opening up next year, you can get on the waiting list at</span> <a href="http://www.alphadogpound.com"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">alphadogpound.com</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last 6 months or so, Zach has been wanting to get away from internet marketing. With everyone always posting their highlight reel, it’s become so fake. There are so many influencers out there that act like they’re better than others in an attempt to cover up their own flaws. Wouldn’t it be better if influencers stopped talking crap on others, and instead pointed out their own flaws and how they’re working on them? That’s the approach Zach has been trying to take. He feels like it’s more relatable and sets an example that, yes you can go to work on your own personal, dark demons. You can start slaying them instead of running away from them. That’s the only way to truly build the life you want. So many of us feel like we have to always be building and collecting wins, only to feel good for a short time before asking what’s next. If you want to find fulfillment, you have to deal with your issues. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zach struggled with never feeling good enough growing up. That manifested into the mindset of proving everyone wrong. That tactic was great for a time, it was necessary to survive what he’d gone through. But, after doing everything they said he’d never do, Zach still didn’t feel good enough. It was time to go from surviving to thriving. It was time to deal with his demons head on and that’s often not compatible with internet marketing. People are too busy trying to position themselves like they’re perfect and have it all going on and figured out. While it is a means to feed his family, what really keeps Zach around is the messages he receives from people saying his content has helped them. He hopes to get going in real estate so he doesn’t need to make money online anymore, because 99% of it is just trash. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s more interested in focusing his passion on the Alpha Dog Pound, and Alpha Underdog Empowerment. He reminds everyone that next time you’re going through a rough path, to remember to zoom out and look at where you were 5 years ago. 5 years ago Zach was just dreaming of the home he lives in now. He couldn't even imagine back then that he’d be into homesteading now. He’s started a garden and is about to get chickens. It’s a life skill that’s therapeutic, gives his family the best food to consume, and saves money. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How to achieve fulfillment. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The biggest mistake influencers make.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What Zach’s real estate investment plans are.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">And much more!</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Developing character and skill is a never-ending process.” -Zach Babcock</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get podcasting help</span> <a href="https://podcastpowertrain.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how to grow your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><br /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people will tell you that SEO is dead, but Adam McChesney is proof that it’s still alive and kicking. Born and raised in St Louis, MO, Adam spent 5 years in medical device sales after getting out of college. With that job he was able to travel the country, make great money, and gain a lot of sales experience. After a promotion that had him making $200k/year, Adam started looking at the people ahead of him. What he found was that they weren’t making much more than him, but were working much longer hours, and were super stressed. He realized that wasn’t the path for him, and he started looking into the next Ebay or Amazon drop shipping. What he found instead was an opportunity in digital real estate, but with digital marketing. He learned how to build websites, rent them out, do paid ads, and ultimately sell them off. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018 he ended up starting an auto glass company. Not knowing the first thing about that industry, he was still securing a top rank on Google just by utilizing SEO. Adam got married at the end of 2019 and knew he wanted to design his life around when he wanted to work. He decided 2020 would be his year to dive into digital marketing full time. Then, the pandemic hit. No longer traveling for work, Adam had a lot of time to work on building more websites. In 6 weeks time, he went from making nothing with digital marketing to $10k in recurring revenue. So, in July 2020 he put his 2 weeks notice in and went out on his own. A couple months in, Adam realized he didn’t know as much as he thought he did, so he started investing in mastermind courses and coaching.  The investment paid off with his business taking off at the end of 2020. Because Adam knew how to do everything, he tried to do it all himself. Quickly realizing that wasn’t sustainable, Adam started bringing other people in. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam’s company works with a lot of local businesses that have several locations and want to take their business to the next level. Knowing that each platform has its own algorithm for SEO, Adam utilizes two components, Google business listing, and website. There are a lot of ways to get SEO, and there are different things on the back end of a website that Google is looking at. Two main things are the number of words on each page, and quality of content being written. Each page also has a tag and description that only Google and SEO providers will see. Adam says that any image or video on your site should also have keywords added to them. Every time you add a new piece of content to your website, it will start to come up for more keywords. While SEO is great, it doesn’t happen overnight, so about 25-30% of Adam’s clients will still utilize paid ads in the meantime. He says that one reason they’re so successful is because everything they’re doing for their clients, they're also doing for their own businesses. So many people will try to sell stuff they’ve never even done for themselves.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam attributes his strong work ethic to his father who worked as a lawyer. He started out working for a large firm, but started his own firm when Adam was in 8th grade. Around this time, Adam started working at his grandparents bakery. Just before Adam went off to college, his parents ended up getting a divorce, but he says they still both remained very supportive and got along great. One thing Adam did learn from his father working so much, was that he didn’t want to become that guy in corporate America that thinks the only way to make more money is by putting in more hours. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam has a strong plan for the next 5 years, but he admits he wasn’t always good at planning for the future. With employees to think about now, Adam needs to think about how to get the agency to a place where it can provide for the entire team. Having grown from zero to 7-figures in 18 months, they’re on pace to do $1.5million+ this year. Thinking of the big picture, Adam reminds himself that bigger is not better, better is better. One thing he has learned as an entrepreneur is that shiny object syndrome is real. A mentor taught him that your main thing should be fully automated to run without you for a month+ before you should go start something else. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a personal level, Adam says he had an aha moment a month ago about becoming the person he wants to be. He’s now 3 weeks sober and ready to step into the next season and level of his life. He says that season will most likely include becoming a father. Through his journey, Adam has learned the importance of two things, the importance of core values, and why you need processes and systems. He says with core values you’ll make better decisions and attract the right people and clients. With processes and systems, you can remove yourself from the business so you have more than just a job. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How SEO works and why you need it. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The difference between having a job and having a business. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What being involved in sports can do for your character.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How to overcome shiny object syndrome. </span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Google is a beast, and you want to keep feeding the beast.” -Adam McChesney</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Connect With Adam:</strong></p> <p><a href="http://www.adammcchesney.com"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Website</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get podcasting help</span> <a href="https://podcastpowertrain.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how to grow your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><br /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!

A couple months in, Adam realized he didn’t know as much as he thought he did, so he started investing in mastermind courses and coaching.  The investment paid off with his business taking off at the end of 2020. Because Adam knew how to do everything, he tried to do it all himself. Quickly realizing that wasn’t sustainable, Adam started bringing other people in. </p> <p> </p> <p>Adam’s company works with a lot of local businesses that have several locations and want to take their business to the next level. Knowing that each platform has its own algorithm for SEO, Adam utilizes two components, Google business listing, and website. There are a lot of ways to get SEO, and there are different things on the back end of a website that Google is looking at. Two main things are the number of words on each page, and quality of content being written. Each page also has a tag and description that only Google and SEO providers will see. Adam says that any image or video on your site should also have keywords added to them. Every time you add a new piece of content to your website, it will start to come up for more keywords. While SEO is great, it doesn’t happen overnight, so about 25-30% of Adam’s clients will still utilize paid ads in the meantime. He says that one reason they’re so successful is because everything they’re doing for their clients, they're also doing for their own businesses. So many people will try to sell stuff they’ve never even done for themselves.</p> <p> </p> <p>Adam attributes his strong work ethic to his father who worked as a lawyer. He started out working for a large firm, but started his own firm when Adam was in 8th grade. Around this time, Adam started working at his grandparents bakery. Just before Adam went off to college, his parents ended up getting a divorce, but he says they still both remained very supportive and got along great. One thing Adam did learn from his father working so much, was that he didn’t want to become that guy in corporate America that thinks the only way to make more money is by putting in more hours. </p> <p> </p> <p>Adam has a strong plan for the next 5 years, but he admits he wasn’t always good at planning for the future. With employees to think about now, Adam needs to think about how to get the agency to a place where it can provide for the entire team. Having grown from zero to 7-figures in 18 months, they’re on pace to do $1.5million+ this year. Thinking of the big picture, Adam reminds himself that bigger is not better, better is better. One thing he has learned as an entrepreneur is that shiny object syndrome is real. A mentor taught him that your main thing should be fully automated to run without you for a month+ before you should go start something else. </p> <p> </p> <p>On a personal level, Adam says he had an aha moment a month ago about becoming the person he wants to be. He’s now 3 weeks sober and ready to step into the next season and level of his life. He says that season will most likely include becoming a father. Through his journey, Adam has learned the importance of two things, the importance of core values, and why you need processes and systems. He says with core values you’ll make better decisions and attract the right people and clients. With processes and systems, you can remove yourself from the business so you have more than just a job. </p> <p> </p> <p>What You’ll Learn:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">How SEO works and why you need it. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The difference between having a job and having a business. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What being involved in sports can do for your character.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">How to overcome shiny object syndrome. </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Favorite Quote:</p> <p>“Google is a beast, and you want to keep feeding the beast.” -Adam McChesney</p> <p> </p> <p>Connect With Adam:</p> <p><a href="http://www.adammcchesney.com">Website</a></p> <p> </p> <p>How to Get Involved:</p> <p>Get podcasting help <a href="https://podcastpowertrain.com/">here</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p>For more on <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970"> how to grow your business</a>, check out this episode. </p> <p> If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178"> Apple Podcasts</a> - leave a review and let us know what you thought!

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to take your marketing to the next level, Joshua Centers is the man to talk to. It took him a while to discover his passion for marketing, but now there’s no turning back. After high school, Josh didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life, except that he wanted to start his own business. He figured if he could make it in the Army as an infantryman, and work on his mindset, he could do anything. After 8 years of service, Josh got out, still not certain what he wanted to do. He got into sales and found himself getting a new job every 6-8 months. Eventually, he came across a webinar about starting a Facebook ads agency. He got excited and remembers rushing home to tell his wife they’d be making $10,000/month within 90 days. It wasn’t quite as easy as Josh expected, and it ended up taking him 2 years to reach that level of success. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh was thankful for that 2 year journey, however, because it gave him a chance to build up his resume and find his passion. In addition to his marketing agency, Josh also has a company called Ready, Launch, Scale, where he helps others to achieve their dream business. He recalls when he was learning to market there were endless terms and strategies, and that shiny object syndrome actually held him back. He came to realize there are some basic principles that lead to success, and that if you keep things simple with marketing, and position yourself to sound the best in your niche, you’re going to be successful.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So many things helped Josh to get to where he is today. From watching his father's hard work as a farmer, to learning to implement processes in the military, to offering solutions in the life insurance industry. One of his biggest lessons learned was the importance of setting yourself apart. For example, he says most agencies will charge an up front fee, so he decided to do something different. Josh created a program where they're so confident in what they bring to the table, that they don’t charge an upfront fee. Being different from competitors really helped them to take off.  </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh has gotten excellent at creating lead magnets. He says it’s the content before the funnel that really sells. He’s confident that Zach could sell numerous tickets to his next event with a video highlighting some of his most famous interviews, with a snapshot of his event, and a funnel that goes straight to a checkout page. For anyone who starts filling out the form but doesn’t finish, Josh recommends then making a follow-up call. Another good idea would be an email blast to all of his long-time listeners. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building your business without paid ads is very possible if you solve a specific problem. Going with the status quo isn’t something Josh recommends. He says when you get to a point of starting to build a team, operations are important. Having standard operating procedures for everything has made all the difference for Josh. He always says that setting expectations is key. You have to be as clear as possible while also understanding that it’s going to take your team a few times to get it. A good rule of thumb is, don’t expect what you don’t inspect. When creating a standard operating procedure, always ask yourself, will my team understand how to do this? Then, test them to see if they do. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, you have to do something you’re passionate about. However, even with passion, numerous people will get derailed by imposter syndrome in the beginning. Josh recommends finding the most influential person you can serve, and show them how you can make them more money. Offering your services for free is beneficial because when they win, you also win by having their influence behind you. Get some results and credibility under your belt, and then you can confidently sell your skills.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Why mindset is so important for an entrepreneur. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What app Josh recommends for building standard operating procedures.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How to combat Imposter Syndrome.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">And much more!</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody is going to build your business for you, you have to blueprint everything yourself.” -Joshua Centers</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Connect With Josh:</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.joshuafcenters.com/"><strong>Digital marketing</strong></a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.facebook.com/jfcenters"><strong>Facebook</strong></a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.facebook.com/groups/readylaunchscale"><strong>Ready, Launch, Scale</strong></a></p>]]></description>

			<title>Drastically Improve The Quality Of Your Life With Transdermal Magnesium With Kristen Bowen</title>
			<itunes:title>Drastically Improve The Quality Of Your Life With Transdermal Magnesium With Kristen Bowen</itunes:title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does better sleep, less anxiety, more focus, more energy, and an all around better quality of life sound good to you? Let’s find out how transdermal magnesium may be able to help you achieve that and more. Kristen Bowen is the owner of Living The Good Life Naturally, where they specialize in magnesium soaks, sprays, and lotions. Unlike traditional oral magnesium, there are no digestion issues, and you absorb much more with the transdermal method. Having a cell saturation of 6.3 or higher is ideal, and within just 30 days using transdermal magnesium you should be at least a 5. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristen stumbled upon transdermal magnesium after suffering through the worst health crash of her life. After having her 4th child, Kristen needed to undergo a surgery. For the next 3.5 years following the surgery, Kristen would experience daily seizures, be confined to a wheelchair, need a colonoscopy bag, and a catheter bag. This was all a massive stress on Kristen’s family, and it was her husband that ultimately discovered it was a reaction to the titanium introduced to her body. While learning to put her health back together, she discovered that it is much more expensive to be sick than it is to be healthy, so she spared no expense in the pursuit. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finding what worked for her, Kristen’s health began to dramatically improve, and people started asking questions. This is when Kristen discovered she loved talking about it, and helping other people. No matter the disease or ailment, magnesium is a great place to start, as it’s like a spark plug for your body. Many people will actually experience a tingling sensation as the lymph nodes pull the magnesium up through the feet. While you can add ¼ cup to your bath and soak your whole body, all that’s really needed is to soak your feet. Even kids can benefit from soaking, only requiring an ⅛ cup. Soaking for 20 minutes will uptake about 80% of the magnesium, where soaking for 45 minutes uptakes about 98%.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of us have experienced some sort of trauma in childhood, and that can lead to a disregulated nervous system, which leads to an increased magnesium burn rate. Other factors, such as smoking, drinking, or stress, can all deplete magnesium levels. Addressing these other factors while using transdermal magnesium is essential. It’s also important to make sure you’re getting high quality magnesium. Kristen shares that she could get it much cheaper from Utah, but it would be very high in heavy metals. All of her magnesium is sourced from deep beneath the earth’s surface from the Zechstein Sea, and is third party tested for purity. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In as little as a few weeks, people report better sleep, more stability, calmer mood, weight loss, clear skin, and blood sugar regulation. Now, Kristen wants people to have reasonable expectations. Magnesium isn’t a cure-all for everything, but it is a great starting place. For instance, if you’re still exhausted after introducing magnesium, that’s your body telling you that you are low on potassium. Magnesium and potassium work great together.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Evan is a health and fitness coach that wants to help everyone to get into the best shape of their life and stay there. Growing up, Joel read Muscle & Fitness Magazine, with a focus on having more confidence and getting girls to like him. As he left high school, he didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life, but fell into the trap of feeling like he had to figure it out. He settled on getting into police work. He served in Oakland, CA, which saw a lot of robberies and homicides. He would eventually transfer to San Francisco. It was when Joel’s first son was born that he found himself getting disenfranchised with the work. Things were getting too political, so he started to look into fitness. He began getting different fitness certifications and learning all he could about health from various experts. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Doing fitness coaching on the side, Joel made the leap to full time last October when the police department let him go for refusing to get the Covid vaccine. Having been coaching for a while, Joel felt ready to go all in. He was passionate about not only getting people physically fit, but to improve their health overall. He’s a huge advocate for clean eating and warns of the dangers of Glyphosate, a chemical that is sprayed on food crops. Joel says it does so many things to the body including leaky gut, autoimmunity, and inflammation. With traditional food, sprayed with this chemical, robbing the body of nutrients, Joel makes the case for going organic. Beyond going organic, Joel says it’s a good idea to work towards being self-sufficient. You see all the news about food plants burning down, Joel doesn’t get too much into the conspiracy theories, but still thinks it’s a good idea to be prepared. By supporting local farmers, you’re not only getting top nutrition, but also growing community with others.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to his coaching business, Joel also hosts a podcast called The Hacked Life. He interviews others who have taken a chance and done big things to inspire his listeners to take action. Joel believes that success loves speed and that we shouldn’t sit on the sidelines waiting for everything to be perfect. He encourages others to just start, to take messy action. You’ll either succeed or you’ll learn from your failures. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How intermittent fasting works.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Why weight loss isn’t as simple as maintaining a caloric deficit.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How health, wealth, and mindset are all connected.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">And much more!</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The more I stand on my truth, the more good things happen.” -Joel Evan</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><strong>Connect With Joel:</strong></p> <p><a href="http://www.joelevancoaching.com"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Coaching Website</span></a></p> <p><a href="http://www.instagram.com/joelevancoaching"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get podcasting help</span> <a href="https://podcastpowertrain.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how to grow your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was on fire at the recent Alpha Underdog Empowerment event, and today he’s here to fan the flames. Tommy Mello is a leader in the home service industry, but it took him a lot of trial and error to get there. Growing up in Michigan, Tommy learned what hard work looked like from his parents. They didn’t have a lot, but were never short on love. After his parents divorce, Tommy would end up moving to Phoenix to live with his dad in 1999. To make money, Tommy started bussing tables and washing dishes. He tried his hand at landscaping, but being allergic to grass, that didn’t go very well. He ended up finding himself in the garage door business, but realized if he were to take a vacation, the business would collapse. That told Tommy it wasn’t much of a business, just a job.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tommy went through everything from losing $30,000 to the IRS, being lied to, cheated, and even having arson done to his business. He learned from each mistake though, and now has over 500 employees, and is in 20 states. His next step is to get into acquisitions, and to do $200 million in business. After reading the book, Profit First: Transform Your Business From a Cash Eating Monster to a Money Making Machine, Tommy has learned to control spending, have a budget, and institute more follow up. He’s doubled down on branding and training, and is ready to reach for the stars. He says he also learned a lot from the book, The Compound Effect, in which the author discusses how he has to change who he is in order to attract what he wants. During Covid, Tommy tried this. He built a list of things he needed to be in order to attract high performers. Since then, he’s hired someone who’s whole job is to help the employees to dream again. Whether they want to own a home, go on a dream vacation, or put their kids in private school, as an employer, Tommy holds them accountable to their dreams.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tommy hosts a podcast called The Home Service Expert that he started when he realized other people have the same questions he does. He’s taken it a step further and written a book called Home Expert Millionaire that encourages people to pursue trades. Going into a trade can make you money and be a great job. If you need more convincing, Tommy invites everyone to check out his event taking place October 12th called Vertical Track. It will give you a lot of great information and a detailed road map of how to get to where you want to be. They’ll go over the importance of branding, building reviews, learning from your mistakes, and much more.  All you need to do is implement what you learn and hold yourself accountable. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How to be a talent magnet.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Why core values are so important.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What the difference between a manager, a technician, and a visionary is.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What the four quadrants of the Eisenhower Matrix are.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m the testament to say that it’s out there.” -Tommy Mello</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><strong>Connect With Tommy:</strong></p> <p><a href= "https://www.tiktok.com/discover/tommy-mello"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Tik Tok</span></a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/officialtommymello/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thomasmello/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get podcasting help</span> <a href="https://podcastpowertrain.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how to grow your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in the Bible Belt of West Virginia, Kris Whitehead developed a mindset that he had to be a certain way. It wasn’t until, at the age of 20, he read the book The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck that he began to look at his spiritual growth in a new light. The book goes through the 4 levels of faith, agnosticism, atheism, institutionalism, and mysticism. Kris believes it’s important for people to go through some sort of institutionalism for their faith, but if they stay in that place, they’ll never have a deeper relationship with their higher power. Kris admits that he was stuck in his own head, worried about his looks and how people perceived him.  He wanted to be free of that so badly and was led to a corporate job. But as he looked down the road, he saw his successors working 6-7 days a week with a plastic smile. Kris knew that wasn’t for him, and so he opened up the Yellow Pages and started cold calling people, looking for lawns to mow.  He figured he’d rather make $3/hour working for himself than $30/hour working for someone else.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone looking to get deeper in touch with themselves, Kris recommends the book Stealing Fire by Steven Kotler and Jamie Wheal. The book discusses ways to enter what is known as a flow state. While our conscious mind can translate 120 bits of information per minute, the unconscious mind can translate billions. Tapping into this unconscious flow state can help you do what you need to do faster and with more ease. Some of the methods for achieving this may be unconventional, but Kris says if you want to be elite, you have to be willing to ask the questions without preconceived notions.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How to grow in your faith.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How to achieve harmony in your life.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What the key to happiness is.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">And much more!!</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not about how much success you have, it’s are you fully who you are.” -Kris Whitehead</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to Connect With Kris:</strong></p> <p><a href="http://www.kriswhitehead.com"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Personal Website</span></a></p> <p><a href="http://www.iconicalliance.com"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Iconic Alliance</span></a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/kris_whitehead_official/?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instagram</span></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thekriswhitehead"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></a></p> <p><br /> <br /> <br /></p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get podcasting help</span> <a href="https://podcastpowertrain.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how to grow your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><br /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!

Some of the methods for achieving this may be unconventional, but Kris says if you want to be elite, you have to be willing to ask the questions without preconceived notions.</p> <p> </p> <p>What You’ll Learn:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">How to grow in your faith.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">How to achieve harmony in your life.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What the key to happiness is.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">And much more!!</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Favorite Quote:</p> <p>“It’s not about how much success you have, it’s are you fully who you are.” -Kris Whitehead</p> <p> </p> <p>How to Connect With Kris:</p> <p><a href="http://www.kriswhitehead.com">Personal Website</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.iconicalliance.com">Iconic Alliance</a></p> <p><a href= "https://www.instagram.com/kris_whitehead_official/?hl=en"> Instagram</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thekriswhitehead">Facebook</a></p> <p>  </p> <p>How to Get Involved:</p> <p> </p> <p>Get podcasting help <a href="https://podcastpowertrain.com/">here</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p>For more on <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970"> how to grow your business</a>, check out this episode. </p> <p> If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178"> Apple Podcasts</a> - leave a review and let us know what you thought!

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zach aims to pull the alpha out of everyone around him, including his children. Zach’s young son, Landon, joins him today to discuss a few life lessons he’s learned as of late. Landon recently faced his fears and got on stage at his dad’s live event, Alpha Underdog Empowerment. He says that while he was scared, he did it anyway, and it felt great. He’s already looking forward to his chance to do it again. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With big dreams of owning his own golf cart, 4-wheeler, dirt bike, or side by side, Landon has been working on saving his money rather than spending it as soon as he gets it. With almost $200 in the bank, Landon’s dad will match his earnings once he reaches $500. One thing is for sure, after a recent golf cart crash, Landon will be operating whatever he decides to purchase with caution. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having watched his father work hard to get their dream home, Landon hopes to follow in his dad’s footsteps. He’s ready to work hard to make his dreams come true, and aspires to have his own podcast or YouTube channel someday. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What Landon learned from getting up on stage. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What Landon is saving up his money to buy.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Who Landon’s favorite YouTube stars are.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">And much more!!</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m glad my dad worked hard for this house because he’s a really good dad.” - Landon Babcock</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get podcasting help</span> <a href="https://podcastpowertrain.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how to grow your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><br /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">Podcasts – leave a review and let us know what you thought!

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re hot off the heels of the Underdog Empowerment event, and today’s guest, Callye Keen, is fired up after attending. One of the topics touched on during the event was building a community, and today we’re taking a deep dive into why that is so important. Partnerships and collaboration are one of Callye’s biggest focuses as the Chief Business Development Officer at K-Form. He’s always asking himself, “Who can I work with? Who can I add value to? Who can I collaborate with to increase impact?” He’s well aware that no billion-dollar company was built alone. It’s no secret to Callye that we can do things together that we couldn’t do alone.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally charging a minimum of $50k as a consultant, and $3,500-$5,000/month for coaching, Callye is currently offering his expertise at a heavily discounted price. He’s doing it because he wants to meet people where they are, helping the people that need it the most. By joining his community, you’ll not only learn how to start and scale a business, but he’ll share his simple strategy he used to presell 150 $700 fidget spinners with zero dollars in ads. It’s the same strategy he’s used to sell technical products to some of the biggest tech companies, including Google and Microsoft. Callye has been designing, manufacturing, and selling products for a long time, and he has plenty of knowledge to share. To get in on the action, head over to</span> <a href= "http://www.redbluecollective.com/movement"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">www.redbluecollective.com/movement</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and sign up for just $49/month. There’s zero risk as if, after three months, you don’t think it’s worth it, Callye will refund your money.  To further sweeten the deal, Callye says to decline the upsell offer, and instead DM him to let him know you signed up because of Underdog Empowerment, and he’ll throw that upsell opportunity in for free. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Why community is so important.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The biggest mistake that entrepreneurs make when starting out.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">How to access Callye’s expertise for a heavily discounted price.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">And much more!!</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I want to be a leader of a community, I have to be able to solve the problem that they have.” -Callye Keen</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><strong>Connect With Callye:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/callyekeen/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/callyekeen?lang=en"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get podcasting help</span> <a href="https://podcastpowertrain.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how to grow your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping others to establish a dominant brand through podcasting is what Podcast Powertrain is all about.

To learn more, visit <a href= "http://www.ladopoly.io">www.ladopoly.io</a>.  </p> <p>What You’ll Learn:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">How to sign up for the first-ever Alpha Underdog Empowerment event.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What NFT’s are and how they work.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The various ways to make passive income with Ladopoly.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">And much more!!</li> </ul> <p>Favorite Quote:</p> <p>“Just hustle; if you outhustle the competition, you’re going to win everytime.”</p> <p>-Andrew Sayles</p> <p>Connect with Me:</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/closesomesayles">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewsayles/">LinkedIn</a></p> <p>How to Get Involved:</p> <p>Get podcasting help <a href="https://podcastpowertrain.com/">here</a>.</p> <p>For more on <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970"> how to grow your business</a>, check out this episode. </p> <p>If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178"> Apple Podcasts</a> - leave a review and let us know what you thought!

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 12 step program isn’t for everyone. It didn’t work for Angie Manson, so she decided to create a better way.  Her drinking and using started at just 11 years old, and Angie found herself in rehab by age 16. Like many others, all she did there was meet more people to party with. Having been arrested 8 times by age 18, Angie found herself facing embezzlement charges and 10 years in prison.  Sentenced to a year in rehab, Angie got into a place run out of a guy’s house who had helped her friend get clean.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working for her keep, Angie learned all positions in the organization. Seeing her progress over a 3 year period, the judge declared Angie a success story.  She proved him right when she went on to open her own rehab center.  One that doesn’t take the traditional 12 step course.  In Angies program you are not powerless over your addiction. It’s about addressing what happened to you, what you did in turn, and then making amends for it. Angie says making amends to yourself is often overlooked but is a vital step. She discusses topics like this and more on her podcast, The Elevate Experience.</span></p> <div> <div><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z"> Show Notes:</span> <span class= "attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url"> <a class="attrlink" title= "https://underdogempowerment.com/angie-manson" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/angie-manson" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" data-target-href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/anthony-morrison">https://underdogempowerment.com/angie-manson</a></span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z"> Get More Involved: </span></div> <ol class="listtype-number listindent1 list-number1" start="1"> <li><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z"> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:</span> <span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url"> <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></span></li> <li><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z"> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast:</span> <span class= "attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url"> <a class="attrlink" href="https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap">https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap</a></span></li> <li><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z"> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:</span> <span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url"> <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></span></li> <li><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z"> Subscribe On YouTube:</span> <span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url"> <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></span></li> </ol> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you missed it, Tim James was just on episode 325, but Zach was so impressed with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">him that he’s back again.  Tim is a true master of his craft and the best health expert this podcast has ever seen.  Zach, personally, has seen the quality of his life improve by following Tim’s recommendations.  The most recent product recommendation Tim has made was for grounding pads.  Zach says the first night he used it, he slept like a baby.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim is full of all the information you wish you didn’t know.

Joe Robert grew up wanting to be independent, and so at a young age he started shoveling snow and doing landscaping.  Once he started working, he never stopped.  Joe was able to purchase his first property at the age of 19, which was unheard of back then.  He learned quickly that real estate was a great avenue to invest in.  Joe began his real estate career by establishing relationships and trust with the community.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe knows how to spot a quality property and location to invest in.  A lot of people are into flipping properties quickly, but often it can pay off to hold onto a property for 10+ years.  You can make passive income on it in the meantime and then sell when it’s appreciated enough. Another up and coming investment opportunity is in crypto.  Joe shares all his tips and tricks for getting started.

He follows that with a dip in the ice barrel to bring his energy back up and curb his procrastination and stress.</p>   Show Notes:  <a class="attrlink" title= "https://underdogempowerment.com/seth-humphrey" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/seth-humphrey" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-target-href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/anthony-morrison">https://underdogempowerment.com/seth-humphrey</a>     Get More Involved:  <ol class="listtype-number listindent1 list-number1" start="1"> <li> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></li> <li> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap">https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap</a></li> <li> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></li> <li> Subscribe On YouTube:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></li> </ol> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

What defines your character?  It's important to know these things.  Take the time to really dial in what you want to bring to the world.  Define it, put it on paper, and memorize it. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any input on these core values, Zach would love to hear from you.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to heal, all you need to do is activate your inner healing process. Our bodies are meant to mend themselves. Your job is to get out of your own way and let your breathing and cognitive habits take over.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Florence is an expert when it comes to breathwork, biohacking, and hypnotherapy. After a head injury, he found himself seeking out cold therapy to bring himself back and evolve his health. Now, he lives his life in pursuit of one goal: helping others achieve and maintain a flow state. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this episode of Underdog Empowerment, David surveys what he knows about creating flow states, and how he knows it.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to heal, all you need to do is activate your inner healing process. Our bodies are meant to mend themselves. Your job is to get out of your own way and let your breathing and cognitive habits take over.</p> <p>David Florence is an expert when it comes to breathwork, biohacking, and hypnotherapy. After a head injury, he found himself seeking out cold therapy to bring himself back and evolve his health. Now, he lives his life in pursuit of one goal: helping others achieve and maintain a flow state. </p> <p>On this episode of Underdog Empowerment, David surveys what he knows about creating flow states, and how he knows it. He knows exactly what kind of breathwork to prescribe to each kind of individual, from those with mild anxiety to those with PTSD. Doing breathwork will do more for you than just clear your mind; it can also help you deal with inner trauma, and help you along your healing path.

When you value yourself and your potential, and you do the work, you’ll be surprised at your own momentum, and you’ll be leveling-up in no time.

His first company started in a bedroom, with an ironing board as a desk, and evolved into a multi-million dollar company. Then, the recession of 2007 hit, and he had to start all over again. Since he did, he’s learned a lot: how to use your business as a tool to reach the life you want, how to bounce back from hardship, how to seek out people to learn from, and apply their teachings to your own world.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecommerce, production design, marketing–there’s a lot that goes into a successful apparel brand. The question Ryan wants you to consider is, what is your target audience actually wearing, and how can you create a brand that they’ll want to wear? </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Williams is an entrepreneur and a former Navy SEAL. He  founded Industry Threadworks as a response to the poor communication and unfulfilled promises he found from other apparel sourcing companies. Now, he prioritizes accuracy and reliability in his quickly growing Private Label service.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this episode of Underdog Empowerment, follow along with Ryan’s journey, from his work as a SEAL to the foundation of his entrepreneurial career.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever experienced a lull of low energy that you just can’t shake? Or a feeling of uneasiness in public, or the overwhelming urge to scream or cry? Tiffany’s here to reassure you why all of those things are happening, and what you can do about it.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiffany Toombs is the founder of the Blue Lotus Mind Institute, a coaching business focused on helping others heal their traumas and find empowerment in themselves. She is certified in many practices including Archetypal therapy, Athletic therapy, and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). She’s here today to focus on inner child work, and introduce you to the world inside of yourself. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this episode of Underdog Empowerment, step in for a session with coach Tiffany Toombs.

Even if you regularly feel high-strung like Marshal, all it takes is three minutes a day of conscious breathing to reset your mindset. Yes, it’s really that easy.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marshal Gillen is an award-winning speaker and primal performance coach who has helped his clients earn over $114M in revenue. Over two million people have been impacted by his work.

They break down why it works–why going out in nature, breathing right, and tapping into your inner frequency will give you the full charge you need to feel satisfied each day. After tapping into today’s show, you’ll have your pick of self-care practices to experiment with–magnesium soaks, biohacking, grounding, you name it.

For them, something as simple as a hike can form a direct link between yourself and a bigger, higher power. Whether it’s going barefoot, breathing intentionally, or meditating, Paul wants you to dive into it; he swears by the power of the flow state that can be achieved by connecting to yourself.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may think you’ve achieved success, but were you able to hold on to it? Were you able to continue to maintain relationships and a healthy lifestyle while also flourishing in your career?

Plant-based medicine can help you relax but it can also be a mode to recovery for anyone from athletes to addicts trying to rebuild what is broken. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Roberts is the founder and owner of Pure Body Zen, a firefighter, and the host of the Good Dudes Grow Podcast. After tragically losing his daughter to opioid addiction, Gary discovered the healing nature of cannabis products and set out on a mission to not only educate others about plant-based medicine but also help those struggling with their mental and physical heath find the path to recovery.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this episode of Underdog Empowerment, Gary tells Zach about his dream: to build a recovery center that uses plant-based medicine to help those suffering from addiction and trauma. He explains how the facility will embrace scientifically proven therapies, separating it from the experimental nature that is often associated with products like CBD. Listen in for an episode that will educate you on this natural healing process. </span></p> <p> </p> <span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z">Show Notes:</span> <span class= "attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url"> <a class="attrlink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/plant-based-medicine" target= "_blank" rel="noopener" data-target-href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/anthony-morrison">https://underdogempowerment.com/plant-based-medicine</a></span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z"> Get More Involved: </span></div> <div> </div> <ol class="listtype-number listindent1 list-number1" start="1"> <li><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z"> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:</span> <span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url"> <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></span></li> <li><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z"> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast:</span> <span class= "attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url"> <a class="attrlink" href="https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap">https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap</a></span></li> <li><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z"> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:</span> <span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url"> <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></span></li> <li><span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z"> Subscribe On YouTube:</span> <span class= "author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url"> <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></span></li> </ol>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you trapped in a cycle -- deriving power from your own dysfunction?

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do you get up and get to work every day? The answer is different for everyone.

Tune in for an interview with a true achiever that will get you fired up to push forward through whatever roadblock you got in front of you.       Show Notes:  <a class="attrlink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/quentin-gause" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/quentin-gause">https://underdogempowerment.com/quentin-gause</a>    Get More Involved:    <ol class="listtype-number listindent1 list-number1" start="1"> <li> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></li> <li> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap">https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap</a></li> <li> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></li> <li> Subscribe On YouTube:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></li> </ol>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ You're lying to yourself. In fact, most of us are. It's how we're raised - we're taught to be quiet and polite and follow the plan, and we swallow our individualities and drives and needs to fit in. Time to break that silence and speak your truth.    Sean Whalen found his liberation after he hit rock bottom and lost everything, including his wife, his kids, his money, and his respect. It was only then that he hauled himself up, took responsibility and forged his future in radical honesty with himself and the rest of the world. Sean is also the founder and CEO of Lions Not Sheep, a global movement that reflects his drive to help others stand out as leaders rather than society's followers.    On this episode of Underdog Empowerment, Zach and Sean jam on pursuing the truth after a lifetime of being programmed to lie, how to build yourself up to your full potential  (and  why you deserve to have a little bit of an ego), and the indescribable freedom Sean found when he dove into his darkness and made it his message.

McCabe’s 20-year love story warped into a nightmare with the onset of everything from his own health issues to growing mistrust between himself and his  (now  ex) wife to death threats and private investigators.

Probably tons - because it’s much easier to slack off than to run an ethical, value-driven business. But there are those out there who are dedicated to changing the game...    Trevor Cowley and Kale Goodman are two of the minds behind Real Business Owners, a credit repair and accounting company that goes the extra mile past simply crunching numbers. Trevor and Kale are on a mission to do and model better practices for other entrepreneurs getting lost in the Internet bullshit.    On this episode of the Underdog Empowerment Show, Zach, Trevor and Kale dig into how the right culture and environment for your business takes your whole team to the next level, identifying the cracks in the system as a business grows and expands so you can strengthen those areas, and the tools you can use to attract people to your business, make sure they know, like and trust you, and serve them at the highest level possible. Tune in for real advice with real value from real business owners.      Show Notes:  <a class="attrlink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/real-business-owners" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/real-business-owners">https://underdogempowerment.com/real-business-owners</a>    Get More Involved:    <ol class="listtype-number listindent1 list-number1" style= "list-style-type: decimal;" start="1"> <li> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></li> <li> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap">https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap</a></li> <li> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></li> <li> Subscribe On YouTube:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></li> </ol>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[   Are you running your business? Or is your business running you? See, most of us feel like we’re on top of the world when we’re working 24/7 and completely tied into every piece of whatever we do. This is not true, and it’s not healthy.    Michael Michalowicz is an entrepreneur and author with bestselling business titles like  <em>Clockwork: Design Your Business to Run Itself</em>  and  <em>Fix This Next</em>  to his name  (among  many others). Nearly all of his work is centered on this one mission: to eradicate  “entrepreneur  poverty” and help the self-starters of the world build the business of their dreams without that business running them - or running them into the ground.    On this episode of the Underdog Empowerment podcast, Zach and Michael break down the lies we have begun to believe about entrepreneurship and the  “constant  hustle” mentality plus how we can build our businesses up better than that, ditching the complexity in order to exponentially boost your efficiency, and why not knowing the rules of the game is your greatest advantage. Tune in for a supercharged interview that will get you headed in the right direction, wherever it is you want to go.    Show Notes:  <a class="attrlink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/michael-michalowicz" target= "_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/michael-michalowicz">https://underdogempowerment.com/michael-michalowicz</a>    Get More Involved:    <ol class="listtype-number listindent1 list-number1" style= "list-style-type: decimal;" start="1"> <li> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></li> <li> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast:  <a class="attrlink" href="https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap">https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap</a></li> <li> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></li> <li> Subscribe On YouTube:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></li> </ol>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[  When did you lose sight of the thing that got you into your entrepreneurship? It happens to most of us at some point; but there's no damn excuse for lying down when it does. Get your team together, get centered and get busy.    Anthony Sarandrea is a legend of lead generation, as well as a wildly influential keynote speaker, philanthropist and entrepreneur. Having been featured everywhere from Forbes to Inc., Entrepreneur and beyond, Anthony continues to raise the bar for entrepreneurs the world over.    On this episode of the Underdog Empowerment podcast, Zach and Anthony jam on the need to find the right people to keep around and figure out where those people should be placed, balancing risk and reward  (not  to mention you versus everyone else) when it comes to investing the dollars in your pocket, valuing the masterful shit you bring to the table correctly, and relentlessly pursuing that thing that drives and inspires you, staying dedicated to growth at all times. Tune in to reignite that spark that got you where you are today.     Shownotes: <a href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/anthony-sarandrea/" target= "_blank" rel= "noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/anthony-sarandrea/</a>    Get More Involved:    <ol class="listtype-number listindent1 list-number1" start="1"> <li> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></li> <li> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast: <a href= "https://www.podcastpenthouse.com/roadmaps/">https://www.podcastpenthouse.com/roadmaps/</a></li> <li> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></li> <li> Subscribe On YouTube:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></li> </ol>]]></content:encoded>

There are all kinds of tools and media, but choose wisely. The best strategy is one that fits perfectly with you.    Charley Valher went from an average career as a plumber to the elite among online advertising agencies due in part to his love of podcasts. Now, Charley hosts his own podcast, The Business of Podcasting, and continues to help entrepreneurs build stellar shows of their own through his company, Valher Media.    On this episode of the Underdog Empowerment podcast, Zach and Charley break down the secrets of paid ads and podcasts, including unorthodox-but-effective targeting methods, choosing the ideal platform(s) for your advertising campaign, and how to avoid the most common mistakes made by rookie podcasters. Tune in to hear the marketing advice that's about to put you ahead of your peers.     Shownotes: <a href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/charley-valher/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/charley-valher/</a>    Get More Involved:    <ol class="listtype-number listindent1 list-number1" start="1"> <li> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></li> <li> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast: <a href= "https://www.podcastpenthouse.com/roadmaps/">https://www.podcastpenthouse.com/roadmaps/</a></li> <li> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></li> <li> Subscribe On YouTube:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></li> </ol>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[  Fame is rarely glamorous. Not every artist with a big following has had their career handed to them on a silver platter. There are those who fought for every step, pulling themselves ahead of the pack and changing their corner of the industry forever.    Futuristic is a household name at this point. Like most others, though, he didn’t start out that way. He grew up simply working hard, immersing himself in music and learning how to run a business with integrity and accountability. Now, as a mature artist with his star rising, Futuristic continues to pump out chart-topping hits like  "Pull  Up" and  "The  Greatest" amassing millions of loyal followers and constantly playing with different genres and styles.    On this episode of the Underdog Empowerment podcast, Zach and Futuristic jam on the importance of embracing the  “business”  part of the music business, attracting the people that align with who you are, and finding ways to stay hungry and motivated even when you’ve reached the top. Tune in to get to know the man behind the legendary music.      Show Notes: <a href="https://underdogempowerment.com/futuristic/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/futuristic/</a>    Get More Involved:    <ol class="listtype-number listindent1 list-number1" start="1"> <li> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></li> <li> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast: <a href= "https://www.podcastpenthouse.com/roadmaps/">https://www.podcastpenthouse.com/roadmaps/</a></li> <li> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></li> <li> Subscribe On YouTube:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></li> </ol>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[   Running a business seems complicated. Whether you’re a one-man-show or the guy in charge of an entire team, it’s easy to lose sight of the reason your business exists: to serve your people, and serve them to the best of your ability.    Russ Ruffino built Clients on Demand from a desire to do more than just release content that keeps the audience happy but doesn’t inspire action. Once he put his focus on premium offers built to meet his clients’ needs, everything changed. Russ now pours his experience into others who are looking to follow in his footsteps.     On this episode of the Underdog Empowerment podcast, Zach and Russ jam on the formula that separates legit entrepreneurs from scammy online  “experts”,  building a business that functions like a machine - one that you actually understand - to get you where you want to go, and how keeping your integrity as you grow gets you 90% of the way to the success you’re after. Listen in for the tools you need to set your business apart from the rest.     Show Notes: <a href="https://underdogempowerment.com/russ-ruffino/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/russ-ruffino/</a>     Get More Involved:  <ol class="listtype-number listindent1 list-number1" start="1"> <li> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></li> <li> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></li> <li> Join The Elite Underdog Alphas With The Free Underdog Report:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/report" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/report</a></li> <li> Subscribe On YouTube:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></li> </ol>]]></content:encoded>

Fact is, if you’re spending more time dreaming than you are doing, it’s time to switch up your approach and start making some progress.    John Bourgeois founded the Dreamcatcher Show to connect with people who are, simply, crushing it in their own personal arenas. The point is to dissect real, no-BS success so listeners can stop reaching for what they want and just go get it.    On this episode of the Underdog Empowerment podcast, Zach and John jam on learning from mistakes and constructive criticism, why confidence is essential to succeeding at literally anything  (and  why humility is overrated), and the actual definition of what we call  “selflessness.”  Join in to bypass the information overload on the Internet and figure out how to get where you want to go. <p> Show Notes: <a href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/john-bourgeois/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/john-bourgeois/</a></p> <p>Get More Involved:  1.

Join the conversation to shift your mindset beyond what seems possible.      Show Notes: <a href="https://underdogempowerment.com/alex-morton/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/alex-morton/</a>    Get More Involved:  <ol class="listtype-number listindent1 list-number1" start="1"> <li> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></li> <li> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></li> <li> Join The Elite Underdog Alphas With The Free Underdog Report:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/report" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/report</a></li> <li> Subscribe On YouTube:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></li> </ol> ]]></content:encoded>

Listen in to learn how to crush your fears and keep moving forward.    Show Notes: <a href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/7-figure-mindset/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/7-figure-mindset/</a>    Get More Involved:  <ol class="listtype-number listindent1 list-number1" start="1"> <li> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></li> <li> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></li> <li> Join The Elite Underdog Alphas With The Free Underdog Report:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/report" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/report</a></li> <li> Subscribe On YouTube:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></li> </ol>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[  What are the principles that drive the way you market?  “Shiny  Object Syndrome” is a constant temptation for entrepreneurs and business owners, but every truly successful giant in marketing knows the value of getting back to basics.    Brian Kurtz is a legend in the world of direct response marketing. After spending decades helping an elite publishing company reach the 9-figure mark, Brian threw himself even further into his love of direct marketing. He wrote  <em>Overdeliver</em>, which remains a staple of the industry, and he continues to teach others the foundational principles of passionate, effective marketing while embracing innovation.    On this episode of the Underdog Empowerment podcast, Brian and Zach break down the holy grail of lifetime value, which three factors of your direct marketing will put you on the path to success, and why your business lives and dies by your list.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Mitch Russo was the lead guitar player for his high school rock band.     Besides being the best way ever to meet girls, it taught him how to build, run and promote a business. His band; Absolutely Free, was the highest paid high school rock band in his school district, making over $500 a night, and that was in 1970.     In 1985, Mitch co-founded Timeslips Corp, which grew to become the largest time tracking Software Company in the world. In 1994, Timeslips Corp was sold to Sage, plc. While at Sage, Mitch went on to run all of Sage U.S. as Chief Operating Officer, a division with 300 people with a market cap in excess of $100M.    Mitch Russo was nominated for Inc. Magazine’s  “Entrepreneur  of the Year” on two separate occasions, 1989 and 1991.    Mitch Russo joined long time friend Chet Holmes and Tony Robbins and together created Business Breakthroughs, Int'l, a company serving thousands of businesses a year with coaching, consulting and training services. Mitch was the President and CEO.     After the untimely death of Chet, Mitch left Business Breakthroughs to help others build their business as a consultant specializing in working with call centers with large volume lead flow and helping coaching organizations scale.     In 2015, Mitch published  “The  Invisible Organization” which is the CEO’s guide to transitioning a traditional brick and mortar company into a fully virtual organization.     In 2017, Mitch launched a SaaS platform called The Results Breakthrough Network, to match entrepreneurs for the purpose of holding regular accountability sessions to complete their goals and be successful.     In 2018, Mitch published his second book: Power Tribes – How Certification Can Explode Your Business.     Mitch’s Podcast: Your First Thousand Clients, focuses on discovering the secrets of success from business owners who have served 1000 clients or more.     TODAY, Mitch helps his clients build recurring revenue streams by using his proprietary certification training and podcasts with super smart business owners.     In this interview, we talk about what it really means to be an entrepreneur building a real company, and how you can get ahead of nearly 90% of everyone in your space.    Show Notes: <a href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/mitch-russo/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/mitch-russo/</a>    Get More Involved:    <ol class="listtype-number listindent1 list-number1" start="1"> <li> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></li> <li> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></li> <li> Join The Elite Underdog Alphas With The Free Underdog Report:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/report" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/report</a></li> <li> Subscribe On YouTube:  <a class="dynamiclink" href= "https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube" target="_blank" rel= "noreferrer nofollow noopener">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></li> </ol>]]></content:encoded>
