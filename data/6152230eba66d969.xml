   <media:description>C++20 was big - very big indeed. Some even say it had brought so many innovations that it might overwhelm not only users, but also the compiler developers and standard library implementers, so that the C++ committee better was not to bring any major innovations in C++23. Nevertheless, there was of course a bold plan for all the exciting new things that should be prioritised as goals for the upcoming standard. And then came the pandemic and with it - by necessity - new approaches of working together on the specification of C++23.

In the meantime, it has been largely clarified what we can expect with the upcoming standard. Major deviations from it are unlikely to happen, but minor things that are already in the pipeline may still be added in the coming months.

I will present the following main points:

1) what was the Bold Plan that guided us through three years of development?
2) what is already included in the draft and what is likely to be included?
3) what could unfortunately not be finished in time?
4) which changes also affect C++20?
5) where do the implementations of the major compilers stand in terms of implementation?
6) show a few highlights from C++23 in code examples

   <media:description>I wrote a patch.

Modified/condition decision coverage (MC/DC) is a useful tool for code correctness and is particularly important in safety oriented industries like automotive and aerospace. While there are techniques for doing it manually, condition coverage benefits greatly from tooling.

I designed an algorithm for figuring out condition coverage from control flow graphs and implemented it in gcc. This talk covers what MC/DC is, why you should do it, and shows why a little bit of theory can make very beautiful programs.

   <media:description>The C++ type system is both very weak and very strong.

In this presentation I will show you how using the strengths of the type system makes your code better.

I will show you how types...
* prevents incorrect code from compiling
* improves readability of code
* reduces the risks when changing code

and I will show you how very simple changes to your code will take you far in the desired direction.

   <media:description>When it comes to building applications, there's no shortage of frameworks that claim to do it all but the reality is that they either focus on iOS and Android, or desktop, or they're just a web technology. This session provides an overview of the Uno Platform, a set of tools and technologies that allow you to deliver native applications for iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS, Linux and Web, all from a single codebase of C# and XAML. Whilst other technologies are still scrambling to simply ship a stable product, Uno also delivers tooling such as hot reload, plugins for Figma and Extensions to help with Configuration, Logging and Navigation. You leave this session with a roadmap for how you can get started building your next application for mobile, desktop or even the web.

   <media:description>For those of us who are already using token-based authentication in our environments, abstraction and standards mean we don't often have to worry about the details of the libraries we use in our software. For those of us not using token-based authentication, perhaps the value isn't immediately obvious.

In this session, we're going to strip back the covers and take a look at where token-based authentication came from, what problems it was designed to solve, and how it actually works under the hood.

Even though you're probably never going to have to write your own authentication, knowing what's happening will keep you and your users safer, and could even prevent an oversight or security vulnerability in the future.

   <media:description>What if we could interpret the sentiment and opinion of spam messages, and then respond? What if we could turn spam against itself? In this talk Lars will do just that using the power of cloud computing, machine learning and very very cute llama photos. Most likely without angering the spam gods.

   <media:description>Apollo federation enables you to architect, build and connect multiple distributed GraphQL microservices. In a microservices world, you'll eventually run into the situation where you need to query distributed APIs. GraphQL microservices are no different. Whether they are created using AWS AppSync or Apollo Server, you have to query these distributed GraphQL microservices in your client application. If you had to connect to each one in your client application, you must authenticate against all these GraphQL APIs as they have different domains. Apollo Federation Gateway enables you to combine the distributed GraphQL subgraphs into one so that your client sends queries to one endpoint.

You'll learn the power of Apollo Federation and how it is used to connect distributed GraphQL microservices built using AWS AppSync and Apollo Server in Azure Function.

   <media:description>Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected items or events in data sets. It’s about detecting the deviation from expected pattern of a dataset. It’s like having “spidey senses” for your apps that can detect when there’s danger or something is not right. Attend this session and learn about using anomaly detection in javascript and Cognitive Services API, become a superhero and save the day.

   <media:description>To deal with uncertainty, you have to design your software to be resilient. This session will review the most useful patterns for building resilient applications such as graceful degradation, timeouts, exponential back-off, and circuit breakers. It will also explore how we can test our assumptions by injecting failure into our applications and uncovering our weaknesses. You will leave with an understanding of how to build more resilient applications and several patterns that you can apply to your software development projects.

   <media:description>In a connected, global world there are a surprising number of problems with formatting text for our users. Did you know how many different ways there are to format a number? Or pluralise a noun? Or display a date? And let's not get into doing time zone maths for those dates. Internationalising an app by hand, and doing it correctly, could be a never-ending, full-time job.

The Intl namespace is home to the ECMAScript Internationalization API and contains the solutions to many of our formatting problems. In this talk we'll explore the available APIs that can make it easier to build a truly international application.

With Intl we can build apps that cater to all our users, wherever they are, however they write things down.

   <media:description>Microservice is a blazing topic today. From SMEs to large corporations, building solution in microservice architecture has been the trend. However, how to quickly build and deploy the microservice to production across different environments while keeping the impact to the live production side to the minimal have been a challenge.

In my talk, I will show the audience how to build the DevOps pipeline and work out a release strategy to better deploy micro-services into production. I call it MicroDevOps. We will use Azure DevOps to build a proof of concept to showcase the concept of blue green deployment and best practises to bring a microservice solution into production.

   <media:description>Kubernetes is an amazingly powerful and flexible platform that introduces a range of new complexities and required knowledge. Sometimes we need that all that control, but sometimes developers just need a scalable, reliable and low friction place to run our micro-services.
Azure Container Apps aims to meet this need by providing an opinionated Kubernetes environment configured with battle-tested opensource components and management practices.
This session will showcase a day in the life of a development team using Azure Container Apps and Dapr to see if the control trade-off lives up to its promise.

   <media:description>In this session we'll run through everything needed to build a Robot Arm with a Raspberry Pi, .NET 6 a Blazor App and SignalR.

We'll begin by seeing how easy it is to install .NET 6.

Then we'll see how we've connected up the various components to our Raspberry Pi.

Next we'll spin up a console application to explore how we can control the GPIO on the Pi.

We'll then examine the code to start moving the connected servos for our Raspberry pi based Robot Arm.

Next we'll look at a simple Blazor and SignalR app to control our robot remotely!

Finally we'll have a look at how we can use an Oculus Quest 2 to interact with our Robot Arm in VR!

This session will appeal to all knowledge levels. A working knowledge of programming will help, but all the code will be shared on GitHub!
