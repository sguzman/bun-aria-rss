						<description><![CDATA[<p>A new type of artificial blood has been created which, in the future, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2331983-blood-substitute-repairs-damaged-organs-hours-after-heart-stops/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could bring people back from the dead</a> - or what we think of now as dead, at least. This special fluid has been shown to preserve the organs of dead pigs, long after what was previously thought possible - which the team says could be a game-changer for organ transplants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rowan talks to legendary writer Neil Gaiman about the <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81150303" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new Netflix series, out this week, based on his smash-hit Sandman comics</a>. They also discuss <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23931873-300-weve-started-to-uncover-the-true-purpose-of-dreams/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the function of dreams</a>, and the inspiration Neil draws from them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This week we also chew over the recent massive news that <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2330866-deepminds-protein-folding-ai-cracks-biologys-biggest-problem/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DeepMind’s artificial intelligence AlphaFold has predicted the structure of nearly all proteins known to science</a>.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>Women’s abortion rights are under threat in the US. Leaked documents suggest the Supreme Court is on the verge of overturning the landmark Roe v Wade decision that protects the right to abortion. The team discusses<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2318570-how-repealing-roe-v-wade-in-the-us-will-lead-to-more-womens-deaths/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> the dramatic impact this move could have on women’s health</a>.</p><br><p>Eating microbes could save the world. The team examines a new study which found that <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2318472-swapping-fifth-of-meat-for-alternative-foods-could-halve-deforestation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">substituting just a fifth of the meat in our diets with microbial proteins would more than halve global deforestation rates and related carbon emissions</a>.</p><br><p>While we fight to protect the environment on Earth, a lot less is done to safeguard space. Professor of astronomy at the University of Edinburgh, Andy Lawrence, hopes that is about to change. He tells Rowan why space needs to be a protected ecosystem, subject to the same sort of regulations as the oceans and the atmosphere.</p><br><p>The earthworm invasion is upon us.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Women’s abortion rights are under threat in the US. Leaked documents suggest the Supreme Court is on the verge of overturning the landmark Roe v Wade decision that protects the right to abortion. The team discusses<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2318570-how-repealing-roe-v-wade-in-the-us-will-lead-to-more-womens-deaths/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> the dramatic impact this move could have on women’s health</a>.</p><br><p>Eating microbes could save the world. The team examines a new study which found that <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2318472-swapping-fifth-of-meat-for-alternative-foods-could-halve-deforestation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">substituting just a fifth of the meat in our diets with microbial proteins would more than halve global deforestation rates and related carbon emissions</a>.</p><br><p>While we fight to protect the environment on Earth, a lot less is done to safeguard space. Professor of astronomy at the University of Edinburgh, Andy Lawrence, hopes that is about to change. He tells Rowan why space needs to be a protected ecosystem, subject to the same sort of regulations as the oceans and the atmosphere.</p><br><p>The earthworm invasion is upon us.

Referred to as “the worst disease you’ve never heard of”, the condition makes everyday living an ordeal.

So how do they do it? The team explores new findings about the genetic changes that have occurred in the bats to allow them to survive and thrive on the stuff.</p><br><p>And finally, the team takes you on a trip to Monterey Bay off central California, <a href="https://www.mbari.org/soundscape-listening-room/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sharing sounds of the bay’s aquatic life</a> in an escapist audio-quiz.&nbsp;</p><br><p>On the pod are <a href="https://twitter.com/rowhoop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rowan Hooper</a>, Penny Sarchet, Leah Crane and Alice Klein.

Referred to as “the worst disease you’ve never heard of”, the condition makes everyday living an ordeal. The team finds out how this new treatment works.</p><br><p>Astronomers have detected a star more than 27 billion light years away - <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2313903-furthest-star-ever-seen-offers-glimpse-12-8-billion-years-into-past/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the most distant individual star we’ve ever seen</a>. The team explains how this finding could shed light on what was going on in the early universe, ‘shortly’ after the Big Bang.</p><br><p>In a bid to tackle the biodiversity crisis, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2314046-un-biodiversity-talks-fail-to-agree-on-new-targets-to-protect-wildlife/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">195 countries have been working on a draft deal called the Global Biodiversity Framework</a>. But despite the alarming real-world consequences of the crisis that we’ve been seeing in recent weeks, the team explains how the discussions have been a flop.</p><br><p><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2313214-vampire-bats-adapted-to-drinking-blood-by-shedding-several-genes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vampire bats are the only mammal to feed exclusively on blood</a> - which is weird because it’s not very nutritious or filling. So how do they do it? The team explores new findings about the genetic changes that have occurred in the bats to allow them to survive and thrive on the stuff.</p><br><p>And finally, the team takes you on a trip to Monterey Bay off central California, <a href="https://www.mbari.org/soundscape-listening-room/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sharing sounds of the bay’s aquatic life</a> in an escapist audio-quiz.&nbsp;</p><br><p>On the pod are <a href="https://twitter.com/rowhoop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rowan Hooper</a>, Penny Sarchet, Leah Crane and Alice Klein.

						<description><![CDATA[David Bennett has become the first person in history to have a pig to human heart transplant. Scientists have edited several genes to make this possible. On the pod, the team say that if it proves successful longer term, it could be a game-changer for medicine. In cetacean news, have you ever wondered why dolphins have so much sex? Patricia Brennan from Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts has been studying dolphin clitorises, and shares her findings with the team. We now know much more about the omicron variant of coronavirus, and with more than half of people in Europe set to catch it in the next 6 to 8 weeks, the team explains why the variant is more infectious. There’s a double dose of moon news this week - first there’s the discovery that Saturn’s moon Mimas may have an ocean beneath its surface, and then we have the first water ever detected by a robot on our Moon. And novelist and New Scientist columnist Annalee Newitz joins the discussion to share their experiences with a robot therapist called Woebot.

The team says although it’s early days, we’re beginning to get a handle on why this covid-19 variant is so good at dodging immunity, and they unpack ‘misleading’ reports that it causes milder infections.&nbsp; Climate journalist Emily Atkin joins the team to discuss Netflix’s new satire Don’t Look Up, which follows the story of two astronomers and their attempts to warn humanity of an approaching comet that will destroy the planet. As well as that, renowned cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker joins the pod to discuss his new book ‘Rationality’, which outlines the major forces underlying our irrational tendencies. The team also brings you the bubbling sounds of melting glaciers, and they share news of a new kind of GPS that uses cosmic rays.

The team examines fears that it may be more transmissible than the delta variant, and <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2237475-covid-19-news-omicron-linked-to-sharp-rise-in-cases-in-south-africa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">better at evading vaccines and immunity</a>.

						<description><![CDATA[Where did covid-19 <em>really </em>come from? Well, the team explains why the wet market in Wuhan is back on top as the most likely place of origin. They also look ahead to the future of the pandemic, as the delta variant continues to run rampant across the globe. In eyesight news, forget carrots - if you want to improve your vision all you need (maybe) is some red light. The team digs into new research which shows that red light can boost mitochondrial activity in cells - but will it prove useful? The team get a little self conscious when the topic of body odour comes up. But this story is actually about an odourless chemical that we emit, that seems to influence human behaviour - affecting men and women differently. They also touch on an innovative new climate-saving method of making plastic, and they find out why NASA is sending a rocket to smash into an asteroid.

						<description><![CDATA[In rare cases children can be born without an immune system, and sadly their chances are very bad. Fortunately the team brings news of a life-saving implant which has now been approved for use in the US. If you’re thinking of seeing the new film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s epic novel Dune, you’ll want to hear the insights of ecosystem professor Yadvinder Malhi. Herbert was amazingly ahead of his time, anticipating the work of James Lovelock and the Gaia hypothesis, for example.  The team hears about the world’s largest artificial intelligence - the Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation model - and finds out what it is capable of. They also discuss how hard Iran has been hit by the coronavirus pandemic: new data shows nearly every person in the country has had covid, some twice or even three times. And in the build up to COP26, the team is getting in the party spirit, and shares details of a climate-inspired Spotify playlist they’ve put together.

						<description><![CDATA[More than a week since England lifted its covid restrictions, infection numbers in the UK are very high. The team examines how the country has set up the perfect circumstances for the evolution of “escape variants” - forms of the virus that may be able to evade our immune systems and vaccines. The team also learns of the discovery of the earliest fossil animals ever found - sponges that are 350 million years older than anything we’ve seen before. They explain how a 14-legged single-cell organism is able to walk without a brain. They also discover what would happen if two superfast stars smashed into each other, and find out why many climate models weren’t able to predict the severity of recent extreme weather. On the pod are Penny Sarchet, Timothy Revell, Leah Crane and Michael Marshall.

						<description><![CDATA[In the UK, rules around attendance at schools after a covid outbreak are changing, but the country still hasn’t decided whether or not to vaccinate children. The team finds out what the hold up is, especially given some countries have already taken the leap. It’s been 25 years since the cloning of Dolly the sheep, so the team looks at Dolly’s legacy, exploring the many advancements and discoveries that have come as a result of this marvel of biological science. They then discuss the small matter of how to save the planet as former UK chief scientist David King, founder of the newly formed Climate Crisis Advisory Group, sets out his mission. In the race to create a breakthrough quantum computer, China is in the lead - the team explores a leapfrogging event which has seen the country achieve quantum advantage, creating the fastest computer on Earth. And they discuss NASA’s exciting plans to create a spacecraft powered by solar sails.

The team describes the details of this skull, known as the ‘Dragon Man’, and explains how it might belong to a new species of human. And if that’s not exciting enough, its discovery has the most amazing Indiana Jones style backstory too. In breaking news, Jeff Bezos has announced that legendary aviator Wally Funk, one of the Mercury 13 women who trained as astronauts, will go to space with him on the first crewed Blue Origin mission. The team then discusses the intense heat waves that have been wreaking havoc in the Arctic and across the Pacific northwest. They explore the effects of <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25033413-600-brain-changes-from-covid-19-may-impact-consciousness-and-cognition/'>covid-19 on the brain</a>, as new studies show that a third of people who’ve been infected have suffered some form of cognitive or psychological disorder. They also share some incredible, experimental music from the composer John Luther Adams, whose new album ‘Arctic Dreams’ is inspired by the sounds of the Alaskan wilderness.

						<description><![CDATA[A new variant of coronavirus which originated in India is spreading rapidly. The team explains how both this new mutation and the UK variant are capable of evading vaccines, causing huge concerns for the global fight against covid-19. They also discuss whether the risks of solar geoengineering outweigh the benefits, as new research in the journal <em>Nature Food</em> looks at the <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00278-w'>potential impact on agricultural yields</a>. They discuss a <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25033360-100-alice-roberts-archaeogenetics-will-help-us-solve-mysteries-of-past/'>revolution taking place in archaeology</a> as the discipline absorbs modern techniques from genetics, speaking to anatomist Alice Roberts about her new book Ancestors: The Pre-History of Britain in Seven Burials. They hear the calls of red-handed tamarin monkeys who <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2278562-monkeys-can-change-their-accent-to-communicate-with-another-species/'>change their accents when they move in with a neighbouring species</a>.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>To mark Earth Day 2021, we’ve assembled a panel of experts to discuss climate change and biodiversity loss - “two runaway crises tightly interlinked that will mutually make each other’s effects worse”. New evidence shows <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25033310-800-climate-emergency-the-new-science-showing-its-make-or-break-time/'>2021 really is a make-or-break year for the environment and the planet</a>. In this episode the panel explores the disparity between our efforts to combat each issue, they explain how some attempts to help the environment can actually worsen the situation, and they discuss the limitations of carbon drawdown technologies. The discussion leans into the dangers of losing the Amazon rainforest, the importance of working with local communities, and the role billionaires play in advancing global climate goals. And while the scale of the problem seems insurmountable to many, the team says it’s important to remember that your actions are not futile - taking a personal stand and changing your habits is still absolutely critical. The Earth can recover, if we let it. On the pod this week: New Scientist journalists Rowan Hooper, Michael Le Page and Adam Vaughan, joined by Tilly Collins from the Centre for Environmental Policy and Bonnie Waring from the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment. </p><p><br/><br/></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[A year on from the launch of our podcast, the team reflects on the news highlighted in the first ever episode, of a small outbreak of an unknown virus in Wuhan - how life has changed. The good news is vaccination programmes are being rolled out across the globe, but the bad news is new models suggest infection rates will continue to rise, even after most of us have had the jab. The team also explores the issue of gaslighting, explaining how it’s possible for people to manipulate and exploit our perception of reality. There’s the news that artificial intelligence is now able to figure out what song you’re listening to, just by studying your brainwaves. And the team also discusses new methods being used to search for sun-harnessing megastructures known as Dyson spheres, and they examine new satellite data which shows 28 trillion tonnes of ice disappeared globally between 1994 and 2017.

						<description><![CDATA[The coronavirus vaccines that have been approved so far all require two doses to be given 3-4 weeks apart. But the UK has chosen to <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24933173-700-is-the-uk-right-to-delay-the-second-dose-of-the-covid-19-vaccines/'>delay the time between doses</a> to 12 weeks, so it can roll out the vaccine to more people more quickly. This week the team examines whether this is the right move, and whether it’s safe. Also on the show, they explore the incredible potential that could be achieved if we’re able to design a <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24933170-900-the-superconductor-breakthrough-that-could-mean-an-energy-revolution/'>superconductor that can operate at room temperature</a>, including high speed travel, super-fast computers and ultra-efficient renewable energy. They also discuss the huge biodiversity issue that is coral loss, and how a team of researchers on Heron Island is helping to boost corals on the Great Barrier Reef. Then there’s news from Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, and his plans for a new zero carbon city, and an exposé on the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2264340-megalodon-sharks-grew-2-metres-long-in-the-uterus-by-eating-eggs/'>cannibalistic tendencies of ancient megalodon sharks</a>. On the panel are Rowan Hooper, Tiffany O’Callaghan, Clare Wilson, Donna Lu and Michael Brooks.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The coronavirus vaccines that have been approved so far all require two doses to be given 3-4 weeks apart. But the UK has chosen to <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24933173-700-is-the-uk-right-to-delay-the-second-dose-of-the-covid-19-vaccines/'>delay the time between doses</a> to 12 weeks, so it can roll out the vaccine to more people more quickly. This week the team examines whether this is the right move, and whether it’s safe. Also on the show, they explore the incredible potential that could be achieved if we’re able to design a <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24933170-900-the-superconductor-breakthrough-that-could-mean-an-energy-revolution/'>superconductor that can operate at room temperature</a>, including high speed travel, super-fast computers and ultra-efficient renewable energy. They also discuss the huge biodiversity issue that is coral loss, and how a team of researchers on Heron Island is helping to boost corals on the Great Barrier Reef. Then there’s news from Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, and his plans for a new zero carbon city, and an exposé on the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2264340-megalodon-sharks-grew-2-metres-long-in-the-uterus-by-eating-eggs/'>cannibalistic tendencies of ancient megalodon sharks</a>. On the panel are Rowan Hooper, Tiffany O’Callaghan, Clare Wilson, Donna Lu and Michael Brooks.

With case numbers soaring, it’s feared these variants could lead to a massive wave of new infections around the world. The team examines why the mutations allow the virus to spread more quickly, what this means for the effectiveness of covid vaccines, and whether these new variants are more deadly. Also on the show, we explore the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24933160-800-low-carb-diets-an-easy-way-to-lose-weight-or-recipe-for-heart-attack/'>health benefits of going low-carb</a>, and explain why high-fat diets might not be as bad for your heart as you might think. We discuss the discovery of ancient bones in a cave in South Africa which may belong to <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2263973-treasure-trove-of-ancient-human-remains-hints-at-undiscovered-species/'>a new species of human</a>. There’s also a look at how scientists are using <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2263638-home-baking-frenzy-inspires-tissue-scaffold-for-growing-muscle/'>soda bread as a scaffold for growing cells</a>, which could be promising for lab-grown meat, and we discuss the result in the Georgia election for the US senate, and why that spells hope for action on climate change.

						<description><![CDATA[Happy New Year! This special episode previews some of the biggest science stories to keep an eye on over the coming year. Coronavirus, the story that’s defined our lives for the past year, will continue to evolve and unfold. The team digs into what life will look like as vaccinations eventually allow us to come out the other side of the pandemic. There are also several missions to Mars to look out for this year - the UAE’s orbiter Hope, NASA’s Perseverance rover, and China’s Tianwen-1 mission. The team also finds out whether we’re going to be able to get back on track in the fight against climate change, and they discuss the growing problem of microplastics, as this year we hope to learn more about the impact these tiny particles have on our health. As a bonus, the team shares their cultural picks for the new year. On the panel are Rowan Hooper, Cat de Lange, Layal Liverpool, Adam Vaughan, Leah Crane and Chelsea Whyte.

A clinician at Imperial College London, Katrina is working on both the Imperial mRNA vaccine trials, and the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine trials. She discusses vaccine safety, and the finding in trials that a low-dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine caused a bigger immune response. Also on the podcast, science writer Stuart Clark explains why the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24833100-800-the-universe-is-expanding-too-fast-and-that-could-rewrite-cosmology/'>unusually fast expansion of our universe might require a rethink of Einstein’s general theory of relativity</a>.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>The universe is so large, so expansive, it’s hard to believe that life doesn’t exist elsewhere. Over the years we’ve found a handful of planets that look like they could host life, but now the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24732970-800-strange-worlds-unlike-earth-may-be-our-best-bet-to-find-alien-life/'>net’s being cast wider</a> than ever before.</p><p>In the pod this week are New Scientist journalists Valerie Jamieson, Clare Wilson and Tim Revell.

They discuss the views of the chief of the World Meteorological Organisation, Peterri Taalas, that our <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/climate-change/'>environmentally unfriendly ways</a> might change as a result of the pandemic - and if the last few months might reset our climate damaging norms or will we slip back into old habits. </p><p>The team also hear how bumblebees <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2244009-bees-force-plants-to-flower-early-by-cutting-holes-in-their-leaves/'>can force plants to flower early</a> if they are struggling to find food, they discuss how to <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24632843-300-at-work-school-and-seeing-friends-how-to-lower-your-coronavirus-risk/'>stay safe from the coronavirus as lockdown eases</a>, and they explore the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2244541-spacex-to-make-history-launching-nasa-astronauts-on-a-private-rocket/'>new space race</a> between private companies rather than global superpowers. They debate whether NASA outsourcing space travel is wise, given they are potentially putting their faith in the hands of companies with controversial CEOs such as Elon Musk SpaceX - even if they are getting a good deal on price.

In this episode, we attempt to answer some of the most pressing questions about COVID-19. In the pod for this week are New Scientist journalists Rowan Hooper, Penny Sarchet and Graham Lawton. Also, the poet laureate Simon Armitage reads a poem written in response to the coronavirus crisis, called Lockdown. We discuss when you are likely to be at the peak of infection, whether it is possible to be infected twice, and why the coronavirus doesn’t seem to be <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2239380-will-the-spread-of-covid-19-be-affected-by-changing-seasons/'>affected much by heat and humidity</a>. We also offer our tips for <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24532760-100-how-to-get-the-health-benefits-of-nature-when-youre-stuck-inside/'>maintaining a healthy mental state</a> during lockdown.</p><p>And in non-pandemic news: the team reports how <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2238947-mars-may-have-had-hot-springs-millions-of-years-ago/'>hot springs</a> might have been discovered on Mars, highlight <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2238946-mind-reading-ai-turns-thoughts-into-words-using-a-brain-implant/'>an artificial intelligence</a> that has the ability to read your mind, and explore the origins of humanity now that <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24532760-800-human-evolution-the-astounding-new-story-of-the-origin-of-our-species/'>new research suggests</a> humans might not have a single point of origin but rather many, scattered all over Africa.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>There’s still so much <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24532760-900-coronavirus-treatment-what-drugs-could-work-and-when-can-we-get-them/'>uncertainty</a> surrounding COVID-19, from the symptoms and spreadability to matters like how long you should self-isolate. In this episode, we attempt to answer some of the most pressing questions about COVID-19. In the pod for this week are New Scientist journalists Rowan Hooper, Penny Sarchet and Graham Lawton. Also, the poet laureate Simon Armitage reads a poem written in response to the coronavirus crisis, called Lockdown. We discuss when you are likely to be at the peak of infection, whether it is possible to be infected twice, and why the coronavirus doesn’t seem to be <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2239380-will-the-spread-of-covid-19-be-affected-by-changing-seasons/'>affected much by heat and humidity</a>.
