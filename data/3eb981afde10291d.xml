Created by Seth MacFarlane and voiced by Seth Green, we look at Chris Griffin's history, his entire life story, his past and future. Taking a look at the Family Guy cutaways, as well as Family Guy full episodes, I've put Chris life in chronological order. From season 1 to the newest Family Guy season.

   <media:description>With the cinema release of Halloween Ends film, I thought now would be the best time to do the timeline of the Boogeyman, Michael Myers.
In this video we'll be going over the life, evolution and dark history of Michael Myers. Created by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, starring Jamie Lee Curtis. I review the events of Hallowen 1978, Halloween 2018, Halloween Kills (2021), as well as including a Halloween Ends (2022) analysis. So let's smash some pumpkins!

   <media:description>In this video we look at the timeline of Birdperson from Rick and Morty. Created by Justin Roiland, we look at life and history of Birdperson. His friendship with Rick, meeting Tammy and Birdperson's daughter. With Rick and Morty season 6 out on Adult Swim, I thought it was the best time to look at the history of Rick and Morty characters.

Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. The series follows the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his grandson Morty Smith.

   <media:description>In this video we look at the entire evolution of Lois Griffin from Family Guy. Voiced by Alex Borstein, we look at Lois' entire life story, her past and future. Taking a look at the Family Guy cutaways, as well as the Family Guy full episodes, I've put Lois's life in chronological order. From season 1 to newest Family Guy season. I go into Lois and Peter Griffins marriage and their children, Meg, Chris and Stewie Griffin.

We also look at the funniest and best of Family Guy moments from Peter, Lois, Chris, Meg and Brian. As well as other Family Guy characters from Quahog Rhode Island like Quagmire and Joe.
