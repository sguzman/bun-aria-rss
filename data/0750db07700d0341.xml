   <media:description>By the 1930’s, Jewish life had prospered in Europe for over 2,000 years. Despite facing expulsion, persecution, and antisemitic rhetoric, Jews survived, sometimes through bribery for security or relocation to “safer” parts of Europe. 

While this survival tactic served them for centuries, the Nazis rise to power was swift and calculated. Though historians who study this time period can theorize about where and how the tragic death of six million Jews could have occurred, hindsight is 20/20. 

What the Jews of Europe endured was beyond their control. The reality is that there was nowhere to go, and escape was nearly impossible. With surrounding countries and borders closed to Jews, the pre-World War II European Jewish community of approximately nine million had only a tiny number of survivors to carry on Jewish tradition and continuity into the next generation.

About Explainers: From ancient Jewish traditions to the modern State of Israel, we explain it all. Diving into anything and everything related to Jewish culture, history, and even religion. 
Understand Jewish holidays, Israeli politics, Jewish diasporic communities, and more. Learn about Judaism in pop culture, debunking myths about Jews, and explore obscure Israeli landmarks.  We’re asking questions as basic as “What is the Talmud?”, and as obscure as “How did hip-hop boost Kosher wine sales?”, and everything in between.

About Unpacked: We provide nuanced insights by unpacking all things Jewish. People are complex and complicated — yet we’re constantly being pushed to oversimplify our world. At Unpacked we know that being complex makes us more interesting. Because of this, we break the world down with nuance and insight to drive your curiosity and challenge your thinking.

   <media:description>In January 1954, the Attorney General v. Gruenwald case AKA the Kasztner trial began. This was seemingly an open and shut libel case between an elderly Hungarian Jew and Israeli government official, Israel Rudolf Kasztner. 
However, when the story of the impossible choices Kastner faced at the hands of the Nazis came to light, Israel was in an uproar. Somehow, this seemingly straightforward trial sent the country reeling, causing a government fallout and led to one of Israel’s first political assassination.

   <media:description>The Jewish concept of a Messiah, or Mashiach in Hebrew, has been discussed extensively by rabbis, philosophers, poets and even featured in Jewish prayer. 

However, much like many other Jewish concepts, there are debates amongst Jews over what a messianic era is, how or when it will come about and how to help the Messiah arrive. 
Despite these debates, the belief in Mashiach is a fundamental ideal that has been passed down for generations and has created a cohesive peoplehood of Jews, bonded over a shared history and belief of a shared, peaceful future.

   <media:description>After a horrific attack on an Israeli family by a Lebanese teenager working with the Palestine Liberation Front (a faction of the PLO) in 1979, Israel looked for an ally to help create a secure buffer zone between Israel and Lebanon. 

However, working with the  President-elect of Lebanon, Bashir Gemayel, proved to have deadly consequences. His paramilitary group, the Phalangists massacred between 800 and 2,000 people in two Palestinian refugee camps called Sabra and Shatila. 

With the world in an uproar over the horrific news of this event, all fingers pointed blame towards Israel. Although the IDF entered Lebanon to stop the PLO’s terror, Israel accepted responsibility for the part they played in the dark story of Sabra and Shatila.

   <media:description>The integration of Mizrahi Jews into Israel was not an easy one. Jews from countries like Yemen, Morocco, Iraq, Egypt, and Syria had lived there for generations and after much oppression found themselves running for their lives to Israel. 

Enraged by the inequality they faced in their new home, a group of Mizrahi Jews took inspiration from the Black Panthers movement in the United States. 

The Israeli Black Panthers, HaPanterim HaShchorim, who emerged from this painful time period fought for systematic change and their impact is still felt in Israeli society today.

   <media:description>In the second century CE, the Romans exiled the Jews of Judea and created a far flung diaspora which saw many Jews make their way to Europe, Asia and North Africa. Those who ended up in the East in countries like Iraq, Iran, and Syria and in North African countries like Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia would later become known as Mizrahi Jews. 

Mizrahi Jews often prospered under Muslim rule in these countries, however by the twentieth century, as Nazi ideology spread to the Middle East, they found themselves facing violent attacks from their once peaceful neighbors. 

By the mid-twentieth century, Mizrahi Jews were in desperate need of a safe haven. From 1948 to 1972, nearly 600,000 immigrated to Israel alongside other Jewish refugees from around the world. Though they faced a difficult transition and discrimination in their new home, Israel today is known for its richly-integrated Mizrahi culture.

   <media:description>When Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini took control of Iran in the Islamic Revolution of 1979, no one could have predicted that would be a catalyst for the formation of the terrorist organization Hezbollah, or “Party of God.” 
Since its inception, Hezbollah has grown from a small militant group in Lebanon to a massively well-funded organization hell-bent on destroying Israel.  
Despite retaliation from the Israel Defense Forces, Hezbollah’s power continues to grow and remains a serious threat to Israeli lives; a fact which will remain until true peace is found between Israel and Lebanon.

   <media:description>In the summer of 1929, the British-controlled region of Palestine saw growing fault lines between Arabs and Jews. Tensions rose until they erupted one fateful day. In the city of Hebron a riot quickly turned into a gruesome massacre, and in a mere two hours, 67 Jews were murdered. The Hebron Riots were the catalyst for the week of terror that followed. In total 133 Jews and 116 Arabs were killed and most peaceful Jewish-Arab coexistence came to an unfortunate end.

   <media:description>Throughout the ages, people have debated whether Judaism is a religion, a culture, or a nationality…and where Israel fits into the mix.  In fact, the Jewish experience encompasses all of these. 
While different denominations such as Reform, Modern Orthodox, or Haredi Jews may focus on different elements to define how they relate to their Judaism,  there is a shared understanding that despite these differences, Jews still make up one Peoplehood based on so much more than just religion.

   <media:description>It was 1916 and World War I was raging. Countries were fighting for resources, land and power and the Ottoman Empire was on its deathbed. 

With all eyes on the Empire’s territories, the secretive Sykes-Picot agreement was created to decide who would get control over what would become Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, and Iraq, as well as parts of future Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

However, in 1920, representatives at the San Remo Conference tossed these secret plans out in favor of “mandates'' AKA territory temporarily governed by an Allied power. This led to the British Mandate over Palestine, and the eventual establishment of Israel as a legal national home for the Jewish people.

   <media:description>In the late 1800s, rising antisemitism had people concerned that Judaism would disappear entirely. Two very different solutions arose in an attempt to solve this crisis:  Reform Judaism and Zionism.

Reform Judaism aimed to emphasize more universal Jewish values rather than rituals in an attempt to better integrate with non-Jews. Zionism focused on the desire for Jews to re-enter the world stage as their own people in a Jewish state. 

Eventually, after the horrors of the Holocaust, the Reform movement recognized the need for Zionism and moved to support it. Today, Jews both in and out of Israel have different and often polar opposite views about how to be Jewish, yet they remain part of the same peoplehood focused on Jewish continuity.

   <media:description>When two young Christians were murdered in Kishinev, the heart of Moldova, in 1903, popular journalist Peva Krushevanl seized the opportunity to blame the Jews for their deaths. 

Using his daily newspaper as a personal soapbox, he riled up thousands of Kishinev’s civilians to take revenge against the Jews in a deadly pogrom which killed 49 people. 

This attack inspired Jewish poet Chaim Nachman Bialik to publish works to awaken the Jewish spirit and successfully invoked Jews across the world to take action against the rampant antisemitism in Europe.

   <media:description>Upon witnessing the danger and suffering Jews were experiencing from rampant antisemitism, Theodor Herzl proposed a temporary safe haven in Uganda. However, a Jewish homeland in East Africa was heavily opposed by the Zionist Congress. 

After much debate, the Seventh Zionist Congress decided against executing the Uganda Plan and Herzl focused his efforts on aiding the future establishment of a Jewish state elsewhere. 
Fifty years later, Israel was established, keeping the Jewish state in a place rich with Jewish history, rather than merely a place of physical safety.

   <media:description>Throughout history, people have traveled from across the world to make Israel their home. This has created a fundamental Israeli value to encourage and support immigrant absorption.
Immigration to Israel is not without its challenges. While there may be many differences in ideologies, religious and political beliefs, and languages spoken, this vastly multicultural society is what makes Israel the richly diverse mosaic that it is today.
