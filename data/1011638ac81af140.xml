      <description>Contributor(s): Ignacio Garcia Bercero, Emily Lydgate | The talk will discuss issues for a potential trade and climate negotiating agenda such as subsidies, liberalisation of goods and services with a positive climate impact, standards for measuring carbon intensity or the role of border carbon measures. It will look into the potential of tackling those issues in a WTO context either multilaterally or through open plurilateral approaches.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Leslie McCall | Questioning widespread notions of US exceptionalism, the lecture critically examines common assumptions about how Americans think about issues of economic inequality (in outcomes and opportunities and across dimensions of race and class) and related policies that reduce economic inequality.
Using a wide range of existing and original data sources, as well as multiple methodological approaches, Professor McCall analyses public views in the United States over time and in a comparative context. She proposes a multi-dimensional framework for understanding public views of inequality rooted in desires for substantive economic and educational opportunities through a broad set of social rights, employment protection and support, and redistribution of pay. The in-depth study of the American case in comparative perspective and supplementary cross-national analyses suggests that this novel analytical framework can shed light on the politics of inequality throughout advanced political economies.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Abraham L Newman, Dr Jamie Martin, Professor Stephanie J. Rickard | The war in Ukraine raises questions about whether states must be ‘strategic’ about their national economic policies due to geopolitical risks. The scramble for supplies to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, long-term trends of growing competition between the United States and China and the rise of populism had already fuelled geopolitical tensions, along with fears that globalisation is eroding. As a result, some of the global economy’s most prominent players prioritise economic resilience and reshoring global supply chains with ‘friendly’ allied states. The potential outcome is a fracturing of a globalised economy based on these alliances or outright deglobalisation. All of this is culminating in escalating economic disruptions for lower-income countries, with countries in sub-Saharan Africa facing possible default on their sovereign debt. Added to this, the war in Ukraine has caused the most significant commodity shock since the 1970s. International institutions, like the World Trade Organization, continue to defend global trade and the International Monetary Fund and World Bank continue to champion international cooperation to address economic and social welfare.
What are the political, social, and economic implications of these challenges for the global economy? How should international laws and institutions address these challenges to economic integration? How do precedents for twentieth-century international economic institution building help us contextualise today’s challenges?</description>

Sue Windebank talks to an LSE Law student who reveals how she has overcome the challenges of being an asylum seeker and a care leaver to study law at the School. Professor Sam Friedman, a sociologist of class and inequality, discusses the arbitrariness of what is considered ‘high culture’.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor June Barrow-Green | In 1916 the physician Ronald Ross published the first of three papers on the mathematical study of epidemiology or, as he called it, ‘pathometry’. The second and third of these papers appeared the following year co-authored with the mathematician Hilda Hudson. At the time Hudson, who had ranked equivalent to the 7th wrangler in the 1903 Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, was well known for her work on Cremona Transformations. So how and why did Hudson, a geometer, end up collaborating with Ross, winner of the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1902 for his work on the transmission of malaria? And what role did she play? In her talk June Barrow-Green shall discuss the nature and extent of their collaboration, as well as the content and significance of their work.</description>

At the time Hudson, who had ranked equivalent to the 7th wrangler in the 1903 Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, was well known for her work on Cremona Transformations. So how and why did Hudson, a geometer, end up collaborating with Ross, winner of the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1902 for his work on the transmission of malaria? And what role did she play? In her talk June Barrow-Green shall discuss the nature and extent of their collaboration, as well as the content and significance of their work.</itunes:summary>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Alpa Shah, Professor Nikhil Anand, Dr Kasia Paprocki | Bangladesh dominates mainstream narratives of climate disaster. Frequently described as the ‘world’s most vulnerable country to climate change’, the oversimplified spectre of a major country slipping underwater has yielded a crisis narrative that erases a complex history of landscape transformation and intense, contemporary political conflicts. Colonialism, capitalism, and local agrarian struggles have so far shaped the country’s coastline more than carbon emissions. Today, both national and global elites ignore this history, while crafting narratives and economic strategies that redistribute power and resources away from peasant communities in the name of climate adaptation. 
Threatening Dystopias draws on over two years of multi-sited ethnographic and archival fieldwork with development practitioners, policy makers, scientists, farmers and rural migrants, to investigate the politics of climate change adaptation in Bangladesh from multiple perspectives and scales, offering an in-depth analysis of the global politics of climate change adaptation and how they are both forged and manifested in this unique site.</description>

The war in Ukraine has heightened concerns over the impact that geopolitical instability will have on future climate change and energy policy. Great power tensions and conflict threaten to harm the search for international cooperation on global challenges. At the same time, Russia’s military aggression has galvanised European powers to seek strategic autonomy and reduce their reliance on fossil fuel imports. Will it also end up galvanising leading powers to accelerate the net zero transition?</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Rhacel Salazar Parreñas, Lina Abou Habib, Dr Steffen Hertog | The Kafala System, an employment scheme in the Middle East, has attracted much academic scrutiny and criticism over the decades. Human rights activists align the system with slavery, unfreedom, and human trafficking. In her new book, which she will discuss at this event, Rhacel Salazar Parreñas offers more nuanced accounts of workers relationships with their employers in the United Arab Emirates.
Rhacel's work employs novel methods of researching the Kafala system and its impact on workers and questions concepts such as unfreedom and freedom. Whilst her arguments highlight the dehumanising treatment and lack of recognition of migrant domestic workers, her empirical data crucially illuminates the diversity of work conditions. A key argument is that rather than ‘abuse’ being the main point of reference in Kafala debates, it is the absence of labour standards in the region that leads to unequal and complex employment relationships. A diverse panel of academics, stakeholders and human rights activists will offer their reflections on Parreñas’ book, highlighting their expertise from the Middle East.</description>

If Ukraine stops fighting, there will be no Ukraine” is the sentiment used by many Ukrainian protesters mobilising against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In this talk, the panellists will consider both Russia's war against and invasion of Ukraine since February 2022 and the longer trajectory of Russia's aggression against Ukraine since 2014, first in Crimea and second in Donetsk and Luhansk.
The panellists will reflect on what we know about Ukraine and Ukrainian citizens prior to and since Russia's aggression began, as well as perspectives we can take to understand the scale and consequences of Russia's aggression.</description>

In their new book, which they will talk about at this event, Saul Estrin and Simon Commander argue that if Asia’s claim to the 21st century is not to be derailed, major changes must be made to policy and behaviour to promote more sustainable economic and political systems.
Join the speakers and Minouche Shafik, Director of LSE, for an evening exploring what the future could hold for Asian capitalism.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Tamma Carleton, Dr Asad Gilani, Professor Michael Greenstone, Dr Eric Obutey | Climate change is already increasing global temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and resulting in more frequent and severe floods and droughts. Developing countries are most vulnerable to climate change, which can aggravate the effects of poverty and rapid urbanisation. Without effective policies for adaptation and mitigation, climate change may push hundreds of millions further into poverty and limit the opportunities for sustainable development. In order to formulate effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation strategies, governments must be equipped with a thorough estimation of the costs and benefits of various policies.</description>

Human created climate change is drastically reshaping life on earth, with up to 75% of the diversity of the species on our planet on their way to becoming extinct.
This month, LSE iQ asks: How can we survive the next mass extinction? We’ll discuss the dangers of greenwashing, what it’s like to witness an environmental catastrophe and how we can change our behaviour to benefit the planet.
Anna Bevan talks to: Dr Ganga Shreedhar, Assistant Professor in LSE’s Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science, and Associate at the Grantham Research Institute of Climate Change and the Environment and the Inclusion Initiative; and former BBC Science Editor, and now Visiting Professor in Practice at the Grantham Research Institute, David Shukman.

This is something both of the major political parties appear to have signed on to.
The question then is not only how much should we tax, but who should we tax, and how far the wealthy should be the focus of increased taxation. Questions of fairness will be central to the debate. In this event we present evidence on the trends in wealth inequality in society and reflect on the political challenges involved in addressing these.</description>

As so many are forced to leave their homes, not all refugees gain the same level of visibility, welcome, and recognition. What are the consequences for the lives of those who move and those who receive them? How do media representations of refugees affect their reception?

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Mathias Koenig-Archibugi, Dr Devika Hovell, Dr Martin Binder | Multilateralism seems in crisis precisely when it is needed most. Challenges are multifaceted and originate from established, emerging and declining powers.
In his address to the UN Security Council in April 2022, President Zelenskyy of Ukraine said: “It is now clear that the goals set in San Francisco in 1945 during the creation of a global international security organization have not been achieved. And it is impossible to achieve them without reforms. Therefore, we must do everything in our power to pass on to the next generations an effective UN with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and thus guarantee peace.”
What reforms could revitalise the UN and what are the prospects of them being enacted?</description>

This participatory short film animates longer-term ethnographic research conducted over the past 24 months across the UK by LSE’s COVID and Care Research Group, led by Professor Laura Bear. It highlights the story of psychotherapist Suad Duale and the Somali single mothers who have stepped up to support their community in this time.
Co-directed by Suad Duale, Dr Nikita Simpson and Dr James Rattee, it provides insight into the profound work done by some people to ferry their communities through this crisis.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Teniola Tayo, Richard Kozul-Wright | The economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Africa have been severe, with formal and informal sectors affected by lockdowns, decreasing exports, disruptions to global supply chains, mounting debt and increasing levels of poverty. Fiscal responses have been unable to weather dramatic shifts in business and economic activity worldwide, with major challenges for local populations seeking employment and food security.
With historic changes within the continent to the way trade is being conducted, a crucial part of Africa’s economic recovery from COVID-19 therefore hangs on what happens in this area. Will the much-hyped African Continental Free Trade Area really transform the continent’s economic prospects, or does an economic recovery depend on external actors? With a small percentage of Africa receiving vaccines to COVID-19, how can trade work to counter the challenges of supply?</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Nicholas Barr, Andrew Dilnot, Michelle Dyson, Lord MacPherson | A decade after the Dilnot Report called attention to the fact that the finance of social care had been ignored for too long and that the system was "confusing, unfair and unsustainable", the government announced an overhaul to the way adult social care is financed in England.
The government’s proposal, to increase finance for social care through an increase in National Insurance contributions (NICs), has attracted a range of diverging opinions. The speakers will debate current proposals and possible alternatives.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Anna Valero, Rebecca McDonald, Dr Carl Benedikt Frey | Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, underlying structural changes have placed significant pressure on labour markets. This has profound implications for inter-personal and inter-place inequalities.
The challenge, therefore, is how we create good jobs in a time of crisis, where everyone and everywhere benefits. This event will discuss the opportunities a transition to net zero presents, and how skills policy needs to be reframed to support strong, sustainable and inclusive job creation.</description>

This is an inter-generational and transnational conversation: while both texts showcase place-based writing that is attentive to context, they also transcend place and engage with a transnational feminist orientation that takes care seriously as a universal experience and as a political question. These texts are exciting examples of experimental writing and publishing, demonstrating the power and beauty of feminist writing in our current moment.</description>

And how can we build a new economic strategy that responds to the challenges of the 2020s, as well as our legacy problems of weak productivity, high inequality and stagnating living standards?
The UK is facing a decisive decade of huge economic change, from restructuring after Brexit and the pandemic, to urgently transitioning towards a net zero future, and adapting to technological shifts amid an ageing population. Some of these shifts present big new opportunities for people and places throughout the country. But they bring challenges too, and failing to respond to the disruption they will bring carries huge risks – to our living standards, our communities, and to our planet. The UK’s many strengths must be harnessed to manage this change well.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Lexi Stadlen, Professor Patricia Jeffery, Sonia Faleiro | This event marks the launch of Lexi Stadlen’s newly published Nine Paths which explores the intimate lives of nine women and their families on an island in the Sunderban, at the eastern edge of India, over the course of a year. There are weddings to celebrate and deaths to mourn, families to care for, difficult marriages to navigate and tragedies to overcome, as we observe the everyday drudgery, unexpected turmoil and the dreams of something better.
A conversation chaired by Alpa Shah with Lexi Stadlen, sociologist Patricia Jeffrey who has conducted four decades of research in a Muslim village in Uttar Pradesh and journalist Sonia Faleiro who most recently wrote the The Good Girls, the ordinary killing of two low caste girls in a village in Uttar Pradesh.</description>

In particular, they have the right to make decisions on behalf of their children in all areas of their children’s lives, including education, religious observance and relationships. Parental rights fulfil two roles: protecting children’s interests and protecting parents’ interest in rearing their children in line with their values. Yet, these interests are often in tension with one another.</description>

In his new book, Simon details how Oxford University has produced most of the most powerful Conservative politicians of our time. They aren't just colleagues - they are peers, rivals, friends. And, when they walked out of the world of student debates onto the national stage, they brought their university politics with them.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Annette Zimmermann, Dr Zeynep Pamuk, Professor Jocelyn Maclure, Dr Etienne Brown | Public administrations increasingly use AI to automatise the allocation of public services. Judges use risk-assessment algorithms to determine a person’s eligibility for bail or parole. Social media platforms use AI to optimise content moderation, while political actors can use these platforms to engage in microtargeting and misinformation. And law enforcement agencies can use facial recognition systems and predictive analytics to strengthen surveillance. This new reality requires careful examination: Who should be responsible for selecting principles of AI governance? How can we align the decisions of AI systems with democratic values? Are “black box” algorithms undermining transparency and our capacity to exercise scrutiny over public decisions?

      <description>Contributor(s): Lord Malloch-Brown | For decades, democracy and human-rights advocates have assumed that a growing number of governments were embracing democracy, freedom and the international law.

      <itunes:summary>Contributor(s): Lord Malloch-Brown | For decades, democracy and human-rights advocates have assumed that a growing number of governments were embracing democracy, freedom and the international law. Yet today, 38 percent of the world’s population live in countries which are not free – the highest proportion in a quarter of a century. As the enemies of open society further accelerate their attacks, and Ukraine becomes the frontline in a systems-breaking clash between democracy and authoritarianism, where do we turn next in today’s fight for open society?</itunes:summary>

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Juliana Bidadanure | Age shapes social institutions, roles, and relationships, as well as how we assign obligations and entitlements within them. Each life-stage also brings its characteristic opportunities and vulnerabilities, which spawn inequalities between young and old. How should we respond to these age-related inequalities? Are they objectionable in the same way gender or racial inequalities are? Or is there something distinctive about age that should mitigate our concern for inequalities between young and old?
Juliana Bidadanure addresses these and related questions, presenting the theory of justice between age groups that she develops in her book Justice Across Ages: Treating Young and old as Equals. The book advances ethical principles to guide a fair distribution of goods like jobs, healthcare, income, and political power among persons at different stages of their life. If we are ever to live in a society where people are treated as equals, she argues, we must pay attention to how age membership can alter our social standing, and we must regard with suspicion commonplace forms of age-based social hierarchy.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Bee Rowlatt, Fawzia Amini, Baroness Kennedy | The fall of Kabul last summer was a minute-by-minute tragedy, as the Taliban swept to power and many Afghans desperately tried to escape. Among the most vulnerable were women lawyers who had formerly stood up to the Taliban, and as the ‘death lists’ began to circulate, these women had the most to lose. But as we witnessed the rolling back of human rights, the events of last August also summoned acts of immense courage and selflessness. In the spirt of Mary Wollstonecraft, Baroness Kennedy shares the extraordinary stories behind the evacuation of Afghan women judges following the fall of Kabul, and her own connection to their escape. This exchange examines the hopes for women's rights internationally, set the story we all watched on the news into the framework of international justice, and consider those who are left behind.</description>

It is faith in others—in their honesty, dependability, and goodwill. Trustworthy people make promises they can keep, follow through on those promises, and do not violate social norms. When trust is absent, society and its members suffer: citizens demand and politicians supply public policies that do not advance collective welfare, feeding disenchantment with democracy; citizens and government officials demand increasing regulation and red tape that slow growth and restrict access to social programs; and the performance of firms and public sector organisations declines as mistrust undermines collaboration, recruitment and innovation.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Annette Lareau, Sibylle Gollac, Dr Aliya Rao | The event will examine a host of related issues including gender dynamics (and tensions) surrounding wealth and philanthropic giving in families, particularly when the wealth and economic expertise of the wife exceeds that of her husband. Professor Lareau highlights the “stickiness” of gender in shaping these family dynamics, thereby complicating and stigmatising the formidable economic advantages these women hold. Following her presentation, Sibylle Gollac and Dr Katharina Hecht will join the discussion.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Michael Cox, Professor Caroline Kennedy-Pipe, Professor Peter Trubowitz | The defeat of Donald Trump in November 2020 followed by the attack on the US Congress on 6 January 2021 represented a tipping point moment in the history of the American republic. Divided at home and facing a world sceptical of American claims to be the ‘indispensable nation’ in world politics, it is clear that the next few years will be decisive ones for the United States. But how did the US, which was riding high only 30 years ago, arrive at this critical point? And will it lead to the fall of what many would claim has been one of the most successful empires of modern times?
In this volume, Michael Cox, a leading scholar of American foreign policy, outlines the ways in which five very different American Presidents – Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump and now Biden - have addressed the complex legacies left them by their predecessors while dealing with the longer-term problems of running an empire under increasing stress. In so doing, he sets out a framework for thinking critically about US foreign policy since the end of the Cold War without ever losing sight of the biggest question of all: can America continue to shape world affairs or is it now facing long-term decline?</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Sylvie Goulard, Frank Elderson, Otávio Damaso, Dr Ma Jun | Panellists discuss the findings of the report of the Joint NGFS-INSPIRE Study Group on Biodiversity and Financial Stability. The report investigates and strengthens the case for action to enable central banks and supervisors to not only understand the issues the planet is facing due to the unparalleled loss of biodiversity, but also to define the actions that must be taken within existing mandates in the collective effort to address this vital challenge.
The report sets out how financial risks stemming from biodiversity loss can have implications for financial stability and therefore the core objectives and policy frameworks of central banks and supervisors. The decline of ecosystem services as a result of biodiversity loss poses physical risks for economic and financial actors that depend upon those services.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Shani Orgad, Professor Rosalind Gill, Professor Pumla Dineo Gqola, Dr Katherine Angel | Interrogating the prominence of confidence in contemporary discourse about body image, workplace, relationships, motherhood, and international development, Orgad and Gill demonstrate how “confidence culture” demands of women near-constant introspection and vigilance in the service of self-improvement. They argue that while confidence messaging may feel good, it does not address structural and systemic oppression.
Rather, confidence culture suggests that women—along with people of colour, the disabled, and other marginalised groups—are responsible for their own conditions. Rejecting confidence culture’s remaking of feminism along individualistic and neoliberal lines, Orgad and Gill explore alternative articulations of feminism that go beyond the confidence imperative.</description>

The lecture draws empirically on research conducted over the last 5 years on violence against Brazilian migrant women in London and among women living in the favelas of Maré in Rio de Janeiro. The discussion reflects the feminist co-production of research with a range of organisations and on the role of arts-based methods and engagements in enhancing understandings of gendered violence and through which diverse forms of resistance emerge. </description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Philipp Ager | The 1920s border closure is one of the most fundamental changes to United States immigration policy in the past century. In the early 20th century, European immigrants faced few restrictions for entry into the US and close to one million immigrants arrived on the nation's shores each year.
This era of open immigration ended in the 1920s with a series of increasingly restrictive immigration quotas, eventually limiting entry from affected countries to 150,000 a year. Professor Ager will discuss the socio-economic consequences this policy had for the US population at that time, and what lessons can be learned from it.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Winnie Byanyima | This event with Winnie Byanyima, the feminist activist who leads the UN’s response to HIV and AIDS and who chairs the People’s Vaccine Alliance for COVID-19, will highlight lessons rooted in ongoing experience from the AIDS response and the commonalities between the two pandemics, as well as learnings from other health crises, to set out an approach that can actually succeed in keeping us all safe.
The COVID-19 crisis has alerted world leaders to the urgency of stopping and preventing pandemics, which are recognised as undermining health, stability, and economic progress. But the path on which the world is embarking to overcome pandemics cannot succeed, because it is failing to address their underlying systemic drivers. Inequalities are increasingly preventing overwhelming majorities in most developing countries from accessing COVID-19 vaccines, enabling the pandemic to spread and the virus to mutate. If we end inequalities upfront, we will increase our odds of ending AIDS, ending COVID-19 and winning against future pandemics. But business as usual will fail. In this time of emergency, the only realistic approach is a radical one, the only safe response is to be bold.</description>

Alongside providing material support (e.g., food, medical supplies etc.) and mutual aid, civil society organisations have been at the forefront in campaigning for better policies and social protections for communities. 
Panellists discuss how civil society organisations are responding to the new challenges and examine the forms of solidarity and agency that are emerging. As we ponder the question, “How do we get to a post-COVID world?", we need to consider the ways in which actors across civil society are not only meeting immediate needs, but more importantly, how through prefigurative forms of action they are imagining and enacting new social relations and practices of wellbeing and care.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Luitgard Veraart | Domino effects of losses can bring down entire financial systems with severe knock-on effects on the real economy. This talk considers insights from mathematics to model loss cascades and apply them to recent financial stress events.
We live in an interconnected world. As the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, interconnections affect both our lives and our livelihoods. In this talk, Luitgard Veraart will show how we can use mathematical models to quantify and manage risk arising from interconnections in financial markets. A particular focus will be on systemic risk and financial stability. Examples provided from the 2007-2009 financial crisis and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will illustrate how mathematical models can inform the debate on mitigating systemic risk.
Meet our speaker and chair
Luitgard Veraart is a Professor in the Department of Mathematics at LSE. She joined LSE in 2010 after holding positions in the USA and in Germany. She is a co-winner of the 2019 Adams Prize awarded by the University of Cambridge for her research in the Mathematics of Networks.
Jan van den Heuvel is Professor of Mathematics and Head of the Department of Mathematics at LSE.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Christopher Murray | The COVID-19 pandemic has had massive global impacts infecting more than 3.5 billion and causing more than 15 million excess deaths. The virus has directly killed millions and the lockdowns needed to dampen transmission may have contributed in various ways to millions of pandemic related deaths not due to SARS Cov2 infection. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only been a major shock to human health but has had unprecedented economic impacts. The distribution of health and economic effects has not been even around the world. Countries judged prior to the pandemic to be better prepared to manage threats such as the United Kingdom and Unites States have not faired particularly well during 2020 and 2021. </description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Lorraine Whitmarsh | A moment of change is when circumstances shift quickly. They include life course moments – like becoming a parent or changing careers - and external changes – such as travel disruption or the impact of wider societal disruption. The relationship between moments of change and environmental impact is complex. There are differences across individuals, cultures and society. Professor Whitmarsh will discuss this research, including how this relates to net zero societal change and the COVID-19 pandemic. She will also share her thoughts on implications for policy makers.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Jessica Whyte | In this talk, Jessica Whyte will trace the development of neoliberal attitudes to the subjective comportment required for a functioning competitive market. Her focus is on the irony by which a neoliberal movement that emerged as a critique of the stoic resignation of previous liberals in the face of poverty, mass unemployment and economic misery, ultimately came to counsel what Friedrich Hayek termed “submission” to our market-dispensed fates.
Neoliberalism is commonly understood as a philosophy embracing free trade or laissez-faire. And yet, a key impetus for its development was the rejection of the earlier liberal idea that markets operated in a realm of natural freedom. Walter Lippman, the American journalist who inspired the early neoliberals, believed that liberals had become simple apologists for the miseries of the existing legal order because they neglected the role of law and the state in consolidating the liberal capitalist order. By doing so, he argued, they were reduced to preaching “stoic resignation” in the face of the human suffering that resulted from the market.</description>

Join us as a panel of speaker discuss the theme of this new publication from LSE Press.
Modern international relations apparently shows a rapid swing back towards ‘great power’ politics and the use of force and violence in inter-state relations, dashing the millennial hopes of an irreversible shift towards a more ethically based international regime. Yet a whole succession of major thinkers have espoused versions of a ‘realist’ strand urging recognition of the inevitable presence of violence in international affairs.

      <description>Contributor(s): Hilary Cooper, Professor Simon Szreter | Hilary Cooper and Simon Szreter discuss their book in which they reveal the deep roots of our vulnerability and set out a powerful manifesto for change post-Covid-19. They argue that our commitment to a flawed neoliberal model and the associated disinvestment in our social fabric left the UK dangerously exposed and unable to mount an effective response. This is not at all what made Britain great. The long history of the highly innovative universal welfare system established by Elizabeth I facilitated both the industrial revolution and, when revived after 1945, the postwar Golden Age of rising prosperity. Only by learning from that past can we create the fairer, nurturing and empowering society necessary to tackle the global challenges that lie ahead - climate change, biodiversity collapse and global inequality.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Anastasia Chamberlen, Peter Dawson, Professor Antony Duff | Societies take it for granted that we should punish those who commit crimes. Punishment for serious crime takes various forms in different areas of world and periods of history: caning, mutilation, death, exile, servitude, and imprisonment are all examples. But why do societies engage in this practice? What purpose does punishing serve? And does the punishment we find in modern societies do an effective job of meeting these aims?
A leading philosopher, a decorated criminologist, and a prominent prison reform campaigner and ex-governor engage in a dialogue to answer these questions.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Harlan Krumholz | We find ourselves in the early 21st century with a plethora of data and a paucity of personalised information to transform care and outcomes. With ever more investments in health care, ever more digital data, ever more computational power, we find that our health indices are declining, our disparities increasing, and ability to translate the life science revolution into tangible population health gains diminishing. In what should be the golden age of health, we are caught in neutral at best, and, in some cases, reverse. Our health care infrastructure was built for a different age, and the economic models, poorly suited to current opportunities, resist change that is necessary for progress. </description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Jan Lucassen, Professor Sara Horrell | Jan Lucassen provides an inclusive history of humanity’s busy labour throughout the ages. Spanning China, India, Africa, the Americas, and Europe, Lucassen looks at the ways in which humanity organises work: in the household, the tribe, the city, and the state. He examines how labor is split between men, women, and children; the watershed moment of the invention of money; the collective action of workers; and at the impact of migration, slavery, and the idea of leisure.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Owen Flanagan, Dr Céline Leboeuf, Dr Emily McRae, Professor Jesse J Prinz | Is anger sometimes a useful emotion? It is often suggested that we should try to suppress our anger. Perhaps passion is a virtue, but anger is simply unproductive. But might anger be useful for achieving positive social change? Can it help us make better moral judgments (or even form part of those judgements)? Can 'good' anger be distinguished in a principled way from 'bad' anger? How do different schools of thought answer these questions?</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Achim Steiner | UNDP’s Human Development Report regularly highlights the impacts of so-called ‘wicked problems’ of under-development, instability and conflict. Recent initiatives such as the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development and the SDG Investor Platform aim to encourage more business and investor contributions to tackling these problems and delivering the SDG Agenda. In this keynote lecture, the head of UNDP Achim Steiner argues that we need to step up multi-stakeholder co-operation and collective efforts to combat rising poverty and inequality, violence that particularly affects women and girls, and economic fragility, that are exacerbated by current crises like COVID-19 and climate change.
The lecture will mark the launch of the LSE IDEAS report Maximising business contributions to sustainable development and positive peace. A human security approach. The report sets out what a human security approach means for business, and highlights issue areas such as information technology, impact investing and migration, where the private sector can make a difference through helping to build resilient communities and delivering the SDGs.</description>

Career and Family explains why we must make fundamental changes to the way we work and how we value caregiving if we are ever to achieve gender equality and couple equity.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Beverly Daniel Tatum | Walk into any racially mixed secondary school and you will see young people clustered in their own groups according to race. Is this self-segregation a problem to address or a coping strategy? Beverly Daniel Tatum guides us through how racial identity develops, from very young children all the way to adulthood, in black families, white families, and mixed race families, and helps us understand what we can do to break the silence, have better conversations with our children and with each other about race, and build a better world.</description>

Once considered an exception, now EU foreign policy in its various guises appeals to a variety of theoretical perspectives and engages with the most important contemporary political debates, from the role of ‘normative power Europe’ to leadership and effectiveness issues to feminist insights.
In this book launch, the editors share their motivations for putting together this collection and, together with contributors, discussant and the audience, discuss the ultimate question: can the study of EU external action overcome Euro-centrism and contribute to a truly global politics?</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Catherine D'Ignazio, Professor Lauren F Klein | Drawing from their recent book, Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a set of principles for data science that are informed by decades of intersectional feminist activism and critical thought. To illustrate these principles they will discuss a range of recent research projects, including some of their own. Taken together, these examples demonstrate how feminist thinking can be operationalised into more ethical, more intentional, and more capacious data practices, in the digital humanities, computational social science, human-computer interaction and beyond.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Michael Cholbi, Dr Will Daddario, Priya Jay | Can we grieve well? Is mourning for public figures very different to the grief we feel after the death of friends and family? What is it like to grieve in the midst of something like a pandemic, where so many lives are touched by tragedy? And what have we learned about grieving though this pandemic, where death is both very publicly discussed but also hidden by the demands of social distancing? We explore the nature of grief and grieving.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): April Rinne | Rinne shows that when everything is in flux, everything benefits from a flux mindset: the ability to consistently see all change as an opportunity, not a threat. She harnesses her very personal experiences with flux, including the death of both of her parents in a car accident when she was 20, as well as her history as a futurist, advisor, global development executive, microfinance lawyer, investor, mental health advocate, certified yoga teacher, globetrotter (100+ countries) and insatiable hand stander, to bring global perspective and cross-cultural understanding to how we see, think about, struggle with and ultimately forge positive relationships with change.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Graciela L Kaminsky, Professor Carmen M Reinhart, Professor Thomas J Sargent | Can we draw parallels between the impact of crisis and war on state’s indebtedness in the past with the consequences of public borrowing in today’s age of independent central banks and aging populations? This panel discussion will bring together experts on the history of finance to examine the fiscal challenges brought about by the pandemic. By situating today’s challenges in their historical context, they will address whether lessons can be learnt from the past about the ways in which debt can be managed and how it will affect the world’s economies in the future.
Meet our speakers
Graciela L Kaminsky is Professor of Economics and International Affairs at George Washington University with expertise in international finance and open-economy macroeconomics. Her research focuses on contagion, currency and financial crises, exchange rates, fiscal and monetary policies, international capital flows, and sovereign debt crises. She has done extensive research on capital flows to Latin American countries during the first globalisation era of 1820-1931.
Carmen M Reinhart (@carmenmreinhart) is Senior Vice President, Development Economics and World Bank Group Chief Economist. Assuming this role on June 15, 2020, Reinhart provides thought leadership for the institution at an unprecedented time of crisis. She also manages the Bank’s Development Economics Department. She comes to this position on public service leave from Harvard Kennedy School where she is the Minos A. Zombanakis Professor of the International Financial System.
Thomas J Sargent is William R. Berkley Professor of Economics and Business at NYU Stern. He was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Economics, shared with Princeton University's Christopher Sims, for his empirical research on cause and effect in the macroeconomy.
Olivier Accominotti is Professor of Economic History at LSE and a Research Fellow at the Centre of Economic Policy Research. His research interests cover international finance and economic history and he has published extensively in these areas, especially on the international propagation of financial crises, the determinants of global capital flows, the evolution of the foreign exchange market, and the structure of the global financial system and money markets.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Eduardo Cavallo, Marla Dukharan, Dr Andrew Powell, Professor Andrés Velasco | The year 2020 will be remembered as one of the most challenging in modern history. Latin America and the Caribbean lost 7.4% of GDP, the largest drop on record in a single year. The region is expected to recover in 2021 but faces a hazardous time ahead. Most countries will require some type of adjustment to maintain fiscal sustainability. While the way forward will be challenging, specific public policies should help countries realize a stronger recovery, not just to the low growth rates of the pre-pandemic period, but to higher rates of growth that will benefit all, with more efficient public policies, higher productivity in the private sector, and more sustainable economies.
Meet our speakers and chair

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Anne-Marie Slaughter | Join us for this event discussing Anne-Marie Slaughter's new book, Renewal: From Crisis to Transformation in Our Lives, Work, and Politics.
Like much of the world, America is deeply divided over identity, equality, and history. Renewal is Anne-Marie Slaughter’s candid and deeply personal account of how her own odyssey opened the door to an important new understanding of how we as individuals, organisations, and nations can move backward and forward at the same time, facing the past and embracing a new future.Weaving together personal stories and reflections with insights from the latest research in the social sciences, Slaughter recounts a difficult time of self‐examination and growth in the wake of a crisis that changed the way she lives, leads, and learns. She connects her experience to her nation's crisis of identity and values as the country looks into a four-hundred-year-old mirror and tries to confront and accept its full reflection.

      <description>Contributor(s): Molly Mathieson, Alexander Mazonowicz, Professor Hanna Pickard | What is addiction? Although it is often discussed in terms of neurobiology, this can’t begin to capture what it means to be addicted and what addiction does to our sense of self.
Philosophers have long been concerned with questions about the self and identity, so might philosophy be able to help us to understand addiction? And what does understanding the relationship between addiction and identity mean for recovery? Philosopher Hannah Pickard and members of New Note Orchestra, the first recovery orchestra in the world, discuss.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Santiago Levy, Professor Nora Lustig, Dr Marcela Meléndez, Professor James Robinson | For as long as data on income inequality has been available, Latin America has stood as one of the world’s two most unequal regions (along with sub-Saharan Africa). Despite some promising declines during the 2000s, inequality in many countries remains higher today than it was in the 1970s, suggesting a persistent high-inequality political economy equilibrium.
Inspired by the Deaton Review of inequality in the UK, an independent group of scholars from across many countries and disciplines – co-sponsored by the International Inequalities Institute at LSE; the InterAmerican Development Bank; Yale University; and the Institute for Fiscal Studies – is launching a five-year review of what we know – and what we need to learn – about the nature, causes and consequences of the high-inequality equilibrium in Latin America. In this public launch event, three of the Review Panel members and two eminent discussants will present and debate some of the core questions of the nascent LAC Inequality Review.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Nicholas Barr, Professor Sir Tim Besley, Dr Tania Burchardt, Gregg McClymont | Join our panelists as they come together to discuss the new issue of the LSE Public Policy Review, Beveridge 2.0: Reciprocity Across the Life-Cycle.
The welfare state plays a central role in managing risks and tackling vulnerability across the life-cycle. This new issue of the LSE Public Policy Review focuses on the relationships between individuals and between generations that underpin welfare state institutions. In face of emerging social and economic changes, our understanding of the social contract invites questions around the role of reciprocity as a principle of social cooperation, and around the way in which reciprocal relationships affect the design and financing of welfare state institutions.

      <description>Contributor(s): Michel Barnier | This event will explore Michel Barnier's new book, My Secret Brexit Diary: a glorious illusion.
In June 2016, the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. As the EU's chief negotiator, for four years Michel Barnier had a seat at the table as the two sides thrashed out what Brexit would really mean. The result would change Britain and Europe forever. During the 1600 days of complex and often acrimonious negotiations, Michel Barnier kept a secret diary. He recorded his private hopes and fears, and gave a blow-by-blow account as the negotiations oscillated between consensus and disagreement, transparency and lies.
You can order the book, My Secret Brexit Diary: a glorious illusion, (UK delivery only) from our official LSE Events independent book shop, Pages of Hackney.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Ulrike Franke, Dr Christian Odendahl, Mujtaba Rahman, Professor Daniela Schwarzer | After 16 years of Angela Merkel's chancellorship, the signals for a new beginning in German politics are ambiguous. Her own party has gone for a candidate who promises continuity. But the Green Party has become the second strongest contender for office and this opens up new possibilities for coalition governments. What does either continuity or change mean for key policies and for European integration? The panel to discuss this question consists of a new generation of leading experts who analyse German politics and policymaking from an international vantage point.
Meet our speakers and chair

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor David Cutler | From New York to New Delhi, COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on our urban world, turning the physical proximity which is central to the creative energy of the city into a potentially deadly threat to our health and wellbeing. Most of us live or work in cities. They are a vital part of both local and global economies and shape the lives we lead and our interactions with others. How can we adjust to this new reality and what lessons can we learn from the past?
In this event, Harvard Economics professors Edward Glaeser and David Cutler examine the history and future of the global city. They argue the biggest threats are those we have created ourselves - inequalities in housing, health, work and education - and that we need to address these as a matter of urgency if our cities are to continue to thrive and drive economic growth and prosperity.
Meet our speakers and chair
David Cutler is the Otto Ekstein Professor of Applied Economics at Harvard University. He holds joint appointments in the economics department, the School of Public Health and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. He served in Bill Clinton’s administration and was a senior health care advisor to Barack Obama. As well as numerous academic books and articles he published Your Money or Your Life: Strong Medicine for America's Health Care System.
Edward Glaeser is the Fred and Eleanor Glimp Professor of Economics in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, where he has taught since 1992. He is also Director for the Cities Research Programme at the International Growth Centre, LSE and Oxford. He has published numerous academic books and articles on urban economics, economic growth, law, health and inequality and is the bestselling author of The Triumph of the City (Penguin Press 2004).
Jo Beall is an Emeritus Professor and Distinguished Research Fellow at LSE Cities and has conducted research in Africa and Asia on urban development and governance as well as cities in situations of conflict and state fragility. Jo was formerly Deputy Vice-Chancellor, University of Cape Town with responsibility for international strategy and is a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Adam Tooze | When news first began to trickle out of China about a new virus in December 2019, risk-averse financial markets could never have predicted the total economic collapse that would follow as stock markets fell faster and harder than at any time since 1929, currencies across the world plunged and investors panicked. Adam Tooze's new book, Shutdown, tells the story of what followed and, in conversation with Patrick Wallis, he will survey the damage and outline potential ways into recovery.

      <description>Contributor(s): Roméo Dallaire, Guissou Jahangiri, Rosa Emilia Salamanca | 21 September marks the International Day of Peace, an opportunity to commit to building a culture of peace. But what exactly is a culture of peace and how do we build it? On this 40th anniversary of World Peace Day our world is far from peaceful.
The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has precipitated war and surrender to the Taliban leaving Afghans behind. Women peacebuilders, who have long been on the frontlines negotiating for peace, now face exponential risk of targeted killings along with other activists and human rights defenders. Meanwhile Colombia marks the fifth anniversary of its peace agreement and despite initial progress, women peacebuilders voice concern about the lack of implementation, particularly regarding the inclusion of women and youth, and the deteriorating security situation. The Global Peace Index reported deterioration in peace in 73 countries, a trend of nine of the last 13 years. Demonstrations, riots and militarisation continue to increase, exacerbated by the weakness of state institutions and rule of law exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor David Kaye, Dr Damian Tambini, Alan Rusbridger, Professor Jean Seaton | Join us for the launch of Damian Tambini’s new book, Media Freedom, where we'll be joined by media experts to discuss media freedom and international human rights law standards in media governance today.
The contentious role of social media in recent elections and referendums has brought to the fore once again the fundamental question of media freedom and the extent to which, and the way in which, the media should be regulated in a modern democratic society. In Media Freedom, Dr Damian Tambini surveys the history of media in the US, the UK and Europe in order to develop a new theory of media freedom that is capable of resolving current controversies about how best to regulate the media, including the internet and social media. Tambini argues that democratic regulation of the media must build upon - and learn from - the long history of accommodation between the press, broadcasting, the state and corporate power. By attending to this history, we can see that media freedom is not absolute but rather conditional, taking the form of a social contract of privileges and connected duties.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Gertjan Vlieghe | Gertjan Vlieghe's term as an external member of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee comes to an end in August. Join us for his final lecture as a member of the MPC.
In this speech, Dr Vlieghe will consider what we have learned in the past five years about some of the persistent structural drivers of low neutral interest rates, such as demographics, debt and the distribution of income. Considerable new research has been published in these areas, both theoretical and empirical, which explores these drivers, including the extent to which they are interlinked. Since these developments constrain the available monetary policy space, Dr Vlieghe then considers how monetary policy should be set in a constrained environment, as well has how these constraints could be lifted to ensure the effectiveness of future monetary policy.

      <itunes:summary>Contributor(s): Dr Gertjan Vlieghe | Gertjan Vlieghe's term as an external member of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee comes to an end in August. Join us for his final lecture as a member of the MPC.
In this speech, Dr Vlieghe will consider what we have learned in the past five years about some of the persistent structural drivers of low neutral interest rates, such as demographics, debt and the distribution of income. Considerable new research has been published in these areas, both theoretical and empirical, which explores these drivers, including the extent to which they are interlinked. Since these developments constrain the available monetary policy space, Dr Vlieghe then considers how monetary policy should be set in a constrained environment, as well has how these constraints could be lifted to ensure the effectiveness of future monetary policy.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Shakuntala Banaji, Dr Koen Leurs, Dr Giovanna Mascheroni, Professor Jochen Peter, Dr Mariya Stoilova | Online opportunities bring diverse benefits for children, including positive outcomes on learning, participation, creativity, and identity. An important “ladder of opportunities” for children in Europe, digital technologies can activate the potential for social inclusion, equality and children’s rights. Even so, relatively little is understood about how online opportunities generate benefits for children. Opportunities for children have long been theorised, but how should they be rethought in a digital world? In this webinar we will debate the theories and concepts that underpin such questions, drawing on different disciplinary approaches.

      <description>Contributor(s): Samira Ben Omar, Dr Atiya Kamal, Caroline MacDonald, Pasha Shah | The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed both how essential and how fractured Britain’s systems of social care and community health are and the racial and economic divides that determine who is able to access them. It has also, paradoxically shown some ways forward for community engagement as local authorities, the NHS and community groups have built new caring relationships that have saved lives and generated mutual support. This event brings together a diverse range of speakers involved in these policies and local initiatives to move beyond recovery and renewal from COVID-19 and question what equitable social infrastructures might look like in a post-covid world.
The event also marks the launch of the LSE Covid and Care Research Group's second report, based on deep ethnographic and qualitative research across the UK. It hopes to set an agenda for investment, research and policy for both central government and local authorities.

Disruptive technology, scientific advancements, and a global pandemic have forever changed the way we live and work. Our digital tools allow us to innovate, accelerate growth, and connect with one another as never before, but they often come with unexpected consequences. The same technologies that had been used for public uprisings against oppressive governments are now being used by those governments against political demonstrators, whistleblowers and dissidents.

When the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe in 2020, it created an unprecedented impact, greater than the aftermath of 9/11 or the global financial crisis. But out of such disruption can come a new way of thinking, and in this new book Gordon Brown offers his solutions to the challenges we face in 2021 and beyond.
In the book, he states that there are seven major global problems we must address: global health; climate change and environmental damage; nuclear proliferation; global financial instability; the humanitarian crisis and global poverty; the barriers to education and opportunity; and global inequality and its biggest manifestation, global tax havens. Each one presents an immense challenge that requires an urgent global response and solution. All should be on the world’s agenda today. None can be solved by one nation acting on its own, but all can be addressed if we work together as a global community.
You can order the book, Seven Ways to Change the World, (UK delivery only) from our official LSE Events independent book shop, Pages of Hackney.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Ela Drazkiewicz-Grodzicka, Professor Bradley Franks, Dr Erica Lagalisse | Conspiracy theories fomented by political division and a global pandemic have gained traction in the public consciousness in the last couple of years. For some people these ideas are just fun and entertaining, but for others their interest in them becomes much more consuming. Why do people become involved in this kind of conspiratorial thinking? That’s the question that LSE iQ tackles in this month’s episode.
Concerns that 5G phone masts reduce our bodies’ defences against COVID-19 and that vaccines are being used to inject us with micro-chips - allowing us to be tracked and controlled - may seem extraordinary to many of us. But these beliefs have led to the vandalism of 5G phone masts and made some reluctant to be vaccinated.
In this episode of LSE iQ, Sue Windebank finds out how left-wing anarchists got caught up in conspiratorial thinking and how Irish parents looking for support and community were accused of spreading a conspiracy. And is LSE unknowingly carrying out the wishes of the Illuminati? Listen to hear how LSE became embroiled in a global conspiracy.
Sue talks to: Dr Ela Drążkiewicz from the Institute for Sociology at the Slovak Academy of Sciences; Professor Bradley Franks from LSE’s Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science; and Dr Erica Lagalisse from LSE’s Institute of Inequalities.

Join us to discuss a special issue of LSE's Public Policy Review, a brand new public policy journal. The special LSEPPR issue on COVID 19 is now available LSE's Public Policy Review.
The COVID-19 pandemic represents an extraordinary health and economic global challenge as well as an opportunity to re-evaluate many aspects of modern economy, society, and government. The crisis has mobilised scientific efforts at an unprecedented scale, with an impressive emerging body of research spanning across disciplines. This special issue invites scholars from across the School to explore a range of key questions the pandemic has raised - from the factors shaping government responses and collective behaviour, to the relationship between policy-making and scientific evidence; from the impact of the pandemic on economic policy and employment, to how it intersected with inequalities related, for instance, to gender or ethnicity. Through their different disciplinary lenses the papers in this issue offer a rich and comprehensive insight into some of the key questions emerging from the current crisis.

      <description>Contributor(s): Michaela Rafferty, Jeremiah Emmanuel, Jason Allen | Even before the pandemic, young people in the UK faced many forms of inequality and their health and wellbeing was being eroded by a lack of jobs, a shortage of affordable housing, and cuts to public services. As the gap between the generations grows and young people’s voices and concerns are not adequately taken into account by policy makers and politicians, it is no surprise that young people increasingly feel anxious of what the future holds. This panel brings three young leaders who are working in and beyond their local communities to address inequalities in education, housing, employment and the criminal justice system.
The three panellists, Jason Allen, Jeremiah Emmanuel, and Michaela Rafferty, will draw on their ongoing work and share their experiences in dialogue with one another and the audience. In doing so, they will not only consider the consequences of inequalities on young people’s lives and their wellbeing, but also discuss what can be done to tackle those inequalities.
Meet our speakers and chair
Jason Allen has a dedicated career and specialism in the treatment of trauma in young people. He is recognised as an national expert in gang and youth violence in London and currently runs Mary’s, a hub for counselling, mentoring and gang mediation in Camden which he built from its inception in 2006. His professional training is wide-ranging and he is currently completing a Masters Degree in Psychology and Trauma.
Jeremiah Emmanuel (@je1bc) was raised in a single-parent family in south London and started working within his local community from a young age, campaigning around issues that affect his generation. He was elected into the UK Youth Parliament and later became a young mayor within London, as well as setting up a Youth Council for the BBC. Dreaming in a Nightmare, his new book, is a manifesto for how we can tackle inequality in the UK and improve the lives of young people today.
Michaela Rafferty (@MichaelaRaffert) is a Youth Engagement and Campaigns Organiser at Just for Kids Law, who exist to ensure young people have their legal rights and entitlements respected and promoted, and their voices heard and valued. She spent 12 years as a community youth worker and human rights activist in Belfast, and has worked in youth rights initiatives in Palestine, women’s empowerment projects in Tajikistan and human rights education in refugee camps in Greece. Michaela is a Senior Atlantic Fellow for Social and Economic Equity.
Armine Ishkanian (@Armish15) is Associate Professor of Social Policy and the Executive Director of the Atlantic Fellows for Social and Economic Equity programme at LSE. Her research focuses on the relationship between civil society, policy processes, and social transformation. She is co-convenor of the Politics of Inequality research theme based in the International Inequalities Institute.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Lasana Harris, Professor Anil Seth, Dr Jennifer Sheehy Skeffington, Dr Tiffany Watt Smith, Professor Paul Dolan | Join Paul Dolan and his guests to launch the latest series of his podcast, Duck - Rabbit, with a discussion of the neuroscience and social science behind our polarisation problem. Why do we respond to the world in one way and not another? What makes us want to be, or feel, part of a group? What drives our judgements, choices and assumptions?
Think of this: you’re shown a picture, it's black and white and sort of blurry, and you are asked what animal you see. You look closely and you see that it’s a duck. But if you’re told it’s a rabbit? Well, you can see for a second how someone could think that but it’s definitely a duck. That’s true of life isn’t it? Think Brexit, climate change, marmite, and even Covid – once we’ve chosen our tribe, we rarely change our minds and see the other side.
Meet our speakers and chair
Lasana Harris (@lasana_harris) is Associate Professor in Experimental Psychology at University College London, having previously held positions at New York University, USA, Duke University, USA, and Leiden University, the Netherlands. A social neuroscientist who takes an interdisciplinary approach to understand human behaviour, his research explores the neural correlates of person perception, prejudice, dehumanization, anthropomorphism, social learning, social emotions, empathy, and punishment.
Anil Seth (@anilkseth) is Professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex and Founding Co-Director of the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science. In his work, he seeks to understand the biological basis of consciousness by bringing together research across neuroscience, mathematics, artificial intelligence, computer science, psychology, philosophy and psychiatry. His new book - Being You: A New Science of Consciousness - will be published in autumn 2021.
Jennifer Sheehy Skeffington (@jsskeffington) is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science at LSE, researching the interface between psychology and society. One stream of research examines how socioeconomic status and inequality shape basic decision-making processes. Another reveals the psychological underpinnings of ideology, and what this means for intergroup conflict and political polarisation.
Tiffany Watt Smith (@drtiffwattsmith) is Reader in Cultural History at Queen Mary University of London, where she is also Director of the Centre for the History of Emotions. Her books include: Schadenfreude (2019), The Book of Human Emotions (2015), and On Flinching (2015). In 2019 she was awarded a Philip Leverhulme Prize, and her research has been funded by the Wellcome Trust, the British Academy and the AHRC. In 2015 she was named a BBC New Generation Thinker and her TED talk The History of Human Emotions has been viewed more than 4 million times.
Paul Dolan (@profpauldolan) is Professor of Behavioural Science at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He is author of the Sunday Times best-selling book Happiness by Design, and Happy Ever After. He is host of the Duck – Rabbit podcast, in which he discusses the polarisation problem with members of the public, academics, commentators, politicians and activists to try to understand why we can’t be more understanding of each other. Episodes currently available discuss marriage and monogamy; security and liberty; freedom of speech; lifestyle choices; and class. This event marks the release of two new episodes.
Simon Hix (@simonjhix) is the Pro-Director for Research and the Harold Laski Professor of Political Science at LSE. An LSE alumnus, he is one of the leading researchers, teachers, and commentators on European and comparative politics in the UK. Simon has recently been appointed Stein Rokkan Chair in Comparative Politics at the European University Institute in Florence and will take up his new post in September.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Maria Christina Chatziioannou, Dr Andreas Kakridis, Professor Stathis N Kalyvas | How far may the economic problems of the modern Greek state be attributed to the nature of its origins? It’s small, albeit enlarging, size; the lack of popular trust in public institutions and authority; the recourse to patrons and to ‘rent-seeking’; and, its own vulnerability to external powers: are these path-dependent features that overwhelm the scope for change?
This panel will discuss the inheritance of 1821 for the course of development taken by modern Greece and how it has structured options and choices. When, and how, has or might such historical determinism be overcome?

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Sophie Harman, Professor Naila Kabeer, Dr Gustavo Matta, Dr Clare Wenham | At this book launch, we discuss the need for gender mainstreaming in global health security.
As many news reports have made clear during COVID-19, there has been a recent sea change in thinking about the secondary effects of infectious disease control policy on women. However, we have yet to see this reflected in global health policy. When Zika made headlines in 2016, images of women cradling babies affected with microcephaly spread across the media and pulled on heartstrings. But, as this book argues, whilst this outbreak was about women and babies, it also highlighted the lack of broader gendered considerations in global health security. Taking Zika as its primary case but also touching on more recent experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic, Feminist Global Health Security asks what the policy response to disease outbreaks tell us about the role of women in global health security.

Join us for the 18th Hellenic Observatory Annual Lecture which this year will be delivered by Notis Mitarachi, Greece's Minister of Migration &amp; Asylum.
Greece has been at the epicentre of much of the migration crisis in the Mediterranean. The accommodation and processing of asylum-seekers and refugees in Greece has proved both challenging and controversial. But there are also major implications of the crisis for the European Union and its individual member states in their burden-sharing. What are the lessons from this humanitarian crisis on Europe’s shores? We explore the ways forward.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Joel Mokyr | Joel Mokyr will discuss the Great Divergence, the rapid economic and technological growth between c. 1500 and 1950, that gave the West the opportunity to dominate (and often oppress and exploit) the rest of the world.
The lecture will answer a simple but haunting question: how were they able to do that?

      <itunes:summary>Contributor(s): Professor Joel Mokyr | Joel Mokyr will discuss the Great Divergence, the rapid economic and technological growth between c. 1500 and 1950, that gave the West the opportunity to dominate (and often oppress and exploit) the rest of the world.
The lecture will answer a simple but haunting question: how were they able to do that?

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Judd Birdsall, Dr H A Hellyer, Dr Courtney Freer | This roundtable discussion will bring together experts from around the world to examine the Biden Administration’s approach to international religious freedom and the implications this has on American foreign policy.
Biden’s predecessor made Religious Freedom a cornerstone of its foreign policy, notably highlighted by the creation of the State Department’s “Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom”, which the UK is expected to host in 2022. Will he carry on a similar legacy? Or will we see a substantial shift from the Biden Administration? Finally, what does this mean for America’s foreign policy?

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Chiara Cordelli | Many governmental functions today—from the management of prisons and welfare offices to warfare and financial regulation—are outsourced to private entities. Education and health care are funded in part through private philanthropy rather than taxation. Can a privatised government rule legitimately?
The Privatized State argues that it cannot. In this new book, Chiara Cordelli argues that privatisation constitutes a regression to a precivil condition—what philosophers centuries ago called “a state of nature.” Chiara is going to discuss her book and issues such as privatisation in the democratic state , role of private actors and a new way of administering public affairs with LSE academic Kate Vredenburgh.

      <description>Contributor(s): Gordon Brown, John Campbell, Dr Jill Pellew, Professor Andrés Velasco | Richard Haldane pioneered cross-party and cross-sector cooperation. How might Haldane's approach - that of the philosopher-statesman - be applied to politics today?
A close friend of Beatrice and Sidney Webb, Haldane was involved in the founding of LSE and his visionary thinking also laid the foundations for Imperial College, the ‘red brick’ universities, the University Grants Committee and the Medical Research Council. As Minister for War he shaped the modern British Army, and was instrumental in the creation of the BEF, the Territorial Army, the Imperial General Staff, the RAF, MI5 and MI6. As a lawyer and philosopher and in particular in his judicial work after becoming Lord Chancellor he was deeply concerned with the development of an effective State and Civil Service. His influence extended beyond the UK to the continent of Europe and to the Empire, especially Canada.

      <itunes:summary>Contributor(s): Gordon Brown, John Campbell, Dr Jill Pellew, Professor Andrés Velasco | Richard Haldane pioneered cross-party and cross-sector cooperation. How might Haldane's approach - that of the philosopher-statesman - be applied to politics today?
A close friend of Beatrice and Sidney Webb, Haldane was involved in the founding of LSE and his visionary thinking also laid the foundations for Imperial College, the ‘red brick’ universities, the University Grants Committee and the Medical Research Council. As Minister for War he shaped the modern British Army, and was instrumental in the creation of the BEF, the Territorial Army, the Imperial General Staff, the RAF, MI5 and MI6. As a lawyer and philosopher and in particular in his judicial work after becoming Lord Chancellor he was deeply concerned with the development of an effective State and Civil Service. His influence extended beyond the UK to the continent of Europe and to the Empire, especially Canada.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Odd Arne Westad | For the last seventy years, the United States has been the predominant state within the international system. Does it make sense to call the United States an empire? Is its power now irrevocably waning? Are we in the midst of a transfer of global power and wealth from west to east? Will China — another international power that can be seen as an empire — be the state benefitting most from the global changes we are now seeing?

Why is Descartes so important? What changed with Darwin? And in what ways have technological advances changed how we think about the mind? Join us as we explore the story of one of the central concerns of philosophy.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Peter Henry | 
In a 2015 communique, the World Bank claimed that rich-country private capital could close the infrastructure services gap, achieve the sustainable development goals, and make money by moving from “billions to trillions” in infrastructure investment in poor countries. This lecture introduces an equilibrium framework. The framework compares a poor country’s social rate of return on infrastructure investment with: (a) the poor country’s return on private capital, and (b) the average rich country’s return on private capital. Applying the framework to the existing, comprehensive cross-country estimates of the social rate of return on infrastructure, reveals, contrary to the World Bank’s claim, that only 7 of 53 poor countries clear the dual-hurdle rate in both paved roads and electricity.

      <description>Contributor(s): Poul Mathias Thomsen | The event will assess the long-term impact of COVID-19 crisis on the Euro Area taking into account the existing structural differences between member states and in particular the fundamental limitations on policies evident from past experience.
It will discuss, the pandemic crisis in relation to the North-South fragmentation within the Euro Area as COVID-19 will significantly increase public debt levels in countries with already limited fiscal space, despite the transfers and debt mutualization implied by the policy response at the European level.

      <description>Contributor(s): Leena Koni Hoffmann, Rachel Bezner-Kerr, Miltone Ayieko | The COVID-19 pandemic is set to radically increase food insecurity in Africa, exacerbating an issue that has only worsened in recent years. The World Bank warns Africa is heading from a health crisis into a food crisis, and the United Nations predicts the rate of chronic malnutrition over the next twelve months could double.
Decisive lockdowns, imposed by many African governments to prevent the virus’ spread, have disrupted the continent’s supply chains and led to rising unemployment. At the same time, huge locust swarms continue to devastate crops across East Africa and, in the continent’s southern region, years of drought have led to repeated crop failures. African countries have quickly become more reliant on externally sourced food at a time when international markets are experiencing unprecedented changes.
Government and international interventions are already in motion, but questions remain about the scale and nature of their delivery. This is especially the case for people living in conflict-affected regions, where humanitarian food aid is harder to deliver.
What can be done to address the upcoming emergency? If regional or global collaboration is needed, how and when can this be delivered for those most in need?
Join our event as experts discuss the outlook for the continent’s food security, and what measures should be taken.</description>

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Andrés Velasco | Join us to hear from Harvard law professor Cass Sunstein speaking about his new book.
Voter fraud, the legitimacy of COVID-19, and fake news are just a few examples of the lies that have recently been spreading like wildfire. Lying has been around for as long as we can remember but today is different, and in many respects, worse. Falsehoods are amplified as never before through powerful social media platforms that reach billions. And unfriendly governments, including Russia, are circulating lies in order to destabilize other nations, including the United Kingdom and the United States. In the face of those problems, Cass Sunstein probes the fundamental question of how we can deter lies while also protecting freedom of speech in his new book Liars: Falsehoods and Free Speech in an Age of Deception.
Meet our speaker and chair
Cass R. Sunstein (@CassSunstein) is currently the Robert Walmsley University Professor at Harvard. From 2009 to 2012, he was Administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. He is the founder and director of the Program on Behavioral Economics and Public Policy at Harvard Law School. Professor Sunstein has testified before congressional committees on many subjects, and he has been involved in constitution-making and law reform activities in a number of nations. His latest book is Liars: Falsehoods and Free Speech in an Age of Deception.
Andrés Velasco (@AndresVelasco) is Professor of Public Policy and Dean of the School of Public Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Gurminder K Bhambra | The social sciences are implicated in the reproduction of the very structures of inequality that are ostensibly their objects of concern. This is partly the result of their failure to acknowledge the ‘connected histories’ of one of their primary units of analysis – the modern nation-state, postcolonial scholar Gurminder K. Bhambra will argue.
In the inaugural Atlantic Fellows for Social and Economic Equity Keynote Lecture, Professor Bhambra will explore the social sciences’ failure to acknowledge the extent to which modern nation-states were bound up with relations of colonial extraction and domination. Without putting such relations at the heart of our analyses, we cannot address global inequality effectively. Positing colonial histories as central to national imaginaries and the structures through which inequalities are legitimated and reproduced, she will explore a framework for a reparatory social science, oriented to global justice as a reconstructive project of the present. The past cannot be undone, she will conclude, but its legacies can be transformed to bring about a world that works for us all.
Meet our speaker and chair

      <itunes:summary>Contributor(s): Professor Gurminder K Bhambra | The social sciences are implicated in the reproduction of the very structures of inequality that are ostensibly their objects of concern. This is partly the result of their failure to acknowledge the ‘connected histories’ of one of their primary units of analysis – the modern nation-state, postcolonial scholar Gurminder K. Bhambra will argue.
In the inaugural Atlantic Fellows for Social and Economic Equity Keynote Lecture, Professor Bhambra will explore the social sciences’ failure to acknowledge the extent to which modern nation-states were bound up with relations of colonial extraction and domination. Without putting such relations at the heart of our analyses, we cannot address global inequality effectively. Positing colonial histories as central to national imaginaries and the structures through which inequalities are legitimated and reproduced, she will explore a framework for a reparatory social science, oriented to global justice as a reconstructive project of the present. The past cannot be undone, she will conclude, but its legacies can be transformed to bring about a world that works for us all.

We are at a crossroads. The wrecking-ball of COVID-19 has destroyed global norms. Many think that after the devastation there will be a bounce back. The event will explore Ian Goldin's latest book, Rescue: From Global Crisis to a Better World.
Ian Goldin believes that this crisis can create opportunities for change, just as the Second World War forged the ideas behind the Beveridge Report. Published in 1942, it was revolutionary and laid the foundations for the welfare state alongside a host of other social and economic reforms, changing the world for the better. Ian Goldin tackles the challenges and opportunities posed by the pandemic, ranging from globalisation to the future of jobs, income inequality and geopolitics, the climate crisis and the modern city. It is a fresh, bold call for an optimistic future and one we all have the power to create.

      <description>Contributor(s): Vishal Talreja | Education is a national endeavour, but with our growing interdependence, is it time we acknowledge it has a global purpose? Join us for the launch of Thrive: The Purpose of Schools in a Changing World.
The event will take the form of an open conversation about the risks and opportunities as education takes a new course. There is no denying that education is in a moment of flux. With disrupted labour markets, entrenched inequality, and stalled social mobility, long-standing international assumptions about education’s purpose are under strain. Meanwhile, the climate crisis and the reckoning with colonialism are pressing for wholescale reform of what schools and universities prioritise. What movements or institutions are fit to lead this change? And what form should change take? There is a need for a new narrative of what education is for: can it be global?

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Anne Phillips | Drawing on her forthcoming book Unconditional Equals, Anne Phillips explores the dangers of treating equality as conditional on some supposedly shared human characteristic.
The claim to be regarded as an equal, or to consider others as our equals, is often explained by reference to some quality all humans are said to possess, something like rationality, a capacity for autonomy, or a sense of justice. This sounds inclusive, but this kind of justification sets up a test. Historically, many millions have been deemed to fail the test: women, the enslaved, the colonised, and those too poor to be considered fully human.
The legacy of this way of understanding equality continues today: in philosophical argument, in public policy, and in everyday talk. One of the consequences is that we cannot be confident of a shared belief in even ‘basic’ human equality, not to mention support for the kind of socio-economic equality usually associated with those on the left.
This lecture explores whether we can think of an equality that is genuinely unconditional. That is, not based on supposed facts about human beings, not something we might forfeit through our actions or character, but something we ourselves enact through our commitments and claims.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Niall Ferguson | Disasters are inherently hard to predict. But when catastrophe strikes, we ought to be better prepared than the Romans were when Vesuvius erupted or medieval Italians when the Black Death struck.
We have science on our side, after all. Yet the responses of many developed countries to a new pathogen from China were badly bungled. Why? While populist rulers certainly performed poorly in the face of the pandemic, Niall Ferguson argues that more profound pathologies were at work - pathologies already visible in our responses to earlier disasters. Drawing from multiple disciplines, including economics, network science and cliodynamics, his new book, Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe offers not just a history but a general theory of disaster.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Janet C. Gornick, Dr Laurie C. Maldonado, Professor Ive Marx, Dr Rense Nieuwenhuis | In the United States, single mothers are often blamed for their own circumstances and offered little support. The American social policy discourse is very much shaped by the image of the “welfare queen” – a never-married single mother who is dependent on public assistance and refuses to work. However, experiences of lone parents across Europe and other countries calls this stereotype into question. So what does this mean for social policy?
Our panel will engage in discussion and provide comparative policy lessons intended to improve the lives of single-parent families in the United States. The panel will also discuss future directions and pressing challenges for single-parent families during a time of COVID-19, as well as social and political unrest in the U.S.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Amal-lee Amin, Carlota Cenalmor, Professor Lord Stern, Josué Tanaka | The challenge of scaling up sustainable investments to support a strong and green recovery and the much more difficult environment for mobilising finance in the post-pandemic world has highlighted the importance of strengthening the role of national and international development banks. This panel event examines the role of the multilateral development banks (MDBs) in achieving this mobilisation from the global north to the global south including scaling up and aligning action with climate responsible development, and sustaining that action.
Even though the need to mobilise greater sums of private finance to meet climate goals is well accepted, this will only increase in the post-COVID-19 world. The three agendas of climate finance, MDBs and mobilisation are the key channels where the global north currently takes actions consistent with its “responsibilities” (including as set out in the Paris agreement). Yet, none of these channels directly set out north-south equity arguments or justifications for global north responsibility around recovery and transformation in the global south.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Cheshire Calhoun | Join us for the Brian Barry Memorial Lecture, an annual event honouring the work of political philosopher and former colleague, Professor Brian Barry.
Embedded in our social practices are three distinct, default conceptions of a responsible person connected with three distinct basic expectations of and stances toward responsible persons. First is the conception of responsible persons as capable of living up to normative expectations and thus being accountability responsible. Second is a conception of responsible persons as in fact disposed to satisfy minimal normative expectations and thus as compliance responsible. Third is a conception of responsible persons as responsibility takers, that is, as both capable of electing and disposed at least sometimes to actually take the initiative to do good things that could be omitted without blame.
In this event Cheshire Calhoun argues that these conceptions are not competing and are rather jointly essential for capturing the complex ways we think about and interact with responsible persons and the centrality of resentment, trust, and hope in everyday life.
Meet our speaker and chair
Cheshire Calhoun is Professor of Philosophy and head of Philosophy faculty at Arizona State University. She has recently been elected to the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.

      <description>Contributor(s): Kate Klonick | The problem of fake news and other contentious online content is one of our most pressing challenges - it is widely believed to have played a major role in the election of President Donald Trump, the outcome of the Brexit Referendum, and in general threatens the healthy functioning of news media in modern democracy.
Our panellists will discuss the risks of deceptive content (both mis and dis information) and will examine what a healthy and mature democracy such as the United Kingdom should do to combat those risks while protecting the rights of individuals and political parties to engage in open and free political debate.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Taina Bucher, Professor Christine Hine, Dr Jean-Christophe Plantin, Dr Bieke Zaman | Technologies are spreading into all aspects of our lives via smart devices, internet of things, augmented reality, and data profiling. Children’s lives have become digital by default and technology is the taken-for-granted means of playing, seeing family, doing schoolwork, hanging out with friends in a post-COVID world. The distinction between the offline and online no longer offers a meaningful way of conceptualising the infrastructure of life but what can we replace it with? Where does the digital begin and end, what does it incorporate? What are the implications for children? In this webinar we will debate the theories and concepts that underpin such questions, drawing on different disciplinary approaches.
Meet our speakers and chair
Taina Bucher (@tainab) is an Associate Professor in Screen Cultures at the Department of Media and Communication, University of Oslo. She studies the relationships and entanglements between algorithms, social and political concerns – examining how users experience and make sense of algorithmic power and politics. Her first book, IF…THEN: Algorithmic power and politics details the ontological politics at stake in the algorithmic media landscape.
Christine Hine (@DigiSocSurrey) is a Professor of Sociology at the University of Surrey. Her work offers a sociology perspective on science and technology with a particular focus on the role played by new technologies in the knowledge construction process. She is interested in the development of ethnography in technical settings and in "virtual methods" (internet-based social research). She has developed mobile and connective approaches to ethnography that combine online and offline social contexts.
Jean-Christophe Plantin (@JCPlantin) is Associate Professor in the Department of Media and Communications at LSE. His research investigates the politics of digital platforms, the evolution of knowledge infrastructures, and the rise of digital sovereignty. His first book, Participatory Mapping: New Data, New Cartography details the use of web-based mapping platforms by non-experts to participate in socio-technical debates.
Bieke Zaman (@biekezaman) is an Associate Professor in Human-Computer Interaction and research group leader of the Meaningful Interactions Lab (Mintlab) at the Institute for Media Studies, KU Leuven, Belgium. Her work lies primarily at the intersection of human computer interaction research and communication sciences and focuses on children, digital media and design; media convergence in a digital society; progressive research and dissemination methods.
Sonia Livingstone (@Livingstone_S) is a Professor of Social Psychology at the Department of Media and Communications at the London School of Economics and Political Science. She has published 20 books including “The Class: Living and Learning in the Digital Age.” Since founding the 33 country EU Kids Online network, Sonia has advised the UK government, European Commission, European Parliament, Council of Europe, OECD and UNICEF.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Philippe Aghion | 
Philippe Aghion, Professor at the Collège de France and LSE, offers a cutting-edge analysis of what drives economic growth and a blueprint for prosperity under capitalism.
With the launch of his book, of which he is a co-author, The Power of Creative Destruction, Philippe Aghion draws on cutting-edge theory and evidence to examine the roots of growth and inequality, competition and globalisation, the determinants of health and happiness, technological revolutions, secular stagnation, middle-income traps, climate change, and how to recover from economic shocks. He shows that we owe our modern standard of living to innovations enabled by free-market capitalism. We hear more and more calls for radical change, even the overthrow of capitalism. Aghion suggests the answer is to create a better capitalism by understanding and harnessing the power of creative destruction—innovation that disrupts, but that over the past two hundred years has also lifted societies to previously unimagined prosperity. The Power of Creative Destruction shows that a fair and prosperous future is ultimately ours to make.
Meet our speaker and chair
Philippe Aghion is Professor at the Collège de France and the London School of Economics and Political Science and was previously Professor of Economics at Harvard. His new book The Power of Creative Destruction, is co-authored with Céline Antonin and Simon Bunel.

      <description>Contributor(s): Muna Luqman, Fatou Bensouda, Hamsatu Allamin | Focusing on the escalating violence and ongoing kidnappings of women and girls in Nigeria and the continued targeting of civilians in Yemen, for this fourth session of the Coming of Age of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda series Sanam Naraghi Anderlini will be in conversation with Hamsatu Allamin, founder of the Allamin Foundation for Peace Development in Maidugiri, Nigeria; Fatou Bensouda, Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC); and Muna Luqman, leading peacebuilder and founder of Food4Humanity in Yemen. 
Reflecting on their personal experiences and journeys into their fields of expertise, this discussion will draw attention to the growing challenge of failed governance by states, the emergence of ungoverned and ‘alternatively governed’ spaces, and the implications for civilians. The panellists will also discuss the role of the ICC when states are implicated in violence against their own citizens, and what can be done when the state is absent and new entities emerge, with no respect for international norms.
Meet our speakers and chair
Hamsatu Allamin is an educator by profession, with 32 years’ experience in teaching, public administration, and project management. She is a gender activist and human rights defender, who initiated the creation of the Network of Civil Society for Peace in Borno and Yobe states in Nigeria.
Fatou Bensouda is the first woman to serve as Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), having assumed office in 2012. In 2011, she was elected by consensus by the Assembly of States Parties to serve in this capacity. Through her work, she has strived to advance accountability for atrocity crimes, highlighting in particular the importance of addressing traditionally underreported crimes such as sexual and gender-based crimes, mass atrocities against and affecting children, as well as the deliberate destruction of cultural heritage within the Rome Statute framework.
Muna Luqman (@munaluqman) is the Founder and Chairperson of Food4humanity. She is an activist for women, peace and security; co-founder of the Women Solidarity Network; and member of the Women’s Alliance for Security Leadership.
Sanam Naraghi-Anderlini (@sanambna) is the Director of the Centre for Women, Peace and Security.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Amartya Sen, Bee Rowlatt | 
Join two great minds in exploring the themes of justice and equality: Amartya Sen and Enlightenment hero Mary Wollstonecraft, as Amartya Sen gives the inaugural Wollstonecraft Society Lecture.
Mary Wollstonecraft claimed human rights for all. She overcame limited education and a background of domestic violence to become an educational and political pioneer, and one of the greatest thinkers of the eighteenth century. As well as her intellectual audacity, it is Wollstonecraft’s love for humanity, her self-proclaimed “ardent affection for the human race” that continues to inspire. This event explores how, despite a savage pandemic, economic downturn, and increasing isolation in both political and individual life, there is a counter-story of community building and education, of optimism and hope.
Meet our speakers and chair
Bee Rowlatt (@BeeRowlatt) is a writer and public speaker, and a programmer of events at the British Library. Her most recent book In Search of Mary retraced Wollstonecraft’s 1795 treasure hunt over the Skagerrak sea. She led the campaign for the Wollstonecraft memorial sculpture and is chair of the Wollstonecraft Society.
Amartya Sen is Thomas W Lamont University Professor and Professor of Economics and Philosophy at Harvard University and an LSE Honorary Fellow. His research has ranged over social choice theory, economic theory, ethics and political philosophy, welfare economics, theory of measurement, decision theory, development economics, public health, and gender studies. Amartya Sen’s books have been translated into more than thirty languages and his awards include the Nobel Prize in Economics. He was Professor of economics at LSE from 1971 to 1977, and he taught part-time at the School from 1978 to 1982. His memoir, Home In The World, will be published in July by Penguin. LSE announced the Amartya Sen Chair in Inequality Studies in 2019.
Alpa Shah (@alpashah001) is Associate Professor of Anthropology at LSE and leads the International Inequalities Institute research theme on Global Economies of Care. Her most recent book is the award winning ‘Nightmarch: Among India’s Revolutionary Guerrillas’.
More about this event
The International Inequalities Institute (@LSEInequalities) at LSE brings together experts from many LSE departments and centres to lead cutting-edge research focused on understanding why inequalities are escalating in numerous arenas across the world, and to develop critical tools to address these challenges.
The Wollstonecraft Society (@TheWollSoc) is a registered charity carrying Mary Wollstonecraft’s legacy of human rights, equality and justice into young people’s lives. It delivers learning materials and experiences, inspired by Wollstonecraft’s work, for young people who might not have heard of her. The annual WS lecture features an outstanding speaker on themes related to her work, and each year it awards a state-educated student the Wollstonecraft Prize for Political Engagement. This lecture is also part of a week-long celebration of events around Mary Wollstonecraft organised by the Newington Green Meeting House.
This event forms part of LSE’s Shaping the Post-COVID World initiative, a series of debates about the direction the world could and should be taking after the crisis.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Richard Bradley, Professor Justin E. H. Smith | Julian Le Grand will talk with Justin E. H. Smith about his new book, Irrationality - A History of the Dark Side of Reason.
Irrationality ranges across philosophy, politics, and current events. Challenging conventional thinking about logic, natural reason, dreams, art and science, pseudoscience, the Enlightenment, the internet, jokes and lies, and death, the book shows how history reveals that any triumph of reason is temporary and reversible, and that rational schemes, notably including many from Silicon Valley, often result in their polar opposite. The problem is that the rational gives birth to the irrational and vice versa in an endless cycle, and any effort to permanently set things in order sooner or later ends in an explosion of unreason. Because of this, it is irrational to try to eliminate irrationality. For better or worse, it is an ineradicable feature of life.
Meet our speaker and chair
Justin E. H. Smith (@jehsmith) is Professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Paris 7–Denis Diderot. His books include The Philosopher: A History in Six Types.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Etienne Balibar | A cosmopolitics that allows it for mankind to address its common interests is clearly needed, as demonstrated again by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is even urgent, a matter of life and death for millions, and survival for the planet as a livable environment.
But there can exist no cosmopolitics without a cosmopolitan idea. From this point of view, we find ourselves in an extremely contradictory situation: always an “essentially contested concept” throughout history, cosmopolitanism today appears squeezed between powerful nationalisms competing for global or local hegemony, and utopian ideals in search of their capacity to rally the multitude. The lecture does not offer a blueprint, it traces a genealogy and delineates some possibilities for the future which is already our actuality.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Michael R. King, Richard Nesbitt, Ghela Boskovich, Vineet Malhotra, Brenda Trenowden | Join us for a panel discussion on The Technological Revolution in Financial Services: How Banks, Fintechs and Customers Win Together, edited by Michael R. King and Richard W. Nesbitt.
Financial services is going through a global transformation. Structural changes are being driven by three forces: regulation, technology, and demographics. This combination is changing the competitive landscape by lowering barriers to entry and increasing competition from outside the industry.
These new entrants are leveraging technology to gain a foothold in financial services, with many of them following the disruption playbook and building a foothold at the bottom end of the market by targeting underserved customers. Rather than being threatened by Fintech startups, banks will be more threatened by global technology companies like the Chinese Techfins Alibaba and Tencent and the bigtech companies Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. These tech companies have platform ecosystems that embed financial services, including payments, lending, investing, and insurance. Technology companies will prove to be the real threats to incumbents over the next decade.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Daphne Nicolitsas | Putting available talent to its best use is key for the welfare of individuals and of the society to which they belong. Unequal access to opportunity in education and labour markets tampers with the allocation of talent leading to more inequality, poverty traps and lower welfare for all. This lecture reviews recent evidence on the misallocation of talent by economic class and gender in different settings, highlighting how temporary shocks - such as the current pandemic can have permanent consequences.

      <description>Contributor(s): Baroness Shafik, Juan Manuel Santos, Professor Amartya Sen | What should a social contract for the 21st century look like?
Launching her new book, What We Owe Each Other, LSE Director Minouche Shafik draws on evidence from across the globe to identify key principles for a social contract for every society. She will be in conversation with Juan Manuel Santos and Amartya Sen.
The social contract governs all aspects of society, from politics and law to our families and communities. Accelerating changes in technology, demography, climate and global health, as we have seen over the last year, will reshape our world in ways we have yet to fully grasp. How do we pool risks, share resources and balance individual with collective responsibility? What part do we each have to play?

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Jim Sidanius | The Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements have led to a renewed focus on the persistence of inequality along the lines of race, gender, and their intersection. Political psychology attempts to shed light on this through connecting individual behaviour to wider institutional and ideological dynamics. On the eve of the completion of an updated edition of his now classic text, Social Dominance: An Intergroup Theory of Hierarchy and Oppression, political psychologist Jim Sidanius will present some of his latest ideas on the psychological foundations of intergroup inequality, followed by a conversation on their relevance to twenty-first century struggles for social justice.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Odd Arne Westad | 
In this series of four lectures, the Elihu Professor of History and Global Affairs at Yale, Odd Arne Westad, discusses the concept of empire and why it is still relevant today.
Even if the Europeans had deemed the 19th century a “long peace”, the world had changed tremendously between 1800 and 1900. Of the 1800 powers only a few remained strong, and they were all European. But, at the same time, the concept of empire was changing, and new forms of anti-imperial resistance was starting to grow. This third lecture will discuss high imperialisms, their relationship to globalising capitalism, and how a destabilised European world initiated the tragedies of the 20th century.

      <description>Contributor(s): Kgalema Motlanthe, Ruth Dreifuss, Helen Clark, Juan Manuel Santos Calderón | 
In the last decade, the negative consequences of the international drug control regime based on repression and coercion have increasingly become visible barriers to sustainable development. Despite important reforms and paradigm changes in certain countries and regions, drug policies still pose serious challenges to the international development objectives.
These consequences range from negative outcomes in control of infectious diseases, in access to controlled pain relief, in over incarceration and disproportionality of sentencing targeting certain populations, to breaches in the rule of law as drug laws are not complied with. These consequences are visible and dire at all levels of governance, and affect the most marginalized populations first.
What can be done to mitigate the negative consequences of drug policies on development, and what reforms are suggested? This high-level discussion will explore the experiences of four former heads of state or government, from four regions in the world, to discuss the medium and long-term solutions to the harms created by current drug control policies.
Meet our speakers and chair

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Sinan Aral | Join us for this talk by MIT professor Sinan Aral who will draw on two decades of his own research and business experience and go under the hood of the biggest, most powerful social networks to tackle the critical question of just how much social media actually shapes our choices, for better or worse.
In his new book, which he will be talking about, Aral shows how the tech behind social media offers the same set of behaviour-influencing levers to both Russian hackers and brand marketers—to everyone who hopes to change the way we think and act—which is why its consequences affect everything from elections to business, dating to health. Along the way, he covers a wide array of topics, including how network effects fuel Twitter’s and Facebook’s massive growth to the neuroscience of how social media affects our brains, the real consequences of fake news, the power of social ratings, and the impact of social media on our kids. In mapping out strategies for being more thoughtful consumers of social media, The Hype Machine offers the definitive guide to understanding and harnessing for good the technology that has redefined our world overnight.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Jessica Wilson, Dr Vanessa Seifert, Philip Ball | The biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky wrote that nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. Is there an even more general theory that can make sense of all the sciences? The various scientific disciplines each have their own methods, theories, and practices. This is the case even when different sciences try to explain the same phenomena. Can we translate between these distinct disciplines? What does this even mean? Might all of science be reduced to physics one day? Our panel discuss reduction, emergence, and the unity of the sciences.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Julia Lynch | Inequality has become an intractable feature of the rich industrialised democracies, despite consensus among mass publics and experts that more social and economic equality is desirable. In this lecture, Julia Lynch will examine the political dynamics underlying the “new normal” of high and rising inequality since 1980.
To do so, she'll trace the largely unsuccessful attempts of west European governments during this period to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in health and argue that inequality persists despite growing awareness of the harms it creates because of the way political leaders choose to talk about it — and not only because of economic necessity or demands from the electorate.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Charles Tripp | This year’s Fred Halliday Memorial Event will explore how and why the symbolic investment in republican discourse and the building of republican institutions can be so detrimental to the rights of the very public that they are meant to represent, even embody.
In the construction and history of the republic, the qualities of liberty, of solidarity and of equality have been powerful affective rallying points, shaping the political imagination and holding out the promise of active citizenship. However, the practices of republics have more often than not borne out the charge of ‘organised hypocrisy’. Even where these principles have not been overturned, there remains a tension between them and the political and economic forces that demand a more disciplined, hierarchical order for the reproduction of their power. Using, by way of illustration, examples from across the Middle East and North Africa, it will nevertheless be argued that these are more universal features of the ways in which republican ideals have materialised – but at the same time, the very tensions and contradictions provide incentives and spaces for an insurgent citizenship.

After a major political struggle, it was obliged to accept new bailout terms and it spent its remaining years in office, in part, implementing its painful measures. In this conversation with Kevin Featherstone, Euclid Tsakalotos will discuss its achievements and setbacks; what lessons its experience suggests for the Left in Europe; and the future for the Left in Greece and elsewhere.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Professor Mariana Mazzucato, Dr Clare Wenham | As part of our online public events programme, we are pleased to invite you to a unique session with: Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, World Health Organization; Mariana Mazzucato, Chair of the WHO Council on the Economics of Health for All and Professor of the Economics of Innovation and Public Value at University College London (UCL) and author of Mission Economy: A Moonshot Guide to Changing Capitalism; and Clare Wenham, Assistant Professor of Global Health Policy at LSE.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed extraordinary challenges to all sectors of society and underscored the centrality of human health and well-being to the very survival of economies and societies at large. It has exposed the great social disparities and inequities found in communities worldwide, including racial, gender and financial, and highlighted the critical need for global solidarity and multilateralism to drive a fair and just response that reaches all.

It will also demonstrate the need for investing in a wide range of essential sectors, from preparedness and universal health coverage to equitable delivery of vaccines, in order to enable people to attain the highest levels of health and wellbeing, and for countries and economies to be able both thrive as well as withstand shocks caused by health crises like COVID-19.

      <description>Contributor(s): Lord O’Neill | Diseases present us with obvious health costs, but there are significant economic costs to illness too. Investing more in health systems and disease prevention, including the use of modern technologies and diagnostics, would not only allow us to cope with future health challenges, but possibly reduce the cost of maintaining and responding to ongoing health care. In this talk, Jim O’Neill will discuss the need to embed health policy in broader economic thinking, reflecting on his experience working in Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and his observations about COVID-19.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Kenneth Amaeshi, Kojo Boakye, Oyin Solebo, Sharmi Surianarain, Dr David Luke | 
Africa is a 1.2 billion person market on the cusp of dramatic and transformative growth. It is adopting new technology and fostering new entrepreneurial ventures to address challenges to its development. At the same time, it is the continent with the largest rate of population growth with the number estimated to double by 2050.
With this growing population, there is a challenge of addressing youth unemployment as it is estimated that 18 million new jobs need to be created annually in order to compensate for the youth that will be entering into the labour market. Currently 3 million are made annually. Along with this, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the state of work on the continent has changed. The tourism and service sector has been hit the worst, and employers are looking for new ways to increase productivity, engage with new customers, and grow their business. In order to do this new ideas and skills are needed from employees to promote this transition and to attract investors that will help unlock Africa's economic future. With this, new conversations are occurring around what measures African nations need to take to address the new terrain in their countries. Many innovative organisations are working to establish pathways for young people into employment and to help Africa capitalise on their fast-growing economies. In order to meet the needs of the coming decade to build profitable, and sustainable enterprises, executives need to meet challenges with innovation, and job-seekers will need to develop the skill-sets necessary to meet the unmet market demands.

      <description>Contributor(s): Jonathan Reynolds | The COVID-19 emergency is testing the protective capacity of welfare states in the most dramatic way. In virtue of their scale and nature, only the state can respond to on-going challenges, but policy responses need to be understood in relation to the capacity of different systems to provide protection and support. Prior to the COVID crisis, recent years had seen a growing debate around different approaches to address human needs: these differed in a variety of ways – in terms of type and coverage of provision, level of generosity and conditionality arrangements – which in turn reflected different priorities and policy goals. The new issue of the LSE Public Policy Review, ‘Beveridge 2.0: The Supportive State’ discusses a range of these approaches, from Universal Basic Income and Universal Capital Grants to Universal Basic Services. It also addresses the radical changes that have affected the development of social security systems and tries to understand contemporary challenges to provide human security more broadly.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Thomas Piketty | Will the Covid-19 pandemic fuel social demand for equality and economic justice?
In this lecture, Thomas Piketty offers a refreshing perspective on the historical rise of equality from the 18th century until the early 21st century. The primary determinants of inequality regimes across societies, Piketty argues, are political and ideological, rather than economic or technological. If we remember lessons as to how societies handled past inequality crisis, it is possible to pursue the long-run trend toward equality.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Tom Reader | In the post-COVID world, companies (and indeed societies) will need to develop a culture that allows them to maximise productivity whilst retaining safety. How might the principles developed for managing safety in high-risk industries help organisations successfully balance these twin aims?
Organisations in high-risk domains, like aviation, energy and healthcare, have been managing risks around productivity and safety for many years. It is a tricky balance to reach: they must prioritise safety in order to not jeopardise operations, yet to remain solvent and successful they must also focus on productivity, and thus manage risk.

      <description>Contributor(s): Minette Batters, Tony Danker, Professor Sam Fankhauser, Frances O'Grady | How best can the UK economy compete in the world of the future? What model of market regulation should we seek and can we realistically attain? And, over what time scale? How far might the UK’s strategy be blown off course by wider, exogenous pressures or by domestic pushback? What accommodation should we seek in regulatory standards with our external partners?
The panel will discuss the prospects for the future, the opportunities and the threats.

      <description>Contributor(s): Dr Odul Bozkurt, Professor Brian O'Connor, Professor Judy Wajcman | When it comes to work, is less more?
Our panel discuss whether work is making us bad citizens and unhappy humans. Is there something to be said for being idle? Bertrand Russell wrote that "immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous". In more recent times, organisations from Microsoft to the Wellcome Trust have experimented with a four-day week, and advocates argue that shorter working weeks will solve everything from unemployment to the gender pay gap. Brian O’Connor has recently argued that idleness allows us to be truly free.

      <description>Contributor(s): Professor Tony Travers, Kieron Boyle | How can policy makers and urban health leaders plan through this uncertainty, and how can those plans help to address the changing nature of and existing inequalities in urban health?
To explore this question, we focus on a scenario planning approach undertaken by the Guys’ and St Thomas’ Charity and LSE Cities. Developed using a combination of social and spatial data analysis, existing research, and community input, we will discuss the five scenarios, or imagined futures, and what each might mean for urban health policymaking in years to come.
Living in cities has always carried distinct health challenges. Not only has COVID-19 emphasised issues of poor-quality housing and the importance of access to adequate green spaces, it has also challenged many of the previously considered health benefits of urban life: good public transport links, better employment options, and access to culture and leisure opportunities.
The effects of the pandemic in cities have not been experienced equally and it is vital to remember that those worst affected often have little option over whether they live in cities or not.
