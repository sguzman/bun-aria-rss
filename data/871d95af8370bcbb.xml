  <title>Capital and funding</title>
  <description>Banking operations are being rewired around XVA metrics, quantifying market incompleteness. Here Claudio Albanese, Simone Caenazzo and Stéphane Crépey focus on the cost of funding of variation margin and the cost of capital: that is, funding valuation adjustment (FVA) and capital valuation adjustment (KVA). Motivated by Basel Pillar 2, Solvency II and IFRS 4 Phase II, they propose a principled approach to accounting regulatory treatments for FVA and KVA, arguing the two are intertwined since economic capital is itself a source of funding</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/regulation/basel-committee/2456382/capital-and-funding</link>

  <title>Testing interest rate models for Solvency II applications</title>
  <description>Solvency II guidelines require that models used in calculations be checked for appropriateness. Since interest rate risk is one of the key risks for insurance companies, it is essential to ensure that the corresponding models are fit for the task. Here, Alexey Botvinnik and Vladimir Ostrovski show a way to effectively validate such models</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/regulation/solvency-ii/2441865/testing-interest-rate-models-for-solvency-ii-applications</link>

  <title>Reporting and fragmentation worry as insurers grapple with Solvency II interim guidelines</title>
  <description>Solvency II is on its way to a rolling start after national supervisors pledged to adopt Eiopa’s interim guidelines as their own. Reporting requirements are the main concern for insurers, which are hastily rebooting their compliance programmes. But large pan-European groups are also alert to the implications of regulatory fragmentation in the run-up to full implementation of the rules in 2016.</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/asset-management/insurance/2331060/reporting-and-fragmentation-worry-as-insurers-grapple-with-solvency-ii-interim-guidelines</link>
