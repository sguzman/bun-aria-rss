   <media:description>This video attempts to display the incredible detail that goes into drawing an arbitrary shape using Fourier epicycles.  Although there is little here that is truly new, I wanted to spend some time just enjoying the beauty of Fourier series.  Why?  Well, to quote Grant Sanderson, &quot;Because why not?&quot;  And why should he have all the fun?

Thanks once again to Noah Lape for helping record the live narration scenes.

   <media:description>In this video we take a detailed look at how to construct an orbit of arbitrary shape by using moons upon moons and the mathematical technique of Fourier series.

   <media:description>In this video we analyze the trajectory of a moon about a star in search of a square orbit.  It turns out that it's not too difficult to create a reasonably square orbit.  Interestingly, the trajectory of a moon about a star is identical to the trajectory of a point on a wheel that rolls without slipping around the outside of a circle!

   <media:description>In this video we perform an analysis of an object that rolls while slipping against the ground, like when a cue ball is hit with English in the game of pool.  Surprisingly, the final velocity of the object is independent of the coefficient of friction, which means it will have the same final velocity whether sliding on a wooden table or on ice!

Special thanks to the Gingerbread Man in Carlisle, for giving us access to their pool room after hours.  Thanks also to Jonathan Barrick, for making the disk, to my son Adam for helping record the pool scenes, and to Noah Lape for helping record the intro/outro clips.

   <media:description>This video takes an in-depth look at a rolling wheel, and demonstrates that the point on the wheel that's in contact with the ground is instantaneously at rest.  In addition, this point acts as the instantaneous center of rotation, which means that all points on the wheel are (instantaneously) rotating about the point in contact with the ground.  In my opinion, the fact that the contact point is the instantaneous center of rotation is probably the most interesting aspect of a rolling wheel.  And of course, if you're going to talk about a rolling wheel, it would be criminal not to mention that the path of a point on the periphery of wheel traces out a cycloid.

Special thanks to my partner in crime, Marc Renault, for helping get the video footage of a speeding car.  Thanks also to Jonathan Barrick, for making the beautiful wheel, and to Noah Lape for helping record the intro/outro clips.

   <media:description>This video is a bit of a teaser posted as part of the #VeritasiumContest, which requires videos be no longer than one minute, and also as part of the #SoME1 contest.  Obviously, I can't go into much detail in a one-minute video, but I will be posting a follow-up video that contains much more detail about a rolling wheel.  For such a simple system, there's a surprising amount of subtle physics at play.  So if you hunger for a more detailed explanation, check back soon (better yet, hit the subscribe button).</media:description>
