<p>These data show the level and share of U.S. household wealth held by four percentile groups of wealth: the top 1 percent, the next 9 percent (i.e., 90th to 99th percentile), the next 40 percent (50th to 90th percentile), and the bottom half (below the 50th percentile). Additionally, the top 1 percent has data divided into the top 0.1 percent (99.9th to 100th percentile) and top 99 to 99.9 percent (99th to 99.9th percentile).</p>



<p>Of the 117 new series, 112 series are data for the top 0.1 percent and top 99 percent to 99.9 percent wealth percentiles, with the remaining additional series being household count and minimum wealth cutoff data. </p>The post <a href="https://news.research.stlouisfed.org/2022/09/fred-expands-distributional-financial-accounts/">FRED Expands Distributional Financial Accounts</a> first appeared on <a href="https://news.research.stlouisfed.org">St. Louis Fed Economic Research</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>As surely as the sun rises, FRED continues to provide great data tools. The latest is our new mapping feature. You can customize, share, and download geographical maps of data directly in FRED.</p>



<p>These maps are available for series in a dataset that have geographical characteristics, such as per capita personal income for U.S. states: For example, Missouri personal income can be examined on a U.S. state map.</p>


<p><iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?m=QhfA&amp;width=670&amp;height=640" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:690px;" allowtransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe></p>



<p>Our <a href="https://geofred.stlouisfed.org/">GeoFRED website</a> will close down Sept. 1, 2022, and we know a change like this can be disruptive, especially if you use GeoFRED as a teaching tool. So we hope our new FRED map feature will be a helpful alternative to engage with data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maps provide a cross-sectional perspective that lets you compare regions on a map while complementing and expanding the data analysis you get on a time-series graph. FRED has 9 types of maps: U.S. counties, U.S. metro areas, U.S. states, nations, Federal Reserve Districts, Census regions, Census divisions, BEA regions, and NECTAs (New England city and town areas).</p>



<p>Check out our <a href="https://fredhelp.stlouisfed.org/#fred-maps">FRED map tutorials</a> for additional guidance on how to use this new feature and try it out to:</p>



<ul><li>Supplement your data story with an interactive map.</li><li>Share your customized map with an option to automatically update the map with the latest data.</li><li>Embed your maps in your favorite blog site.</li><li>Download all data on the map into a single file.</li></ul>
