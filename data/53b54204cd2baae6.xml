      <title>Outward: Fire Island</title>
      <description>It’s June, and in honor of Pride, we’re bringing you a special episode from the Outward podcast!
Hosts Christina Cauterucci, Jules Gill-Peterson, and Bryan Lowder dig into the big gay movie of summer 2022: Fire Island. Directed by Andrew Ahn and written by Joel Kim Booster, who also stars in the film, Fire Island explores the magic of queer spaces like the titular enclave—along with the class and race disparities that often beset them. The film, which also stars Bowen Yang, Margaret Cho, and Conrad Ricamora, is a gay resetting of Pride and Prejudice. Does it succeed? The hosts discuss this, and much more, in spoiler-filled detail.
This podcast was produced by June Thomas.

      <title>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</title>
      <description>This week’s Spoiler Specials takes on Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Film critic Dana Stevens is joined by Slate senior editor Sam Adams to spoil the Marvel film that stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Directed by Sam Raimi, the first action scene takes place at the wedding of Doctor Stephen Strange’s (Benedict Cumberbatch) ex (Rachel McAdams) being interrupted by a one-eyed octopus creature from space that’s chasing after America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez).
It’s an explosive start to a film that has some of the best –and the worst– of what Marvel movies are famous for.

      <title>Decoder Ring: The Sideways Effect</title>
      <description>Hey, Spoiler Specials listeners, Dana Stevens here. If you haven’t heard the Slate podcast Decoder Ring yet, I urge you to check it out. Hosted by our friend Willa Paskin, each episode cracks a different cultural mystery by examining its history and why it still matters today. In their new season they look at how men’s razors went from one...to two...to five blades! They explore how "method acting" became so misunderstood—there’s more to it than just Jared Leto behaving badly.
And now, we present their latest which I loved. It follows the unlikely path of a 2004 indie flick from director Alexander Payne...off the screen and onto our restaurant menus. Decades later, the American wine industry is still under the influence of “The Sideways Effect." Make sure to subscribe to Decoder Ring wherever you listen, and I hope you enjoy this episode!

With all the drama that unfolds, how will Lady Whistledown keep up with this season’s shenanigans?

      <title>Scream (2022)</title>
      <description>On this week’s Spoiler Specials, Slate staffers Jeffrey Bloomer, Sam Adams, and Josh Levin spoil the latest Scream movie. 
After high-schooler Tara Carpenter (Jenna Ortega) is attacked and hospitalized by Ghostface, her estranged sister Sam (Melissa Barrera) comes back to town with her boyfriend Ritchie (Jack Quaid). The reunion causes a surprising family secret to be revealed. More mayhem ensues as old characters return to the Scream fold. Who is the new Ghostface—and is this franchise dead?
CORRECTION: After this episode was taped, Jeffrey Bloomer realized that he had misspoken about the familial connections of a key character in Scream 4: That person was Sidney’s cousin, not her niece.

      <title>Spider-Man: No Way Home</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Slate staffers Allegra Frank and Sam Adams spoil Spider-Man: No Way Home. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is grappling with being identified as Spider-Man. This not only has consequences for him, but also his girlfriend, Michelle “MJ” Jones-Watson (Zendaya), and his best friend Edward “Ned” Leeds (Jacob Batalon) who are rejected from MIT. This inspires Peter to approach Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. But what happens when it all goes sideways?

      <title>Godzilla vs. Kong</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Slate’s senior editor Allegra Frank is joined by Brow Beat nights and weekends editor at Slate, Matthew Dessem, to spoil Godzilla vs. Kong, the new action-packed sci-fi movie from director Adam Wingard.  
Kong and his protectors go on a perilous journey to find his true home but soon find themselves in the path of an enraged Godzilla as he cuts a swath of destruction across the globe.

      <title>Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week Slate’s movie critic Dana Stevens is joined by New Yorker staff writer Rachel Syme to spoil Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, the new adventure-filled comedy by real life best friends and the writers who brought us Bridesmaids, Kristin Wiig and Annie Mumolo. 
When lifelong best friends and roommates Barb (Annie Mumolo) and Star (Kristin Wiig) leave their Midwestern hometown for the first time ever, they embark on a vacation to Vista Del Mar, Florida. What starts out as a bit of harmless fun in the sun, quickly becomes the most unexpected, bizarre and even dangerous adventure of a lifetime for the pair. Will they ever be the same?

      <title>Saint Maud</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Slate’s movie critic Dana Stevens is joined by Slate features editor Jeffrey Bloomer and New York Times correspondent Ruth Graham to spoil Saint Maud, the feature film debut from writer and director Rose Glass. 
In this extremely eerie horror film, we meet Maud, (played by Morfydd Clark) a reclusive young nurse charged with the hospice care of Amanda, (Jennifer Ehle) a former dancer who has been diagnosed with cancer. At first, they find commonality in their religious beliefs. But will Maud’s newfound faith guide her and Amanda toward a path of healing? Or is something more sinister at play?

      <title>Mank</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Slate’s Dana Stevens is joined by Slate’s Brow Beat’s nights and weekends editor Matthew Dessem to spoil Mank, the new film about the making of another film, Citizen Kane. Will Herman Mankiewicz, a troubled alcoholic (played by Gary Oldman), finish his script in time for his deadline? Will anyone like the film? And how does a California Governor's race fit into it all?

      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Christina Cauterucci and June Thomas discuss Happiest Season, a charming new Christmas rom-com from writer-director Clea DuVall that premiered on Hulu on Nov. 25. Harper Caldwell (Mackenzie Davis) invites her girlfriend, Abby (Kristen Stewart) home for Christmas. Right before they arrive, Harper shares that the people in her hometown, or even in her family, don’t know that she’s gay. And since her father is running for mayor, the couple has to keep their relationship a secret. How will Abby navigate the holiday season while hiding her authentic self? What impact will the holiday weekend have on the lovebirds and their relationship?

      <title>Enola Holmes</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Slate’s Marissa Martinelli and Laura Miller spoil Enola Holmes. 

Enola, who likes to remind people that her name spelled backwards is ‘alone,’ wakes up to find her mother missing. While Enola is determined to investigate her mother’s disappearance, it’s up to Mycroft and Sherlock to figure out what to do with their little sister. Can Enola outwit her intelligent brothers and break free from the stuffy, proper future Mycroft sets out for her? 

Plus, Marissa and Laura delve into other, more transgressive, Holmes stories with female protagonists.

      <title>Tenet</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. 

This week, Slate’s Sam Adams and Vox’s Film Critic Alissa Wilkinson spoil Tenet. Christopher Nolan’s time-bending thriller is visually spectacular yet incredibly confusing. 

The main character, played by John David Washington, simply referred to as the Protagonist is a CIA operative who becomes entangled with Tenet, a secret organization that’s fighting a future that’s actively attempting to destroy the world. The Protagonist suddenly finds himself in a world where things, and even people, can be inverted to travel backwards through time. Can the Protagonist save the world before it’s too late? How does Nolan incorporate palindromes within the movie’s structure? And what parallels can be drawn to Bill &amp; Ted? 

Note: As the title indicates, this podcast contains spoilers galore.

      <title>I'm Thinking of Ending Things</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Slate’s Dana Stevens and Matthew Dessem spoil I’m Thinking of Ending Things. Charlie Kaufman starts the film following a young couple, Lucy (Jessie Buckley) and Jake (Jesse Plemons) driving on a snowy evening to meet and have dinner with Jake’s parents. Lucy is already second guessing the trip since she doesn’t know if she wants to stay with Jake, who oddly seems to physically react when she thinks about breaking things off with him. Kaufman intersects their journey with the experiences of a janitor at a high school. Things start to get weird when the couple arrives at Jake’s childhood home. As the movie progresses, the characters become untethered from time and the film calls into question if Lucy and Jake even exist. And what does the janitor have to do with anything?

      <title>I May Destroy You</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Slate’s Television Critic Willa Paskin is joined by Vulture Staff Writer Angelica Jade Bastién to spoil I May Destroy You. Michaela Coel is at the heart of this series. Besides writing and producing the show, she directed many episodes and plays the main character, Arabella Essiedu. Coel covers consent, rape, friendship, and empathy, in a complex, yet compelling, way that really humanizes Arabella. 

Arabella is a young writer and influencer working on her second book when her drink was drugged and raped while at a bar in London. The series follows her as she works through the aftermath of her assault. Does Arabella regain her full memories of her sexual assault? Will she be able to finish her book? Will she accept the help from another acquaintance who she believes to have raped her? How does she use fantasy to imagine a better resolution for herself than reality can give her?

This week, Slate’s movie critic Dana Stevens is joined by Willa Paskin, Slate’s television critic, and Sam Adams, a senior editor at Slate and the editor of Slate’s culture blog, Brow Beat, to spoil Palm Springs. At first, Palm Springs seems like a fun wedding rom-com until Nyles (Andy Samberg) is shot with a bow and arrow while fooling around in the desert with Sarah (Cristin Milioti). Injured, he crawls into a nearby cave and tells Sarah not to follow him. She ignores his warning and is pulled into his infinite time loop. Will she follow Nyles’ lead and make peace with the situation? Why is Nyles being hunted? Why is Sarah so desperate to find a way out? And what is with those dinosaurs? 

You can read Sam’s interview with the theoretical physicist who consulted on the movie here.

      <title>Irresistible  </title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Dana Stevens, Slate’s movie critic, is joined by Sam Adams, a senior editor at Slate and the editor of Slate’s culture blog, Brow Beat, and Tom Scocca, Slate's politics editor. They dive into Jon Stewart’s comedy starring Steve Carell as an out-of-touch political operative who decides that a former marine would make a great Democratic candidate for mayor in Deerlaken, Wisconsin. It creates a proxy battleground in rural Wisconsin as Carell’s Republican counterpart, played by Rose Byrne, ups the ante. Stewart practically perfected political commentary woven with jokes during his time on The Daily Show. But can he harness that same nuance as a director? And how does the movie’s big twist affect Stewart’s message about unchecked money in politics? 

You can read Sam Adams’ review here.

      <title>Da 5 Bloods</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Dana Stevens, Slate’s movie critic, is joined by Aisha Harris, writer and editor for The New York Times’ Opinion section to spoil Da 5 Bloods. 
Spike Lee’s newest film follows a group of Black Vietnam War veterans as they reunite years later. The group returns to Vietnam to find the remains of Stormin’ Norman, their commander who died during the war. While they are there, they try to retrieve a lost cache of CIA gold. At first the search seems easy–too easy. But soon familial tensions, lingering PTSD, and environmental hazards start complicating the mission. How many of the remaining Bloods will make it back out of the jungle?
Plus: Dana and Aisha break down Spike Lee’s employment of numerous film techniques, including an innovative use of four different aspect ratios. 

You can read Sam Adams’ review here. 

You can read Matthew Dessem’s piece on the aspect ratios here.

You can also read Matthew Dessem’s piece on the real story behind the landmine scene here.

      <title>The Hunger Games Prequel: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. We have a very special episode this week! Sam Adams is joined by Laura Miller to discuss the new Hunger Games prequel, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. Suzanne Collins’ new novel explores President Snow’s origin and descent into one dimensional villainy seen in the Hunger Games trilogy. The story departs from the YA dystopian genre that Collins’ trilogy helped shape. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a more sophisticated, philosophical examination of human nature and the battle of nature versus nurture. How does Coriolanus Snow regain the power and money his family lost during the war? What is his role in the spectacularization of the Hunger Games? What can The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes teach readers about the realities of living in a surveillance state? 

You can read Laura Miller’s review here. 
You can also read Lara Miller’s explanation of the unusual names in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes here.

      <title>Hollywood</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Slate’s Sam Adams, Matthew Dessem, and Daniel Schroeder spoil Hollywood. Ryan Murphy and co-creator Ian Brennan reimagine a more inclusive golden-age of filmmaking. While the first couple episodes of the Netflix series stay relatively grounded in reality, the series takes a sharp right turn into self-serving fantasy by simplifying the fight for equality and progress within Hollywood.

      <title>Too Hot to Handle</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Slate podcast producer Daniel Schroeder and Slate staff writer Rachelle Hampton discuss Netflix’s new reality dating show: Too Hot to Handle. Ten attractive contestants are thrown together on an island to compete over a $100,000 prize. To win the money, they need to form bonds that are more than skin deep. The catch is they can’t have any sexual contact - even with themselves - for the remainder of “the retreat.” For every sexual encounter, the group loses money out of the prize pot. Can the sexy singles restrain themselves, even when workshops and drama challenges their resolve?

      <title>Tiger King</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Sam Adams is joined by Slate’s Television Critic Willa Paskin to spoil Netflix’s hit documentary series Tiger King. The hit series is an increasingly sordid tale of wild characters conning each other out of zoos. The show’s standout character is Joe Exotic, whose charisma and personality are made for reality television. He has a long time feud with Carole Baskin, who runs the nonprofit Big Cat Rescue and is actively trying to shut private zoos down. Will Carole succeed? What happens when Joe tries to hire someone to murder Carole? And when will anyone focus on the questionable conditions forced on the big cats?

You can read Sam Adams’ review here and his story about the artists behind Joe Exotic’s music here. 

You can read Willa Paskin’s piece about Carole Baskin here.

      <title>Contagion</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Slate Senior Editor Sam Adams is joined by Slate Staff Writer Rebecca Onion to spoil Contagion, Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 pandemic movie. Not dissimilar to the coronavirus, the fictional virus, MEV-1, started off transferring from infected animals to humans. MEV-1 infected Gwyneth Paltrow’s character on a work trip. Then she traveled back to the Midwest, spreading the virus. Can the institutions in charge find a vaccine before the virus decimates society? 

You can read Rebecca Onion’s piece about the lessons to take from Contagion here.

You can read Sam Adams’ interview with the screenwriter here.

      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Marissa Martinelli and Heather Schwedel discuss Emma. Though certainly not the first adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel, director Autumn de Wilde’s film humanizes the familiar characters and departs at times from the source material to bring a certain freshness to this comedy. Will Emma’s meddling still result in matchmaking errors? How far does she have to go to right her wrongs? And what’s with the inopportune nosebleed?

This week, Sam Adams is joined by Benjamin Frisch, Rachelle Hampton and Daniel Schroeder to discuss The Witcher, Netflix’s popular new show about a monster hunter.

Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) is a monster hunter with supernatural powers. But, what exactly is a witcher? How will the Law of Surprise bring people together? Will Geralt ever find the girl in the forest who he is destined to find? And what kind of transformation comes at the cost of removing one’s womb?

Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) is a monster hunter with supernatural powers. But, what exactly is a witcher? How will the Law of Surprise bring people together? Will Geralt ever find the girl in the forest who he is destined to find? And what kind of transformation comes at the cost of removing one’s womb? </p><p><br></p><p>You can also check out past Spoiler Specials, and you can subscribe to the podcast on Apple Podcasts.

      <title>Cats</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Sam Adams and Marissa Martinelli discuss Cats, the movie adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, which was based on poems by T.S. Eliot. Many jokes have been made about Tom Hooper’s Cats, mostly stemming from the “digital fur technology.” After the premiere, Universal Pictures released an updated version with “some improved visual effects.” But the 1981 musical wasn’t free from criticism either - yet it was still a hit. Does the movie adaptation have more of a plot? Does the star-studded cast add to the many cat introductions? Which cat at the jellicle ball will be picked for another life? And what exactly does jellicle mean? 


You can read Marissa Martinelli’s review here. 

You can read Dana Stevens’ review here. 

You can read Violet Kim interview with Cats’ ‘feline movement expert’ here and read the investigation into how many times the Cats in Cats Say “Cats” here.

      <title>Outward: Special Episode: The Inheritance</title>
      <description>In this special bonus episode of Outward, Bryan and a guest panel of multigenerational gay men devote a whole hour to The Inheritance, a seven-hour, two-part play by Matthew Lopez that won many awards for its recent run in London and is currently dominating discussions on Broadway. There will be spoilers!
While it’s length, ambition, and engagement with the AIDS crisis have invited comparisons to Tony Kushner’s “gay fantasia on national themes” Angels in America, The Inheritance’s driving concern is a bit more personal: If gay men think of ourselves as a community spanning generations, what happens when a huge swath of that community is lost to plague, the survivors deeply traumatized, and younger cohorts must therefore come of age and figure out what it means to be gay in the wake of a tragedy that shapes everything around us? Borrowing a line from E.M. Forester’s Howard’s End, on which the play is based, The Inheritance desperately wants gay men to “connect” across age and loss — but is that kind of connection really possible?

      <title>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Dana Stevens is joined by Forrest Wickman, Sam Adams and Marissa Martinelli to discuss Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Director J.J. Abrams seemed committed to fan service; even if it made the final episode of the Skywalker saga worthy of some eyerolls. Well, committed to fans - except those shipping Poe and Finn - despite the film touting the franchise's first same-sex kiss. With the final battle looming, will Rey discover who she really is? Will she be persuaded by Kylo Ren to join the dark side? Or will they join forces? And how does ‘forcetiming’ play into all of this?

      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Dana Stevens, Jeffrey Bloomer and Heather Schwedel discuss Uncut Gems. 
Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), owner of a small jewelry store in Manhattan, racked up a gambling debt while the rest of his life is collapsing. He’s trying to avoid creditors when his shop receives an illegal gem from Ethiopia. This rock, Ratner thinks, is his ticket out of debt. He temporarily trades Kevin Garnett, of the Boston Celtics, the rock for Garnett’s NBA Championship. Ratner pawns the ring to bet on the championship game. Will The Celtics win? Will Garnett get his ring back? Will Ratner finally get out of debt?

This week, Dana Stevens and Sam Adams discuss Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story. Charlie and Nicole have decided to end their marriage. Now they need to figure out how to get a divorce. Can they keep the proceedings civil or will it escalate to a fraught situation as divorce lawyers pit them against each other? Will Charlie have to uproot his life to maintain custody? What will happen to the kid? At the end of the divorce, will they even be able to remember why they fell in love in the first place?

      <title>Knives Out</title>
      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Dana Stevens and Forrest Wickman discuss Knives Out, the whodunnit from Rian Johnson. Renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey’s death following his 85th birthday party sparks a twisted hunt for the murderer. The suspects: his own family. Can celebrity detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) pin down Thrombey’s eccentric family intent on avoiding suspicion. What happens when they find out Harlan’s personal nurse, Marta, will receive his fortune? And what role does ICE have in a potential motive?

      <description>On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Slate staffers Marissa Martinelli, Inkoo Kang and Heather Schwedel spoil Last Christmas. Emilia Clarke’s character, Kate, is a walking disaster.

But what’s Tom’s real motive? Why does Kate’s heart feel funky? And what does Brexit have to do with any of this?

And how does Jojo navigate those challenging his ideology and the imminent fall of Nazi Germany?

But is it just one bad day that leads Arthur down this path? Or is it a consequence of broken system failing to help someone in need?

This week, June Thomas and Seth Stevenson discuss Downton Abbey--the movie. It’s been four years since viewers visited the upstairs or downstairs of Downton. Much to our critics’ delight, seemingly nothing has changed, save for Lady Mary’s hairdo. As Downton Abbey prepares for the royal visitors, quips fly and schemes are afoot. But will the servants clash with the unsavory, arrogant royal retainers? And will Downton survive the visit with its dignity intact?
