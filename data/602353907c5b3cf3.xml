  <title>Non-parametric local volatility formula for interest rate swaptions</title>
  <description>The volatility smile in the interest rate derivative models has long been an important topic in theory and practice. With a growing divergence of monetary policy cycles between the US and Europe, there is a stronger need for robust smile models that would allow for pricing illiquid, out-of-the-money and exotic interest rate products. Dariusz Gatarek, Juliusz Jabłecki and Dong Qu propose a simple Dupire-like local volatility formula that works for swaptions. Working in a Cheyette-type quasi-Gaussian framework, they link the resulting swap rate local volatility to the dynamics of two state variables parameterising the entire evolution of the interest rate curve, which allows for fast and accurate calibration</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/derivatives/interest-rate-derivatives/2444629/non-parametric-local-volatility-formula-for-interest-rate-swaptions</link>

  <title>The free boundary SABR: natural extension to negative rates</title>
  <description>In the current low interest rate environment, extending option models to negative rates has become an important issue. Here, Alexandre Antonov, Michael Konikov and Michael Spector extend the widely used SABR model to the free boundary SABR model that can handle negative rates. They derive an exact option pricing formula for the zero correlation case, and a suitable approximation for the general case. The analytical results are successfully compared with the Monte Carlo simulations</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/derivatives/interest-rate-derivatives/2423287/the-free-boundary-sabr-natural-extension-to-negative-rates</link>

  <title>CCP basis market takes off – but will buy-side join in?</title>
  <description>Over the past three months, it has been more expensive to trade a pay-fixed US dollar swap that will clear at CME than at rival LCH.Clearnet, resulting in a surge in volumes and volatility for so-called basis trades. Now, banks are trying to get buy-side firms involved</description>  <link>https://www.risk.net/derivatives/interest-rate-derivatives/2420724/ccp-basis-market-takes-off-but-will-buy-side-join-in</link>

  <description>John Hull, Alexander Sokol and Alan White introduce a new concept, called local price of risk, to construct and calibrate a joint-measure model describing the evolution of interest rates under both the real-world and risk-neutral measures.
