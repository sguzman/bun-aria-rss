			<description><![CDATA[<p>Trivia refers to obscure or useless information, but this definition is a far cry from the word's etymology. Trivia, or <em>tri-via</em>, literally means "three roads," and in Ancient Roman times, it referred to three-way intersections.

Nothing at all, which is why most of us probably overlook the obvious fact that "understand" is actually a compound word comprising "under" and "stand."

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In Old English, the word "world", or <em>weorold</em>, did not refer to a place. It was a compound word comprising <em>wer</em>, meaing "man", and <em>ald</em>, meaning "age". "World" literally meant "the age of man", and in many of its earliest usages, it's more closely related to a man's "lifetime" or "lifespan" than the earth he inhabits. We also look at some unlikely cognates of "world", all of which share etymologies related to "manliness". </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In many English works printed before the late 19th century, a letter unfamiliar to us today, ſ, is often used in place of the letter S. However, that unfamiliar f-looking letter is actually just an archaic form of the letter S called "long s". In this episode, we explore the origins and decline of this odd orthographical relic. As a coda to our series on lost letters, we also explore the history of the ampersand (&), which up until the late 19th century was often listed as the 27th letter of the alphabet. <br /> <br /> Examples from the episode:<br /> <br /> 1. Us'd, Clos'd</p> <p>2. Always puffs, offset, satisfaction; never puffſ, offſet, satiſfaction</p> <p>3. 17th century: mask, disbelief; 18th century maſk, diſbelief</p> <p>4.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In ancient Greek botanical literature, there is a reference to a spiny plant called a <em>kaktos</em>. This word would pass into Modern English as "cactus," though the <em>kaktos </em>itself was certainly not a cactus as we know it. More likely, it was an undomesticated "artichoke," a plant whose name ultimately comes from Arabic.

In general, these cognates are associated with speakers of Romance languages throughout Europe. Strange!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>At last, the finale in the Words for Granted series on days of the week! ‘Saturday’ comes from a root that literally means ‘day of Saturn.’ Unlike the rest of the English names for the days of the week, it’s a direct etymological descendent of the original Latin word for Saturday.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In today's episode, we look at the etymology of mouse, but really, it's a springboard into a far more complicated topic: the word "mice," its irregular plural form. Why do we say "mice" and not "mouses" when referring to more than one mouse? The answer lies in the grammar of an ancient tongue that predates modern English by thousands of years. This is the most linguistic-heavy episode of Words for Granted yet, so first-time listeners, beware!</p>]]></description>
