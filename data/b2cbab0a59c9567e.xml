   <media:description>Host Daniel Donskoy travels to different cities to meet exciting Jewish guests. Together they discuss and philosophize about the meaning of being Jewish. What is life like for Jews in London, Buenos Aires, Tel Aviv, and Istanbul?

In the evening, before hosting his guests, Daniel Donskoy explores the cities he visits: covered in oil from head to toe for a Turkish oil wrestling match in Istanbul, visiting Pride in Tel Aviv, or as the &quot;Leader” on a double-decker bus in London. It is all about Jewish identities and stories, where you often don't know whether to laugh or cry.
 
Always playful and charming, Donskoy provides his various guests for the late-night show with home-cooked food and engaging questions. From an author, comedian, all the way to a rabbi, they talk about the reality of their Jewish lives. With such an intimate atmosphere, they open up right away in front of the camera.

In this episode Daniel Donskoy is in Argentina's capital city, Buenos Aires.

A production by Turbokultur Berlin on behalf of WDR.

   <media:description>Europe was built on the principle of freedom of movement. But security politics, xenophobia, unemployment, the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing war in Ukraine are continuously re-defining migration movements, along with the rules that govern them.

The humanitarian catastrophe caused by the war in Ukraine has resulted in the development of many different reception strategies across the EU. The complexity of this response demonstrates how inconsistent Europe’s answer to immigration and human suffering is. While some refugees are welcomed with open arms, others are are turned away. 

Krakow’s population has increased by 50% since Russia attacked Ukraine in February 2022. Meanwhile, Europe has been busying itself with drawing up real and virtual borders that are patrolled by militia. 

But migration is an entirely normal phenomenon. People who leave their home country in search of a better life have shaped the face of the continent for centuries. From England to Bulgaria, expats are a core part of Europe’s identity.

In spite of this, foreign workers frequently face rejection. They are often blamed for national economic decline. Nonetheless, they are a vital element of modern-day Europe: In an aging society that depends on migrants to survive, they are the backbone of the labor market. But as right-wing and eurosceptic voices rise, these basic facts tend to get lost. 

Now, the war in Ukraine is causing Europe to re-think its position -  both ethically and practically. Once again, Europe’s migration policies are facing historical challenges.

   <media:description>Microplastics have only recently become an issue outside the scientific world. A pioneering researcher in this field, Christian Laforsch is primarily interested in the long-term hazards they pose - something that could assume critical importance for us in the future.

Microplastics can be found everywhere: in snow up in the mountains, in our rivers - and in the air that we breathe. They comprise particles so minute that they can only be seen under a microscope. Professor Christian Laforsch and his team from the University of Bayreuth have devised their own customized instruments to track down microplastics in water, the air and farmland soil. They also want to find out how dangerous they are for humans and our environment.

Seema Agarwal is a chemist who knows the problem all too well from her native India. She's working on the development of organic-based plastics that are 100% biodegradable. At the same time, she's trying to reach out to the chemical industry - because in her eyes, the obvious and ultimate goal is to prevent microplastics being created in the first place.

   <media:description>Janez Lenarčič, the EU Commissioner for Crisis Management, travels to Colombia and Panama. He wants to help people fleeing violence and poverty. And sends a signal: Despite its own crises, Europe thinks of Latin America too.

In Panama, the EU wants to open its first permanent Crisis Reaction Center outside of Europe in order to be prepared for humanitarian crises and natural disasters. This way, people in need should receive aid without compromising EU interests. A report by Alexandra von Nahmen, Assistance: Felipe Abondano and Johan Ramirez.

   <media:description>At the end of their Mediterranean journey, Sineb El Masrar shows Jaafar Abdul Karim her parents’ country. In Morocco, the two visit Tangier’s souk and its old city, with its view across the strait of Gibraltar to Europe.

Sineb then travels on alone. She meets an animal rights activist, helps out in a women's cooperative and hears the famous female &quot;Hadra&quot; singers in Chefchaouen, known as &quot;The Blue City&quot;. After securing the right to sing in public, they have made female Sufi chanting famous far beyond Morocco’s borders.

Again and again, Sineb finds evidence that Morocco has its sights set on progress. The kingdom is undertaking an energy revolution, aiming to generate more than 50 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. For now, the Moroccan-made electric car is still a test project. But engineer Kawtar Benabdelaziz sees e-mobility as the future -- and not just in her own country.
Back in Tangier, Sineb and Jaafar look back on their travels around the Mediterranean. One thing is clear: its coastline contains multitudes. With its distinctive mix of European, Arabic and African communities, the Mediterranean’s richness lies in its diversity.

   <media:description>The fight against the destruction of nature is a dangerous one. Around the globe, people are risking their lives to protect the environment and climate. When environmentalists’ activities disrupt organized crime and other illegal profiteers, they are sued, threatened and even murdered.

According to the organization Global Witness, 227 environmental activists were killed in 2020 alone, and the number of unreported cases is probably much higher. In addition to environmentalists, indigenous people who fight illegal land grabs and journalists who report on environmental crimes are often also in grave danger. This documentary accompanies those for whom fighting for the environment is dangerous work.

The filmmakers travel to Nigeria, a country known for its oil wealth. But in parts of the Niger Delta, people suffer due to leaking oil pipelines. Huge areas are contaminated with oil, leading to empty fishing nets, polluted water, contaminated fields and a high mortality rate. Many people are starving. And they are as good as defenseless, because anyone who resists the oil mafia is threatened or even killed.

In Peru, non-governmental organizations and indigenous people are up against international corporate interests that exploit the rainforest. Illegal palm oil, cocoa and coffee plantations are tearing huge holes in the jungle. Added to this is the overexploitation of tropical timber and, more recently, the production of cocaine. For those who want to protect the Amazon rainforest, the work is extremely dangerous.

In Europe, too, the pressure on environmentalists is growing. Due to an increase in timber and energy prices, illegal logging in Romania's forests is becoming more and more profitable for criminals. And those who work to uncover the illegal business live in fear of retribution.

   <media:description>Collecting taxes and distributing tax money are core tasks for a modern state. This documentary tells the history of taxation, from the French Revolution to political protest movements like France’s &quot;Gilets Jaunes”.

Part 1: https://youtu.be/ashglZx5yaU

Is taxation an instrument serving the powerful, or a way to more fairly distribute wealth among the people? Part Two of the documentary looks at the history of citizen protests against &quot;those at the top&quot;, as well as demands for taxation justice.

After the 2008 financial crisis and the austerity policies that followed, voices of protest were heard all over Europe: whether from Brexit supporters in the United Kingdom, the &quot;Gilets Jaunes” (or &quot;yellow vests”) in France, or those disadvantaged by German reunification. These protests highlight a growing mistrust on the part of citizens toward their governments, and tax policy is often a bone of contention.

Since the American Revolution with its rallying cry of &quot;No taxation without representation&quot;, taxation and popular sovereignty have been mutually dependent. Current protests are a reminder to those in power of this basic rule of democracy. Meanwhile, the protests themselves hark back to turbulent moments in history: Since the Middle Ages, taxation has led to repeated conflicts between Europeans and their rulers. This two-part documentary follows the trail of these conflicts.

   <media:description>Host Daniel Donskoy travels to different cities to meet exciting Jewish guests. Together they discuss and philosophize about the meaning of being Jewish. What is life like for Jews in London, Buenos Aires, Tel Aviv, and Istanbul?

In the evening, before hosting his guests, Daniel Donskoy explores the cities he visits: covered in oil from head to toe for a Turkish oil wrestling match in Istanbul, visiting Pride in Tel Aviv, or as the &quot;Leader” on a double-decker bus in London. It is all about Jewish identities and stories, where you often don't know whether to laugh or cry. 

Always playful and charming, Donskoy provides his various guests for the late-night show with home-cooked food and engaging questions. From an author, comedian, all the way to a rabbi, they talk about the reality of their Jewish lives. With such an intimate atmosphere, they open up right away in front of the camera.

In the first episode, Daniel Donskoy is in London to meet British comedian David Baddiel and Dana Margolin, singer of &quot;Porridge Radio&quot;.

A production by Turbokultur Berlin on behalf of WDR.

   <media:description>On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an all-out attack on Ukraine. While Putin spuriously claimed that the country must be &quot;denazified,&quot; the attack is in fact part of the Russian leader’s attempt to return to the days of Russian empire.

From the very beginning of his tenure, the Russian president's foreign policy strategy aimed to destabilize Russia's neighboring states. The Chechen war raged from 1999 to 2009. In 2008, Putin attacked Georgia. This was followed, in 2014, by the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Putin’s goal was always to bring these neighbors back into the Russian sphere of influence, and to prevent the emergence of democratic societies there. 

Putin also wanted to prevent neighboring countries from drawing closer to the EU or NATO. But his desire to exert military power over foreign states was not limited to Europe: Putin also came to the defense of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and used Russian-controlled mercenary troops to intervene in Libya, the Central African Republic and Venezuela. 

Within Russia, he has managed to consolidate his power thanks to drastic coercive measures and state-controlled propaganda. In this documentary, Russian journalists, human rights activists and even oligarchs have their say. They paint a picture of a man whose quest for power knows no bounds.

   <media:description>In 2011, Libya’s longtime dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi was overthrown and killed by French-backed rebels. A decade later, once high hopes for a &quot;Libyan Spring&quot; have long since vanished, as Libya is torn apart by civil war.

Foreign actors like Turkey and Russia are also moving in. &quot;They’re slicing up Libya like a cake,&quot; says Libyan activist Emad Shanab. Ankara and Moscow have seized their opportunity to gain a foothold in the Mediterranean country, upsetting the region’s geopolitical balance. In the chaos that followed the fall of Gaddafi, the terrorist militia IS was also able to set up operations in Libya.

A popular uprising degenerated into ongoing civil war. The eastern and western parts of the country are divided into different camps under two rival governments. The younger generation is traumatized by ongoing conflict. As activist Emad Shanab asks: &quot;How long can this go on? What do we have to do? Leave the country? Die? Is dying our only choice?&quot;

Europe is deeply divided over Libya. The divergent strategies of Western powers, with their conflicting economic interests, are only driving Libya further into disintegration. An influx of sophisticated weapons - despite a UN embargo - poses a growing threat to the security of the entire Mediterranean region.

   <media:description>Friend or foe? In a fraction of a second, our brain forms an impression of a person based on their facial expressions and voice. And artificial intelligence is getting better and better at interpreting human emotions.

Faces and voices are the first impressions we get of people we don’t know. In less than half a second, we decide whether we like or trust a person, and how intelligent we think they are. That’s thanks to the astonishing processing power of our brains. We learn to read facial expressions as babies, and as we grow older we continue to interpret emotions according to facial expressions. The voice also plays a crucial role: speed, syntax, tone, and phonetics all provide information about what a person is feeling. 

But we are not the only ones who can decipher human emotions. Artificial intelligence technology is also learning to read faces and voices. A photo or a spoken sentence is usually enough to get information about identity, health, emotions and even personality. And the internet has become a vast and ever-growing database of faces and voices. Based on the sound of a voice, artificial intelligence can now detect whether a person suffers from Parkinson's, depression or even Covid-19. In this documentary, international experts offer insight into the latest science, illuminating how our brains work -- and the potential of artificial intelligence.

   <media:description>Many countries, particularly in the West, have long taken reliable food supplies for granted. But climate change, conflict and population growth are challenging such certainties. How can we ensure food security for everyone in the future?

The vertical farm run by Anders Riemann in Copenhagen aims to get the maximum yield from the smallest area possible and operate sustainably. The CEO grows vegetables over 14 stories at his carbon-neutral indoor farm. Eight hundred kilograms of lettuce are grown here each week at Nordic Harvest. Riemann sees this alternative to conventional agriculture as a big opportunity for the future. He says the corona pandemic and the war in Ukraine have shown us just how vulnerable our food supply chains are. &quot;We need local food production in our cities, as part of the infrastructure.”

Agricultural scientist Urte Grauwinkel is part of a project researching what food crops could be better adapted to the new climate conditions in eastern Germany. Part of the idea is also to become less dependent on food imported from far away. She is experimenting with nutritious plants such as chickpeas, millet, amaranth, quinoa and hemp. 
Seaweed is another food with potential for the future. It is seen as environmentally friendly, hardy and nutritious. However, this superfood has not caught on yet in many western countries. Joost Wouters, the former manager of a soft drink manufacturer, wants to change that. He has set up the Seaweed Company to bring together seaweed farmers and the food industry. Could seaweed grown in Europe help feed more people in the future and counteract overfishing?

   <media:description>Two years into Joe Biden's presidency, the rift between the political camps in the US remains deep. Now midterm elections are around the corner. The Republican Party is confident, while the Democrats fear they'll lose ground – including in Wisconsin.

Two years ago, Joe Biden won the presidential election - now voters are giving him and his Democratic Party an interim report card. In the midterms on November 8, a new House of Representatives will be elected, along with one-third of the Senate. In the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin the political wind have shifted of late. Many voters there have grown disenchanted with President Biden's policies. That's also true for Milwaukee's Black community, which played a decisive role in the outcome of the 2020 elections. That's why campaign managers of both parties have ramped up their efforts to win over the city's African American voters. A report by Sumi Somaskanda.

   <media:description>As he travels the Mediterranean, Jaafar Abdul Karim visits Andalusia in Spain. He tries flamenco dancing, tours the Alhambra, and finds his dream house on the Costa del Sol. In Tarifa, photographer José Luis Terrado shows Jaafar his photographs of refugees.

Flamenco music has its roots in the south of Spain. In Las Negras, journalist Jaafar Abdul Karim meets up with flamenco performer Anabel Veloso for a dance. His Mediterranean journey then takes him into the interior of Andalusia. Throughout its history, the region has been a gateway to the Arabic-speaking world. More than 700 years of Islamic rule have left their mark, especially on the architecture. In Granada, Jaafar visits the famous Alhambra, a world heritage site.

Back on the shores of the Mediterranean, the journey continues past beautiful beaches and picturesque bays to the city of Málaga. It’s located on the &quot;Costa del Sol&quot;, where the sun shines more than 300 days per year. The climate attracts millions of tourists, especially from Germany and Britain. Many have bought property here. In Estepona, Jaafar finds his dream home: the architects José Carlos Moya and Bertrand Coue have built a solar house with floor-to-ceiling windows and 360-degree panoramic views. Its unique design allows it to follow the trajectory of the sun, all day long. 

Finally, Jaafar heads to Tarifa, just 14 kilometers across the sea from Morocco. The proximity to the North African side of the Mediterranean has inspired the work of photographer José Luis Terrado. His pictures depict migration and the conditions under which refugees from Africa have to work in order to survive. More than any other destination on his Mediterranean journey, Andalusia shows Jaafar Abdul Karim just how closely linked Europe and Africa are, culturally as well as economically.
