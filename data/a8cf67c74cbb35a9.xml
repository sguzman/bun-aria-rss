	The transistor, the basic building block of the electronics industry, was developed in 1947 by 
	<a href="https://ethw.org/John_Bardeen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John Bardeen</a>, <a href="https://ethw.org/Walter_H._Brattain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Walter Brattain</a>, and <a href="https://ethw.org/William_Shockley" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">William Shockley</a> at <a href="https://ethw.org/Bell_Labs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bell Labs</a> in Murray Hill, N.J., to replace the vacuum tube. The three honorary IEEE members received the 1956<a href="https://ethw.org/Nobel_Prize" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Nobel Prize</a> in physics for their work.
</p><p>
	To mark the transistor’s 75th anniversary, the 
	<a href="https://eds.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Electron Devices Society</a> is holding seminars and panel discussions at IEEE conferences, as well as presenting webinars, giving away prizes, and organizing other events from now until the end of next year.
</p><hr/><p>
	“These events are being done at each conference to remind the community how important the mighty transistor has been over the past 75 years,” says IEEE Fellow 
	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravitodi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ravi Todi</a>, the EDS president.
</p><p>
	 Todi says he is particularly excited about the celebrations scheduled for this year’s 
	<a href="https://www.ieee-iedm.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting</a>, the society’s flagship conference, being held from 3 to 7 December at the <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/sfofhhh-hilton-san-francisco-union-square/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hilton San Francisco Union Square</a>. The conference has been bringing together engineers from academia and industry for more than 70 years.
</p><h3>About the IEEE Electron Devices Society</h3><br/><p>EDS was established in 1952 as a committee of the <a href="https://ethw.org/IEEE_Communications_Society_History#IRE_.28Institute_of_Radio_Engineers.29" target="_blank">Institute of Radio Engineers</a>, one of IEEE’s predecessor societies. After IRE’s merger in 1963 with the <a href="https://ethw.org/IEEE_Communications_Society_History#AIEE_.28American_Institute_of_Electrical_Engineers.29" target="_blank">American Institute of Electrical Engineers</a>—which formed IEEE—EDS was an IEEE technical group. It became a society 13 years later.</p><p>EDS now has about 9,000 members and 250 chapters worldwide.</p><p>“We pride ourselves on the fact that a lot of the core inventions of transistors were developed by IEEE EDS members,” says Ravi Todi, the society’s president.</p><p>
	“A lot of the key inventions that have to do with the transistor have been first presented at this conference,” Todi says. “IEEE IEDM has played a key role in driving the progress of the transistor.”
</p><p>
	Several society members are compiling a book about the transistor and its history. In addition, technical articles are scheduled to run in 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/" target="_self"><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></a> and in the <a href="https://eds.ieee.org/publications/eds-newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>EDS Newsletter</em></a>.
</p><p>
	 “Our aim is to teach and enlighten members on the importance of the transistor,” says IEEE Senior Member 
	<a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/manoj-saxena-a0629a14" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Manoj Saxena</a>, who is overseeing the anniversary celebrations. “The events shall be a tribute to the men and women who have contributed to the development of the transistor, which has had a lasting impact on people's lives and has benefited mankind.”

	EDS is collaborating with the 
	<a href="https://sscs.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society</a> to mark the anniversary. Since January, the two societies have been presenting a <a href="https://eds.ieee.org/education/webinars" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">webinar series</a> on the effect transistors have had on society and technological advances. Every month, a member who works in the field of electron device engineering gives a presentation on a technology impacted by the transistor. Presentations so far have covered 2D semiconductors, chemical sensors, and 5G cellular technology. The talks are <a href="https://eds.ieee.org/education/webinars" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">available on demand</a> on the EDS website.
</p><p>
	EDS is compiling a commemorative book designed to explore the development of the transistor and how it has changed in the past 75 years. Transistor pioneers including 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/transistor-wars" target="_self">Digh Hisamoto</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/four-ieee-fellows-share-queen-elizabeth-prize-for-digital-cameras" target="_self">Eric R. Fossum</a>, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-medal-of-honor-goes-to-transistor-pioneer-chenming-hu" target="_self">Chenming Hu</a> are writing chapters for the book, which is scheduled to be published early next year. Hisamoto, an IEEE Fellow, developed the 3D double-gate metal-oxide-silicon field effect transistor in 1989. Three years later, Fossum, also an IEEE Fellow, invented the CMOS image sensor. An IEEE Medal of Honor recipient and IEEE Life Fellow, Hu is known as the “<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law" target="_self">father of the 3D transistor</a>” for inventing the FinFET in 1999.
</p><p>
	“We want to capture historical accounts of the device’s development and growth,” Todi says.
</p><p>
	IEEE EDS chapters are holding events to celebrate the anniversary. The activities include social gatherings, technical talks, and historical seminars.

The vacuum-electronics devices are used for communication with distant space probes and for other applications that need the highest data rates available.</p><p>The amplifiers can cost as much as US $1 million apiece because they’re made using costly, high-precision manufacturing and manual assembly. Gamzina’s startup,<a href="https://elvespeed.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Elve</a>, is using advanced materials and new manufacturing technologies to lower the unit price.</p><hr/><p>It can take up to a year to produce one of the amplifiers using conventional manufacturing processes, but Elve is already making about one per week, Gamzina says. Elve’s process enables sales at about 10 percent of the usual price, making large-volume markets more accessible.</p><p>Launched in June 2020, the startup produces affordable systems for wireless connections that deliver optical fiber quality, or what Gamzina calls <em>elvespeed </em><em>connectivity</em>. The company’s name, she says, refers to atmospheric emission of light and very low frequency perturbations due to electromagnetic pulse sources. Elves can be seen as a flat ring glowing in Earth’s upper atmosphere. They appear for just a few milliseconds and can grow to be up to 320 kilometers wide.</p><p>Based in Davis, Calif., Elve employs 12 people as well as a handful of consultants and advisors.</p><p>For her work with amplifiers, Gamzina, an IEEE senior member, was recognized with this year’s<a href="https://vacuumelectronics.org/veysaward.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Vacuum Electronics Young Scientist Award</a> from the<a href="https://eds.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> IEEE Electron Devices Society</a>. She received the award in April at the<a href="https://www.ieeeivec.org/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> IEEE International Vacuum Electronics Conference</a>, in Monterey, Calif.</p><p>“Dr. Gamzina’s innovation and contributions to the industry are remarkable,” IEEE Member <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272687400" target="_blank">Jack Tucek</a>, general chair of the conference, said in a<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220510005453/en/Elve-CEO-Recognized-with-IEEE-Vacuum-Electronics-Young-Scientist-Award" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> news release</a> about the award.</p><h2>Interactions between millimeter-wave signals and electrons</h2><p>In addition to running her company, Ganzima works as a staff scientist at the <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a>, in Menlo Park, Calif.—a U.S. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/national-laboratories" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Department of Energy national lab</a> operated by Stanford University. It was in this role that she began speaking to industry representatives about how to expand the market for high-performance millimeter-wave amplifiers.</p><p>From those discussions, she found that lowering the price was key.</p><p>“Customers are paying between $250,000 and $1 million for each individual device,” she says. “When you hear these numbers, you realize why people don’t think this price is anywhere close to affordable for growing the market.”</p><p>Elve’s millimeter-wave power amplifier system weighs 4 kilograms, measures 23 centimeters by 15 cm by 8 cm, and is powered by a 28-volt DC input bus. The heart of the amplifier system is a set of traveling-wave tubes. TWTs are a subset of vacuum electronics that can amplify electromagnetic signals by more than a hundredfold over a wide bandwidth of frequencies. They’re commonly used for communications and radar imaging applications, Gamzina says.</p><p class="pull-quote">“Our ultimate goal is to be part of the terrestrial market such that the amplifiers are installed on cellphone towers, enabling high-data-rate communication in remote and rural locations all over the world.”</p><p>The TWT takes a millimeter-wave signal and makes it “interact with a high-energy electron beam so that the signal steals the energy from the electron beam. That’s how it gets amplified,” Gamzina says. “In some ways, it’s a simple concept, but it requires excellence in RF design, manufacturing, vacuum science, electron emission, and thermal management to make it all work.”</p><p>Elve’s millimeter-wave amplifiers enable communication with satellite networks and create long-distance ground-to-ground links.</p><p>“This allows enormous amounts of data to be sent, leading to higher data rates that are comparable to fiber or laser-type communication devices,” Gamzina says. “Another advantage is that the amplifier can operate in most inclement weather.”</p><p>The initial market for Elve’s amplifiers is the communications field, she says, especially for backhaul: the connections between base stations and the core network infrastructure.</p><p>“Our ultimate goal is to be part of the terrestrial market such that the amplifiers are installed on cellphone towers,” Gamzina says, “enabling high-data-rate communication in remote and rural locations all over the world.”</p><p>The company plans to develop millimeter-wave amplifiers for imaging and radar applications as well.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

There she studied vacuum devices that operate at terahertz frequencies for use as power sources in particle accelerators, broadcast transmitters, industrial heating, radar systems, and communication satellites. She also led research programs in additive manufacturing techniques.

<img src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/overhead-view-of-vehicle-traffic-on-highway-with-widgets-in-foreground-info-for-editor-if-needed.jpg?id=31963264&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C234%2C0%2C235"/><br/><br/><p>Sensors enabled by the Internet of Things are network-connected smart devices that collect and transmit real-time data about their environment. The data they provide lets people make better-informed decisions.</p><p>The use of IoT sensors has grown explosively in recent years because their increasing functionality, small size, and low power consumption allow designers to deploy them in new applications to increase productivity and lower costs. The sensors are being used in new ways to maximize the capabilities of network-connected systems and infrastructure.</p><hr/><p>The sensors are poised for mass-scale adoption in fields including automotive, health care, industrial automation, energy, and smart cities. But the lack of standardization in IoT sensors, coupled with interoperability challenges, has made them vulnerable to cyberattacks—which creates barriers for their ubiquitous use. Hackers are targeting IoT sensors in greater numbers, in more industries, and with increased sophistication.</p>
<h2>Consequences of poor cybersecurity</h2><p>A cyberattack can lead to financial penalties and legal issues if it renders a business or organization unable to fulfill its contractual obligations. An attack could harm the corporate brand and generate user mistrust of affected systems. It is costly and time-consuming to repair damage caused by an attack.</p><p>More concerning is the inability to collect and transmit uncorrupted data in real time from critical applications such as with network-connected medical devices. The growing use of such medical devices to monitor and treat diabetes and other conditions depends on sensor cybersecurity.</p><p class="pull-quote">Cyberattackers are targeting IoT sensors in greater numbers, in more industries, and with increased sophistication. Interoperability challenges reduce the ability to access the sensors and the data they publish.</p><p>Another area where sensor cybersecurity is essential is smart cities, a recently growing market. Smart cities use networks that rely on systems of IoT-enabled sensors to gather data to improve local services, allocate resources more effectively, and manage traffic signals and other infrastructure. If compromised sensors fail to send timely, accurate information, then safety issues might arise. People and property could be in danger if warnings about fires, chemical spills, or other emergency situations fail to reach public safety officials in time.</p>
<h2>Sensors can improve operational efficiency</h2><p>The power and energy sector could significantly benefit from sensor cybersecurity and interoperability to help determine when and where to efficiently distribute power.</p><p>Consider the U.S. grid, which comprises about 7,300 power plants; 160,000 miles of high-voltage power lines; and millions of miles of low-voltage power lines and distribution transformers, according to the U.S. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=27152" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Energy Information Administration</a>. The grid consists of equipment of varying vintages and different technologies, is operated by many companies, and is serviced by vendors with differing cybersecurity practices. Achieving adequate cybersecurity in such a large, disjointed system is a monumental challenge, but it could have a great impact on autonomous control of power systems.</p><p>In industry, automated systems are critical to improving operational efficiency and precision manufacturing, helping to make up for worker shortages. But when the IoT sensors in automated or semiautomated systems fail to operate, workers could be injured or exposed to toxic substances, and operations could be disrupted.</p>
<h2>IEEE standards on sensors </h2><p>The <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Standards Association</a> has a growing portfolio of standards and projects that address different aspects of IoT sensors. Here are a few of them:</p><p><a href="https://standards.ieee.org/search/?q=1451&type=%7CProject%7CStandard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE 1451</a> is a series of standards and projects that describe a set of open, common, network-independent communication interfaces for connecting sensors or actuators to microprocessors, instrumentation systems, and control/field networks. The goal of the series is to allow access of sensor/actuator data through a common set of interfaces, whether they are connected to systems or networks by wired or wireless means.</p><p>The <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2700/6770/?utm_source=ieeeorg&utm_medium=the-institute&utm_campaign=cybersecurity-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE 2700 Standard for Sensor Performance Parameter Definitions</a> provides a common framework for performance specification terminology, units, conditions, and limits. The standard addresses accelerometers, magnetometers, gyrometers/gyroscopes, accelerometer/magnetometer/gyroscope combination sensors, barometer/pressure sensors, hygrometer/humidity sensors, temperature sensors, light sensors, and proximity sensors.</p><p><a href="https://standards.ieee.org/search/?q=p2888&type=%7CProject" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE P2888</a> is a series of standards projects that address a multitude of areas for virtual reality and augmented reality, including sensor interfaces.</p><p>The <a href="https://beyondstandards.ieee.org/addressing-the-need-for-protecting-cybersecurity-in-connected-diabetes-devices/?utm_source=ieeeorg&utm_medium=the-institute&utm_campaign=cybersecurity-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE 2621</a> series of standards defines the concept of cybersecurity assurance for wireless diabetes devices, and it specifies security requirements. It also provides instructions on how to achieve assurance.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/sensor-cybersecurity-standards</guid><category>Ieee products services</category><category>Standards</category><category>Sensors</category><category>Iot</category><category>Cybersecurity</category><category>Ieee standards association</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>The IEEE Standards Association</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/overhead-view-of-vehicle-traffic-on-highway-with-widgets-in-foreground-info-for-editor-if-needed.jpg?id=31963264&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>A New Fund Helps IEEE-HKN Student Chapters Flourish</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-hkn-student-chapters-fund</link><description><![CDATA[

There are 269 chapters at universities worldwide.</p><p>A strong chapter helps ensure that members have a fulfilling experience. For the 2021–2022 academic year, IEEE-HKN chapters reported approximately 92,000 hours of activity and service, much more than the previous year—when chapters reported approximately 62,000 hours—and other years.</p><hr/><p>The chapters engaged in a variety of virtual and in-person activities including preuniversity functions, as well as joint activities with IEEE student branches.</p><p>Chapters can strengthen the IEEE-HKN organization while setting into motion a pipeline of engaged members who are prepared and motivated to enhance their volunteer experience throughout their career.</p><p>Support provided by universities to chapters varies widely, however—which can limit activities. The <a href="https://www.ieeefoundation.org/ieee_hkn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE-HKN Student Chapter Support</a> Initiative was established through the <a href="https://www.ieeefoundation.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Foundation</a> to address the issue. The dedicated fund paves the way for creating new resources and enhancing existing ones, plus training and programs to help every chapter thrive.</p><p>The two facets of the initiative are the <a href="https://hkn.ieee.org/chapter-support-grant" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Student Chapter Support Grant program</a> and the supplemental <a href="https://hkn.ieee.org/alumni-news/2022/07/chapter-support-initiative-off-to-a-great-start" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chapter Success Program</a>. </p>
<h2>Grants help UC-Berkeley, the University of Texas, and others</h2><p>The grant program funds activities designed to support and strengthen chapters. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis. The first grants have been awarded to fund programs including chapter-building and visibility activities, mentoring, and alumni engagement events.</p><p>The officers of the <a href="https://hkn.ieee.org/hkn-chapters/all-chapters/mu-chapter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mu Chapter</a> at the <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of California, Berkeley</a>, spent the money to offset the cost of announcement whiteboards, which it uses to increase the visibility of its tutoring programs and events.</p><p>Officers at the <a href="https://hkn.ieee.org/hkn-chapters/all-chapters/mu-iota-chapter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mu Iota Chapter</a> at <a href="https://www.seattleu.edu/scieng/ece/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Seattle University</a> used the grant to help pay for an electrical and computer engineering mentoring event it held. At the evening event, students met with industry professionals. The night was the chapter’s most-attended event to date.</p><p>For the <a href="https://hkn.ieee.org/hkn-chapters/all-chapters/delta-omega-chapter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Delta Omega Chapter</a> at the <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/catalog/schools-colleges/engineering/ee/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Hawaii at Manoa</a>, the grant went toward its annual induction ceremony and banquet. The event brings students, faculty, and alumni together to recognize induction candidates’ hard work.</p><p>Later this year, the <a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/electrical" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Texas Arlington</a>’s <a href="https://hkn.ieee.org/hkn-chapters/all-chapters/epsilon-mu-chapter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Epsilon Mu Chapter</a> plans to hold career development events for students. Chapter officers say they will use the grant money to enhance their résumé-building and interview-preparation workshops and to present a discussion about technology by industry representatives.</p>
<h2>Training and coaching resources</h2><p>The Chapter Success program provides training and coaching resources. The program makes it possible for universities to establish new chapters and reinstate dormant ones. Since January, HKN volunteers and staff have been coaching 18 chapters on how to revitalize their activities, as students began returning to campus after staying home because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>A new HKN chapter, Nu Epsilon, was installed in April at <a href="https://www.kennesaw.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kennesaw State University</a>, in Georgia. The Gamma Lambda Chapter at <a href="https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/departments/electrical-engineering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Columbia </a>inducted new members for the first time in at least seven years. The <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Colorado, Boulder</a>, Rho Chapter marked the 100th anniversary of its installation this year by working to reactivate operations on campus.</p>

<p>We read with considerable interest the story in the September 2022 issue of<em> The Institute</em> titled “<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-plan-combat-climate-change" target="_self">IEEE’s Plan to Help Combat Climate Change</a>.” As IEEE members and as co-principal investigators of the U.S. <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/eng/about.jsp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a> initiative, the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nsf-engineering-alliance-climate-change" target="_self">Engineering Research Visioning Alliance</a>, we agree that engineers, scientists, and technical professionals have a critical role to play in mitigating the effects of climate change and that the role of engineering has not been as prominent as we believe it should be. We hope you agree that it’s time to take action and pursue solutions.</p><p>In both approach and key priorities, there is significant alignment between the technology areas identified by the IEEE ad hoc committee on climate change and the engineering research priorities identified at ERVA’s inaugural visioning event and the resulting report, <a href="https://www.ervacommunity.org/visioning-report/visioning-event-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Role of Engineering to Address Climate Change</a>, published in August. The ERVA report highlights specific research directions through which engineering can take the lead and have impact in energy storage and transmission; greenhouse gas capture and elimination; resilient, energy efficient infrastructure; and water, ecosystem, and geoengineering assessment. It’s important to note that ERVA convened academic researchers and engineers in industry to develop the priorities identified in the report. We believe it’s critical to bring all stakeholders to the table to collaboratively envision engineering solutions to address societal challenges such as climate change.</p><p>ERVA is pleased to count IEEE as an <a href="https://www.ervacommunity.org/affiliates/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">affiliate partner</a> in this important work. We strive to unite the voices of engineering to identify and develop bold and transformative new engineering research directions and to catalyze the engineering community's pursuit of innovative, high-impact research that benefits society. We welcome further conversation with IEEE’s ad hoc committee on climate change and urge <em>The Institute </em>readers to download the report and act on its findings.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 20:38:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/erva-supports-ieee-climate-change-plan</guid><category>Opinion</category><category>Climate change</category><category>National science foundation</category><category>Engineering research visioning alliance</category><category>Ieee member news</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Charles Johnson-Bey</dc:creator></item><item><title>Thomas M.

But when the telephone was invented in 1876, the farthest a call could be made was about 13 kilometers.</p><p>The first of those calls involved the telephone’s inventor, <a href="https://ethw.org/Alexander_Graham_Bell" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alexander Graham Bell</a>, who spoke from Paris, Ont., Canada, with his father, who lived in Brantford, also in Ontario.</p><hr/><p>Intercity telephone networks had been built in Canada in 1881, but the distances between them were limited, and customers needed to be connected to each other by an operator.</p><p>Fast-forward to 1958. To enable direct-dialed, long-distance calls, <a href="https://www.bell.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bell Canada</a>, headquartered in Montreal, built the Trans-Canada Microwave system. It consisted of 139 relay towers that spanned more than 6,000 kilometers, from Victoria, B.C., to Sydney, N.S. The system used microwave frequencies to achieve a high enough bandwidth and telephone line capacity to conduct the calls. When the system was completed, it was the longest microwave relay network in the world.</p><p>The microwave system was commemorated with an IEEE Milestone during a ceremony on 1 July at the <a href="https://www.telus.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telus</a> headquarters in Vancouver—which is a former Trans-Canada Microwave site. The <a href="https://vancouver.ieee.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Vancouver Section</a> sponsored the Milestone nomination.</p><p>“No single engineering achievement of the past century has had a greater impact on Canada’s society, economy, and citizens than the completion of the Trans-Canada Microwave system,” says IEEE Senior Member <a href="https://ece.ubc.ca/david-michelson/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Michelson</a>, <a href="https://www.ieee.ca/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Canada</a>’s historian. “Introducing direct-dialed long-distance telephone services to Canadians immediately transformed the way that they communicated with each other for both business and pleasure.”</p><h2>A growing demand for long-distance calls</h2><p>When telephones were introduced to consumers, Canadians’ usage was among the highest in the world, according to the <a href="https://ethw.org/Milestones:The_Trans-Canada_Microwave_System,_1958" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Milestone entry</a> on the <a href="https://ethw.org/Main_Page" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Engineering and Technology History Wiki</a>.</p><p>In the early 1900s, seven telecommunications companies provided telephone services in Canada, according to a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6372537" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1956 article</a> in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6367273" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers</em></a>. (AIEE is one of IEEE’s predecessor societies.) Each company operated a small network within its own territory. In 1929 they formed the <a href="https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2019/isde-ised/Co22/Co22-321-1979-eng.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TransCanada Telephone System</a> to expand and maintain the networks. Its telephone systems consisted of copper wires or high-frequency and very-high-frequency radio waves. The country had nine switching centers, where operators connected callers. But the system had limited capacity, suffered from poor voice quality, and was expensive to use.</p><p>After World War II, Canada’s economy boomed, and its population grew. The volume of long-distance calls made during the first postwar decade doubled from the prewar era, according to the ETHW entry.</p><p>To keep up with the demand, TransCanada hired Bell Canada to upgrade the networks. The company’s engineers determined that microwave links could be used to improve the service. During World War II, scientists from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States had developed microwave transmitters and receivers for use in radar systems that measure the echo of a pulse of microwave radiation to detect and locate distant objects. Adopting the high operating frequencies used by radar systems increased the bandwidth and capacity of the new communication system, Michelson says.</p><p>The first part of Bell Canada’s intercity network began operating in 1948. Its 23 telephone lines connected Nova Scotia with Prince Edward Island, a distance of 211 km. Four years later, a radio system made up of 46 telephone lines began operating. It connected Halifax with St. John, N.B., a distance of about 310 km.</p><p>In 1953 Bell Canada built a microwave relay system that linked Buffalo, N.Y., to Toronto; Ottawa; Montreal; Quebec City, Que.; and Kingston, Ont.</p><h2>Building Canada’s national telephone and TV network</h2><p>Because of the success of the intercity networks, the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</a>, the country’s public broadcaster for both radio and television, decided to build a nationwide relay network to send TV and radio signals from coast to coast. Construction began in March 1955 and was completed in June 1958.</p><p>The CBC system introduced live network television to households. There had been no national TV network with individual stations or live programming.</p><p>To provide the ability to make coast-to-coast calls and access to TV programs nationwide, engineers used Bell Canada’s Northern Electric TD-2 microwave equipment, according to a 1957 <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6442806" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Electrical Engineering</em> article</a>. The equipment operated at a frequency of 4,000 megahertz, which produced six, two-way radio channels. One of the channels served as a backup in case another one malfunctioned. Each channel could handle two TV programs or 600 telephone connections, according to the 1957 article.</p><p>The TD-2 system divided bandwidth into frequency “slots” so that a channel could be shared among several users at the same time. Because each channel had an effective base bandwidth of 10 MHz and a TV program used 4 MHz, it was possible to house a TV program and a small number of telephone lines on the same channel simultaneously, according to the <em>Electrical Engineering</em> article.</p><p>The new TV network began operating in July 1958, when it ran its first live coast-to-coast broadcast—“A Memo to Champlain”—in honor of Canada Day.</p><p>The Trans-Canada Microwave system was decommissioned in the late 1990s. It has been replaced with satellites and fiber-optic cables.</p><p>Administered by the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/about/history_center/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE History Center</a> and <a href="https://www.ieeefoundation.org/donate_history" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supported by donors</a>, the Milestone program recognizes outstanding technical developments around the world.</p><p>The Trans-Canada system’s Milestone plaque, which is displayed in the lobby of the Telus headquarters, reads:</p><p><em>On 1 July 1958, the Trans-Canada Microwave system introduced live network television and direct-dialed long-distance telephone service to Canadians from coast to coast. Comprising 139 towers spanning more than 6,275 kilometres, it was, when completed, the world’s longest such network. Later extended and upgraded, the system had an immense impact on Canada’s society and economy.</em></p><em></em>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 18:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/trans-canada-microwave-system-milestone</guid><category>Ieee history</category><category>Ieee milestone</category><category>Telecommunications</category><category>Microwave radar</category><category>Ieee history</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Joanna Goodrich</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-electrical-tower-against-a-cloudy-sky.jpg?id=31941092&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>A Serial Entrepreneur Shares Lessons Learned on His Road to Success</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/serial-entrepreneur-on-lessons-learned</link><description><![CDATA[

It wasn’t until he became an IEEE student member in 2006 that Pillai learned those terms. He served on several IEEE committees and had leadership positions in IEEE groups—which helped him discover his managerial instincts. He learned from other IEEE members what running a tech company entails. And he belatedly realized that his father, who ran a small rubber-band manufacturing company next to the family’s home in India, was an entrepreneur.</p><p>After learning more about what running a tech company entails from other IEEE members, Pillai decided he also wanted to become an entrepreneur, to create “something bigger than me.”</p><hr/><p>He helped launch two companies that develop software-as-a-service platforms—both of which he and his cofounders subsequently sold. </p><p>His most recent venture, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/insent-ai/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BuxxNjRF1T4m6IszPiMJTgg%3D%3D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Insent</a>, was a business-to-business chat platform based in Denver; it was acquired last year by software and data company <a href="https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwjgveSry5n6AhXG9sgKHYEiATgYABABGgJxdQ&sig=AOD64_3S3mJk_XJ_XoQDHEn7KDsH5kTHAw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjE6tyry5n6AhWLM1kFHc7LApgQ0Qx6BAgEEAE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ZoomInfo</a> of Vancouver, Wash. Pillai is now senior vice president of ZoomInfo’s products and growth department.</p><p>He credits IEEE with giving him leadership training and opportunities to hone his public-speaking skills. As an active volunteer with the <a href="https://ieeekerala.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Kerala (India) Section</a>, he spoke at numerous conferences and meetings. He also served on the <a href="https://www.ieeer10.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Region 10</a> <a href="https://newsletter.ieeer10.org/home_oct2021/r10-humanitarian-technology-activities-committee/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">humanitarian technology activities committee</a> and was vice chair of <a href="https://yp.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Young Professionals</a>.</p><p>Thos activities helped him improve his English language skills, he says, as well as his interpersonal skills.</p><p>“IEEE helped me gain the confidence I needed to found my first startup, in 2012,” the senior member says.</p><h2>From systems engineer to CEO</h2><p>After graduating in 2010 with a bachelor’s degree in electronics and communication engineering from the <a href="https://cusat.ac.in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cochin University of Science and Technology</a> in India, Pillai joined IT company <a href="https://www.infosys.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Infosys</a>, in Bangalore, as a systems engineer. He left in 2012 and founded <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/profoundis/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Profoundis</a> with three former classmates: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jofin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jofin Joseph</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nithinsamoommen/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nithin Sam Oommen</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/atmb4u/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anoop Thomas Mathew</a>. The company, based in Cochin, aimed to help businesses and other organizations connect with customers.</p><p>“I was 23 years old. I was young and stupid and had no idea what I was getting into,” Pillai says, laughing. He served as chief executive, while Joseph was chief operating officer, Oommen was chief of data research, and Mathew was chief technology officer.</p><p>During the company’s first two years, it developed four products—a management system for online testimonials, a financial analytics platform for small and midsize businesses, an assignment system for college students, and a social media analytics tool—all of which failed to get any traction within their intended markets, Pillai says.</p><p class="pull-quote">“If the reason why you started a company is strong, it will get you through the hurdles you will face.”</p><p>“But we had to just keep going,” he says. “The failure didn’t really register as such. It was just another day at work.”</p><p>In 2015 Profoundis launched its fifth product, Vibe: sales software that helps businesses identify prospective customers. It proved to be a winner. Vibe collects data about companies from the Internet, organizes it into a searchable list, and makes it available to marketers and salespeople. More than 200 companies in dozens of countries have used it. The success of the product enabled the company to grow from seven employees to 72. <a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FullContact</a>, a software company in Denver, acquired Profoundis nine months later.</p><p>“It was the first product acquisition in the history of my state of Kerala,” Pillai says.</p><p>After Profoundis was sold, Pillai joined FullContact as the head of data strategy, working in Denver. But he says he didn’t really enjoy working for another company.</p><p>“Once you’re an entrepreneur, you kind of have that bug all the time,” he says. He also struggled with the fact that it wasn’t his company anymore, he says. </p><p>“I didn’t do a good enough job transitioning from CEO to employee,” he says. “I always tell other entrepreneurs about my experience so they don’t make the same mistake. This was the most important thing I learned after selling my first company.”</p><p>Pillai left FullContact after two years and worked as a consultant until 2018, when he founded Insent with IEEE Member <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasanna081460" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prasanna Venkatesan</a>. The two cofounders had met through their volunteer activities with IEEE a decade earlier.</p><p>The startup’s B2B platform used a combination of human and chatbot conversations to personalize a customer’s purchasing experience with a retailer. After the company was acquired, the platform was renamed ZoomInfo Chat.</p><p>ZoomInfo hired all of the startup’s employees.</p><p>In his new position, Pillai led the release of ZoomInfo Chat. He is currently managing the company’s data portfolio.</p><p>“ZoomInfo has the best business data assets in the world,” he says. “It’s the core of the company, so I have a big responsibility.”</p><p>Pillai also invests in startups including <a href="https://www.inflection.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inflection</a>, <a href="https://www.savantlabs.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Savant Labs</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/toplynehq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Toplyne</a>. Inflection and Savant Labs are data analytics companies, while Toplyne develops software.</p><p>“Investing in others gives me the ability to learn about new industries,” he says.</p><h2>Advice for budding entrepreneurs</h2><p>Pillai says that running his own company gave him an unparalleled education on how to be a CEO, and he has learned from both his successes and his failures.</p><p>Pillai, who had no mentor to teach him how to run a company, is now a strong advocate for supporting budding entrepreneurs. For the past five years, he has been an ambassador for <a href="https://startupchile.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Start-Up Chile</a>, a government initiative that seeks to attract high-potential entrepreneurs to the country.</p><p>“I want to give back,” he says.</p><p>The biggest challenge for any startup, he says, is bringing together the right team, especially if you plan to launch the company with another person.</p><p>“Being cofounders is like being married,” he says. “If you choose the wrong person, running a successful startup together will be difficult.”</p><p>You need to pick people who share your passion and have a similar mindset, a positive attitude, and strong ethics, he says.</p><p>Other challenges include developing a product or service that makes sense for its intended market and securing enough funding so that you can release the product in a timely way while it still can make an impact.</p><p>He tells budding entrepreneurs to ensure they’re forming a company for the right reasons. Found a startup only if “you feel passionate about a problem that keeps you awake at night and that you believe you’re the only person who can solve,” he says. “If the reason why you started a company is strong, it will get you through the hurdles you will face.”</p><p>Pillai advises startup founders to take occasional breaks from work.</p><p>“In the four and a half years I was CEO of my first company, work was my life,” he says. He was so driven that he showed up once to an investor’s meeting while he was sick, instead of rescheduling it. He says he thinks that’s the reason the investor ended up backing away from the project.</p><p>Pillai says he wishes he had had a mentor to tell him that he needed to take it easy, and that things would work out in the end.</p><p>“Learning all of these lessons on my own was a humbling experience,” he says.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 18:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/serial-entrepreneur-on-lessons-learned</guid><category>Ieee member news</category><category>Startups</category><category>Profile</category><category>Entrepreneurship</category><category>Careers</category><category>Ieee young professionals</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Joanna Goodrich</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-of-a-man-in-a-black-blazer-and-a-blue-button-up-shirt-against-a-white-background.jpg?id=31890708&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Speech Processing Pioneer Sadaoki Furui Dies at 77</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/in-memoriam-october-2022</link><description><![CDATA[

<img src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/group-of-young-people-smiling-at-the-camera.jpg?id=31859223&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C343%2C0%2C33"/><br/><br/><p>The word <em>home</em> evokes a sense of belonging and welcoming. IEEE aims to create a similar feeling by offering services for members at every stage of their career and by building a community among them.</p><p>IEEE President and CEO K.J. Ray Liu is committed to making IEEE the professional home for members. As he announced in his<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-presidents-note-march-2022" target="_self"> March column</a> in <em>The Institute,</em> he’s doing that by “examining ways in which the organization could evolve to best meet the needs of all technical professionals in the years ahead.”</p><hr/><p>“The days when a technologist could count on lifetime employment with a single company are long gone,” Liu wrote. “IEEE can be your professional home base from the time you first join as a student member until retirement. IEEE spans our members’ entire professional life cycle—catering to those just thinking about engineering or science as a career as well as those already studying, teaching, practicing, inventing, or advocating for technology. IEEE offers the products, services, networking opportunities, and educational and professional development programs required for every stage of your career.” (Liu expands on his vision in <a href="https://ieeetv.ieee.org/ns/ieeetvdl/2021/CA_Items_2021/Ray_LIU_IEEE_Your_Professional_Home_REV_final.mp4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this video</a> on IEEE.tv.) </p><h2>Tailored services for each career phase</h2><p>To help Liu fulfill his commitment, he formed the Ad Hoc Committee on IEEE as Your Professional Home. The chair is <a href="https://r2.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Region 2</a> Director<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/btilton/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Barry Tilton</a>. The committee has identified five broad areas that members and potential members can align with: industry; academia; public service; students and young professionals; and retirees. </p><p>Tilton says the committee has selected products, services, networking opportunities, and educational and professional development programs that are suitable for the five groups and cover the entirety of an individual’s career. A summary of offerings has been posted on the new <a href="https://www.ieee.org/your-professional-home/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Professional Home website</a>. </p><p>The committee has operated with the understanding that there is no one career path that serves everyone, Tilton says.</p><p>“There are career beginners who really haven’t figured out where they’re going yet, as well as folks who are nearing the end of their career but still have a lot to give back,” he says. “Beginners can learn from those who have already gone through it. Experienced members can offer advice, such as what it took to move up the career ladder and what types of training, certifications, or additional resources would be most impactful.”</p><p class="pull-quote">“IEEE can be your professional home base from the time you first join as a student member until retirement.”</p><p>Tilton says he has benefited from IEEE’s professional support in his own career. Based in the Washington, D.C., area, he works as a technical evangelist for<a href="https://www.maxar.com/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Maxar Technologies</a>. During the first part of his career, when he was working for the U.S. <a href="https://www.airforce.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Air Force</a> on aerospace and remote-sensing projects, his main involvement with IEEE was renewing his membership, he says, as well as reading <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/" target="_self"><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></a> and occasionally attending a conference. After 20 years, the senior member decided to join the private sector but had few contacts.</p><p>“I thought—and luckily I was right about this—that IEEE might provide a good source for networking opportunities to figure out where I should go with my second career,” he says. “IEEE has provided me with both a framework to understand the art of the possible and a network to allow me to communicate with others.” </p><p>He says he picked up leadership skills while serving as treasurer and chair of the<a href="https://r2.ieee.org/nova/about_us/chapters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> IEEE Northern Virginia Section</a>. Now as director of Region 2, which covers Ohio, Pennsylvania, northern Virginia, southern New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, he says he gets insight on a regular basis from the region’s 27,000 members.</p><p>“IEEE really provides the foundation that allows me to communicate effectively with professionals in my discipline,” Tilton says. “And that, to me, is home.”</p><h2>The importance of professional networking</h2><p>In Liu’s March column, he wrote that IEEE “provides members with a strong sense of community and a worldwide network of personal connections that can help mentor and nurture your professional journey.”</p><p>Many members who have been profiled in <em>The Institute</em> say networking is one of the most important IEEE benefits. Senior Member<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-cto-michael-kagan-profile" target="_self"> Michael Kagan, CTO of Nvidia</a>, says he likes meeting members who are working on similar projects, because he always learns something new.</p><p>“Being connected to these people from more diverse communities helps a lot,” Kagan says. “It inspires you to do your job in a different way.”</p><p>IEEE Fellow<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/amds-lisa-su-breaks-through-the-silicon-ceiling" target="_self"> Lisa Su</a>, chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices, told <em>The Institute</em>, “I’ve met many people through my IEEE connections, and they continue to be close colleagues.”</p><p>In videos posted under each phase of a career on the new <a href="https://www.ieee.org/your-professional-home/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, members share their perspective about why they made IEEE their home base.</p><p>“I encourage all our members to be engaged,” Liu wrote. “Be involved and be part of the drive to reaffirm awareness of IEEE as your professional home to all members and other technologists around the world.”</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 18:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/make-ieee-your-home-base</guid><category>Ieee products services</category><category>Ieee news</category><category>Ieee president k.j. liu</category><category>Membership</category><category>Careers</category><category>Students</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Kathy Pretz</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/group-of-young-people-smiling-at-the-camera.jpg?id=31859223&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Remembering LED Pioneer Nick Holonyak</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/led-pioneer-nick-holonyak-obituary</link><description><![CDATA[

</p><p>
	Nick Holonyak Jr., a prolific inventor and longtime professor of electrical engineering and computing, died on 17 September at the age of 93. In 1962, while working as a consulting scientist at <a href="https://www.ge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">General Electric</a>’s Advanced Semiconductor Laboratory, he invented the first practical visible-spectrum LED. It is now used in light bulbs and lasers.
</p><p>
	Holonyak left GE in 1963 to become a professor of electrical and computer engineering and researcher at his alma mater, the <a href="https://illinois.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Illinois</a> Urbana-Champaign. He retired from the university in 2013.
</p><hr/><p>
	He received the 2003 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/recipients/ieee-medal-of-honor-recipients/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Medal of Honor</a> for “a career of pioneering contributions to semiconductors, including the growth of semiconductor alloys and heterojunctions, and to visible light-emitting diodes and injection lasers.”
</p><p>In honor of Holonyak, the IEEE Board of Directors established the IEEE Nick Holonyak, Jr. Medal for Semiconductor Optoelectronic Technologies in November 2021. The award will be presented for the first time at the annual IEEE Honors Ceremony in 2024. The medal is sponsored by Friends of Nick Holonyak, Jr. </p><h2>LED and other semiconductor industry breakthroughs</h2><p>
	After Holonyak earned bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois, he was hired in 1954 as a researcher at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bell Labs</a>, in Murray Hill, N.J. There he investigated silicon-based electronic devices.
</p><p>
	He left in 1955 to serve in the U.S. <a href="https://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/career-match/signal-intelligence/locations-stats-frequencies/25a-signal-officer.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Army Signal Corps</a>, and was stationed at Fort Monmouth, N.J., and Yokohama, Japan. After being discharged in 1957, he joined GE’s Advanced Semiconductor Laboratory, in Syracuse, N.Y.
</p><p>
	While at the lab, he invented a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/EP0035841A2/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shorted emitter thyristor device</a>. The four-layered semiconductor is now found in light dimmers and power tools. In 1962 he invented the red-light semiconductor laser, known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_diode" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">laser diode</a>, which now is found in cellphones as well as CD and DVD players.
</p><p>
	Later that year, he demonstrated the first visible LED—a semiconductor source that emits light when current flows through it. LEDs previously had been made of gallium arsenide. He created crystals of gallium arsenide phosphide to make LEDs that would emit visible, red light. His work led to the development of the high-brightness, high-efficiency white LEDs that are found in a wide range of applications today, including smartphones, televisions, headlights, traffic signals, and aviation.
</p><h2>Pioneering research at the University of Illinois</h2><p>
	Holonyak left GE in 1963 and joined the University of Illinois as a professor of electrical and computer engineering.
</p><p>
	In 1977 he and his doctoral students demonstrated the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_well_laser" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quantum well laser</a>, which later found applications in fiber optics, CD and DVD players, and medical diagnostic tools.
</p><p>
	The university named him an <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/chairs/bardeen-chair" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">endowed-chair professor of electrical and computer engineering and physics</a> in 1993. The position was named for <a href="https://life.ieee.org/a-look-back-at-john-bardeen/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John Bardeen</a>, an honorary IEEE member who had received two Nobel Prizes in Physics as well as the 1971 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/recipients/ieee-medal-of-honor-recipients/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Medal of Honor</a>. Bardeen was Holonyak’s professor in graduate school. The two men collaborated on research projects until Bardeen’s death in 1991.
</p><p>
	 Together with IEEE Life Fellow <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/mfeng" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Milton Feng</a>, Holonyak led the university’s transistor laser research center, which was funded by the U.S. <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>. There they developed <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/498047" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transistor lasers</a> that had both light and electric outputs. The innovation enabled high-speed communications technologies.
</p><p>
	More recently, Holonyak developed a technique to bend light within gallium arsenide chips, allowing them to transmit information by light rather than electricity.
</p><p>
	He supervised more than 60 graduate students, many of whom went on to become leaders in the electronics field.
</p><h2>Queen Elizabeth prize, Draper prize, and other awards</h2><p>
	Holonyak received last year’s <a href="https://qeprize.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering</a>; the <a href="https://www.nae.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Academy of Engineering’s</a> 2015 <a href="https://www.nae.edu/20681/DraperPrize" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Draper Prize</a>; the 2005 <a href="https://www.japanprize.jp/en/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Japan Prize</a>; and the 1989 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-edison-medal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Edison Medal</a>. In 2008 he was inducted to the <a href="https://www.invent.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Inventors Hall of Fame</a>, in Akron, Ohio.
</p><p>
	He was a fellow of the <a href="https://www.amacad.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, the <a href="https://www.aps.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Physical Society</a>, and <a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Optica</a>. He was also a foreign member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russian Academy of Sciences</a>. In addition Holonyak was a member of the U.S. Academies of Engineering and <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sciences</a>.

<img src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-smiling-man-in-a-suit-and-glasses.jpg?id=31832314&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C676"/><br/><br/><p>
	In his five years as IEEE’s executive director and chief operating officer, Stephen Welby has led the organization through a global pandemic, a changing publishing landscape, and soaring geopolitical tensions. Welby, an IEEE Fellow, is leaving at the end of the year to spend more time with his family while he explores his career options. The IEEE Board of Directors has named <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophiamuirhead/" target="_blank">Sophie Muirhead</a>, IEEE’s current general counsel and chief compliance officer, as his replacement.</p><p>
	Welby directs the daily operations of IEEE and its approximately 1,000 employees. While the IEEE Board of Directors sets the organization’s policies and strategic direction, the executive director’s job is to implement them and provide input about issues affecting the organization’s future.
</p><hr/><p>
	“I feel comfortable with stepping out of my role at this time because I feel that, in almost every way, thanks to the hard work of volunteers and staff, IEEE is stronger than when I arrived,” Welby says.
</p><p>
	IEEE’s mission of advancing technology for the benefit of humanity drew him to the organization, he says, after he served a term in the Obama administration as U.S. assistant secretary of defense for research and engineering.
</p><h3>About Stephen Welby</h3><br/><p>
<strong>Employer:</strong> IEEE
</p><p>
<strong>Title:</strong> Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer
</p><p>
<strong>Member grade:</strong> Fellow
</p><p>
<strong>Alma mater:</strong> The Cooper Union, New York, N.Y.
</p><p>
	The IEEE position “offered an opportunity to influence and engage a global community,” Welby says. “The work that IEEE is doing is important, and the ideas embedded in our mission statement are big drivers for ensuring that we leave a better world to future generations.
</p><p>
	“IEEE has an ambitious agenda: supporting our members around the world; deepening our technical engagement in emerging areas; building communities and disseminating technical information; meeting a growing demand for technical education; exploring new frontiers of technical standards; and engaging with the broader public about the critical role that technical professionals play in building a better world.”
</p><h2>A commitment to diversity and the open access publishing model</h2><p>
	Welby lists his most important accomplishments as helping to strengthen IEEE’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and professional ethics; updating the organization’s publication model to increase its embrace of open access; and shoring up its financial footing.
</p><p>
	“IEEE is very considerate in trying to make sure that it is a voice for all of our members,” he says. “We’ve been taking steps to be as inclusive as possible and to find ways that people can participate and contribute—which ties back to our mission. We’ve got to find ways to be open, welcoming, and maybe more than encouraging to ensure that everybody can contribute to the best of their abilities.”
</p><p>
	During his tenure, the IEEE Board revised its 
	<a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/diversity-index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">policy on diversity</a> to ensure that members have a safe, inclusive place for collegial discourse. Changes also were made to the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/board-of-directors-approves-revisions-to-the-ieee-code-of-ethics" target="_self">IEEE Code of Ethics </a> to focus members on key elements of the code, a commitment not to engage in harassment, and to protect the privacy of others.
</p><p class="pull-quote">
	“The work that IEEE is doing is important, and the ideas embedded in our mission statement are big drivers for ensuring that we leave a better world to future generations.”
</p><p>
	When Welby began working for IEEE, he says, the open access publishing movement was perceived as a threat, but today he sees it as an opportunity. The movement calls for making research publications available without fees for the reader.
</p><p>
	“This requires a shift to new business models to cover expenses that were previously funded with subscription fees,” he says. “IEEE has been responsive to this change in a careful, deliberate, and responsible way. We are offering a wide variety of opportunities and tools for people to engage with. The evolution of our publication activity has been about responding to community demands for new and diverse offerings.”
</p><p>
<span></span>Twenty open access journals have been launched in the past five years, for a total of 29 in the portfolio. Today they make up more than 20 percent of IEEE’s journal publishing output and that percentage is growing, Welby says.
</p><p>
	He says he is proud that IEEE is much stronger financially than when he started. In 2018, its total net assets were US $391 million, and by the end of last year it had more than $851 million, he says. He adds that he anticipates strong results for this year as well.
</p><p>
	“To support our mission in perpetuity, IEEE needs strong financial reserves—ideally reserves that are large enough to serve as reliable and stabilizing sources of revenue,” he says. “Doubling our reserves has been a significant accomplishment and represents an investment in our future and our long-term commitment to our mission.”

	Another is the work that IEEE-USA has done in helping to shape public policy concerning technology. He points to major U.S. legislation passed this year: the 
	<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4982/text" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Creating Helpful Incentives for Producing Semiconductors for America and Foundries Act</a>. Welby predicts that other countries will make similar investments, and he says he hopes IEEE will support those as well.
</p><p>
	“IEEE is in an interesting spot relative to public policy in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere because we talk to the concerns of technologists, and about technology and how it impacts regulations and legislation,” he says. “We’re not arguing for a particular stakeholder; we’re arguing for investments in advancing technology. We’re engaged around the world in helping to ensure that research is adequately funded and that technical education gets the support it needs.”
</p><h2>The impact of the pandemic and global tensions</h2><p>
	Leading a global organization that depends on in-person meetings and events has proven especially challenging in recent years. After the coronavirus pandemic began spreading in 2020, the organization suddenly shifted its business model from building communities through in-person engagement to relying almost exclusively on digital delivery, Welby says.
</p><p>
	“IEEE has a reputation for being a conservative organization, for being slow to change, and sometimes for being overly rule-bound and bureaucratic,” he says. “But in the face of a global crisis, we adapted quickly. Staff and volunteers worked closely together to redesign and redeploy IEEE activities in a manner that allowed our communities to remain connected even while physically distancing themselves for safety. There was great trust, great collaboration, and great success.
</p><p>
	 “The ability to respond, to change, to evolve, and to adapt is one of IEEE’s great strengths,” he adds. “That makes me feel it will be ready to take on whatever the future brings and deliver on our mission.”
</p><p>
	Geopolitical tensions in recent years have impacted IEEE, he notes. Conflict among countries, trade restrictions, and proliferating international sanctions among nations have created new challenges for IEEE activities, he says.
</p><p>
	“We have worked hard to stay focused on IEEE’s role in supporting an international community of engineers and technical professionals that spans national borders and supports a global commitment to expanding the scientific and technical knowledge of humankind,” he says. “But IEEE also must operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations while seeking clarification of those that appear misapplied in the IEEE context. At the same time, we are sympathetic to the hardships that international tension can place on our members.”
</p><p>
	Coordinating the enormous scope and scale of IEEE activities is complex. IEEE operates in 160 countries; has 46 societies and councils; has 343 sections in 10 geographic regions; maintains a portfolio of more than 1,075 technical standards; publishes 200 transactions, journals, and magazines; and holds more than 1,900 conferences and events.
</p><p>
	“Trying to maintain coordination and synchronization across this enormous portfolio, managing risk, and prioritizing resources is a continuous challenge,” Welby says.
</p><p>
	He says his one regret is that more progress has not been made in evolving IEEE’s membership model. The model has remained relatively unchanged since the organization was established in 1963. He points out that overall membership growth has largely flattened, despite the increased role that technology plays in society. Across IEEE there has been a decline in the share of members working in industry, while at the same time there has been recent strong growth in student membership.
</p><p>
	“We continue to rely on face-to-face interaction for many of our core membership activities, despite the growth of online, virtual, and digital communities,” Welby says. “Prospective volunteers are working longer hours [and] have family commitments. Plus, there are other activities competing for their time. The time and energy commitments that IEEE has traditionally demanded of its volunteers may not be a viable strategy in coming decades. It may be time to fundamentally rethink the structure of IEEE membership and explore different ways to engage our members.”
</p><p>
	He notes that those concerns have been studied and debated, and initiatives have been undertaken to explore alternative membership models. But, he says, there remains more work to do to develop consensus on the future of membership.
</p><h2>Meeting with industry leaders and engineering students</h2><p>
	Welby says he’ll miss the concentrated chaos of an IEEE Board meeting series, where many decisions—great and small—are debated and decided in a short period of time. He’ll also miss talking to audiences of thousands of people about important technical topics, he says, and meeting with leaders from government and industry.
</p><p>
	“I have had the opportunity to see the amazing diversity of our membership,” he says, “and the fantastic work that they do, and their impact on the world. I spent a lot of time talking to as many volunteers in different roles as I could. I have particularly enjoyed engaging with students around the world and seeing their enthusiasm, their creativity, and their optimism. They give me great hope for our future.”
</p><p>
	Welby adds that he could not have accomplished as much as he did without the support and confidence of the IEEE presidents and boards he served, the thousands of IEEE volunteers, his senior management team, and the professional staff members around the world “who brought their creativity, commitment, and technical skills to every task.”
</p><p>
	“I will leave it to others to assess how effective I have been,” he says. “But I have woken up every day for the last five years thinking about what I could do to improve and advance IEEE’s mission.”

The results are distilled into reports that identify actionable priorities for engineering research pursuit. Reports from recent visioning events are slated to be released to the public in the next few months. </p><hr/><p>IEEE is one of more than 20 professional engineering societies that have joined ERVA as <a href="https://www.ervacommunity.org/affiliates/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">affiliate partners</a>.</p><h2>Research energy storage and greenhouse gas capture solutions </h2><p>Identifying technologies to address the climate crisis was ERVA’s first theme. The theme was based on results of a survey ERVA conducted last year of the engineering community about what the research priorities should be.</p><p>“The resounding answer from the 500 respondents was climate change,” says <a href="https://www.ervacommunity.org/profile/dorota-grejner-brzezinska/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dorota Grejner-Brzezinska</a>, EVRA’s principal investigator. She is a vice president for knowledge enterprise at <a href="https://www.osu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ohio State University</a>, in Columbus.</p><p>During the <a href="https://www.ervacommunity.org/event/visioning-event-the-role-of-engineering-in-addressing-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">virtual visioning event</a> in December, experts explored solar and renewable energy, carbon sequestration, water management, and geoengineering. The climate change task force released its <a href="https://www.ervacommunity.org/visioning-report/visioning-event-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> last month.</p><p>These are some of the research areas ERVA said should be pursued:</p><ul><li>Energy storage, transmission, and critical materials. The materials include those that are nanoengineered, ones that could be used for nontraditional energy storage, and those that can extract additional energy from heat cycles.</li><li>Greenhouse gas capture and elimination. Research priorities included capturing and eliminating methane and nitrous oxide released in agriculture operations.</li><li>Resilient, energy-efficient, and healthful infrastructure. One identified priority was research to develop low-cost coatings for buildings and roads to reduce heat effects and increase self-cooling.</li><li>Water, ecosystem, and geoengineering assessments. The report identifies research in creating sensing, measuring, and AI models to analyze the flow of water to ensure its availability during droughts and other disruptive events caused or worsened by climate change.</li></ul><p>“The groundwork ERVA has laid out in this report creates a blueprint for funders to invest in,” Grejner-Brzezinska says, “and catalyzes engineering research for a more secure and sustainable world. As agencies and research organizations enact legislation to reduce carbon emissions and bolster clean-energy technologies, engineering is poised to lead with research and development.”</p><p> IEEE is developing a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-plan-combat-climate-change" target="_self">strategy</a> to guide the organization’s response to the global threat.</p><h2>Use biology and engineering to interrupt the transfer of viruses</h2><p>A virtual <a href="https://www.ervacommunity.org/event/visioning-event-biology/2022-03-09/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">visioning event</a> on Leveraging Biology to Power Engineering Impact was held in March. The hope, as explained on the event’s <a href="https://www.ervacommunity.org/task-force/leveraging-biology-to-power-engineering-impact/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>, is to transform research where biology and engineering intersect: health care and medicine, agriculture, and high tech.</p><p class="pull-quote">“As agencies and research organizations enact legislation to reduce carbon emissions and bolster clean-energy technologies, engineering is poised to lead with research and development.”</p><p>The experts considered research directions in three areas: Use biology to inspire engineers to develop new components, adapt and adopt biological constructs beyond their original function, and create engineering systems and components that improve on biology. An example would be to interrupt the transfer of viruses from one species to another so as to reduce the spread of diseases.</p><p>The task force’s report on which research areas to pursue is scheduled to be released next month, according to Grejner-Brzezinska.</p><h2>Protect infrastructure from hackers</h2><p>One of today’s main engineering challenges, according to ERVA, is the protection of infrastructure against hackers and other threats. At the in-person <a href="https://www.ervacommunity.org/event/engineering-rd-solutions-for-unhackable-infrastructure/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">visioning event</a> held last month at <a href="http://mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MIT</a> on the <a href="https://www.ervacommunity.org/event/engineering-rd-solutions-for-unhackable-infrastructure/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Engineering R&D Solutions for Unhackable Infrastructure</a> theme, researchers discussed gaps in security technologies and looked at how to design trustworthy systems and how to build resilience into interdependent infrastructures.</p><p>ERVA describes <em>unhackable</em> as the ability to ensure safety, security, and trust in essential systems and services that society relies on.</p><p>The task force examined research themes related to physical infrastructure such as assets and hardware; software and algorithms; and data and communication networks. It also considered new security methods for users, operators, and security administrators to thwart cyberattacks.</p><p><a href="https://www.ervacommunity.org/profile/dorota-grejner-brzezinska/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grejner-Brzezinska</a> says the task force’s report will be released in mid-December.</p><h2>Sustainable transportation networks</h2><p>Planning has begun for the next visioning event, <a href="https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/a7e65b3fc2d2486dba29cfd719ffdcdc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sustainable Transportation Networks</a>, to be held virtually on 2 and 3 November. The session is to explore innovative and sustainable transportation modes and the infrastructure networks needed to support them. Some of the areas to be discussed are green construction; longitudinal impact studies; interconnected transportation modes such as rail, marine, and air transport; and transportation equity.</p>
<h2>Become an ERVA supporter</h2><p>ERVA will convene four visioning events each year on broad engineering research themes that have the potential to solve societal challenges, Grejner-Brzezinska says. IEEE members who are experts in the fields can get involved by joining the ERVA Champions, now more than 900 strong. They are among the first to learn about upcoming visioning sessions and about openings to serve on volunteer groups such as thematic task forces, advisory boards, and standing councils. Members can <a href="https://www.ervacommunity.org/get-involved/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sign up on the ERVA website</a>.</p><p>“Becoming a champion is an opportunity to break out of your silos of disciplines and really come together with others in the engineering research community,” Grejner-Brzezinska says. “You can do what engineers do best: solve problems.”</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/nsf-engineering-alliance-climate-change</guid><category>Ieee member news</category><category>Climate change</category><category>National science foundation</category><category>Engineering research visioning alliance</category><category>Biology</category><category>Cybersecurity</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Kathy Pretz</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/earth-with-different-circles-of-climate-change-options-around-it.jpg?id=31788673&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Take a Trip Through Switzerland’s Museum of Consumer Electronics</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/switzerlands-museum-of-consumer-electronics</link><description><![CDATA[

	For more than a decade <a href="https://enter.ch/home/visit/?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Museum ENTER</a>, in Solothurn, Switzerland, has been a place where history buffs can explore and learn about the development and growth of computer and consumer electronics in Switzerland and the rest of the world. On display are computers, calculators, floppy disks, phonographs, radios, video game consoles, and related objects.
</p><p>
	Thanks to a new four-year partnership between the museum and the <a href="https://ieee.ch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Switzerland Section</a>, IEEE members may visit the facility for free. They also can donate their time to help create exhibits; translate pamphlets, display cards, and other written media; and present science, technology, engineering, and math workshops.

<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The technology on display includes televisions and radios from the 1950s.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">ENTER Museum</small></p><h2>Collections of calculators, radios, telephones, and televisions</h2><p>
	ENTER started as the private collection of Swiss entrepreneur Felix Kunz, who had been amassing computers and other electronics since the mid-1970s. Kunz and Peter Regenass—a collector of calculators—opened the museum in 2011 near the Solothurn train station.
</p><p>
	The museum’s collection focuses on the history of technology made in Switzerland by companies including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolex" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bolex</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_AG" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Crypto AG</a>, and <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/manuf/gretag/index.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gretag</a>. The technology on display includes early telegraphs, telephones, televisions, and radios.
</p><p>
	There are 300 mechanical calculators from Regenass’s collection. One of the mechanical calculators, Curta, looks like a pepper mill and has more than 700 parts.
</p><p>
	The museum also has several <em>Volksempfängers</em>, the early radio models used by the Nazis to spread propaganda.
</p><p>
	Visitors can check out the collection of working <a href="https://www.apple.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple</a> computers, which the museum claims is the largest in Europe.
</p><h2>Free admission, discounts, and STEM education courses </h2><p>
	The IEEE Switzerland Section began its partnership with the museum last year, when the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EPFLieeeSB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">student branch</a> at the IEEE <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EPFL</a> hosted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9FnbAatUhA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">presentation</a> there, says IEEE Senior Member <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieu-c-303b1920/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mathieu Coustans</a>, the Switzerland Section’s treasurer.
</p><p>
	In May, the section and the museum organized a <a href="https://enter.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Leserbeitrag_100JahreRadio.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">workshop celebrating 100 years of radio broadcasting in Switzerland</a>. IEEE members presented on the topic in French, Coustans says, and then translated the presentations to English.
</p><p>
	Based on the success of both events, he says, the section and the museum began to discuss how else they could collaborate.
</p><p>
	The two organizations discovered they have “many of the same goals,” says IEEE Member <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/violettavitacca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Violetta Vitacca</a>, chief executive of the museum. They both aim to inspire the next generation of engineers, promote the history of technology, and bring together engineers from academia and industry to collaborate. The section and museum decided to create a long-term partnership to help each other succeed.
</p><p>
	In addition to the free visits, IEEE members receive a 10 percent discount on services offered by the museum, including digitizing books and other materials and repairing broken equipment such as radios and vintage record players. Members can donate historical artifacts too. In addition, IEEE groups are welcome to host conferences and section meetings at the facility.
</p><p>
	The IEEE Switzerland Section as well as members of student branches and the local <a href="https://www.ieee.org/communities/life-members/groups.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Life Members Affinity Group</a> have agreed to speak at events held at the museum and teach STEM classes there.
</p><p>
	“The museum is a space where both professional engineers and young people can network and learn from each other,” Vitacca says. “I think this partnership is a win-win for both IEEE and the museum.”
</p><p>
	She says she hopes that “collaborating with IEEE will help Museum ENTER gain an international reputation.”
</p><p>
	The perks of the collaboration will become “especially attractive with the opening of the brand-new Museum ENTER building” next year, says IEEE Senior Member Hugo Wyss, chair of the Switzerland Section, who led the partnership effort.
</p><h2>Exhibits on gaming, inventors, and startups</h2><p>
	The museum is set to move in May to a larger building in the village of Derendingen. When it reopens there in November, these are some new additions visitors can look forward to:
</p><ul>
<li>Audio guides, display cards, and pamphlets in German, English, and French.</li>
<li>“The Academy,” which aims to inspire the next generation of engineers, offering workshops, lectures, and other events, as well as access to a technical library.</li>
<li>A data digitization laboratory where collectors and electronics enthusiasts can convert vintage media carriers, records, and film.</li>
<li>A public-gathering piazza with an attached café and meeting rooms.</li>
</ul><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The museum offers STEM workshops.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit..."> ENTER Museum</small></p><p>
	In addition, these eight permanent exhibits will be available, the museum says:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Game Area.</strong> A display featuring innovations that have driven the rise of gaming and high-performance computing.</li>
<li><strong>Hall of Brands.</strong> A showcase of technologies from well-known companies.</li>
<li><strong>Now.</strong> Current technology highlighted in the news.</li>
<li><strong>Show of Pioneers.</strong> A look at the inventors of popular consumer and computer electronics.</li>
<li><strong>Switzerland Connected. </strong>A showcase for the country’s former and current accelerators, startups, and schools.</li>
<li><strong>Time Travel. </strong>A retrospective look at 150 years of technology.</li>
<li><strong>Typology of Technology. </strong>Applications such as optical and magnetic recording used for music and film.</li>
</ul><p>
	The museum also plans to curate special exhibitions.
</p><p>
	“We are going from being simply a museum with an extensive collection to being a center for networking, education, and innovation,” Vitacca says. “That’s why it’s important for the museum to collaborate with IEEE. Our offerings are not only unique in Switzerland but also across Europe. IEEE is a great partner for us to help get the word out about what we do.”

Each member is assigned to a local section within one of the 10 regions, and each region elects a representative to serve on the <a href="https://mga.ieee.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10" target="_blank">IEEE Member and Geographic Activities </a>(MGA) Board and on the IEEE Board of Directors. The regional units work to fulfill IEEE’s mission and to meet the needs of IEEE members living within the region’s borders. </p><p>As of June, the distribution of the IEEE membership across the 10 regions is <a href="https://r1.ieee.org/about/" target="_blank">Region 1</a>: 24,938 members; <a href="https://r2.ieee.org/" target="_blank">Region 2</a>: 21,795 members; <a href="https://r3.ieee.org/" target="_blank">Region 3</a>: 24,202 members; <a href="https://www.ewh.ieee.org/reg/4/index.php" target="_blank">Region 4</a>: 16,836 members; <a href="https://r5.ieee.org/" target="_blank">Region 5</a>: 22,317 members; <a href="https://ieee-region6.org/" target="_blank">Region 6</a>: 43,089 members; <a href="https://www.ieee.ca/en/" target="_blank">Region 7</a>: 14,179 members; <a href="https://ieeer8.org/" target="_blank">Region 8</a>: 74,451 members; <a href="https://r9.ieee.org/en/home/" target="_blank">Region 9</a>: 16,426 members; and <a href="https://www.ieeer10.org/" target="_blank">Region 10:</a> 151,421 members.</p><p>Last year, the MGA Board, which oversees IEEE membership and the activities of geographic units worldwide, formed a region realignment ad hoc committee to review the regional organization and propose recommendations for structural changes. The committee consists of current region directors among other MGA volunteers.</p><p>Based on the ad hoc committee’s recommendations, several actions have been taken to date. A formal plan will be presented to the MGA Board for approval at a meeting later this year.</p><p>A plan has been developed to divide Region 10, IEEE’s largest region, into two regions, to better meet the needs of its members in this region. Region 10 leadership and the MGA ad hoc committee have been working to develop the geographic boundaries of the two regions and have been creating implementation plans to execute this regional division following approval by the MGA Board and the IEEE Board of Directors. </p><p>To maintain a total of 10 regions across the world, IEEE Region 1 and Region 2 are proposing to merge formally into a single region with a single region director. The Region 1 and Region 2 Board of Governors and Executive Committees will work collaboratively to document and determine the best path forward in merging the two regions affairs, governance, and member activities. </p><p>While planning efforts for regional realignment are ongoing, another recent initiative has been the introduction of additional zone representatives at the MGA Board. A zone is a substructure within a region with a significant number of members. In these large regions, zone representatives can assist in the region and provide an additional voice for members within the zone. </p><p>To test the zone concept, in February the MGA Board approved the formation of four zones: two in Region 8 and two in Region 10. Representatives from the new zones participated in the MGA Board meeting held in June. The ad hoc committee is continuing to further develop specific responsibilities for the zone leaders.</p><p>The ad hoc committee is planning to bring motions forward to an upcoming MGA Board meeting to confirm the direction and next steps of the realignment, including next steps in the split of Region 10 into two regions, the consolidation of Regions 1 and 2 into a single region, and further definition of the zone concept.</p><p>If approved by the MGA Board, the vice president of MGA, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidakoehler/" target="_blank">David Koehler</a>, will then present motions related to these matters for consideration by the IEEE Board of Directors at its November meeting.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 18:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-regions-reconfiguration</guid><category>Ieee news</category><category>Ieee regions</category><category>Ieee member and geographic activities</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Kathy Pretz</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-the-regions-of-the-ieee.jpg?id=31531954&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>IEEE President’s Note: A Promise Is a Promise</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-presidents-note-a-promise-is-a-promise</link><description><![CDATA[

	My great-grandfather was the kindest man I ever met. A self-taught accountant without formal education, he lived in the impoverished countryside of southern Taiwan. Legend has it that because members of the community viewed him as trustworthy, humble, and hardworking, they hired him to do their bookkeeping. He escaped a future of being a struggling farmer and was able to build a successful business.
</p><p>
	He was also a vegetarian. While there were many special occasions and festivals in his sleepy village where meat was served, he always chose to eat his simple vegetarian meals away from others. I always wondered why. I came to learn that it was because my great-grandfather made a promise to Buddha.
</p><hr/><p>
	Many years ago, my grandfather was a medical student studying in Japan. After a vacation home to Taiwan with my grandmother, they returned to Japan by boat, during which time he became very ill. World War II was raging, and medical supplies were limited. Unfortunately, by the time the necessary supplies reached my grandfather, it was too late. Later, my great-uncle went to Japan to study medicine and he also became quite sick. That was when my great-grandfather made a promise to Buddha: If you let my second son live, I will forever be a vegetarian to honor you. My great-uncle survived. My great-grandfather’s wish came true and until he passed away in his nineties, he never broke his promise, a simple vow between him and Buddha. A promise is a promise.
</p><p>
	I strongly believe that integrity is the essence of everything successful, and character is what you do when no one is watching. Ethics serves as my ultimate guide for how I conduct myself both personally and professionally.
</p><p>
	Because we are in a profession that often deals with innovation and safety, all members of our community—engineers, technologists, scientists, practitioners, and entrepreneurs—should have the highest ethical standards.
</p><p>
	IEEE has recently revised its<a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Code of Ethics</a>, which encourages our members to strive to comply with ethical design and sustainable development practices. This is crucial given the global scale of the environmental, social, and political challenges that threaten to rapidly and critically impact the living conditions of current and future generations.
</p><h2>Fair opportunity for participation</h2><p>
	At the time of my grandfather’s death, my grandmother was pregnant with my mother. Because of this, she dropped out of medical school. During this era, a widow was expected to remain as such, even though my grandmother was only in her twenties. She chose to get remarried, an act that was unforgivable then. Thus, my mother was raised by my great-grandfather.
</p><p>
	My grandmother was ahead of her time and dared to defy tradition. She was an outstanding athlete and an excellent student, with both ambition and potential. However, she lived during an era when women seldom received an education, not to mention the opportunity to attend medical school. In the end, tradition won. After remarrying, she had more children and became a housewife, not a doctor as she had planned. How many women in the world still face such obstacles?
</p><p>
	Making progress in engineering, technology, and science is a global endeavor with worldwide implications. This progress is guided best by having an open, diverse, and inclusive mindset with the goal of developing and sharing innovative solutions for the benefit of all.

	Throughout my lifelong relationship with IEEE—my professional home—what I have treasured most is having the opportunity to befriend colleagues from around the world, from different cultures, with different beliefs, ways of life, and languages. My work, with IEEE and professionally, has taken me to several continents to collaborate and work with others. Through this global network I have been able to learn from the best and brightest minds in the world, and have come to greatly appreciate the diversity of cultures of IEEE members. Everyone has their own unique wisdom to offer.
</p><p>
	IEEE continues its efforts to strengthen <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/diversity-index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">diversity and inclusivity across the organization</a> and in the broader technological community. The establishment of the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/corporate/ieee-diversity-and-inclusion-committee-charter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Diversity and Inclusion Committee</a> as a standing committee of the IEEE Board of Directors follows the organization’s long-standing commitment to maintaining an environment in which all are welcome to collaborate and contribute to the community, to support the growth of the profession and colleagues, and to advance technology for the benefit of humanity.
</p><p>
	Additionally, IEEE has devoted considerable effort in the past few years revising policies, procedures, and bylaws to ensure that members have a safe, inclusive place where all feel welcome. These activities help ensure all our members have full access to the benefits of membership, including opportunities for professional development and recognition.
</p><p>
	As president, I made a commitment to help shape the IEEE of the future by examining ways in which the organization can evolve to best meet the needs of all technical professionals. And I made a promise to every member from all of our diverse groups and regions, especially women and others from underrepresented communities, that they will have a fair opportunity for participation and leadership in our professional home.<br/>
	 And a promise is a promise.</p><p>

At various times during the ensuing decades, <em>The Institute</em>—or, as we call it in <em>Spectrum</em>’s offices, “<em>TI</em>”—has been published as a stand-alone monthly and then quarterly broadsheet. It even had its own website for a few years, before being integrated into <em>Spectrum</em>’s site in 2019 and appearing in the print magazine as a section on a quarterly basis. </p><p>While <em>Spectrum</em> dives deep into emerging technologies and delivers expert voices from the bleeding edge, <em>The Institute</em> has focused on IEEE members, featuring their stories, celebrating their accomplishments, and telling them about IEEE products, services, elections, and volunteer opportunities. <em>The Institute</em> also brings members all the news relevant to the functioning of the association, such as the reconfiguration of its geographic regions to ensure there is equitable representation across its global membership. </p><hr/><p><em>The Institute</em> staff—Editor in Chief Kathy Pretz and Assistant Editor Joanna Goodrich—say they are most excited about showcasing the diversity of IEEE’s membership and highlighting those who have made IEEE their professional home. Pretz says there’s a misconception that most of IEEE’s members work in academia. That’s why <em>The Institute</em> has put more emphasis on profiling the careers of those working in industry, such as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tsmc-exec-on-chip-shortage" target="_self">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s senior vice president of R&D, Yuh-Jier Mii</a>. </p><p>“I’m always amazed how accessible top leaders at high-tech companies are when I tell them I would like to interview them for an article in IEEE’s member publication,” Pretz remarked recently. “And all of them are so humble about their accomplishments. TSMC’s Yuh-Jier Mii was no different.”</p><p>Pretz and Goodrich also write about the careers of young professionals who are the future of the organization. In this month’s issue, they <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/legacy-of-eddie-custovic" target="_self">spotlight Eddie Custovic</a>, the recipient of the IEEE Theodore W. Hissey Outstanding Young Professionals Award. </p><p class="pull-quote">“It’s very rewarding to be able to interview members who have developed technology that I use every day.”</p><p><strong></strong>In addition to putting a spotlight on the accomplishments of individual engineers,<em> The Institute </em>also covers the history of technology. “It’s very rewarding to be able to interview members who have developed technology that I use every day, as well as members who are developing the next breakthrough tech that will impact society,” Goodrich says. “For example, Steven Sasson invented the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/first-digital-camera-history" target="_self">first digital camera</a>, which we use every day in some shape or form. Eddie Custovic, on the other hand, is working to develop an AI platform that will help solve food shortages that have been predicted for 2050.”</p><p>Indeed, IEEE members have for decades been turning their ideas into successful businesses. That’s why <em>TI</em> features entrepreneurial members who have launched their own ventures, like IEEE Fellow <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-to-increase-ivf-success" target="_self">Alex Bronstein of Embryonics</a>. And, of course, <em>TI</em> celebrates major anniversaries and milestones, like the 25th anniversary of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-25-year-anniversary" target="_self">IEEE Women in Engineering</a>.</p><p>In future issues, readers can look forward to a profile of computer pioneer IEEE Fellow <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/erol-gelenbe-profile" target="_blank">Erol Gelenbe</a>, whose invention of the packet-voice telephone switch made Zoom possible. In December, look for a piece on IEEE executive director Stephen Welby, who is leaving the organization at the end of the year. Kathy, Joanna, and I invite you to celebrate these engineers and their extraordinary accomplishments with us in the coming months. </p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 16:17:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-we-celebrate-engineers</guid><category>The institute</category><category>Engineers</category><category>Engineering careers</category><category>Tech history</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Harry Goldstein</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-collage-of-5-people-on-a-blue-background.png?id=31356180&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Steradian’s 4D Imaging Radar Aims to Make Self-Driving Cars Smarter</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/steradians-4d-imaging-radar</link><description><![CDATA[

Before launching the fabless semiconductor startup in 2016, the founders were working at well-known technology companies designing chipsets for mass-market radio technologies including Bluetooth, GPS, LTE cellular, and wireless LAN. They discovered that radars could be built with modern techniques, such as semiconductors and processing advances, so that they could extract shapes, sizes, and types of objects.</p><p>The sophisticated radar chips and processors working together could be used in autonomous cars to extract the same information if not more, the founders theorized.</p><hr/><p>“We did market studies and literature surveys—including IEEE publications—and found that radar has unlimited potential in the automotive industry,” says IEEE Senior Member<a href="https://steradiansemi.com/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Apu Sivadas</a>, the company’s CTO and a cofounder. “The radar echoes contain a wealth of hidden information, which we felt the existing technology used in autonomous vehicles could not fully harness.”</p><p>Headquartered in Bangalore, India, Steradian developed a “4D” millimeter-wave imaging radar system and the small MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) transceiver chipsets that go with it. The system is called 4D because it tracks distance, speed, elevation angles, and the azimuth, the horizontal angle or direction of a compass bearing.</p><p>At the moment, lidar has superior angular resolution, but Sivadas says he believes radar eventually can bridge the gap once modern radar chipsets and AI are combined.</p><h3>Using IEEE Xplore to its fullest</h3><br/><p>IEEE is “pretty close to my heart,” Sivadas says. “At the universities where I studied [the National Institute of Technology Calicut and the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur], there was a history of faculty publishing in IEEE transactions or journals and referring to them to let us know what was new and trending. For example, our research topics were picked from the journals the professors wrote for.</p><p>“Even after so many years, IEEE is still very much baked into the education of Indian engineers.”</p><p>A subscription to the<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp" target="_blank"> IEEE Xplore Digital Library</a> is his most important member benefit, he says.</p><p>When he needs to solve a technical issue, he says, he searches the digital library to find relevant papers. And he has collaborated with some authors of those papers and hired graduate students who have coauthored the articles.</p><p>“Automotive sensing is fast emerging. We hope to achieve a lot more with radar, Sivadas says. “We should exploit radar to the maximum.”</p><p>The company was named <em>Steradian, </em>he says, because “it is the 3D version of radian, which is the International System of Units [measure] of angle on a plane.” Steradian is the SI unit for a solid angle and has “connotations of having very sharp antenna beams,” he says.</p><p>The startup, which has four dozen employees, submitted 26 U.S. patent applications for its technology, and it has been granted nine patents so far.</p><p>“We are an end-to-end product company,” he says. “The advanced technology that goes into radar—such as antennas, radar semiconductor chipsets, signal processors, and software—are all done under one roof. We take care of the entire product architecture.”</p><h2>4D imaging</h2><p>An imaging radar system consists of two main parts: a transceiver that sends and receives signals and an imaging/processing chip that turns the signals into images.</p><p>Steradian offers a state-of-the-art 28-nanometer CMOS chip that powers its 4D sensors. The radar chip is an integrated 16-channel MIMO that acts as a building block for high-resolution radars. In a market comparison, Sivadas says, Steradian’s transceiver had the highest output power and the lowest noise with the least amount of distortion.</p><p>The radar system, which operates in the 76- to 81-gigahertz frequency band, can be used in intelligent transportation infrastructure in addition to self-driving cars, he says.</p><p class="pull-quote">“The advanced technology that goes into radar—such as antennas, radar semiconductor chipsets, signal processors, and software—are all done under one roof.”</p><p><span></span>“The unit can be installed on highways or intersections to monitor traffic,” he says, “such as counting the number of vehicles in a lane, automating traffic lights, or monitoring a vehicle’s speed.”</p><p>The automotive industry is evaluating the use of 4D radar sensors in autonomous vehicles, he says, adding that the price of mass-produced imaging units is comparable to today’s conventional radar.</p><p>Steradian’s prototypes for intelligent transportation systems are being tested by about 20 companies. Sivadas says the company has revenue coming in from the sale of its system thanks to several partnerships it recently formed. In February the startup signed an<a href="https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2022/02/14/visteon-partners-with-steradian-semiconductors-to-build-enhanced-advanced-driver-assistance-systems/49231/" target="_blank"> agreement</a> to work with mobility company<a href="https://www.visteon.com/" target="_blank"> Visteon</a> to produce enhanced advanced driver-assistance systems. Steradian also signed a<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/steradian-semiconductors-joins-hands-with-astra-microwave-products-for-traffic-monitoring-4d-imaging-radar/articleshow/89951722.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst" target="_blank"> partnership deal</a> in March with <a href="https://www.astramwp.com/" target="_blank">Astra Microwave Products</a> to produce radar modules for traffic management systems.</p><h2>Former Qualcomm and Texas Instruments employee</h2><p>Sivadas has 25 years of experience in engineering R&D and management working for<a href="http://qualcomm.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Qualcomm</a> and<a href="http://ti.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Texas Instruments</a>. He holds more than 20 patents for RF technologies and integrated circuits.</p><p>He says it was an easy transition for Steradian’s founders to go from working for large tech companies to forming their own.</p><p>“We had done many of the same functions required in a large company, such as defining products and architectures, executing them, adding features ahead of the market, and hiring people and building up their capabilities,” he says. What was new for the founders, he says, was having to set up their early office themselves.</p><p>Finding qualified engineers to hire wasn’t difficult, he says, because India has many companies involved in chip design: “The talent pipeline already existed.”</p><p>As with other startups, another challenge has been raising capital. For the first three years, the company was self-funded. Steradian now has several investors, having received funding from venture capitalists and some tech companies with an interest in automotive sensing technology.</p><p>“The biggest challenge,” he says, “was getting the first set of investors to believe in us.”</p><p>On 31 August, <a href="https://www.renesas.com/us/en" target="_blank">Renesas Electronics Corp.</a>, a supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions headquartered in Tokyo, <a href="https://www.renesas.com/us/en/about/press-room/renesas-acquire-steradian-expand-its-reach-radar-market" target="_blank">announced</a> that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Steradian Semiconductors. </p><p><em>This article has been updated from an earlier version. </em></p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 18:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/steradians-4d-imaging-radar</guid><category>Ieee member news</category><category>Self-driving cars</category><category>Autonomous vehicles</category><category>Intelligent transportation systems</category><category>Radar</category><category>Careers</category><category>Computer chip</category><category>Transportation</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Kathy Pretz</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/hand-holding-small-computer-chip-between-the-thumb-and-forefinger.jpg?id=31300451&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>The Superconducting Shields Behind MRIs’ Triumph</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-superconducting-shields-behind-mris</link><description><![CDATA[

The patient is placed on a table that slides into the bore of a scanner, which contains a strong magnet and various coils. The machine uses the resulting magnetic field and radio waves to create images of the patient’s insides.</p><p>Full-body MRI scanners were first used clinically in hospitals in the early 1980s, but they were bulky and expensive. Because the magnetic field produced by the machines sometimes strayed outside the room where the MRI scanner was located, safety measures had to be implemented. The stray field was dangerous as it could affect pacemakers and other metal medical devices. </p><hr/><p>To confine the magnetic field to the room, <a href="https://prizmedimaging.com/pages/mri-shielding-and-rf-shield-enclosure-design-considerations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iron sheets</a> were placed on the walls, ceiling, and floors. The strategy, known as <em>passive shielding</em>, increased construction costs and the time it took to install a scanner, however. The method also restricted where the machines could be built and used.</p><p>The addition of secondary actively shielded superconducting magnets in MRI systems in 1986 eliminated the need for iron sheets. The enhancement, unveiled by a team of scientists at Oxford Instruments (now part of <a href="https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-uk/magnetic-resonance-imaging/siemens-magnet-technology" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Siemens</a>), in Oxfordshire, England, lowered installation costs and shortened construction times.</p><p>The IEEE commemorated the magnets as an IEEE Milestone during a ceremony on 17 June at the Siemens Oxfordshire facility.</p><p>“The magnets made MRI widely available,” says <a href="https://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/kale-izzet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Izzet Kale</a>. The IEEE member is chair of the <a href="https://www.ieee-ukandireland.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE U.K. and Ireland Section</a>, which sponsored the Milestone nomination.</p><h2>Magnetic fields and radio waves</h2><p>Images produced by MRI scanners aren’t really images in the usual sense. They are constructed by a computer using magnetic fields and radio waves.</p><p>Nearly 70 percent of the human body consists of water, and each water molecule has two hydrogen protons. The protons’ magnetic moments (the measure of its tendency to align with a magnetic field) are usually oriented in various directions, but when they are subjected to a strong magnetic field, the protons become polarized and <a href="https://global.canon/en/technology/support28.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">point in the same direction</a>, according to an <a href="https://global.canon/en/technology/support28.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">article about MRI</a> on <a href="https://us.medical.canon/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canon Medical</a>. The application of radio waves at the right frequency makes the protons’ orientation oscillate. When the radio waves are turned off, the protons revert to their prior state and emit a signal (also a radio wave). The interaction is magnetic resonance.</p><p>The strength of the magnetic field produced by an MRI machine can be altered using three sets of gradient electric coils that are made of copper or aluminum, as explained in an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1121941/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">article</a> published by the U.S. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Library of Medicine</a>. <a href="https://mriquestions.com/how-to-reduce-fringe.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gradient electric coils</a> are loops of wire or thin conductive sheets that are located on the innermost part of the scanner’s tube. When current passes through the coils, a secondary magnetic field, or gradient field, is created. The gradient field slightly distorts the main magnetic field and modifies its strength.</p><p>Protons in different areas of the patient’s body will resonate at different frequencies depending on how strong the magnetic field is. Receiver coils in the scanner tube improve the detection of the emitted signal.</p><p>MRI scanners use those signals to produce images, showing differences in the way protons react.</p><h2>Making MRI a staple of medical diagnostics</h2><p>When MRI scanners were introduced in hospitals, up to 40 tonnes of iron were required to prevent the external magnetic field from straying beyond the room, according to the <a href="https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/w/images/2/21/US4587504.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actively shielded superconducting magnets’ patent</a>. But the extra safety measures made installing a scanner more expensive and difficult because the machine often had to be built in a freestanding building or in the hospital’s basement.</p><p>To help lower the cost and make it easier to install scanners, four Oxford Instruments scientists—John Bird, Frank Davis, IEEE Member <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/445667/contributions/2654717/attachments/1516432/2366717/Or20-01_DGH_MT25_Memorial_final_.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Hawksworth</a>, and John Woodgate—in 1986 enhanced the scanner with a second set of actively shielded superconducting magnets. Bird was the project’s lead engineer, Davis was the company’s technical director, Hawksworth was its engineering director, and Woodgate was the managing director.</p><p class="pull-quote">“Actively shielded superconducting magnets made MRI widely available.”</p><p>They created secondary electromagnets that, like the primary ones, operate in a superconducting state: they have no resistance to the flow of an electrical current and can carry large currents without overheating. The electromagnets were forced into a superconducting state by being continually bathed in liquid helium at minus 269.1 °C, according to an <a href="https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/Milestone-Proposal:Active_shielding_of_superconducting_magnets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">entry about the Milestone</a> on the <a href="https://ethw.org/Main_Page" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Engineering and Technology History Wiki</a>.</p><p>The magnets are made of two coils of wire, either of niobium and titanium or niobium and tin. The coils are embedded in copper.</p><p>An electrical current is passed through the coils, each producing its own magnetic field. The coils are oriented so that the magnetic fields they produce oppose each other, according to the technology’s patent.</p><p>If, for example, the first coil produces a magnetic field of 2 Teslas and the second coil generates a field that’s 0.5 T, it reduces the strength of the overall magnetic field to 1.5 T. The Tesla is the unit of measurement of a magnetic field’s magnitude.</p><p>Although the strength of the scanner’s magnetic field is reduced by the active shielding, it keeps the stray magnetic field inside the room, the developers noted in their patent application.</p><p>Thanks to actively shielded superconducting magnets, MRI is now a fundamental diagnostic tool “on which modern medicine depends,” Kale says. “Active shielding was a key enabler to MRI becoming so widespread and important.”</p><p>Administered by the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/about/history_center/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE History Center</a> and <a href="https://www.ieeefoundation.org/donate_history" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supported by donors</a>, the Milestone program recognizes outstanding technical developments around the world. The magnets’ Milestone plaque, which is to be displayed inside the Siemens Magnet Technology building in the Eynsham section of Oxfordshire reads:</p><p><em>“At this site, the first actively shielded superconducting magnets for diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) use were conceived, designed, and produced. Active shielding reduced the size, weight, and installed cost of MRI systems, allowing them to be more easily transported and advantageously located, thereby benefiting advanced medical diagnosis worldwide.”</em></p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-superconducting-shields-behind-mris</guid><category>Ieee history</category><category>Ieee news</category><category>Ieee milestone</category><category>Biomedical engineering</category><category>Mri</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Joanna Goodrich</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/looking-through-the-opening-of-an-mri-machine.jpg?id=31214851&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Is AI Good for Health Care?</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-in-health-care</link><description><![CDATA[

</p><hr/><p>
	Season 3 features these episodes:
</p><p>
<strong>The Balance—AI’s Healthcare Goodness for Marginalized Patients.</strong> IEEE Senior Member <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/an-autism-screening-tool-led-sampathkumar-veeraraghavan-to-devote-himself-to-humanitarian-work" target="_self">Sampathkumar Veeraraghavan</a>, chair of the <a href="https://hac.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Humanitarian Activities Committee</a>, covers whether AI and machine learning can support fairness, personalization, and inclusiveness or if they create even more inequity.
</p><p>
<strong>Riding the Third Wave of AI for Precision Oncology. </strong>This episode features <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanhayes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nathan Hayes</a>, founder and CEO of <a href="http://modal.net" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Modal Technology Corp.</a>, and scientist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthoula-lazaris-6b5b4615/?originalSubdomain=ca" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anthoula Lazaris</a>, director of the <a href="https://rimuhc.ca/biobank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">biobank at the McGill University Health Center Research Institute</a>. They discuss how AI can improve patient outcomes. The experts also cover whether the full potential for precision oncology will be realized by using the “third wave of AI” with real-world data and practice. In the so-called third wave, AI systems are imagined to have humanlike communication and reasoning capabilities and be able to recognize, classify, and adapt to new situations autonomously.
</p><p>
<strong>Advanced AI and Sensors—Reaching the Hardest to Reach Patients at Home. </strong><a href="https://www.himss.org/resource-bio/sumit-kumar-nagpal#:~:text=Cherish%20Health%2C%20Inc.%2C&text=Sumit%20Kumar%20Nagpal%20is%20a,healthcare%20experience%2C%20cost%20and%20access." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sumit Kumar Nagpal</a>, cofounder and CEO of <a href="https://www.cherishhealth.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cherish Health</a>—which develops sensors and artificial intelligence—discusses how the technologies can efficiently support the wellness needs of an aging population with dignity and integrity.
</p><p>
<strong>AI—The New Pipeline for Targeted Drug Discovery.</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marialpineda/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maria Luisa Pineda</a>, cofounder and CEO of <a href="https://www.envisagenics.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Envisagenics</a>, covers how splicing RNA using AI and high-performance computing could create a path to targeted drug discovery. RNA splicing is at the forefront of providing insights into diseases that are linked back to RNA errors. Using AI, high-performance computing, and the exponential amount of genetic data, researchers can develop the insights needed for targeted drug discovery in oncology and other genetic conditions faster and more accurately, Pineda says.
</p><p>
<strong>Reducing the Healthcare Gap With Explainable AI.</strong> <a href="https://www.closedloop.ai/team/dave-decaprio" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dave DeCaprio</a>, cofounder and CTO of <a href="https://www.closedloop.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ClosedLoop.ai,</a> discusses health care disparities around the globe. Identifying and leveraging the social determinants of health can close the gap, DeCaprio says. Off-the-shelf AI programs present a new perspective on transparency and the reduction of bias, and they could build trust about the applications among health stakeholders.
</p><p>
<strong>Getting Real About Healthcare Data and the Patient’s Journey.</strong> The time has come to unleash the value of unstructured data, says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandracarolinaehrlich/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alexandra Ehrlich</a>, principal health innovation scientist at <a href="http://oracle.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oracle</a>. AI and machine learning offer opportunities, but first the technologies must be demystified, Ehrlich says, adding that natural language processing can help. Ehrilich explores NLP applications as well as challenges with navigating bias throughout accessible health care data.
</p><p>
<strong>Mind Your Data—The First Rule of Predictive Analytics in Clinical Research.</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronmann/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aaron Mann</a>, senior vice president of data science at the <a href="https://crdsalliance.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clinical Research Data Sharing Alliance</a>, an <a href="https://ieee-isto.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE–Industry Standards and Technology Organization</a> alliance, discusses how open data sharing is paving the way for access to better quality, real-world, inclusive data. The sharing of data will enable predictive analytics to be more accurate, resourceful, and utilitarian in clinical research, Mann says.
</p><p>
<strong>Can the Health System Benefit From AI as It Stands Today?</strong> While focusing on accuracy, ethics, and bias in AI algorithms, we cannot lose sight of the need for more validated data, says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitrios-kalogeropoulos-phd-95966b1a1/?originalSubdomain=uk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dimitrios Kalogeropoulos</a>. He is a health care expert with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNICEF</a>, the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Bank</a>, and the <a href="https://www.who.int/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>. Kalogeropoulos explores whether AI is good for medicine and whether medicine is good for AI.
</p><h3>​Here are the top 10 insights from the experts:</h3><br/><ol>
<li>Data is a depreciating asset. The longer it sits the less value it has.</li>
<li>Data is an abyss. If you want AI to make an impact on the health system, then make data reliable by design.</li>
<li>Fairness is not a math problem. Equity in health care is not about the technology but rather the approaches taken to make health care accessible to all.</li>
<li>Social determinants of health have significant, if not equal, value to diagnostic health data in closing the health care gap with AI.</li>
<li>Make explainable AI transparent and off the shelf so that clinicians understand how the algorithms are addressing the questions in the data to help them arrive at the insights needed.</li>
<li>Going to the same well of data provides the same results. Secondary use of real-world data available in an open, trusted, and validated means can enable predictive analytics to have a material impact on clinical research.</li>
<li>RNA splicing holds many insights to fighting diseases caused by RNA errors for the development of targeted therapeutics in oncology.</li>
<li>The trillions of bytes of data in genomes and pathology are no match for AI, which could generate much-needed insights in months, compared with the years it takes oncology researchers using former approaches.</li>
<li>AI can close the health care gap if it is deployed properly.</li>
<li>There is a strong disconnect between clinicians and hospital IT system administrators when it comes to implementing, utilizing, and integrating technologies.</li>

<img src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-of-nvidias-cto-michael-kagan-on-a-gray-background.jpg?id=31044752&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C384"/><br/><br/><p>
	In 2019 Michael Kagan was leading the development of accelerated networking technologies as chief technology officer at 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellanox_Technologies#:~:text=Mellanox%20was%20founded%20in%20May,Udi%20Katz%20and%20Alon%20Webman." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mellanox Technologies</a>, which he and eight colleagues had founded two decades earlier. Then in April 2020 <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nvidia</a> acquired the company for US $7 billion, and Kagan took over as CTO of that tech goliath—his dream job.
</p><p>
	Nvidia is headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif., but Kagan works out of the company’s office in Israel.
</p><hr/><p>
	At Mellanox, based in Yokneam Illit, Israel, Kagan had overseen the development of high-performance networking for computing and storage in cloud data centers. The company made networking equipment such as adapters, cables, and high-performance switches, as well as a new type of processor, the DPU. The company’s high-speed 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">InfiniBand</a> products can be found in most of the world’s fastest supercomputers, and its high-speed Ethernet products are in most cloud data centers, Kagan says.
</p><p>
	The IEEE senior member’s work is now focused on integrating a wealth of Nvidia technologies to build accelerated computing platforms, whose foundation are three chips: the GPU, the CPU, and the DPU, or data-processing unit. The DPU can support the ability to offload, accelerate, and isolate data center workloads, reducing CPU and GPU workloads.
</p><p>
	“At Mellanox we worked on the data center interconnect, but at Nvidia we are connecting state-of-the-art computing to become a single unit of computing: the data center,” Kagan says. Interconnects are used to link multiple servers and combine the entire data center into one, giant computing unit.
</p><p>
	“I have access and an open door to Nvidia technologies,” he says. “That’s what makes my life exciting and interesting. We are building the computing of the future.”
</p><h2>From Intel to Mellanox</h2><p>
	Kagan was born in St. Petersburg, Russia—then known as Leningrad. After he graduated high school in 1975, his family moved to Israel. As with many budding engineers, his curiosity led him to disassemble and reassemble things to figure out how they worked. And, with many engineers in the family, he says, pursuing an engineering career was an easy decision.
</p><p>
	He attended the 
	<a href="https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Technion</a>, Israel’s Institute of Technology, because “it was one of the best engineering universities in the world,” he says. “The reason I picked electrical engineering is because it was considered to be the best faculty in the Technion.”
</p><p>
	Kagan graduated in 1980 with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. He joined 
	<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/corporate-responsibility/intel-in-israel.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Intel</a> in Haifa, Israel, in 1983 as a design engineer and eventually relocated to the company’s offices in Hillsboro, Ore., where he worked on the 80387 floating-point coprocessor. A year later, after returning to Israel, Kagan served as an architect of the i8060XP vector processor and then led and managed design of the Pentium MMX microprocessor.
</p><p>
	During his 16 years at Intel, he worked his way up to chief architect. In 1999 he was preparing to move his family to California, where he would lead a high-profile project for the company. Then a former coworker at Intel, Eyal Waldman, asked Kagan to join him and five other acquaintances to form Mellanox.
</p><h3>About Michael Kagan</h3><br/><p>
<strong></strong><strong>Employer:</strong> Nvidia, Tel Aviv
</p><p>
<strong>Title:</strong> CTO
</p><p>
<strong>Member grade:</strong> Senior member
</p><p>
<strong>Alma mater:</strong> Technion, Israel’s Institute of Technology, Haifa</p><p>
	Kagan had been turning down offers to join startups nearly every week, he recalls, but Mellanox, with its team of cofounders and vision, drew him in. He says he saw it as a “compelling adventure, an opportunity to build a company with a culture based on the core values I grew up on: excellence, teamwork, and commitment.”
</p><p>
	During his more than 21 years there, he said, he had no regrets.
</p><p>
	“It was one of the greatest decisions I’ve ever made,” he says. “It ended up benefiting all aspects of my life: professionally, financially—everything.”
</p><p>
	InfiniBand, the startup’s breakout product, was designed for what today is known as cloud computing, Kagan says.
</p><p>
	“We took the goodies of InfiniBand and bolted them on top of the standard Ethernet,” he says. “As a result, we became the vendor of the most advanced network for high-performance computing. More than half the machines at the top 500 computer companies use the Mellanox interconnect, now the Nvidia interconnect.
</p><p>
	“Most of the cloud providers, such as 
	<a href="http://facebook.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Azure</a>, and <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alibaba</a>, use Nvidia’s networking and compute technologies. No matter what you do on the Internet, you’re most likely running through the chip that we designed.”
</p><p>
	Kagan says the partnership between Mellanox and Nvidia was “natural,” as the two companies had been doing business together for nearly a decade.
</p><p>
	“We delivered quite a few innovative solutions as independent companies,” he says.

<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">One of Kagan's key priorities is Nvidia’s Bluefield DPU. The data center infrastructure on a chip offloads, accelerates, and isolates a variety of networking, storage, and security services.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Nvidia</small>
</p><h2>BlueField and Omniverse supercomputers</h2><p>
	As CTO of Nvidia for the past two years, Kagan has shifted his focus from pure networking to the integration of multiple Nvidia technologies including building 
	<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/data-processing-unit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlueField</a> data-processing units and the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Omniverse</a> real-time graphics collaboration platform.
</p><p>
	He says Nvidia’s vision for the data center of the future is based on its three chips: CPU, DPU, and GPU.
</p><p>
	“These three pillars are connected with a very efficient and high-performance network that was originally developed at Mellanox and is being further developed at Nvidia,” he says.
</p><p>
	Development of the BlueField DPUs is now a key priority for Nvidia. It is a data center infrastructure on a chip, optimized for high-performance computing. It also offloads, accelerates, and isolates a variety of networking, storage, and security services.
</p><p>
	“In the data center, you have no control over who your clients are,” Kagan says. “It may very well happen that a client is a bad guy who wants to penetrate his neighbors’ or your infrastructure. You’re better off isolating yourself and other customers from each other by having a segregated or different computing platform run the operating system, which is basically the infrastructure management, the resource management, and the provisioning.”
</p><p>
	Kagan is particularly excited about the Omniverse, a new Nvidia product that uses 
	<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/usd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pixar’s Universal Scene Description</a> software for creating virtual worlds—what has become known as the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">metaverse</a>. Kagan describes the 3D platform as “creating a world by collecting data and making a physically accurate simulation of the world.”
</p><p>
	Car manufacturers are using the Omniverse to test-drive autonomous vehicles. Instead of physically driving a car on different types of roads under various conditions, data about the virtual world can be generated to train the AI models.
</p><p>
	“You can create situations that the car has to handle in the real world but that you don’t want it to meet in the real world, like a car crash,” Kagan says. “You don’t want to crash the car to train the model, but you do need to have the model be able to handle hazardous conditions on the road.”
</p><div class="ieee-sidebar-small">
<h3>Access to IEEE Information</h3>
<p>
	Kagan joined IEEE in 1997. He says membership gives him access to information about technical topics that would otherwise be challenging to obtain.
	</p>
<p>
	“I enjoy this type of federated learning and being exposed to new things,” he says.
	</p>
<p>
	He adds that he likes connecting with members who are working on similar projects, because he always learns something new.
	</p>
<p>
	“Being connected to these people from more diverse communities helps a lot,” he says. “It inspires you to do your job in a different way.”
	</p>
</div><p>
	The Omniverse platform can generate millions of kilometers of synthetic driving data in orders of magnitude faster than actually driving the car.
</p><p>
	Nvidia is investing heavily in technology for self-driving cars, Kagan says.
</p><p>
	The company is also building what it calls the most powerful AI supercomputer for climate science: 
	<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/11/12/earth-2-supercomputer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Earth-2</a>, a digital twin of the planet. Earth-2 is designed to continuously run models to predict climate and weather events at both the regional and global levels.
</p><p>
	Kagan says the climate modeling technology will enable people to try mitigation techniques for global warming and see what their impact is likely to be in 50 years.
</p><p>
	The company is also working closely with the health care industry to develop AI-based technologies. Its supercomputers are helping to identify cancer by generating synthetic data to enable researchers to train their models to better identify tumors. Its AI and accelerated computing products also assist with drug discovery and genome research, Kagan says.
</p><p>
	“We are actually moving forward at a fairly nice pace,” he says. “But the thing is that you always need to reinvent yourself and do the new thing faster and better, and basically win with what you have and not look for infinite resources. This is what commitment means.”

Clarke</a>, who penned <em>2001: A Space Odyssey,</em> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Isaac Asimov</a>, author of the Foundation series. Bovik says they wrote from a “very scientific point of view”—which made him want to help develop aerospace technology that would send humans “to other worlds.”</p><p>But he decided to study nuclear engineering in school—which then seemed like the future of energy. He discovered, however, that he didn't like the subject because it “required too much chemistry and memorization,” he says with a laugh. When he took a course in computer programming, he fell in love with it and ended up changing his major to computer engineering.</p><hr/><p>While pursuing a Ph.D. at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,</a> Bovik found his calling: digital image processing. It is a technology, he says, that back then didn’t have many applications and seemed like something out of a sci-fi novel. </p><p>The IEEE Fellow has since done groundbreaking work in the field.</p><p>He created theoretical models of how people will perceive the quality of an image or video after it has been compressed. He has used the models to develop algorithms that automatically measure picture quality.</p><h3>ABOUT ALAN BOVIK</h3><br/><p>

His video quality prediction technology is used by streaming services, broadcasting companies, movie studios, and technology companies worldwide. </p><p>Bovik has received several awards for his work. The <a href="https://www.emmys.com/academy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Academy of Television Arts and Sciences</a> honored him in 2015 with a <a href="http://live.ece.utexas.edu/emmy_award.php#:~:text=Professor%20Al%20Bovik%20and%20two,Development%20from%20the%20Television%20Academy." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development</a> and with a 2020 <a href="https://theemmys.tv/tech/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Technology and Engineering Emmy</a>. IEEE recognized Bovik with this year’s <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-edison-medal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edison Medal</a> “for pioneering high-impact scientific and engineering contributions leading to the perceptually optimized global streaming and sharing of visual media.” The award is sponsored by <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Samsung Electronics Co.</a></p><p>“The IEEE Edison Medal is the most important award I’ve received,” he says, “because of its history, the amazing past recipients, and because it’s from my peers.”</p><p>For nearly 40 years, he has been a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Texas</a> <a href="https://cockrell.utexas.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cockrell School of Engineering</a>, in Austin. He serves as director of Cockrell’s <a href="https://live.ece.utexas.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering</a>, where graduate students and faculty members develop psychometric databases, theories, and algorithms to advance modern perceptual video processing technologies.</p><p>Bovik says he plans to remain at the university for another 40 years because “being an educator and video research is the best.”</p><p>“I didn't really know how much I would enjoy the academic experience until I started teaching,” he says. </p><h2>Developing the SSIM index</h2><p>At the University of Illinois, Bovik took a class on digital image processing taught by <a href="https://ethw.org/Oral-History:Thomas_Huang" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thomas Huang</a>, a professor of electrical and computer engineering. The IEEE Life Fellow was a pioneer in computer vision, image processing, and image compression. </p><p>Bovik enjoyed the course so much that he joined Huang’s <a href="http://ifp-uiuc.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Image Formation and Processing Group</a>, part of the university’s <a href="https://beckman.illinois.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology</a>. The group conducted research in image and video coding, computer vision, pattern recognition, and machine learning. The professor became one of Bovik’s doctoral advisors. Bovik’s research focused on nonlinear statistical methods for image analysis and enhancement.</p><p>Huang suggested that Bovik consider applying for a job at the University of Texas after he graduated because he thought “it had a great future.” Bovik took his mentor’s advice and moved to Texas in 1984 to work for the Austin school as an assistant professor.</p><p>Bovik soon became interested in visual neuroscience and how it could be applied to video engineering. He spoke with several visual neuroscientists and visual psychologists to gain a better understanding of the brain’s visual cortex, which receives, integrates, and processes visual information. Bovik and his team of researchers created mathematical models of the visual cortex as well as the retina, which converts light into neural signals and sends them to the brain.</p><p class="pull-quote">“The IEEE Edison Medal is the most significant award I’ve received because it’s an award from my peers.”</p><p>In the early 2000s, he began studying how people perceive distortions—such as blurring, resizing, and noise—in pictures and videos, as video compression was becoming important because of digital television.</p><p>Video images take up a lot of space, and because bandwidth is limited, videos generally need to be compressed before being distributed. But the process can distort the images, causing people to perceive them as blurry or jagged. At the time, there was no program that could accurately predict how badly the images would be distorted before they were distributed, Bovik says, because the algorithms in use didn’t account for how people perceive the images. </p><p>Using the mathematical models he and his team previously developed, they created computational algorithms that accurately gauged the way humans would see distortions in compressed images. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Bovik with IEEE President Ray Liu [left] and President-Elect Saifur Rahman at the IEEE Honors Ceremony held in San Diego in May.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Alan Bovik</small></p><p>Bovik says the key to creating the algorithms was understanding how people process visual information when they first see an image.</p><p>“If an image is blurry, you don't have to think about it,” he says. “You sense that it’s blurry instantly.”</p><p>In 2001 he and his team developed SSIM. The program predicts how people will perceive a compressed image on a screen by measuring three factors: luminance masking (distortion visibility depending on an image’s brightness), contrast masking (distortion visibility depending on an image’s texture), and structural similarity.</p><p>If SSIM predicts an image will appear distorted, the errors can be fixed before the image is shared.</p><p>The algorithm has since become part of the <a href="https://www.itu.int/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Telecommunication Union</a>’s<a href="https://nisp.nw3.dk/standard/itu-t-h.264.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> H.264 video coding reference software standard</a>. The standard allows streaming services, broadcasting companies, and technology companies to include the program in their products and services.</p><h2>Preparing for the metaverse</h2><p>Bovik continues to develop algorithms for image processing and video quality assessment. He and his team are working with<a href="https://about.facebook.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Meta</a>’s<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Reality Labs</a> to develop an algorithm to be used in the metaverse, a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">simulated “embodied internet”</a> experienced in 3D, as defined by Meta founder <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/mark-zuckerberg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mark Zuckerberg</a>. Virtual and augmented reality will let users feel as if they can move through space at will and pick up objects with ease, Zuckerberg says.</p><p class="pull-quote">“Back in 1991, when we formed <em>Transactions</em>, not many people understood image processing. It seemed like something out of a science-fiction novel. But things have changed, and now it’s everywhere.”</p><p>“Nobody can predict how quickly the metaverse will be upon us,” Bovik says, “but it introduces all kinds of new challenges that are related to visual neuroscience.” The metaverse will require high-resolution images, he says, because the viewer’s eyes are centimeters away from the augmented-reality technology displays.</p><p>By developing perception-based algorithms, Bovik says, he hopes to “perceptually optimize the way videos are transmitted, compressed, and displayed in VR and AR.” </p><h2>Image processing at IEEE</h2><p>Bovik says he joined IEEE as a student member so he could access the organization’s journals. Maintaining that access is why he continues to be a member, he says.</p><p>He frequently attends IEEE conferences, where he has met engineers who have become his lifelong friends and mentors, he says. He often brings his students along. “I used to call the opportunity to go to a conference with me the <em>Alan Bovik Motivational System</em>,” he says, laughing.</p><p>Because he believed that image processing was going to have “a great feature,” he says, he helped launch the <a href="https://2022.ieeeicip.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE International Conference on Image Processing</a> and the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=83" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</em></a>. He is the publication’s longest-serving editor-in-chief.</p><p>“When I helped form <em>Transactions </em>in 1991, not many people understood the future applications of image processing,” Bovik says. “The technology seemed like something out of a science-fiction novel, but now it’s everywhere.”</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spectrum.ieee.org/alan-bovik-profile</guid><category>Ieee member news</category><category>Profiles</category><category>Image processing</category><category>Video compression</category><category>Type:ti</category><dc:creator>Joanna Goodrich</dc:creator><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-of-alan-bovik.jpg?id=30849849&amp;width=980"></media:content></item><item><title>Where the President-Elect Candidates Stand on Key Issues</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/where-the-president-elect-candidates-stand-on-key-issues</link><description><![CDATA[

President <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-presidents-note-june-2022" target="_self">Ray Liu</a> asked <a href="https://candidates.ieee.org/candidates/nominees/thomas-m-coughlin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thomas M. Coughlin</a>, <a href="https://candidates.ieee.org/candidates/nominees/kazuhiro-kosuge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kazuhiro Kosuge</a>, <a href="https://candidates.ieee.org/candidates/nominees/kathleen-a-kramer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kathleen A. Kramer</a>, and <a href="https://candidates.ieee.org/candidates/nominees/maike-luiken/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maike Luiken</a> questions submitted by members on issues important to them. </p><p>The candidates were asked about their plans for increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion at IEEE; expanding science, technology, engineering, and math education programs; and ways to attract and retain members. They also spoke about IEEE’s role in addressing the global climate crisis.</p><p>The candidates were given 90 seconds to answer each question. The following is a summary of some of their answers. Both events are available <a href="https://engage.ieee.org/June-IEEE-PE-Panel-Sign-Up.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on demand</a> on IEEE.tv.</p><h2>Increasing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h2><p>IEEE is committed to increasing DEI within the organization as well as in the engineering profession as a whole. How the organization will go about doing so was top of mind for some members.</p><p>Coughlin said diversity gives the organization “strength and multiple perspectives,” and he said he believes that is “important for IEEE members to be able to develop technology to help solve the world’s problems.” One of his goals, he said, is to increase the number of women who volunteer and hold leadership positions.</p><p>Kramer said one of her priorities should she be elected would be to make inclusivity at IEEE more effective and equitable for “diverse and global members as the organization advances technology.” She said the organization needs to understand just how diverse and inclusive IEEE regions and sections are and make them “accountable for increasing their efforts.”</p>
<p>Coughlin and Kramer serve on a committee in the IEEE Santa Clara Valley (Calif.) Section that is working to incentivize the chapters to add more female speakers at their events.</p><p>Luiken said gender diversity within IEEE is improving but said the organization’s leaders need to “keep their eyes open” to what other types of diversity—including age, cultural, and geographic—need to be increased within the organization. If elected, she said, she will focus on increasing the number of women who become life members because, she said, right now women make up only 2 percent of that membership designation. (To achieve “life” status, a member must be at least 65 years old and have been a member of IEEE for such a period of time that the sum of their age and their years of membership equals or exceeds 100.)</p><p>Kosuge said IEEE sections and regions play an important role in increasing diversity and inclusion within the organization. He would tailor IEEE’s strategies for increasing DEI to each region so that they better respect local cultures.</p><h2>IEEE’s Role in Preuniversity Education</h2><p>Kramer said her main priority as president-elect would be to inspire and engage the next generation of IEEE members. She acknowledged that the organization has been increasing such efforts but said she wants to do more, as she believes it’s essential for IEEE to play a role in preuniversity education.</p><p>Coughlin praised current IEEE programs such as TryEngineering, which provides teachers, parents, and students with a variety of educational resources including hands-on classroom activities. But, he said, IEEE also should produce educational materials for 3- and 4-year-olds. One example he shared was the IEEE science-kit program being offered at libraries in Region 4. The kits teach elementary school pupils what engineers do, as well as how to code, build robots, design video games, and create animations.</p><p>“We need to show [schoolchildren] the value of a professional society when they are young,” Coughlin said.</p><p>He said he also wants IEEE to support STEM competitions and events held by other organizations such as First Robotics and the Maker Faire. In the First Robotics competitions, student teams design, program, and build robots. At Maker Faire conventions, people engage in hands-on DIY and STEM activities.</p><p>Luiken agreed with Coughlin about the importance of making educational materials available earlier to youngsters. She said she also wants to give members more opportunities to go into classrooms and share their expertise through talks or hands-on activities. She said the organization should offer more resources to teachers.</p><p>Kosuge reiterated that IEEE has many “amazing” educational programs, and he said he wants to make them available globally and in multiple languages.</p><p>The candidates were asked how IEEE could do a better job of encouraging children from underrepresented groups and underserved communities to pursue a STEM career.</p><p>Kramer said IEEE needs to offer more mentorship opportunities.</p><p>Kosuge said the organization should start at the local level. Chapters and sections could host events or go to schools to engage students.</p><p>Luiken pointed out that several such programs already exist, such as IEEE REACH, a program that provides teachers with resources to help them explain the history of technology and the roles played by engineers. She said the program should increase its efforts to distribute the materials more widely. She added that IEEE “needs to work with other organizations around the world, such as UNESCO, to make the materials available to underprivileged communities.”</p><p>Coughlin agreed and said IEEE should be collaborating with groups such as the U.S. National Society of Black Engineers to conduct outreach programs.</p><h2>Attracting and Retaining Members</h2><p>One of Kosuge’s priorities would be to ensure IEEE’s products and services meet members’ needs—which he believes would help with retention. One of his plans would be to offer services in languages other than English. Many lectures, courses, and publications are offered only in English, he noted. He said that offering publications and services in other languages would not only help IEEE attract new members but also retain current ones.</p><p>Coughlin said it’s critical to attract and engage student members because the average age of IEEE members has been increasing. If he could accomplish one thing as president-elect, he said, it would be to make the organization valuable to the next generation of engineers. He said he plans to do so by establishing more local sections and chapters to show young engineers the value of being a member. He suggested that IEEE should sponsor career fairs at universities to attract young engineers.</p><p>“If they got a job because of the career fair,” he said, “they may have a bigger interest in becoming a member.”</p><p>Kramer said that to retain members, IEEE needs to change the way it communicates with them about membership.</p><p>“Membership has become a cost rather than a value,” she said. </p><p>Luiken suggested that the organization personalize its interaction with its members.</p><p>All the candidates weighed in with suggestions on how to better engage industry professionals. Kosuge said one way is to offer continuing education courses designed for engineers working in industry.</p><p>Coughlin agreed that such courses are important because “technology is changing all the time, and we need to address that.” Another one of his strategies is for IEEE to hold senior member elevation events at companies.</p><p>If Kramer becomes president-elect, she said, she will develop a strategy to increase IEEE’s member engagement.</p><p>Luiken said that to better connect with engineers, IEEE needs to understand what they value and what their goals are.</p><p>“Common goals give the organization an opportunity to engage with students, industry professionals, and young professionals,” she said. </p><p>She added that she wants to create a program whereby IEEE members—in industry and academia—work with local organizations and government agencies to develop goals.</p><h2>Tackling Climate Change</h2><p>How IEEE can help address the climate crisis was a popular topic at both forums.</p><p>Luiken said one of her goals would be to “mobilize IEEE to help answer the challenges of climate change and build a more sustainable planet.” She wants to create more opportunities for members to share their technical know-how with the world—which she said would “make a true difference.”</p><p>“Knowledge breeds responsibility,” she said, “and it’s our responsibility to serve.”</p><p>Coughlin said IEEE could increase its climate-change impact by increasing its outreach.</p><p>“We need to engage with other parts of the world and other organizations such as the Engineering Change Lab–USA,” he said. “This would help us address climate change and help other organizations see us as a valuable resource.” Engineers and technical organizations use the Engineering Change Lab as a platform to share their perspectives and collaborate on projects.</p><p>Coughlin noted that an IEEE ad hoc committee on climate change recently was formed. He reiterated the fact that the organization has the capabilities to impact public policy on climate change worldwide and that “members can be important agents on technical details necessary to deal with the global threat.”</p><p>Kramer agreed with Coughlin that increasing IEEE’s outreach is key. The organization needs to play a role in directing the technical aspects of sustainable development and be involved in creating policy, she said.</p><p>Kosuge said he wants to create a technology road map to provide government agencies and other organizations with steps to tackle the climate crisis.</p><p>To learn more about the candidates and to read their position statements, visit the <a href="https://candidates.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE President-Elect Candidates website</a>.</p><p>The annual <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-institute/ieee-news/voting-in-ieee-election-starts-in-august" target="_self">IEEE election</a> process begins on 15 August.

</p><h2>Supporting and Opposing Statements</h2><p>Members have been discussing and sharing their views on the proposed amendment on the <a href="https://ieee-collabratec.ieee.org/app/community/1355/IEEE-Constitutional-Amendment-Article-XIV-Amendments-Discussion-Forum/activities" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Collabratec</a> discussion forum. To ensure a collaborative environment, the forum is moderated by the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/whatis/election_oversight_committee.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Election Oversight Committee</a>.</p><p>These two statements, along with a link to the discussion forum, will accompany the proposed amendment on the IEEE Annual Election Ballot. </p><p>In Support Statement: The proposed amendment reflects changes in IEEE membership and in the emergence of global electronic communications. In 1963 IEEE had 150,000 members, 93 percent of which were in today’s Regions 1-6 in the U.S., and electronic communications were almost non-existent. Today IEEE has over 400,000 members, with approximately 1/3 in Regions 1-6, 1/3 in Region 10, and 1/3 in Regions 7, 8, and 9, and global, personal electronic communication is instant and ubiquitous. </p><p>Given the evolution of global membership distribution and the enablement of electronic communications and IEEE electronic petitions, IEEE is today able to ensure equity across all Regions and encourage deeper membership engagement through the requirement that every Region have a voice in proposed constitutional changes, without the great burden of collecting paper signatures. The proposed amendment ensures that future proposed constitutional changes reflect global member interests in a global organization, encourages professional collaboration across regional boundaries, and results in a more balanced, equitable, and scalable IEEE that will keep pace with change, both in global membership and relevant technologies, and continue to support the careers and technical lives of our members.</p><p> In Opposition Statement: The IEEE Board of Directors (BoD) is correct to assert that “IEEE’s Constitution is IEEE’s highest-level governance document that affects all Members and rarely should change.” As such, no change should be made unless substantial evidence is provided that the Constitution has a critical flaw that needs fixed. Such evidence was not provided, and so the proposed amendment should be rejected.</p><p>No evidence was provided that the current Constitution is resulting in a large number of member-initiated petitions. If such petitions are currently rare, then the proposed amendment to make the requirements much more onerous will make it impossible for a member to bring an amendment to the ballot.</p><p>The proposed amendment will require collecting over 3,000 signatures, which is nearly impossible given the time required to locate, contact, communicate with, and discuss with so many members. The proposed 0.333 percent requirement per region will make member-initiated petitions impossible, given the broad geographical locations and the wide variety of languages spanned in the countries covered in the regions. To place an amendment on the ballot would require such an extensive investment in time and finances that only the very rich would have a chance of bringing an amendment to the ballot.</p><p>Members can participate in the forum until it closes at 11:59 EDT on 14 August. It will become accessible to members in “read only” mode when balloting for the 2022 IEEE Annual Election begins on 15 August.</p><h2>More Information on the 2022 Election</h2><p>To adopt this amendment, an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all ballots cast is required, provided that the total number of those voting is at least 10 percent of all IEEE members who are eligible to vote on record as of 30 June 2022.

<a href="https://netlib3.cs.utk.edu/utk/people/JackDongarra/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jack Dongarra</a>’s dream job growing up was to teach science at a public high school in Chicago.
</p><p>
	“I was pretty good in math and science, but I wasn’t a particularly good student,” Dongarra says, laughing.
</p><p>
	After he graduated high school, there was only one university he wanted to attend:<a href="https://www.csu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Chicago State</a>. That’s because, he says, it was known for “churning out teachers.” Chicago State accepted his application, and he decided to major in mathematics.
</p><hr/><p>
	His physics professor suggested that Dongarra apply for an internship at the<a href="https://www.anl.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Argonne National Laboratory</a>, in Lemont, Ill., a nearby U.S. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Department of Energy</a> science and engineering research center. For 16 weeks he worked with a group of researchers designing and developing<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EISPACK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> EISPACK</a>, a package of Fortran routines that compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices—calculations common in scientific computing.
</p><p>
	Dongarra acknowledges he didn’t have a background in or knowledge of eigenvalues and eigenvectors—or of linear algebra—but he loved what he was doing. The experience at Argonne, he says, was transformative. He had found his passion.
</p><p>
	“I thought it was a cool thing to do,” he says, “so I kept pursuing it.”
</p><h3>About Jack Dongarra</h3><br/><p><strong></strong><strong>Employer: </strong>University of Tennessee, Knoxville</p><p><strong>Title: </strong>Professor emeritus, computer science</p><p><strong>Member grade: </strong>Life Fellow</p><p><strong>Alma mater: </strong>Chicago State University</p><p>
	The IEEE Life Fellow has since made pioneering contributions to numerical algorithms and libraries for linear algebra, which allowed software to make good use of high-performance hardware. His open-source software libraries are used in just about every computer, from laptops to the world’s fastest supercomputers.
</p><p>
	The libraries include basic linear algebra subprograms (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BLAS</a>), the linear-algebra package <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LAPACK</a>, parallel virtual machines (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Virtual_Machine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PVMs</a>), automatically tuned linear algebra software (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatically_Tuned_Linear_Algebra_Software" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ATLAS</a>), and the high-performance conjugate gradient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPCG_benchmark" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">(HPCG)</a> benchmark.
</p><p>
	For his work, he was honored this year with the 2021<a href="https://amturing.acm.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> A.M. Turing Award</a> from the<a href="https://www.acm.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Association for Computing Machinery</a>. He received US $1 million as part of the award, which is known as the Nobel Prize of computing.
</p><p>
			“When I think about previous Turing Award recipients, I’m humbled to think about what I’ve learned from their books and papers,” Dongarra says. “Their programming languages, theorems, techniques, and standards have helped me develop my algorithms.
		</p><p>
			“It’s a tremendous honor to be this year’s recipient. The award is a recognition by the computer-science community that the contributions we are making in high-performance computing are important and have an impact in the broader computer-science community and science in general.”
		</p><p>
			Dongarra didn’t end up teaching science to high school students. Instead, he became a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the<a href="https://www.utk.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> University of Tennessee</a> in Knoxville, where he taught for 33 years. The university recently named him professor emeritus.
		</p><h2>Entrepreneurial Spirit</h2><p>
	After graduating from Chicago State in 1972 with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, Dongarra went on to pursue a master’s degree in computer science at the<a href="https://www.iit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Illinois Institute of Technology</a>, also in Chicago. While there he worked one day a week for Argonne with the same team of researchers. After he got his degree in 1973, the lab hired him full time as a researcher.
</p><p>
	With encouragement from his colleagues to pursue a Ph.D., he left the lab to study applied mathematics at the<a href="https://www.unm.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> University of New Mexico</a> in Albuquerque. He honed his knowledge of linear algebra there and began working out algorithms and writing software.
</p><p>
	He returned to Argonne after getting his doctorate in 1980 and worked there as a senior scientist until 1989, when he got the opportunity to fulfill his dream of teaching.
</p><p>
	He was offered a joint position teaching computer science at the University of Tennessee and conducting research at the nearby<a href="https://www.ornl.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> which, like Argonne, is a Department of Energy facility.
</p><p>
	“It was time for me to try out some new things,” he says. “I was ready to try my hand at academia.”
</p><p>
	He says Oak Ridge operated in a similar way to Argonne, and the culture there was more or less the same.
</p><p>
	“The challenge,” he says, “was becoming a university professor.”
</p><p class="pull-quote">"The Turing Award is a recognition by the computer science community that the contributions we are making in high-performance computing are important, and have an impact in the broader computer science community and science in general.”</p><p>University culture is very different from that at a government laboratory, he says, but he quickly fell into the rhythm of the academic setting.
</p><p>
	Although he loved teaching, he says, he also was attracted to the opportunity the university gave its instructors to work on technology they are passionate about.
</p><p>
	“You follow your own path and course of research,” he says. “I’ve prospered in that environment. I interact with smart people, I have the ability to travel around the world, and I have collaborations going on with people in many countries.
</p><p>
	“Academia gives you this freedom to do things and not be constrained by a company’s drive or its motivation. Rather, I get to work on what motivates me. That’s why I’ve stayed in academia for so many years.”

	Dongarra founded the university’s<a href="https://www.icl.utk.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Innovative Computing Laboratory</a>, whose mission is to provide tools for high-performance computing to the scientific community. He also directs the school’s <a href="https://citr.utk.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Center for Information Technology Research</a>.
</p><p>
	He is now a distinguished researcher at Oak Ridge, which he calls “a wonderful place, with its state-of-the-art equipment and the latest computers.”
</p><h2>Software for Supercomputers</h2><p>
	It was working in creative environments that led Dongarra to come up with what many describe as world-changing software libraries, which have contributed to the growth of high-performance computing in many areas including artificial intelligence, data analytics, genomics, and health care.
</p><p>
	“The libraries we designed have basic components that are needed in many areas of science so that users can draw on those components to help them solve their computational problems,” he says. “That software is portable and efficient. It has all the attributes that we want in terms of being understandable and providing reliable results.”
</p><p>
	He’s currently working on creating a software library for the world’s fastest supercomputer, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/frontier-exascale-supercomputer" target="_self">Frontier</a>, which recently was installed at the Oak Ridge lab. It is the first computer that can process more than 1 quintillion operations per second.
</p><h2>Computer-Science Recognition</h2><p>
	Dongarra has been an IEEE member for more than 30 years.
</p><p>
	“I enjoy interacting with the community,” he says in explaining why he continues to belong. “Also I enjoy reading <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> and journals that are relevant to my specific field.”
</p><p>
	He has served as an editor for several IEEE journals including <a href="https://proceedingsoftheieee.ieee.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Proceedings of the IEEE</em></a>, <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/ca" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>IEEE Computer Architecture Letters</em></a>, and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=71" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems</em></a>.
</p><p>
	Dongarra says he’s a big promoter of IEEE meetings and workshops, especially the<a href="https://sc22.supercomputing.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis</a>, sponsored by ACM and the<a href="http://computer.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> IEEE Computer Society</a>, of which he is a member. He’s been attending the event every year since 1988. He has won many awards at the conference for his papers.
</p><p>
	“That conference is really a homecoming for the high-performance computing community,” he says, “and IEEE plays a major role.”
</p><p>
	IEEE is proud of Dongarra’s contributions to computing and has honored him over the years. In 2008 he received the first<a href="http://www.ieee-tcsc.org/achievement.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> IEEE Medal of Excellence in Scalable Computing</a>. He also received the 2020 <a href="https://www.eecs.utk.edu/jack-dongarra-selected-to-receive-the-2020-ieee-computer-societys-computer-pioneer-award/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Computer Pioneer Award</a>, the 2013<a href="https://awards.acm.org/kennedy/award-winners" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> ACM/IEEE Ken Kennedy Award</a>, the 2011<a href="https://www.computer.org/volunteering/awards/babbage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> IEEE Charles Babbage Award</a> and the 2003<a href="https://www.sighpc.org/celebrate/sid-fernbach-award" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Sidney Fernbach Award</a>.
</p><p>
	“I’m very happy and proud to be a member of IEEE,” he says. “I think it provides a valuable service to the community.”
