&quot;Cognitive behavior specialists are always working to reduce traumatic memories and flashbacks. In line with that mission, professor Emily Holmes began researching a new idea on how to lower the occurrence and severity of these flashbacks via an experimental preventive care method -  one that uses Tetris to engage with a patient's mind in hopes to affect how long-term traumatic memories are formed. But is this method &quot;too good to be true?&quot;

How do you create emotion and heartbreak with math? Video games can create meaningful player interactions and connections with characters but we need to stop treating them like trophies. Instead, we need immersion that makes you connect with the character to make them feel more real in the world around you. So sit back and let us drop some mathematical knowledge into your game's next design!

   <media:description>Welcome Extra Historians to Lies, where we talk about the mistakes we made and the details we couldn't quite squeeze into our Eleanor of Aquitaine Series. With questions like, Why wasn't Eleanor in the Robin Hood stories? Did Eleanor really dress as an amazon during the Crusade? And Why were there so many odd deaths like tripping over a pig during this time period?
