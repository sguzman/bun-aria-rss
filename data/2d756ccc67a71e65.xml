      <description>Netflix added 15.8 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2020, showing in no small way that it is still the dominant streaming service (2:07). We wonder whether services like HBO Max and NBC's Peacock even stand a chance of catching up (20:09). Plus, we break down the ‘Devs’ season finale and reflect on the season as a whole (37:35).

      <title>Hollywood Dealmaking Doesn’t Stop, Even If Production Does. Plus That 'Better Call Saul Scene' and Rosario Dawson on the 'Briarpatch' Finale. | The Watch</title>
      <description>Andy reflects on his time making ‘Briarpatch’ after the season finale aired this week (1:06). Production on most TV shows has ground to a halt due to COVID-19, but that doesn’t mean that Hollywood dealmaking is slowing down (15:42). We talk about that electric scene in the penultimate episode of ‘Better Call Saul’ (28:00) and give some immediate reactions to the first episode of ‘Mrs. America’ (38:33). Finally, Chris and Andy are joined by some of the cast from ‘Briarpatch’ (50:59).

      <title>The Magic of a Live Instagram Beats Battle, Plus ‘Run’ and ‘Devs’ | The Watch</title>
      <description>On Saturday night DJ Premier and RZA faced off on Instagram Live for a two-hour beats battle. It might be the most fun we’ve had in a long time and shows how content has evolved during this time of social distancing (1:59). HBO’s newest show ‘Run’ is a Merritt Wever showcase (26:03), and we’ve finally figured out the key to enjoying ‘Devs’ (35:35). Plus, a conversation with Scott Teems, whose Western-thriller movie ‘The Quarry’ comes to VOD this Friday (52:12).

      <title>‘Better Call Saul’ S5E5 and How Reese Witherspoon Cracked the Celebrity TV Code | The Watch</title>
      <description>Social distancing is making us appreciate TV in a new light (1:06). In the fifth episode of ‘Better Call Saul,’ the show showcases Jimmy and Kim’s relationship in a way that stands in contrast to Walter and Skylar’s relationship in ‘Breaking Bad’ (15:23). And Reese Witherspoon’s character in ‘Little Fires Everywhere’ is very similar to her character in ‘Big Little Lies,’ but maybe that’s the point (30:32).

      <title>Breaking Down the First Episode of ‘The Mandalorian’ and Inside the Launch of Disney+ | The Watch</title>
      <description>‘The Mandalorian’ premiered this week, and although we have a lot of mixed feelings about the pilot, we're willing to hang on (1:38). Then Bloomberg reporter Lucas Shaw takes us inside the launch of Disney+ (28:52) and tells us why we shouldn’t be calling this the “streaming wars” (58:28). Plus: We break down what may be the most controversial episode of ‘Survivor’ in the history of the show (1:10:56).

Host: Chris Ryan
Guests: Andy Greenwald, Lucas Shaw, and Riley McAtee

The second season of ‘Big Little Lies’ felt like a seven-episode show that was dying to be 12 episodes long (41:26), and ‘Veronica Mars’ is back and playing hard on nostalgia (50:09).

      <title>Where Does Netflix Go From Here? Plus, ‘Survivor,’ Emmy Nominations, and ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ | The Watch</title>
      <description>The trailer for ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ dropped today and we’re incredibly hyped (0:44).

Plus, we break down the changes coming to ‘Survivor’ for the 40th season (46:17).

      <itunes:subtitle>The trailer for ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ dropped today and we’re incredibly hyped (0:44). The Emmy nominations seem disjointed and unrepresentative of the TV landscape (7:34), and Netflix reported major subscriber losses this week—is this a turning point for the streaming service or just a bump in the road (15:35)? Plus, we break down the changes coming to ‘Survivor’ for the 40th season (46:17).
