And it’s not likely that you’ll stumble upon enough great leaders to maintain the health and growth of your ministry. </p> <p>When we work with churches, we consistently see a tension with how to not only find potential leaders, but how to develop them, as well.  How do you take them to the next level and increase their capacity? </p> <p>In this episode, Tony and Paul Alexander, Executive Pastor of Sun Valley Community Church in Arizona, are digging into how effective leadership development really works in the context of the church.</p> <p>For the full episode transcript, links mentioned during the show, and to download the Leader Conversation Guide, visit this episode's Show Notes at <a href= "https://tonymorganlive.com/2019/11/13/leadership-development-with-paul-alexander-episode-119-the-unstuck-church-podcast/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">theunstuckgroup.com/episode119</a>.</p> <p><em>Join the Live Conversation on Social Media</em></p> <p>If you're listening on Wednesday, when the episode first releases, join the live conversation The Unstuck Group's team will be having on social media about this week's topic.

Less Noise.</em></a>, about how we can reframe our understanding of brand and communications for this decade.

But if you're developing leaders through small groups, that's discipleship that leads to multiplication. You can eventually send them out to start new groups or let them take over existing ones. Then you send out the original leaders as disciple makers to create more.</p> <p>In this episode, Tony Morgan interviews <a href="http://chrissurratt.com/">Chris Surratt</a>. Chris is an author, a ministry consultant at <a href="https://theunstuckgroup.com">The Unstuck Group</a>, and the Discipleship & Small Groups Specialist at <a href="https://www.lifeway.com/">Lifeway Christian Resources</a>.</p> <p>This is a conversation with practical tips for how you can equip group leaders to build effective, multiplying small groups.</p> <p>For the full episode transcript, links mentioned during the show, and to download the Leader Conversation Guide, visit this episode's Show Notes at <a href= "http://tonymorganlive.com/2019/06/19/small-groups-episode-98-the-unstuck-church-podcast/">theunstuckgroup.com/episode98</a>.</p> <p><em>Join the Live Conversation on Social Media</em></p> <p>If you're listening on Wednesday, when the episode first releases, join the live conversation The Unstuck Group's team will be having on social media about this week's topic.
