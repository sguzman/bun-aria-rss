God’s Word is for you and for now. That's why our community is here and always open to you. ]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><b>It’s our second week in 1 Thessalonians! Raechel and Amanda read the rest of the apostle Paul’s letter with Jonathan Pitts, a pastor, author, and father of four. Having walked through his own season of grief recently, Jonathan speaks to the believer’s hope that death is not final and every loss will find its resurrection in Jesus.

The conversation lands with excitement about upcoming reading plans and encountering God through His Word in the new year.</b></p><p><b>This episode corresponds to the free, one-week Open Your Bibles reading plan found on the </b><a href='http://t.ly/1JyqM'><b>She Reads Truth app</b></a><b> and </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/'><b>SheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Shop the Open Your Bibles Reading Plan collection at </b><a href='https://www.shopshereadstruth.com/collections/advent-2020'><b>ShopSheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Show notes can be found at </b><a href='http://shereadstruth.com/podcast/qa-with-raechel-and-amanda'><b>shereadstruth.com/podcast/qa-with-raechel-and-amanda</b></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><b>For the final week of our Advent 2020 series, Raechel and Amanda talk with the very neighborly singer-songwriters, Drew and Ellie Holcomb. As the couple shares about the time they took cover from a tornado in the Schermerhorn Symphony Center, they also marvel at the audacity of God wrapping Himself in flesh to become one of us. Together, our musical guests play two carols and remind us that no matter where we find ourselves—whether the rim of the Grand Canyon or the stage of an empty auditorium—we can keep singing hope into the darkness.

No matter how challenging the passages may seem, they take comfort in this: all of God’s Word is good and profitable because it all helps us to know Him better. </b></p><p>Show notes can be found here: <a href='https://shereadstruth.com/podcast/proverbs-week-3-with-jackie-hill-perry/'>shereadstruth.com/podcast/proverbs-week-3-with-jackie-hill-perry/</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><b>For the second week of our Presence of God series, Raechel and Amanda talk with author, speaker, and exuberant student of God’s Word, Lisa Harper.

    <title>Promises of God Week 3 with Ellie Holcomb</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><b>During this third and final week of our Promises of God series, Raechel and Amanda are joined by special guest Ellie Holcomb.

    <title>Genesis Week 5 with Kelly Minter</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Raechel and Amanda are back with Kelly Minter to wrap up the last week of the SRT Genesis reading plan.

    <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Our Advent series continues with a deep-dive on the mystery of Immanuel, “God with us.” She Reads Truth’s content director, John Greco, joins Raechel and Amanda as they trace the presence of God through the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation.

And the group discusses the right-now and future hope we have in Jesus. </p><p><b>Read with Us: </b></p><p>This episode corresponds to Week 2 of the <a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/mourning-dancing/'>She Reads Truth Mourning &amp; Dancing reading plan</a> found on the <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/she-reads-truth-bible-devotional/id892128363'>She Reads Truth app</a> and <a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/mourning-dancing/'>SheReadsTruth.com</a>. </p><p><a href='https://www.shopshereadstruth.com/collections/mourning-dancing'>Mourning &amp; Dancing Study Book </a></p><p><b>Open Your Bibles: (passages referenced in this episode) </b></p><p><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+9%3A14%E2%80%9317&amp;version=CSB'>Matthew 9:14–17</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A18&amp;version=CSB'>John 14:18</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ecc+3%3A1-8&amp;version=CSB'>Ecclesiastes 3:1–8</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+56%3A8&amp;version=CSB'>John 56:8</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16%3A25&amp;version=CSB'>Acts 16:25</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rev+21%3A3-5&amp;version=CSB'>Revelation 21:3–5</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+56:8&amp;version=CSB'>Psalm 56:8</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col+1%3A13&amp;version=CSB'>Colossians 1:13</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A68&amp;version=CSB'>John 6:68</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+50%3A20&amp;version=CSB'>Genesis 50:20</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A16-18&amp;version=CSB'>1 Thessalonians 5:16</a><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rev+21%3A3-5&amp;version=CSB'>–</a><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A16-18&amp;version=CSB'>18</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A20&amp;version=CSB'>John 16:20</a></p><p><b>Other Links: </b></p><p><a href='https://www.history.com/news/first-thanksgiving-colonists-native-americans-men'>Who Was at the First Thanksgiving?</a> (History.com article)<br/>“You never know how much you really believe anything until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of life and death to you.

    <description><![CDATA[<p><b>On this first-ever episode of the She Reads Truth podcast, founders Raechel Myers and Amanda Bible Williams go deep fast on topics of loss, grief, joy, and hope. How do celebration and sorrow coexist in the life of a believer? Does one cancel out the other? What does Scripture have to say about suffering? What does it mean to lament? Amanda reflects on her youngest son’s 11-month hospital stay, and Raechel shares about the role the Bible played in one of the darkest days of her life.
