    <description><![CDATA[<p>In today&apos;s special Books with Hooks, <b>Carly </b>and <b>CeCe </b>are joined by guest literary agent, <b>Jenni Ferrari-Adler</b> who represents Susie Yang (whose novel, <em>White Ivy, </em> was the #BookswithHooksBC pick for June).  Jenni helps Carly and CeCe evaluate three query letters, in the process discussing leaning into specificity;  sprinkling backstory info rather than dumping it in;  setting up your bombshell moments with the right information; and the importance of emotionality in sample pages.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In today&apos;s <b>Books with Hooks</b>, <b>Carly</b> and <b>CeCe </b>are joined by Kathy and Leila who have submitted their queries for critique.  During the segment, they discuss why it’s important to frame a memoir as ‘why does this book have to be out there for others?’; why it’s okay to not have your hook fully fleshed out in a memoir query because agents are there to help you finish the job; how, in non-fiction, the hook is what you’re delivering to the reader and so it’s something you dig to find, unlike in fiction; how your story can start in multiple places, depending on taste; how starting in story is always the best place to start, even in memoir; using first person to help yourself write third person close; watching out for characters that are too generic/cookie-cutter/cliche; and how to make readers connect with characters in dark stories by making them very human. <br/><br/>After which, <b>Bianca</b> chats with <b>Ashley Audrain</b>, author of <em>The Push,</em> and bookstagrammer, <b>Femi Omotade</b>, about inserting non-typical themes into a thriller; writing about things that could be triggering for an author; writing being a cathartic experience—not therapy, but therapeutic; and the process of having a book get optioned for film or TV.<br/><br/>Find us on our socials: <br/>Twitter: @TSNOTYAW @BiancaM_author @carlywatters @ceciliaclyra <br/>Instagram: @biancamarais_author @carlywatters @cece_lyra_agent @ the_shit_about_writing<br/>Facebook: @tsnotyaw<br/>Website: www.biancamarais.com<br/> Ashley Audrain can be found at www.ashelyaudrain.com and on Instagram at @ashleyaudrain and Twitter at @audrain<br/>Femi Omotade can be found on Instagram at @thebookalert</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&apos;s Books with Hooks segment, we have an author come onto the show to discuss her submission with us. In the segment, Carly and CeCe chat with Shari about linking multiple POV stories in a query letter; answering the &apos;why now?&apos; question; establishing what’s at stake for each POV character; how an offer implies a transaction, and how all of life is about power; being careful who you comp as that creates expectations; explaining the thematic pressures that affect characters; how regret is a passive emotion; and nailing entry and exit points in each chapter.<br/><br/>After which, Bianca chats with debut author of <em>The Tiger Mom&apos;s Tale</em>, Lyn Liao Butler, about how to find support as a debut novelist; debuting in a hostile climate; how much is out of your control as a debut author; revising a novel and changing POVs in the process; all the mistakes writers make with their first novels; the evolution of a rejected manuscript on its journey to publication; why reading is so important; how to use feedback and critique; and how to choose the right agent. </p>]]></description>
