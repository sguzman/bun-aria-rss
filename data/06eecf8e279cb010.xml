      <title>How You Can Avoid Asking THIS Question About God | Sadie Robertson Huff + Kathie Lee Gifford</title>
      <description>Sadie is delighted to speak with TV talk show veteran, author, and actress Kathie Lee Gifford. Kathie Lee is passionate about what she's learned from so many years in the entertainment industry, how her faith has kept her grounded, and why she considers Hollywood to be her mission field. She shares encouragement for anyone feeling discouraged about unrealized dreams and talks about why asking how a loving God could allow something bad to happen is the wrong question. Plus, for the first time, Sadie gets lost in thought during the interview and it yields an incredible moment of revelation for both women.

      <title>A Messy Conversation About Modesty | Sadie Robertson Huff &amp; Korie Robertson </title>
      <description>Sadie &amp; Korie dive into the tricky topic of modesty. But first, what does "modesty" even mean? Is it a strict set of rules that must be followed about what you wear? Does it only refer to your outward appearance? Sadie shares three questions we should ask ourselves as we get ready for the day or to go out for the evening — but these questions can apply to EVERY part of our lives, not just how we dress. And "modesty" isn't just about ourselves but about how we treat others. Sadie talks about how hurtful it was to receive so much backlash from other Christians regarding what she wore on "Duck Dynasty" and "Dancing with the Stars." It ALL comes back to the heart!

      <description>This is the very best of Sadie &amp; Christian's relationship advice! Is he the one? How important is it to wait for marriage? If someone is ghosting you, how should you respond? How do you get past awkward moments when you're dating — or even newly married? Sadie and Christian share a bunch of encouragement for dating couples as you're tempted to cross physical boundaries, how to wisely respond when your significant other's social media feeds aren't full of good things, and how to encourage each other as you draw closer to the Lord and get to know each other better. Plus, what if you disagree on which movies to watch? How do you help your partner guard his heart without nagging him or even becoming hostile? Christian also drops some great advice for how to get past the first ... farts in a relationship. No shame!

      <title>God Can't Bless Who You're *Trying* To Be | Sadie Robertson Huff &amp; Taya Gaukrodger</title>
      <description>Songwriter and worship leader Taya Gaukrodger joins Sadie to talk about why it makes no sense to be someone else in this world, fake humility, and why we all need to stop doubting God's ability. Plus, Taya and Sadie reminisce about their favorite LO Sister Conference moments. Taya encourages us to always remember this: If you can't be fully who you are in front of the Lord, then where CAN you be yourself in this world? Taya challenges us to live not just for the mountaintop moments but to honor God even in the mundane, everyday moments of our lives. And Sadie and Taya both reveal why "honey" is such an important word to them. Taya's debut album, "TAYA," is available now.

      <title>Is It Really OK for Christians to Get Tattoos? | Sadie Robertson Huff &amp; Korie Robertson</title>
      <description>Sadie and her mom, Korie Robertson, tackle one of the top questions they get: "Should Christians get tattoos?" Korie shares why she was initially surprised when Sadie wanted to get her first tattoo, and Sadie explains the reason why she wanted "fearless" on her inner wrist. They reveal the significance of their matching wave tattoos — and why Denmark was the best place to get them. Sadie encourages anyone who — like her — has struggled with legalistic tendencies, and they dive into the Word to really examine what the Lord said about tattoos in the Old and New Testaments.

      <title>What You Want to Hear vs. What You NEED to Hear | Sadie Robertson Huff &amp; Cody Carnes</title>
      <description>Sadie is delighted to welcome worship leader and songwriter of some of her all-time favorite worship songs, Cody Carnes, to the podcast. Cody shares how he and his wife — worship leader &amp; songwriter, Kari Jobe — first started dating, and Sadie agrees that when you're finding the person you'll marry, it's so important that your people in your life love them too. Cody talks about he and Kari writing "The Blessing" which was released just as the world was going into lockdown, and how he's still amazed at the amount of blessings that have resulted from that song. Cody also talks about coming out of a time of chaos, where seemingly all truth is questioned, that Christians have a special privilege in knowing they can trust the Lord at His Word, when He says who He is, what He did, and what He's promised. Cody and Sadie share encouragement that God IS good and that He's the only constant and consistent thing we can count on in this world.

      <itunes:summary>Sadie is delighted to welcome worship leader and songwriter of some of her all-time favorite worship songs, Cody Carnes, to the podcast. Cody shares how he and his wife — worship leader &amp; songwriter, Kari Jobe — first started dating, and Sadie agrees that when you're finding the person you'll marry, it's so important that your people in your life love them too. Cody talks about he and Kari writing "The Blessing" which was released just as the world was going into lockdown, and how he's still amazed at the amount of blessings that have resulted from that song. Cody also talks about coming out of a time of chaos, where seemingly all truth is questioned, that Christians have a special privilege in knowing they can trust the Lord at His Word, when He says who He is, what He did, and what He's promised. Cody and Sadie share encouragement that God IS good and that He's the only constant and consistent thing we can count on in this world.

      <title>Here's Why You Need to Stop 'Manifesting' ANYTHING in Your Life | Sadie Robertson Huff &amp; Chad Veach</title>
      <description>Sadie welcomes author and pastor of Zoe Church Chad Veach to the podcast. Chad shares why worrying is never the answer and why you need to stop "manifesting" — instead of looking to "the universe" for answers, why not focus on the One who created the universe? Sadie and Chad outline practical steps for how to start praying if that's not part of your daily life and remind us that the point of prayer is to connect with God. Prayer is an invitation into intimacy, so we can talk to Him like a friend! Chad also walks us through what he's learned about the physical ways your brain is transformed when you regularly pray. Prayer helps us get a new perspective. And remember: God doesn't want anything from you, He wants YOU. Your relationship with God is exactly that — a relationship!

      <title>God Is Not Finished With You Yet | Sadie Robertson Huff | Katy Nichole</title>
      <description>Sadie is so excited to chat with singer-songwriter Katy Nichole who recently won her first K-LOVE Fan Award for Worship Song of the Year. She shares the yearslong battle she's had with scoliosis, depression, and anxiety and how keeping a prayer journal has literally changed her life. Katy recounts the day her video singing the chorus of "In Jesus Name" blew up on TikTok and how she maintains a heart of worship in every situation. Katy and Sadie share encouragement that we are ALL the same. Our jobs might be different, but we're all the same! And finally, a reminder that being famous — being TikTok famous — will NOT give you the desires of your soul!

      <title>You Are Loved in the Middle of Your Mess | Sadie Robertson Huff | Sisters &amp; Friends</title>
      <description>Sadie's good friend — and doppelgänger — Lydia Dozier has some solid advice for us about how her good friend started pursuing a relationship with her and how her heart changed about him. She also talks about how she went from a no-party girl to a never-miss-the-party girl and when she finally encountered the Lord and had her life transformed. Sadie and Lydia share hope for anyone who hates the cycle they find themselves in but can't find a way to stop. And Lydia describes how surrendering her life to the Lord led her to a role at Fellowship for Christian Athletes working with high school students. May the Lord give us eyes to see and ears to hear, the good and faithful way He cares for us every day.

      <title>If God Leads You to Do Something, He'll Shape the Space Around It | Sadie Robertson Huff &amp; Chris Tomlin</title>
      <description>Chris Tomlin has recorded 31 albums, and it cannot be overstated just how much influence he's had on the world of worship music. Sadie and Chris talk about the friend they have in common who encouraged them both when they were first starting out. Chris reminds us that our faith isn't 30 minutes old — Christians from ALL generations will join together to sing the song of heaven. They also discuss how important your inner circle is and share a good reminder that even though you might have plans, it's ultimately the Lord who determines your steps. Plus, Chris describes his very first worship-leading experience and his epic proposal to his wife, Lauren. Chris Tomlin's new album, "Always," is available now.

        <![CDATA[<p>Chris Tomlin has recorded 31 albums, and it cannot be overstated just how much influence he's had on the world of worship music. Sadie and Chris talk about the friend they have in common who encouraged them both when they were first starting out. Chris reminds us that our faith isn't 30 minutes old — Christians from ALL generations will join together to sing the song of heaven. They also discuss how important your inner circle is and share a good reminder that even though you might have plans, it's ultimately the Lord who determines your steps.

      <title>It's Never Too Late To Reset &amp; Turn Your Life Back to God | Sadie Robertson Huff &amp; Craig Groeschel </title>
      <description>Craig Groeschel, founder and lead pastor of Life Church, talks with Sadie about leadership, pursuing your spouse, how you can attract the right people to you wherever you are, and why he's hesitant to try Christian's cold-plunge tub. He also reminds us that we can't be part-time followers of Christ and that everyone connects with the Lord in different ways, so stop worrying about what everyone else does! And Sadie serves up a challenge: Are you talking ABOUT God as much as you talk TO God?

      <title>My Postpartum Journey</title>
      <description>Today I’m sharing my postpartum struggles with body image, physical pain, "what ifs," anxiety, the battle between fear and joy, and so many other emotions that have flooded over me in the past several weeks. I want to share my story, but I also hope it’s inspiring to you in your own journey no matter if it’s postpartum or something else you’re walking through. And remember, the same God that was with us in the hospital room during Honey’s miraculous birth is the same God who is sitting with you right now.

      <title>Finding the Right Someone: How to Navigate Relationships Pt 1 </title>
      <description>Author and pastor Ben Stuart wrote the book on how to have a successful relationship — literally! Sadie and Christian started their relationship off on the right foot thanks to Ben’s book, "Single, Dating, Engaged, Married: Navigating Life and Love in the Modern Age." Ben talks through a few signs that your relationship may be heading in the wrong direction, not looking to other people for what you can only get from God, and the purpose of singleness and how it can be a gift. Ben and Sadie also discuss finding the right someone the right way and why sex is like a fire.

      <description>Songwriter and producer Nate Butler doesn't take himself too seriously, but he's dropping some serious wisdom as he and Sadie take on the tough issues of 2020. Nate reveals what God taught him during his intense experience with COVID-19, and he shares the advice he gave Sadie about never allowing the enemy to stoke racial fear and division. They discuss how to fight the good fight of faith — one that's not mixed with unforgiveness and hatred — and the difference between putting on your armor and putting on God's armor.
