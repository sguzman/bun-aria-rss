  "description": "It’s shark week! Or ‘spark’ week? Today we’re bringing you an episode of How to Save a Planet, in which Shayle steps into the shoes of a Shark Tank-style judge.\nThis episode is all about (drum-roll please): Storage!\n...Exciting, right? Ok, we’ll prove it to you. Each day, more and more of our electricity comes from intermittent renewables like wind and solar. To balance out our electric grid in the future, we’ll need new ways of storing extra energy, so we can still turn on our lights when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. This week, with help from Dr. Leah Stokes and Shayle Kann, we explore the wild world of energy storage, from a hidden underground lair to a piping hot thermos full of poison. And did we mention it’s a gameshow?\nGuests\n\n\nDr. Leah Stokes, Professor of Climate and Energy Policy at University of California, Santa Barbara\n\n\nShayle Kann, Climate Tech Investor at Energy Impact Partners\n\nLen Greene, Director of Government Affairs and Communications, FirstLight Power\n\n\nCurtis VanWalleghem, CEO of Hydrostor\n\n\nDr. Cristina Prieto, Professor of Engineering at the University of Seville\n\nCalls to Action\n\nLearn more about energy storage\n\nPumped Hydro\n\nCompressed Air\n\nMolten Salts\n\nAnd for a really wild one: check out Energy Vault\n\n\nLearn more about our electric grid, with our episodes How We Got our Grid and How We Get a Better One and Party Like It’s 2035\n\n\nWe still want to see your climate Venn diagrams!
