  "description": "<p>On the final BnB episode of 2021, Avery & Codie are joined by recurring guest host Ryan Quint to discuss one of the lesser known battles of the American Civil War. On December 20, 1861, the Confederate forces under General J.E.B. Stuart collided with a brigade of Pennsylvania Reserves at the small village of Dranesville in Fairfax County, Virginia. While the engagement was brief, and small in terms of troops engaged, it was the first time that U.S. forces had defeated the Confederates in Northern Virginia. For a victory-starved North, Dranesville was a light in the darkness as the first year of the war came to a close. Join Avery, Codie & Ryan in exploring this engagement and its significance to the larger context of the Civil War. Enjoy!</p>",
