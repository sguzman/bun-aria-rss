  "description": "Samantha Gongol and Jeremy Lloyd are songwriting duo Marian Hill and they are here to share their annoyingly sharp insights on music. They come bearing the wistful pop of Lorde's \"Ribs,\" and we deconstruct its primordial roots in classical composers like Scelsi, Beethoven and Haydn. Then, we turn to Marian Hill's new single \"Differently\" to uncover the subtle musical shifts that outline a complex dialogue lurking among the track's sparse, funky textures.\nSongs Discussed:\nLorde - Ribs\nBroken Social Scene - Lover's Spit\nGiacinto Scelsi - Memories\nLudwig van Beethoven - 9th Symphony\nFranz Josef Haydn - Creation\nKid Rock - All Summer Long\nMiley Cyrus - Party in the USA\nMarian Hill - Mistaken\nMarian Hill - Differently\nLearn more about your ad choices.
