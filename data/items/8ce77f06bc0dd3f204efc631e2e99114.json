    "media:description": "Boxer engines are popular engines used in Subaru and Porsche cars, such as the Subaru WRX STi and Porsche 911 GT3. The engines have cylinders that lay flat (not to be confused with a 180 degree V engine), giving them a low center of gravity, and due to the design, they have low engine vibration. These unique engine designs are currently only used by Porsche, Subaru, and Toyota in production cars. \n\nMore videos on boxer engines:\nHow Boxer Engines Work - https://youtu.be/y5oRsvRH_Ig\nBoxer-4 vs Inline-4 - https://youtu.be/mgpDTVBeHOw\nBoxer Rumbe - https://youtu.be/SUiyNud1FX0\n\nSubscribe to Engineering Explained for more videos! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7\nRecommended Books & Car Products - http://amzn.to/2BrekJm\nEE Shirts! - http://bit.ly/2BHsiuo\n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA",
