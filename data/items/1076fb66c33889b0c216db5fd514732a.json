  "description": "In this episode of The Barron Report, host Paul Barron meets with Steve Simoni, the chief executive officer of Bbot, to explore how technology is transforming the restaurant guest experience.<br /><br />Three Key Points:<br /><br />Bbot allows restaurant customers—both in-store and at home—to order food and drinks from their phone. Guests do not have to wait for a menu, download an app, swipe their card, or even sign a receipt. Restaurants install the necessary Bbot hardware and signage, and guests pay on a website using their table ID.<br /><br />The Bbot platform offers restaurants a playbook for handling the marketing side of the business without breaking the bank. Small businesses tend to rely heavily on third parties without much reward. Bbot is able to support young and growing brands with a streamlined online ordering process that ensures restaurants a solid profit.<br /><br />According to Simoni, the average restaurant today uses about twelve different pieces of software to run their business. The goal for operators now is to take the time to consolidate, evaluating what tech is working and what tech is superfluous.<br /><br />Tweetable Quotes:<br /><br />“We built our platform to be open and integrated with other companies that are helping with marketing… the digital marketing game can be expensive if you do not know what you’re doing.” – Steve Simoni<br /><br />“Due to economics, third parties are forced to promote chain restaurants on their apps for more profit, which takes customers away from smaller mom and pops that third parties claim to drive orders to—so they’re not helping that much.” – Steve Simoni<br /><br />“All of these tech companies wouldn’t come up if the demand wasn’t there. The question is, how many of these companies can the demand sustain?” – Steve Simoni<br /><br />Industry veteran Paul Barron takes restaurant business insights to the next level. The restaurant industry isn't just the business of food. It's a cross-functioning, multivariate entity that touches almost every industry — after all, everyone needs to eat. So, why not learn from the greats from all businesses? Connect the dots, read between the lines, build innovative strategies, become a thought leader, get the inside scoop on trends and open your eyes to the full vision of restaurant and hospitality with The Barron Report.<br /><br />To keep listening to The Barron Report, check out the podcast on iTunes Now!",
