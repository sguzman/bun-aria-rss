  "description": "<p><strong>Tim Celek and Andrew Brownback have a rare shared experience: They've successfully navigated the passing of the baton from founding pastor of a thriving, growing church to successor who will lead that church for a new generation.</strong></p> <p>Tim had only recently closed the door on his 40s, when he—with that visionary knack for forward-thinking—started a conversation with his board about succession planning. (In his words, a \"spirited\" conversation followed.)</p> <p>Over about a decade, Tim and his team at The Crossing did their research, formed a plan, onboarded Tim's successor, identified the right timing and rolled out a communications plan.</p> <p>The result? <strong>One of the smoothest examples of pastoral succession we've seen</strong>, and a thriving church positioned for sustained health.</p> <p>In this episode, Tony interviews founding pastor, Tim, and current lead pastor, Andrew, to tell the story. </p> <p>This episode is packed with practical wisdom and recommended resources.
