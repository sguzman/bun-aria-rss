  "description": "<p>Can you feel the cold, wet squeak? When Girly Juice blogger, Dildorks podcaster, and kink author Kate Sloan sparks the attention of the gorgeous Matthew on Twitter, she can barely make eye contact with them. Soon this gorgeous suitor inundates our favorite bisexual submissive with gifts, long distance flights, spot-on role-play & ego-bolstering rope scenes - yet somehow, Matthew’s exquisite spankings leave her self-conscious and paranoid, rather than euphoric. This Secret Sex Spy seems a bit too ideally perverted and weird for her; what if it’s a trick? Or worse yet, what if it’s not? #Espionage #GoodGirl #Suspicious#OutOfMyLeague</p> <p> </p> <p>Song: ‘Spy in the House of Love’ (Was/Not Was)</p> <p> </p> <p>Episode Links</p> <p>Live Shows are Back!
