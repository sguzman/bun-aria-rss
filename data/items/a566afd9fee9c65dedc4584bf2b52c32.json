Frankl said man is driven by meaning.\n\nWhen the future is as unpredictable as it has been recently, we must dig for deeper, more long lasting fuel for our creative motivation. In this episode I want to encourage a mindset shift that can lead to insight into the heart of your work, as well as act as a creative prompt to unlock your latent creative potency!",
