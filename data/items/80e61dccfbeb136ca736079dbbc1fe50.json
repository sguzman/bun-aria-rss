Directed by Andrew Ahn and written by Joel Kim Booster, who also stars in the film, Fire Island explores the magic of queer spaces like the titular enclave—along with the class and race disparities that often beset them. The film, which also stars Bowen Yang, Margaret Cho, and Conrad Ricamora, is a gay resetting of Pride and Prejudice. Does it succeed? The hosts discuss this, and much more, in spoiler-filled detail.\nThis podcast was produced by June Thomas.\nIf you enjoyed this episode, please subscribe to Outward wherever you get your podcasts.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
