  "description": "This week, on the Colin and Samir Podcast, we’re joined by Danny Casale aka Coolman Coffeedan. Now we actually recorded this episode a few weeks ago and we are working on a YouTube video with Danny, but felt like right now was a good time to release it because Danny’s story is extremely inspiring and he built a lot of his career from his bedroom...which is where a lot of us are spending most of our time now. Danny is a NYC based artist who has gained popularity through his surreal, and poorly-drawn animations. He calls himself a Bad animator, but his bad animations have made there way on to the big screens at times square… he’s got 2M subscribers on YouTube, 2 Million on Instagram 1.5 Million followers on Facebook and another 1.3 Million on Tiktok, so clearly his animations connect with a lot of people. He recently released an album on Spotify\nAlthough he’s been uploading to Youtube for over 10 years for His style first took off in 2017 when he released an animation titled Snakes have Legs, which was basically a PSA for people to stop believing everything they read on the internet. The video has over 10 million views on Danny’s facebook and has been shared all over the internet. Spending the day with Danny was awesome, he’s a big inspiration to us, his message is strong and his style is so relatable. I would recommend checking him out on instagram before you listen to this so you can get a feel for his style, he even recently put out a song about washing your hands. We met Danny earlier this year at Samsung Unpacked and we quickly bonded over our mutual love of emo music… so if you’re into that too, tweet at us @colinandsamir",
