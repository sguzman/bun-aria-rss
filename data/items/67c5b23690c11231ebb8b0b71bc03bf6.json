And when there’s kids in the mix, these conversations can be even harder. We also hear from Professor Shantel Buggs—author of the study “Dating in the Time of #BlackLivesMatter”—who shares her findings from talking with with dozens of women about whether awareness of racial issues mattered when they were choosing a partner. <br>\n<br>\nThis mini-series of <em>The Stoop</em> is produced especially for <em>Showcase</em> from PRX’s Radiotopia.
