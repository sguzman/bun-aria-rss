  "description": "<p>First up, Charlie welcomes Pastor Jack Hibbs of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills, one of the bravest and smartest pastors in the country. Charlie previews his speaking event at Calvary Chapel Chino Hills' \"Futures Conference\" where Charlie will deliver a speech focused on prophecy, the Great Reset, and more. Jack and Charlie discuss how the core of Christian discipline is not to seek out comfort, but to be ready and prepared for Christ to return now—today or tomorrow—to enter into wherever God has called you, and why that might be exactly where there is the most need, not the most comfort. Finally, Charlie openly questions, can we trust our intelligence agencies? Was it Russia? Or was it a midterm operation to distract from domestic policy failures? </p><p><a href=\"http://www.charliekirk.com/support\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: http://www.charliekirk.com/support</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
