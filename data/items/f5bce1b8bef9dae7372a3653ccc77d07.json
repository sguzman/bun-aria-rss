  "description": "<p>This week's topic was inspired by a busy and stressful week for both of us - a week in which we had to learn, adapt, and employ what Alice calls \"just-in-time\" learning. Our discussion covers growing pains in both our art and our business. We discuss the importance of failure or mistakes (and how we learn from them) and debate Seth Godin's idea that sometimes we are struggling because we are in a dip and will soon start to come up out of it, while at other times we are struggling because we actually went into a cul-de-sac, from which we can never emerge. In this case, he suggests, the best course of action is to give up and find something else to do. In the end, we both lean towards the idea that learning and growing are essential, which makes growing pains not only inevitable but actually desirable. If you've ever send a marketing email with a dead link, started a project with no idea how to manage it, or spent years trying to make the wrong thing work, this episode is for you!</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Louise's Find Your Joy course opens at 6pm GMT on June 23rd - join at <a href=\"Sign up for our newsletters at:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p> <p><br></p> <p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p> <p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p> <p><br></p> <p>Follow us on Instagram:</p> <p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p> <p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p> <p><br></p> <p><em>Credits</em></p> <p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\">https://www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amandapickles.co.uk/\">Amanda Pickles website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dip-extraordinary-benefits-knowing-stick/dp/0749928301\">Seth Godin - The Dip</a></p>\n<p>See what Alice created for a virtual Open Studio event here: <a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/artistsathome/\">https://alicesheridan.com/artistsathome/</a></p>\n<p>If you enjoy the Art Juice podcast please vote for us in the Listener's Choice section!<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.britishpodcastawards.com/vote\">https://www.britishpodcastawards.com/vote</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Credits</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
