  "description": "<p>We're back after a travel week to discuss Taylor Swift's rerelease of Red, Bryce Hall being named the 'sexiest 22 year old', and Kendall Jenner getting backlash for her outfit to a wedding. We play a game where we analyze the People 'Sexy At Every Age' article and whether or not they got it right. Bri makes up her own laws which we coined a 'Chickenfry Law'. \n\nSupport our sponsors: \nTaki's Face The Intensity</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
