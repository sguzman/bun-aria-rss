  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Mike Erre is back for the second part of his conversation with Skye on the future of the church in America. This time they talk about the difference between “Cold War” Christianity and “Game of Thrones” Christianity. Plus, why does it feel like everything in the culture—including faith and politics—is being pushed to the extremes? What happened to the middle ground and can it be recovered? Also this week, the Ark Encounter amusement park is suing its insurance provider for not covering flood damage. Gay characters are becoming more common on children’s television which causes Phil to revisit Jerry Falwell’s crusade against Tinky Winky—the ambiguously gay Telletubbie. Plus, Beth Moore is on a mission to shine a light on the sexism and misogyny within the Southern Baptist Convention, but is there more than complementarian theology behind the criticism she’s now receiving?</p>",
