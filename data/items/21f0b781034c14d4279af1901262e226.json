  "description": "An Uber driver is fired for refusing to take a woman to get an abortion. I believe the driver is heroic. But should Uber have fired him? And does the woman have a legal case against the driver, as she claims? We’ll talk about it. Also, Charlize Theron says her three year old son discovered he was a girl. And do I lack sympathy for college graduates because I don’t want their loans forgiven? All of that and more on the show today. Date: 04-24-2019\nLearn more about your ad choices.
