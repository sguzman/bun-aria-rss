  "description": "<p>Diana Rodgers, RD, is a “real food” nutritionist and writer living on a working organic farm. She runs a clinical nutrition practice, hosts the <a href=\"https://sustainabledish.com/podcasts/\">Sustainable Dish Podcast</a>, and speaks internationally about human nutrition, sustainability, animal welfare and social justice. Together with <a href=\"https://robbwolf.com/\">Robb Wolf</a>, Diana has created Sacred Cow, a documentary film and book exploring the ways regenerative agriculture can lead to better health for humans, animals, and ecosystems. Far from being the destroyers of land, she argues, cattle can help bring it back from desertification.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"http://chrisryanphd.com/support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please consider supporting this podcast.</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intro music: “Brightside of the Sun,” by <a href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\">Basin and Range</a>; \"I Wish I Was a Cowby\" by S.E.
