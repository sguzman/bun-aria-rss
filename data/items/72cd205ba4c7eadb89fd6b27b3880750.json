  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear about how a cyber espionage campaign exploits a recently patched .NET vulnerability as Leviathan phishes with torpedo recovery programs. What does Pyongyang want in cyberspace? Apparently a lot of the same things it wants in physical space. Some observers think Putin thinks the Americans started that whole destabilization and delegitimation influence ops struggle. He's probably wrong, but there you go. Cutlet Maker malware jackpots ATMs. BoundHook stealth tool demonstrated. Minecraft malware got into Google Play. Ben Yelin from UMD CHHS with a follow up on President Trump’s executive orders. Guest is Dinah Davis from Code.Likeagirl.io with an update on their activities. Ransomware's still a threat, and a New York judge thinks the NYPD didn't get the memo about the importance of backup.\n Thanks for listening to the CyberWire. One of the ways you can support what we do is by visiting our sponsors.\n We read Recorded Future’s free intel daily, and we think you'll find it valuable, too.\n If you’d like to learn more about how small nuances in how artificial intelligence and machine learning are used can make a big difference, check out E8’s white paper.\n Interested in the latest research in cyber security? Our new Research Saturday podcast highlights research being done in industry, universities, and governments. Hear from people who are discovering threats, uncovering vulnerabilities, and devising the security measures to keep cyberspace as safe as it can be. Check it out.",
