  "description": "The Shutdown Fullcast heads to the home of Big Cow himself for our first ever ANIMAL DISASTERS episode. What kind of disasters?\n- The kind where someone decides \"a gun in a Publix\" is a solution\n- The kind that involve early 20th century Atlantic City\n- The kind where your Dad ends up putting multiple holes in the wall\n- The kind where a mascot becomes a serial killer\n- Tennessee Volunteers football\nAnd so forth. Somehow, Ryan forgot to bring up Noah at all on this episode! What an idiot. (Please note: this is a slightly shorter episode than usual because we cut out the Q&A portion of the show. You gotta show up in person if you want to learn those secrets, sucker.)\nWe are conducting an audience survey to better serve you. It takes no more than five minutes, and it really helps out the show. Please take our survey here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3X6WMNF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
