  "description": "Even if you have never walked the red carpet at the Met Gala, or sat in the front row of a Fashion Week runway, the notion of <em>fashion</em> is hard to escape. For some of us, what we wear – whether it's Gucci or the GAP–is about more than just the clothes on our bodies. <br/><br/>Fashion is often about who we are - our ideas, identity, and culture. For those who cover and create fashion, it can be a way to challenge and change the culture in ways that resonate beyond the red carpet and the runway. <br/><br/>Host Michel Martin speaks with designer Eileen Fisher, one of the first in the industry to introduce sustainable clothing production. She is stepping down as CEO of her self named company after 34 years. Kenya Hunt is stepping into the editor-in-chief role at Elle UK. She is the first Black woman to hold the position. Hunt talks about why she chose Lizzo for the magazine's September cover. <br/><br/>In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community. <br/><br/>Email us at considerthis@npr.org.<em>This episode was produced by Robert Baldwin III. It was edited by Jeanette Woods. Our executive producer is Natalie Winston.</em>",
