  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the cabal of James Comey, James Baker, Peter Strzok, and Lisa Page, should be brought into a Grand Jury to give testimony, and given the Donald Trump Treatment; they should have to turn over a million documents, be subpoenaed over and over again, and their associates, their accountants, their lawyers, their private businesses and their children should be subpoenaed as well. Speaker Nancy Pelosi should also provide her tax returns including her husband Paul Pelosi's income so they can be transparent with the American people when it comes to their business and finances, the same way they want Trump to be. Then, the FBI's story regarding the Christopher Steele Dossier paid for by the Hillary Campaign and the Democrat National Committee, is unraveling. It's now known that the Deputy Secretary of State typed a report citing the non-factual nature of the Steele Dossier and reported it to her seniors, this was put on the record well before the dossier was used to obtain any FISA warrants. Later, the Democrats continue decrying that contempt is sham a of sham and that they'll use the Sergeant-at-arms of the House to handcuff the Attorney General Barr. The so-called open-and-shut obstruction case was never brought because they had no case for obstruction. Now the left is twisting the law and abusing their power so that they can obtain Trump's taxes. Afterward, China continues surveilling their own people and rounding up Muslims, jailing them in concentration camps. These two million Muslims are being held in what they call re-education camps. Tariffs against Red China are necessary, they are our enemies and need to be treated that way.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
