Sign up today:</em></p><p>This week I’m joined by Jessica Moody, a PhD candidate at Kings College London whose work focuses on post-conflict Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire for you francophones out there). She’s here to discuss the tensions surrounding President Alassane Ouattara’s (somewhat abrupt) decision to seek a constitutionally-questionable third term in the forthcoming (October 31) election, and the context for those tensions going back to the 1990s), as well as her thoughts on what’s likely to happen next.</p><p><em>Ouattara speaking at a 2017 US State Department event (State Department photo via Flickr)</em></p><p>Jessica is on Twitter and is a great source for news and analysis on Ivory Coast and West Africa in general: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JessMoody89\">@JessMoody89</a>.</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
