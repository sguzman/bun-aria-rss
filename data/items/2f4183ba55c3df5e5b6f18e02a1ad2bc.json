  "description": "<p>LHAASO collaboration detected photons with energy above 10 TeV from the most\nrecent gamma-ray burst (GRB), GRB221009A. Given the redshift of this event,\n$z\\sim 0.15$, photons of such energy are expected to interact with the diffuse\nextragalactic background light (EBL) well before reaching Earth. In this paper\nwe provide the first neutrino-related explanation of the most energetic 18 TeV\nevent reported by LHAASO. We find that the minimal viable scenario involves\nboth mixing and transition magnetic moment portal between light and sterile\nneutrinos. The production of sterile neutrinos occurs efficiently via mixing\nwhile the transition magnetic moment portal governs the decay rate in the\nparameter space where tree-level decays via mixing to non-photon final states\nare suppressed. Our explanation of this event, while being consistent with the\nterrestrial constraints, points to the non-standard cosmology.\n</p>",
