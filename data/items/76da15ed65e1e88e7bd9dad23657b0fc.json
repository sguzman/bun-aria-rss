  "description": "<p>Welcome to the final episode in our series covering <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/3GGE1HO\">Mansfield Park</a></em> by Jane Austen here on The Literary Life podcast. Angelina, Cindy and Thomas dive right into the book chat today in order to cover as much as possible as they wrap up Fanny Price’s story. Angelina brings out the parallels to Edmund Spenser’s <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/3Dfy8PP\">Faerie Queene</a></em>. Cindy talks about how Julia and Maria’s upbringing is instructive for parents. Another topic is how, in a way, the characters continue their roles from “Lover’s Vows” in real life unless they repent. Our hosts also highlight Fanny’s journey toward finding a home throughout this story.</p> <p>Get in on the Western Films and Fiction webinar on November 22nd with Thomas and James Banks! <a href= \"https://houseofhumaneletters.com/product/western-films-and-western-fiction-a-webinar/\"> Register here</a> to join in!
