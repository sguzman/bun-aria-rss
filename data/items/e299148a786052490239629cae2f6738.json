  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, President Trump might be the first President since 1976 to NOT use the National Emergencies Act of 1976. This is a legitimate law that was passed by Congress, not an executive order. What alternatives do Mitch McConnell and other Republicans that are criticizing his use of this act offer to secure the border? All we get is more massive spending and debt. McConnell and Paul Ryan had their chance to solve this problem and didn't. Trump needs to take this to the courts ASAP! Then, we must reject populism — we are a Republic — populism isn't built into our Constitution. Meanwhile the attack against our institutions are unrelenting by Chuck Schumer and others who won't support Trump's anticipated call for unity at tonight's State of The Union. The Democrats won't stop until they get amnesty. Afterwards, the media is in full hype mode promoting the SOTU response from Stacy Abrams, a former candidate for Governor of Georgia. The narrative is being spread by all networks from Donna Brazile to Schumer promoting Abrams as the main event, calling Trump the warm up act to Abrams. They are playing up Abrams just like they play up AOC, and Barack Obama years earlier. Lastly, Governor Andrew Cuomo is upset that NY revenues have dropped so the state has less money to spend due to the increasingly unfriendly environment for wealthy New Yorkers.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
