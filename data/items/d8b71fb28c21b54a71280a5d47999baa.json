  "description": "Jalen & Jacoby talk Draymond Green and how the Celtics should deal with him during Game 3 of the NBA Finals. Find out why they say Green will probably get t’d up the second he steps off the bus. PLUS – Curry, Thompson, and Green get most of the attention for the Warriors, and rightfully so, but Jalen explains why Andrew Wiggins will play a huge role in determining whether the Warriors win Game 3 or not. ALSO – It’s very simple – when the Celtics turn the ball over, they lose…when they don’t, they win. Jalen & Jacoby discuss how Boston can limit those turnovers in Game 3. AND – don’t miss an interview with the legendary Dawn Staley. They get into her success as a coach, her fashion sense, and whether she would ever consider coaching at the next level – the WNBA or NBA. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
