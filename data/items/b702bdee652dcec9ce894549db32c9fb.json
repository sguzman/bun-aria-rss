  "description": "<p>We present a theoretical study of quantum phases and quantum phase\ntransitions occurring in non-Hermitian $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric\nsuperconducting qubits chains described by a transverse-field Ising spin model.\nA non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian is implemented via imaginary staggered\n\\textit{longitudinal } magnetic field, which corresponds to a local staggered\ngain and loss terms. By making use of a direct numerical diagonalization of the\nHamiltonian for spin chains of a finite size $N$, we explore the dependencies\nof the energy spectrum, including the energy difference between the first\nexcited and the ground states, the spatial correlation function of local\npolarization ($z$-component of local magnetization) on the adjacent spins\ninteraction strength $J$ and the local gain (loss) parameter $\\gamma$. A\nscaling procedure for the coherence length $\\xi$ allows us to establish a\ncomplete quantum phase diagram of the system. We obtain two quantum phases for\n$J&lt;0$, namely, $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetry broken antiferromagnetic state\nand $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetry preserved paramagnetic state, and the\nquantum phase transition line between them is the line of exception points. For\n$J&gt;0$ the $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetry of the ground state is retained in\na whole region of parameter space of $J$ and $\\gamma$, and a system shows\n\\textit{two} intriguing quantum phase transitions between ferromagnetic and\nparamagnetic states for a fixed parameter $\\gamma &gt; 1$. We also provide the\nqualitative quantum phase diagram $\\gamma-J$ derived in the framework of the\nBethe-Peierls approximation that is in a good accord with numerically obtained\nresults.\n</p>",
