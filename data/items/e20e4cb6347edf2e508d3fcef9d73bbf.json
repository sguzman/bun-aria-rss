  "description": "<p>Get ready for a practical-advice episode about training your kids how to watch movies together. Dave Radford of The Gray Havens comes on #SASF to ask the guys questions about how, precisely, one teaches children (and yourself!) how to watch movies. BUT FIRST, Dave criticizes the SASF soundtrack -- and as one of Nate's favorite songwriters, his complaints carry weight -- and the SASF pod makes an exciting new acquisition. Then the guys discuss the dangers of ruining the moment by watching movies like a worldview robot: the point is to ENJOY it together. That's what parents are for, after all. Lots of practical movie night recommendations, too. And remember, for a few weeks or so, SASF listeners can get a free month of Canon+ for 99 cents (first-time subscribers only).<br />#SASF #StoriesAreSoulFood #NDWilson #movienight #family</p>",
