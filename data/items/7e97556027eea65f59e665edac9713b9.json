  "description": "We all know the McLaren supercars like the Senna, P1, and 720s. But where did the company that built their beauties get their start? We begin our series on Bruce McLaren, one of Motorsport’s most influential figures, with his early life on the small island nation of New Zealand. Bruce had a rough start, as a kid he was confined to a hospital bed for two years. His time in the hospital taught him great academic discipline, a skill which assisted in the meticulous construction of his race cars later on. Join us as we explore Bruce’s early days of racing: from building a hillclimb car with his dad, to his journey to England to compete in Formula 2 racing!\nFollow James on IG and Twitter @jamespumphrey \nFollow Nolan on IG and Twitter @nolanjsykes \nFollow Donut @donutmedia, and subscribe to our Youtube and Facebook channels! \nLearn more about your ad choices.
