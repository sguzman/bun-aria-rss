  "description": "It's the holiday season so we at <em>Book Of The Day</em> wanted to bring you two of our holiday favorites. The first is David Sedaris' <em>Santaland Diaries</em>, which first aired on <em>Morning Edition</em> in 1992 and has been an annual NPR tradition ever since. It's a hilarious recounting of his time as a department store elf named Crumpet. The second is some of our staff here at NPR reading the poem <em>A Visit from St. Nicholas</em>, which you might know as <em>The Night Before Christmas</em>. Happy holidays \"...and to all a good night!\"",
