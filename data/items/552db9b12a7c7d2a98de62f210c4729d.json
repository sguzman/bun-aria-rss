  "description": "<p>Melissa Molinari is last seen at her home on November 21st. A friend reports the 38-year-old missing December 2nd. Her car is left at home. Neighbors say that is unusual as the mom of four is seen going in and out of the house multiple times in the day. According to the husband, Marcello, the couple had marital problems and had just cut short a family trip to Disney World. He claims she left the house on Monday, November 22nd, after an argument and that Melissa Molanari returned on Tuesday to pack her clothes. The husband says she left with an unknown male. Suffolk County police find the body of Melissa Molinari just off a dead-end road in Middle Island. The body was off of a trail, covered with leaves and branches, wrapped in plastic. Prosecutors say GPS data put Marcello Molanari twice at the scene where the body was found. Investigators say the victim had been stabbed 20 times in the torso, head, and back.</p><p><br></p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Dale Carson - High Profile Attorney (Jacksonville), Former FBI Agent, Former Police Officer, Author: \"Arrest-Proof Yourself, DaleCarsonLaw.com</li>\n<li>Dr. Bethany Marshall - Psychoanalyst, www.drbethanymarshall.com, New Netflix show: 'Bling Empire'</li>\n<li>Joe Scott Morgan - Professor of Forensics: Jacksonville State University, Author, \"Blood Beneath My Feet\", Host: \"Body Bags with Joseph Scott Morgan\" </li>\n<li>Jean-Paul Salamanca, Newsday Reporter, East End (Long Island), Newsday.com Twitter: @JPaulSalamanca</li>\n</ul><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
