  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, do you really think America is as bad as the Democrats and President Biden say it is? Do you really believe that their defense of voting rights is genuine when they altered our electoral system via lawsuits and gubernatorial executive orders for mail-in voting to help Biden and their fellow Democrats win in 2020? Yet it's the Democrats who embrace members like Jaime Raskin, whose father was a revolutionary founded the Institute for Policy Studies, an anti-American communist front group. Then, Democrats challenged the 2000 and 2004 elections and many claimed that George W. Bush and Donald Trump were not their presidents. They claimed that there was ballot fraud and irregularities with voting machines, yet the media did not censor them, kick them off social media, or claim they were attacking democracy. Democrats also fought for the filibuster saying it would be a doomsday for democracy if the rule were changed. Later, Inflation is at its highest rate in nearly 40 years ago when Jimmy Carter was President back in 1982. The government can't take enough of your money to cover its exorbitant expenses. So they tried to change the calculations for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) while attempting to exclude the costs of food and energy from the figure. Afterward, Glenn Beck joins the show to discuss his bout with COVID and his new book, \"The Great Reset: Joe Biden and the Rise of Twenty-First-Century Fascism.\" Beck added that the end of 20th century progressivism has arrived and now it's time for the left to carry their new mantra for the \"great re-set\" which he described as a Marxist road to serfdom.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
