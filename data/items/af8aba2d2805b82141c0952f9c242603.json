  "description": "Drew Barrymore didn’t always love to cook. When she first lived alone, at 14 years old, she stuck to instant ramen, boxed mac and cheese, and egg-in-the-hole toasts. But as an adult, sharing food with her friends and loved ones has become one of her favorite things, and her close friend and personal chef Pilar Valdes is a big reason why. The pair met in the midst of major life transitions, and they found solace and inspiration together in the kitchen. This week, they’re on the pod with host Amanda Shapiro talking about friendship, food preferences, and their new cookbook, Rebel Homemaker: Food, Family and Life. \nStuff we talk about in this episode: \n\n\nRebel Homemaker: Food, Family, Life by Drew Barrymore and Pilar Valdes: https://amzn.to/3Ey6dv2\n\n\nPilar’s Catering Company, Kickshaw Cookery: http://kickshawcookery.com/\n\n\nDrew Barrymore’s Kitchenware Collection, Beautiful: https://cookwithbeautiful.com/\n\n\nFrankie & Olive’s Roast Chicken Recipe: https://thehappyfoodie.co.uk/recipes/frankie-and-olives-roast-chicken/\n\n\nDrew and Pilar Make Turkey Roulade (Video): https://www.thedrewbarrymoreshow.com/videos/drew-and-pilar-valdes-make-turkey-roulade-and-corn-casserole\n\n*(When you buy something through our links, we earn an affiliate commission.)\nLearn more about your ad choices.
