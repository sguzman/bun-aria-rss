  "title": "Letters From A Stoic by Seneca",
  "description": "Stoic philosophy is one in which logic and reason are greater than emotion. The letters of Seneca to his student Lucillius speak of the reasons why this is the case. The topics of the letters range from friendship, wealth, the world and eventually to death. The topics discussed are broad and filled with complexity to show the reader the depth of reasoning that the stoic philosophy has. I will admit that this is one of most mentally exhaustive books I have read. It requires the full attention of the reader to extract the relevant information. Being a profoundly philosophical book, it must be read in contemplation to try and understand its contents. I recommend taking notes and highlighting where appropriate. I wouldn't say this book is for everyone. The depth can be overwhelming at times. However, I do encourage those who are interested in stoic philosophy to read this book. I rate this book four stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
