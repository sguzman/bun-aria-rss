Giant squids were thought to have a similar form reproduction.</p>\n<p>However, a group led by Professor Noritaka Hirohashi, 57, a professor of reproductive biology in the Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences at Shimane University suspects differently.</p>\n<p>They examined 66 sperm &#8220;bags&#8221; attached to five different locations on the body of a female that washed ashore in Ine Town of Kyoto Prefecture in 2020, and found that all of them were from the same male.</p>\n<p>It is rare for a female with sperm attached to be found, and further verification is needed, but the study&#8217;s results indicate that giant squid, unlike other squids, may be &#8220;monogamous.&#8221; That is, females may receive sperm from only one certain male. Hirohashi and his colleagues published their findings in an international scientific journal in July of 2021.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven&#8217;t covered.</p>\n<p>Read my blog posting guidelines <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/03/commenting_poli.html\">here</a>.</p>\n",
