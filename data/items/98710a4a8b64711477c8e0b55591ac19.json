  "description": "<p>As long as humans have existed, we’ve had to choose between our lower and higher desires — between what we want in the moment, and what we want in the long-term. As long as humans have existed, we’ve had to exercise self-control.</p><p>While exercising self-control has always been part of the human condition, our ideas about it have changed through the ages, as have the number of obstacles to doing so.</p><p>My guest charted the course of these changes in his book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3T6DSmU\"><i>Temptation: Finding Self-Control in an Age of Excess</i></a>, and he takes us on a tour of them today. His name is Daniel Akst, and we begin our conversation with a definition of what self-control is. We then discuss how Freudian psychology and the scientific study of self-control took it from being something the ancient Greeks and Romans considered an essential virtue of character, to something you shouldn’t or even couldn’t exercise. We also talk about what it is about the modern age that makes self-control uniquely difficult to put into practice. We end our conversation with how, despite the addition of complexities and hindrances, self-control remains a fundamental resource in a flourishing life, and Daniel shares practical tips for preserving yours by changing your environment, so you actually don’t have to exercise self-control as much.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Episode</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/delayed-gratification/\" target=\"_blank\">The Power and Pleasure of Delayed Gratification</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/manly-lessons/manvotional-the-kingship-of-self-control/\" target=\"_blank\">The Kingship of Self-Control</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/sunday-firesides-lash-yourself-to-the-mast/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunday Fireside: Lash Yourself to the Mast</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Daniel Akst</strong></h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://akst.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel’s Website</a></li></ul><img src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/10/71aX4y1FmOL.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" /><h2><br /> </h2>\n",
