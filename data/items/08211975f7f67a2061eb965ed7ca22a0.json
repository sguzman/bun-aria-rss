  "description": "<p>The Basque Country in northeastern Spain lies on the Bay of Biscay and abuts the Pyrenees Mountains, a mere 18 mi/30 km from the French border. Until about a decade ago, this area was relatively unknown as a wine region. But with the rise of Basque cuisine, an increased interest from wine buyers in native varietals, and a desire for lower alcohol, thirst-quenching wines, <strong>Txakolina (chock-o-LEEN-ah)</strong>, a white, high acid, spritzy wine started to get attention. The phenom started in places all over the United States (which boasts a Basque population of more than 50,000 people), then the UK and Japan, now small quantities of wine find their way to  many other countries around the world.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Basque_Country.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"444\" height=\"281\" /><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Map of Basque Country: Vineyards.com<br /> <br /></em></span></p> <p>In this show, we discuss this historic region, with its own language, culture, and wine traditions. We talk about how the modern wine industry was renewed, and what you can expect from these delicious, refreshing (mainly white) wines.
