  "description": "The Associated Press reports that Pfizer's updated COVID-19 booster \"significantly revved up adults' virus-fighting antibodies, the company said Friday, releasing early findings from a rigorous study of the new shots.\"\n\n\nBooster doses tweaked to target the most common omicron strain rolled out in early September, and the Food and Drug Administration said the latest data should spur more Americans to get one &mdash; especially before another expected wave of cases as people travel for Thanksgiving. Pfizer said people 55 and older who got the omicron-targeting booster had four-fold higher antibody levels than those given an extra dose of the original vaccine.... \n\nA month after receiving the new booster, antibody levels in people 55 and older had jumped 13 times higher than before the extra dose. Younger adults saw a 9.5-fold jump, Pfizer and its partner BioNTech said. It had been about 11 months since the study participants' last vaccination.... \n\nThe new data \"reassures us that this was a good decision to move to this bivalent vaccine,\" FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks told The Associated Press. \"Right now is the time for people to consider going out and get the updated\" booster.... The updated doses are combination shots, tailored to offer a boost of protection against both the original coronavirus strain and the dominant BA.5 strain.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Pfizer+Study+Says+the+Updated+COVID+Boosters+Significantly+Rev+Up+Protection%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3TdtZmx\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F11%2F05%2F0252233%2Fpfizer-study-says-the-updated-covid-boosters-significantly-rev-up-protection%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/22/11/05/0252233/pfizer-study-says-the-updated-covid-boosters-significantly-rev-up-protection?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=22334763&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",
