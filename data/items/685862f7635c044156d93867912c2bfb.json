  "description": "A fresh approach to scholarship on the diverse nature of Indian anticolonial processes, Geographies of Anticolonialism: Political Networks Across and Beyond South India, c. 1900-1930 (John Wiley & Sons, 2020) brings together a varied selection of literature to explore Indian anticolonialism in new ways and offers a different perspective to geographers seeking to understand political resistance to colonialism. It addresses contemporary studies that argue nationalism was joined by other political processes, such as revolutionary and anarchist ideologies, to shape the Indian independence movement. By focusing on a specific anticolonial group, the “Pondicherry Gang,” and investigating their significant impact which went beyond South India, the book helps readers understand the diverse nature of anticolonialism, which in turn prompts thinking about the various geographies produced through anticolonial activity.\nAndrew Davies is a geographer based in Liverpool who works at the intersection of historical, political and cultural geographies. His work explores how anticolonial ideas helped to create new spaces for political activity and expression. Alongside his research activity, Andy regularly (when allowed) conducts public walks exploring Liverpool’s colonial past, particularly working with the Liverpool-based creative arts charity Writing on the Wall.\nSaronik Bosu (@SaronikB on Twitter) is a doctoral candidate in English at New York University. He is writing his dissertation on South Asian economic writing. He is coordinator of the Medical Humanities Working Group at NYU, and of the Postcolonial Anthropocene Research Network. He also co-hosts the podcast High Theory.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
