  "description": "<p>On today's show Pat and the boys look ahead to tonight's Thursday Night Game between the Raiders v Chargers game, chat a lot about the best Christmas movie of all-time, Tim Allen's life before Home Improvement and being The Santa Clause, and much more. Joining the program is The President of the Washington Football Team, former 6 year NFL veteran, and friend of the show, Jason Wright. Pat and Jason chat about how things have been going so far this season, changing the culture in Washington and how he likes where things are currently at in the building, his relationship with Ron Rivera, how the teams around the NFL have been trying to pull in additional revenue, and if the team name is staying the same (1:09-21:44). Next, friend of the program, 7x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, New York Jets legend, and BBQ Maker, Nick Mangold joins the show to drink some of his barbecue sauce after losing a bet to Pat earlier in the season, why the Jets stink, if he'll ever coach, and what it was like living with AJ in college (21:47-49:02). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk look ahead to tonight's matchup between the Raiders and Chargers, and who they like betting wise, and everything else going on in the sports world (55:01-1:44:46).
