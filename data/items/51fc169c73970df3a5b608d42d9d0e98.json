  "description": "<div>For International Podcast Day, something extra and a little different for you...<br>\n<br>\nCrimeCon Glasgow earlier this month was a lot of fun. Late on the Saturday afternoon I had the pleasure of sitting with some incredibly talented true crime podcasters - I admire every single one of them - and we discussed our podcast journeys so far. I hope you enjoy the conversation and if you want more content like this, please just let me know....<br>\n<br>\nAnd a huge thank you to Bob & Ali from the excellent Twisted Britain podcast for hosting and editing this episode.</div>\n",
