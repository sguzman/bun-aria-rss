  "description": "<p>Using a historical definition of the term, socialism designated a political system where the government owns the means of production.

What has changed the traditional sense of socialism? Has the Supreme Court weighed in on any social programs? Join James Harrigan and Antony Davies as they ponder these questions and more on this week’s episode of Words & Numbers. </p> <p><strong><br /> Show your support for Words & Numbers at Patreon</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/wordsandnumbers\">https://www.patreon.com/wordsandnumbers</a></p> <p><strong>Quick hits</strong></p> <p>Enzymes eat plastic</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/factory-uses-enzymes-to-recycle-all-plastics-at-once-backed-by-major-companies/\"> https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/factory-uses-enzymes-to-recycle-all-plastics-at-once-backed-by-major-companies/</a></p> <p>Anti-inflamatory drugs and depression</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.healio.com/primary-care/psychiatry/news/online/%7B649c6090-c2d2-4b42-800d-9f63fabf862c%7D/anti-inflammatory-drugs-improve-depression\"> https://www.healio.com/primary-care/psychiatry/news/online/%7B649c6090-c2d2-4b42-800d-9f63fabf862c%7D/anti-inflammatory-drugs-improve-depression</a></p> <p><strong>Foolishness of the week</strong></p> <p>Senate rejects Rand Paul’s proposal to cut spending by 2 percent</p> <p><a href= \"https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/467817-senate-rejects-paul-effort-to-cut-spending\"> https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/467817-senate-rejects-paul-effort-to-cut-spending</a></p> <p><strong>Topic of the week: Transferism</strong></p> <p><strong>Join the conversation</strong></p> <p>Words & Numbers Backstage</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/groups/130029457649243/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/130029457649243/</a></p> <p>Let us know what you think</p> <p><a href= \"mailto:wordsandnumberspodcast@gmail.com\">mailto:wordsandnumberspodcast@gmail.com</a></p> <p>Antony Davies on Twitter</p> <p><a href= \"https://twitter.com/antonydavies\">https://twitter.com/antonydavies</a></p> <p>James R.
