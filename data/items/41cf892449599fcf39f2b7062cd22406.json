Challenges, problems, and unexpected obstacles are all inherent in the development of a human being.</p> <p>We can choose to tussle with them a bit, complain about them constantly, or we can find a way to break through them. Consistently looking for the challenge, and knowing that you have everything you need within you to overcome it, is part of long-term happiness and fulfillment.</p> <p>The reality is that many people retreat when they are faced with challenges they think are beyond them. Tail between the legs, white flag; the whole nine yards to show they have given up. We have to come to a conclusion at some point that the challenges in our lives aren’t there to break us, they are actually there to develop us in ways that we never knew were possible before.</p> <p><span id=\"more-5191\"></span>You have gifts, talents, capacities, skills, ideas, and so much more that are dormant within you unless you have the right stimulus to bring them out. Why come up with an idea to improve the quality of your life if everything is all comfy and cozy? That idea wouldn’t be needed… It needs a spark. And that spark usually shows up dressed in obstacle pants.
