  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Emerging science shows a strong connection between our brains and our gut, or the gut-brain axis. While you might think that these two organs have very different structures and functions, they actually have more in common than you’d think. The gut and the brain are connected by the vagus nerve and neurotransmitters, and our gut microbes can even communicate with our brains.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">When it comes to brain function and the science behind the gut-brain connection, Dr. Andrew Huberman is one of the world’s foremost experts. Dr. Huberman is a highly-regarded neuroscientist and tenured professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine. He is the director of Huberman Lab at Stanford, and the host of the Huberman Lab Podcast.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">In part two of this interview series, Dr. Huberman is sharing his expertise on the numerous benefits that fasting can have on the brain and the neurobiology behind overeating, hyper-palatable foods, and obesity.
