  "description": "<p>LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he and his guest go deep into the subject of mortality via cinema, and this week he is joined by properly fabulous comedian, actor, writer and podcast SUZI RUFFELL!</p><br><p>A perfect chance right here to get in on some classics and a whole world of glorious tangents with Brett and the awesome Suzi, as they catch up like good old pals RIGHT IN FRONT OF US - but of course we get front row seats and you’ll be ever so thankful we did. Suzi has been in the game for a minute, and chances are you will have caught her on TV or hopefully managed to hit up one of her standup shows - her tour is looking healthy for the last half of the year so you’ll surely have a chance to get in some Suzi time very soon… Anyway - the podcast! If you’re easily spooked out then you might want to listen to this in daylight as she and Brett trade a couple of super eerie ghost stories (this is the podcast for it, right?), her thoughts on horror and gore, the representation of queer characters and the storylines which often come with that and a true showstopper of a story involving her dad going to prison in Italy. It’s as insane and amazing as you imagine… Maybe more so… So enjoy this week’s episode with the great and grand SUZI RUFFELL!</p><br><p><strong><em>EPISODE LINKS:</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>• </em></strong><a href=\"https://suziruffell.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SUZI on THE INTERNET!</strong></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suziruffell\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SUZI on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/likemindedfriends\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SUZI's PODCAST!</strong></a></p><p><strong>• </strong><a href=\"https://suziruffell.com/#gigs\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SUZI's TOURDATES!</strong></a></p><br><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mrbrettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT on INSTAGRAM!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/brettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT on PATREON!</strong></a></p><p><strong>• </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyHN3_ZUyuA\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>'SUPERBOB' - Brett's 2015 feature film!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/75576061\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>'CORNERBOYS' with BRETT & SCROOBIUS PIP!</strong></a></p><br><p>• <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/distractionpiecespodcast\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on FACEBOOK</strong></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/distractionpiecesnetwork\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on INSTAGRAM</strong></a></p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith\">http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
