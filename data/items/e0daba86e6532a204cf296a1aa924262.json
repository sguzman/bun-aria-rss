For five years, when I was a young man pursuing my dream of playing baseball, Rod was my HITTING COACH, MENTOR, FRIEND, and a man I looked up to and ADMIRED deeply. I am not overstating things when I tell you Rod Carew is directly responsible for TRANSFORMING me into the man I am today. Not only are you about to hear an INSPIRING interview with tons of BASE HITS you can apply to your own life, but you‚Äôre also about to hear an INTENSELY PERSONAL AND EMOTIONAL interview for me as well.

During his 19-year career‚Ä¶ --Rod won 7 batting titles, including hitting for a mind-blowing .388 AVERAGE one season and winning another title without hitting a single home run in another. --He batted .328 for his career, including hitting above .300 for 15 CONSECUTIVE SEASONS while racking up 3,053 CAREER HITS. --In 2016, in recognition of his prowess at the plate, the MLB American League Batting Champion award was renamed the Rod Carew Award. Fewer people know about the private side of Rod Carew. It‚Äôs there where you‚Äôll find the INSPIRATIONAL and HEARTBREAKING chapters of his LIFE. You will draw STRENGTH as you listen to Rod describe his early life in Panama with an abusive father, creating emotional scars he would carry with him well into his adult life. Here‚Äôs a HUGE TAKEAWAY for every one of you‚Ä¶ Rod never took for granted the GIFTS and OPPORTUNITIES he was given. You‚Äôll be more than a little surprised to learn he took extra batting practice throughout his entire career, including on the day he RETIRED!
