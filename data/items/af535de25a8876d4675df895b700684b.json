  "description": "Gentlemen, start your engines! And may the best…woman…win\n\nSloots, it has been an amazing month celebrating the LGBTQIA+ community, and here on Sofia with an F we’re ending it with a BANG…or a split, rather? Today Sofia is joined by the queen herself, Izzy Uncut! Okay, now say it slow...Izzy…Uncut. Get it? Anyway - today is a VERY special episode with one of New York City’s FINEST drag queens. Today Izzy will be taking Sofia through ALL things DRAG! From the do’s and don'ts of attending a drag show, drags origins in ballroom culture, to how to truly BEAT your face like the queens, and EVERYTHING in between. We also learn all about Izzy’s life and how she ended up as one of NYC’s most booked and busy queens. Aside from teaching Sofia how to make her boobs 4x bigger and giving her setting spray recommendations, the duo also unpacks some very pressing topics. Today Izzy joined Sloot University as our adjunct professor to further educate about gender and sexuality, and the misconceptions regarding those things in not only the drag world, but the entire world. Together Izzy and Sofia speak on some VERY important issues regarding acceptance and allyship. Yes, We’re definitely looking at you Texas. Our new favorite chaotic couple is jumping (literally) into SO much today that there’s a very good chance Sofia may be taking up a new profession - which btw, it’s important to note: drag is for EVERYONE. Visibility and acceptance is all we tolerate here at Sloot University, now get ready to lip-sync for your LIFE Sloots!\n\n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n\nOK Cupid: Download OK Cupid from the App Store or Google Play today!\nZola: http://www.Zola.com/\n\nWatch full episodes at https://youtube.com/c/SofiaFranklyn0\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
