  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 10/29/20",
  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, polling locations are being closed in red states and election day is being extended in many blue states in what appears to be an underhanded way to help Joe Biden gain more votes. If the legal issues surrounding this election aren't resolved on an emergency basis it will be very cumbersome to handle after the elections when there are hundreds of thousands of ballots. Then, what's at stake in this election is court-packing, eliminating the electoral college, and the filibuster rule, attacking free speech to limit advocacy in elections, and aspects of the free press and the free exercise of religion, the 2nd amendment. But it is also the democrat's purpose to take over the government, to change our culture, country, and render the Constitution useless. Democrats don't own this government, we the people own this government. Marxists have hijacked the Democrat Party to take over the federal government. Later, threats against Justice Amy Coney Barrett have surfaced. Democrats are warning they'll impeach her if she sits in on a case related to counting ballots. Afterward, the media has ratcheted up their partisan support for Joe Biden with negative coverage of Trump soaring. The radicals driving the leftwing movement are intent on surrounding themselves with big government types and creating an American oligopoly.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
