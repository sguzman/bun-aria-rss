  "description": "Following upon the success of his magisterial account of Winston Churchill, Andrew Roberts returns with an outstanding biography of George III: ﻿The Last King of America: The Misunderstood Reign of George III (Viking, 2021) . Drawing on important new archival material, Roberts rescues George III from unwarranted criticism and dramatic hyperbole to show how this \"enlightenment prince\" engaged with the key issues that shaped the British world in the middle and later eighteenth century - from his rejection of slavery to his appreciation of science and the arts. Developing a new account of the rebellion of the thirteen colonies, Roberts argues that \"America's last king\" was already the guarantor of their freedom.\n Crawford Gribben is a professor of history at Queen’s University Belfast.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
