  "description": "<p>Carmen Lynch was a scoliosis nerdburger in hight school. She wore a back brace and couldn't make friends. She came on the podcast this week to tell me about it. How she dealt with having scoliosis at such an important age and how it's helped shape who she's become now. Get it? Shape? Anyway, she's a very well respected comic in NY. Ask any comedian in the city about her and they'll tell you she's really funny.
