  "title": "Marko Geslani, \"Rites of the God-King: Śānti and Ritual Change in Early Hinduism\" (Oxford UP, 2018)",
  "description": "Is “Vedic” fire sacrifice at odds with “Hindu” image worship? Through a careful study of ritual (śanti) texts geared towards appeasement of inauspicious forces (primarily the Atharva Veda and in the Bṛhatsaṃhitā, an Indian astrological work), Marko Geslani demonstrates the persistent significance and centrality of the work of Brahmanical priesthood from ancient to medieval to modern times. In doing so he aptly problematizes the scholarly tendency to demarcate Vedic ritual from popular Hinduism. Join me today as I speak with Marco about his new book Rites of the God-King: Śānti and Ritual Change in Early Hinduism(Oxford University Press, 2018).\nFor information on your host Raj Balkaran’s background, see rajbalkaran.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
