  "description": "<p><p>You will learn a lot you didn't know about Kirk Minihane on today's episode. From outer space to presidential assassinations, he's seen it all -- and don't you dare fucking question him. Minihane reacts to Zero Blog Thirty's defense of a Colorado radio host. A whale of a Pittsburgh radio host picks a new fight with Blind Mike. Minihane finds a new Radio.com show that he actually likes. We find out that Minihane has been spending his spare time working on a novel, but he won't tell us his pen name. The Minifans' madness reaches a boiling point. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
