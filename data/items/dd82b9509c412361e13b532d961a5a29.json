  "description": "Here we are, a few days after the election. With the world still adjusting to the future, we thought we’d give you a break from it all and briefly talk about what we know best: the future of technology. This week we have reviews for the Playstation 4 Pro and Google Daydream, the continuing saga of adapting to a plug drought, and Snapchat’s new Spectacles that were released to the public this week. \n\nSo sit back, relax, (unless you are driving... if you’re driving and listening to this please focus on the road), and let us fill you in with the Verge updates you may have missed this week. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
