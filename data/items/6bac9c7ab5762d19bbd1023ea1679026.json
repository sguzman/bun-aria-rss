  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, when someone uses deadly force against a police officer, hitting them in the head repeatedly with a stick, it should be met with deadly force. When violent revolutionaries seek to transform America by overthrowing institutions across the country it becomes a federal matter. James Madison noted that citizens of all cities and states are also citizens of the United States and the federal government has a responsibility to protect all citizens when Marxist-sympathizing mayors don't. Then, the New York Times is a disgrace and Bari Weiss accurately points out that the objectivity of journalism can't be abandoned in exchange for tweeting hatred toward President Trump. Even veterans newsman Ted Koppel recognizes that Trump is correct when he says that the media is biased against him. Sadly, the media have thrown out the rulebook on objectivity and replaced it with emotion. Later, while the left in the media blames Trump for the scientific response to the Wuhan virus, Anthony Fauci is portrayed as infallible. Despite his nearly four decades in Washington as the nation's top doctor for infectious diseases Fauci's lack of preparedness for this pandemic is still largely overlooked. Afterward, Nancy Pelosi's remarks today that \"the anxiety deepens” each day prove that she is the modern-day George Wallace stopping children from going to school and to keep families broke. Has anyone questioned Pelosi on her endorsement of Ilhan Omar and her openly anti-Semitic behavior?\nLearn more about your ad choices.
