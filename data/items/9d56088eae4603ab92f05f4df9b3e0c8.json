    "media:description": "► In this week's video, I discuss the insanely influential post-hardcore and noise rock trio, Unwound. Formed in 1991, the band has released now iconic records such as Fake Train, New Plastic Ideas, Repetition and Leaves Turn Inside You. Being one of the most important acts to come from the indie label Kill Rock Stars, this is the story of Unwound. A band consisting of Justin Trosper, Vern Rumsey and Sara Lund that defined a generation of outcasts. \n\n► Leave a like if you enjoyed!
