  "description": "Ryan Hackenbracht, who is an associate professor of English at Texas Tech University, has just published one of the most innovative and stimulating discussions of the interplay between literature and religion in early modern England. National Reckonings: The Last Judgement and Literature in Milton’s England (Cornell University Press, 2019) opens up questions about how seventeenth-century writers understood the Christian doctrine of the last judgement, and how the thought of that final reckoning shaped new attitudes to church and to nation. With new readings of authors including John Milton, Thomas Hobbes, Henry Vaughan, Gerrard Winstanley and Abiezer Coppe, National Reckonings will become essential reading for anyone working in the expanding field of literature and religion during England’s revolution.\nCrawford Gribben is a professor of history at Queen’s University Belfast. His research interests focus on the history of puritanism and evangelicalism, and he is the author most recently of John Owen and English Puritanism (Oxford University Press, 2016).\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
