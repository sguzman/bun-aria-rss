Sixty million Americans contracted swine flu in 2009; 300,000 were hospitalized —and the media didn’t generate any panic, because Obama was president. The market rebound will be huge. Media treating Trump like George W. Bush. Montage of sniveling Democrats ripping Trump on MSNBC. Actions Dems will pay price for are destroying economy. Steps Trump takes right now will lead to huge economic rebound. Seventeen thousand died from swine flu in 2009-2010 and there was no panic. Democrats try to shut down primary. All of this panic is political. Why doesn’t anyone care about flu deaths? Liberal answer to coronavirus is same as climate change: More and bigger gov’t.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>Market gains over 1,000 points in Rush’s first hour. VP’s office sends great pictures from Pence studio visit. Does anyone know the U.S. coronavirus death toll? Death toll still in 30s, so it’s not mentioned. Dems oppose Trump’s EU travel ban.
