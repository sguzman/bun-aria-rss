  "description": "<p>This one goes out to the guys (and gals) who are working hard and have a chip on their shoulder because everybody they know - even their friends and family -are telling them to \"grow up\" because they are crazy to \"pursue an unrealistic dream.\" Guess what? Someday, when you are successful, they will tell you \"you are a genius\" and \"I always believed in you.\" And it will be bull sh*t.  But it doesn't matter. Those stupid things that people say are blessings. They will create the chip on your shoulder. They will drive you.  And when you make them eat their words, it will feel damn good.</p>",
