  "description": "Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial is on the horizon, even though he’s out of the White House. Trump was impeached for the second time in January, this time on incitement of insurrection over the riots at the US Capitol, and now, the matter is headed to the Senate. Some Democrats worry conducting an impeachment trial now will collide with Joe Biden’s early agenda, but lawmakers insist they can balance legislation, appointee confirmations, and Trump. Vox’s Li Zhou explains the lay of the land.\n\nReferences: \n\nLi’s story with Ella Nilsen about the impeachment vote. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
