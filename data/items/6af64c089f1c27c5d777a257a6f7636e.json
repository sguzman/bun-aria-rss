Jeremy's work builds on a famous theory from Bruce Yandle's 1983 article <a href= \"http://pirate.shu.edu/~rotthoku/Liberty/On%20Bootleggers%20&%20Baptists.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\" Bootleggers and Baptists-The Education of a Regulatory Economist.\"</a> The article explored the idea that laws are often passed or defended by coalitions of economic interests (bootleggers) and moral crusaders (Baptists). Though these two groups may be quite different, as in the canonical example, policies are unlikely to succeed without support from both groups.</p> <p>Jeremy's work focuses on a particular example of bootleggers and Baptists in the modern world; specifically in Arkansas. Arkansas has many dry counties, where alcohol may not be sold. Many of these dry counties are adjacent to wet counties, where liquor stores just across the county line can sell to the residents of the dry county. When there are ballot initiatives to make dry counties wet, these liquor stores have the most to lose, so they often spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to prevent the prohibition laws from going to a vote.</p> <hr /> <p> </p>",
