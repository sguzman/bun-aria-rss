Then, they offer insight into the app’s newest dance craze and our strongest contender for 2022 song of the summer, Lizzo’s “About Damn Time.” Finally, they trace the origins of TikTok’s strangest earworm, the “Jiggle Jiggle” rap.\nPodcast production by Madeline Ducharme and Derek John.\nSupport ICYMI and listen to the show with zero ads.
