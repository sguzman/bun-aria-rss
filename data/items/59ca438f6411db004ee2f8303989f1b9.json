  "description": "<p>It is anticipated that 6G wireless networks will accelerate the convergence\nof the physical and cyber worlds and enable a paradigm-shift in the way we\ndeploy and exploit communication networks. Machine learning, in particular deep\nlearning (DL), is expected to be one of the key technological enablers of 6G by\noffering a new paradigm for the design and optimization of networks with a high\nlevel of intelligence. In this article, we introduce an emerging DL\narchitecture, known as the transformer, and discuss its potential impact on 6G\nnetwork design. We first discuss the differences between the transformer and\nclassical DL architectures, and emphasize the transformer's self-attention\nmechanism and strong representation capabilities, which make it particularly\nappealing for tackling various challenges in wireless network design.\nSpecifically, we propose transformer-based solutions for various massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and semantic communication problems, and\nshow their superiority compared to other architectures. Finally, we discuss key\nchallenges and open issues in transformer-based solutions, and identify future\nresearch directions for their deployment in intelligent 6G networks.\n</p>",
