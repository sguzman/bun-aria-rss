  "description": "<p>Craig Mod <a href=\"http://craigmod.com/\">writes essays</a> that have the power to change the way you look at everything around you. At regular but somewhat distant intervals, he posts a long bit of writing that retrains your mind to see the world as he does. But he doesn't just talk: He creates projects that demonstrate his points as a designer and publisher of print and electronic work.</p>\n<p>Craig and I had such a great but long conversation that we decided to split it into two parts. This is part 1, about publishing and crowdfunding; part 2, on publishing to different platforms, will air in a few weeks.</p>\n<p>On Twitter, he is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/craigmod\">@craigmod</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsored by</p>\n\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http://audiblepodcast.com/disruptors\">Audible.com</a> for a free, 30-day trial and choose from 100,000+ audiobooks.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/newdisruptors\">Squarespace</a>: Everything you need to build exceptional websites!</p>\n\n\n",
