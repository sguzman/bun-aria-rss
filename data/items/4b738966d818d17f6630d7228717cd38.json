  "description": "<p><p>John has a way to improve all dinners, everywhere. He also does something despicable with his socks. Nikki Glaser returns to talk about laser hair removal, why she likes dead moms, consensual sexting, vagina angles, and chairs vs people. Ian Fidance stops by to tell us how he made his therapist cry. Voicemails include: socks or barefoot,Â  superheroes vs cops, off the menu, and the last single guy in the group.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
