  "summary": "<p>The recent <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/\">0.11 release</a> of scipy includes several new features,\none of which is the <a href=\"http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.csgraph.html\">sparse graph submodule</a>\nwhich I contributed, with help from other developers.  I'm pretty excited about this: there are some\nclassic algorithms implemented, and it will open up whole new realms of computational possibilities in Python.</p>\n<p>Before we start, I should say: this post is based on a <a href=\"http://pyvideo.org/video/1346/lightning-talks-wednesday\">lightning talk</a> I gave\nat Scipy 2012, and some of the material below comes from a <a href=\"http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/csgraph.html\">tutorial</a>\nI wrote for the scipy documentation.</p>",
