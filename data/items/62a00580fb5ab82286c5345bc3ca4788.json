  "description": "In this episode, Sharon sits down with return guest Danielle Coke to learn about the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster of 1986. This history lesson is cast from the perspective of one of America’s most cherished ordinary heroes, Sharon Christa McAuliffe, a school teacher from New Hampshire who was selected by NASA to become the first teacher in space. In 1984 President Ronal Reagan announced the Teacher in Space Project designed to inspire students, honor teachers, and spur interest in mathematics, science, and space exploration by sending a teacher on a voyage to space with NASA. The infamous program ended fatally, however, when after just 73 seconds into its flight on January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded, killing Christa and all six other crew members aboard.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
