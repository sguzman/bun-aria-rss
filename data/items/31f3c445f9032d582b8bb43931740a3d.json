  "description": "In today's first reading from 2 Samuel we learn about God's dealings with David, the Israelite king who put himself on a path of sin that culminated in adultery and murder.  David is forgiven but also cleansed, purified, and brought back to obedience to God precisely through the suffering unleashed by this double-sin.  From David we learn how God's grace is always available, but it is never cheap.",
