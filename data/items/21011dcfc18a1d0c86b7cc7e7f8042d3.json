  "description": "<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Half the world’s webpages are in English, but <a href=\"https://www.ethnologue.com/language/eng \">less than 15 percent</a> of the global population speaks it as a primary or secondary language. It’s no surprise that Chrome’s built-in Translate functionality is one of the most beloved Chrome features. Every day Chrome users translate more than 150 million webpages with just one click or tap.<br/></p><p>Last year, Google Translate introduced <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/translate/found-translation-more-accurate-fluent-sentences-google-translate/\">neural machine translation</a>, which uses deep neural networks to translate entire sentences, rather than just phrases, to figure out the most relevant translation. Since then we’ve been gradually making these improvements available for Chrome’s built-in translation for select language pairs. The result is higher-quality, full-page translations that are more accurate and easier to read.</p>Today, neural machine translation improvement is coming to Translate in Chrome for nine more language pairs. Neural machine translation will be used for most pages to and from English for Indonesian and eight Indian languages: Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu. This means higher quality translations on pages containing everything from <a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shakira/wakawakathistimeforafrica.html\">song lyrics</a> to <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-2017-10/zaheer-khan-announces-engagement-with-actress-sagarika-ghatge-4626646/\">news articles</a> to <a href=\"http://www.indiancricketfans.com/forums/forum/6-cricket-talk/\">cricket discussions</a>.</div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--8\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"translation.png\" class=\"article-image--full\" data-loading='{\n                \"mobile\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/translation.max-500x500.png\",\n                \"desktop\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/translation.max-1000x1000.png\"\n              }' loading=\"lazy\" src=\" https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/translation.max-100x100.png \" tabindex=\"0\"/></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\">From left: A webpage in Indonesian; the page translated into English without neural machine translation; the page translated into English with neural machine translation.

You can already translate to and from English for Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese, and one-way from Spanish to English.</p><p>We’ll bring neural machine translation to even more languages in the future.
