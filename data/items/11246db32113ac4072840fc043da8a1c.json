  "description": "<p>The bridging research between Human-Computer Interaction and Natural Language\nProcessing is developing quickly these years. However, there is still a lack of\nformative guidelines to understand the human-machine interaction in the NLP\nloop. When researchers crossing the two fields talk about humans, they may\nimply a user or labor. Regarding a human as a user, the human is in control,\nand the machine is used as a tool to achieve the human's goals. Considering a\nhuman as a laborer, the machine is in control, and the human is used as a\nresource to achieve the machine's goals. Through a systematic literature review\nand thematic analysis, we present an interaction framework for understanding\nhuman-machine relationships in NLP. In the framework, we propose four types of\nhuman-machine interactions: Human-Teacher and Machine-Learner, Machine-Leading,\nHuman-Leading, and Human-Machine Collaborators. Our analysis shows that the\ntype of interaction is not fixed but can change across tasks as the\nrelationship between the human and the machine develops. We also discuss the\nimplications of this framework for the future of NLP and human-machine\nrelationships.\n</p>",
