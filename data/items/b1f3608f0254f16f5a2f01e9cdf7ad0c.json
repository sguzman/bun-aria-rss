  "description": "<p><p>Max Uriarte is in for Cons on today's pod. Unfortunately, this is only a temporary arrangement.</p><p>Round 1: We catch up with Max and talk about his new book, his love for LCpls, and his social media policy.</p><p>Round 2: Breaking down the terrible battle tactics used in S8E3 of Game of Thrones, and how so many GoT quotes would be awesome to use to chew out Marines.</p><p>Round 3: Ships in the Arctic Circle are blubbering about a whale that keeps head-butting the ships' hulls. Now scientists are saying Russia might be behind this strange sea activity. Fucking Russia.</p><p>Round 4: On Saturday a gunman opened fire at a San Diego synagogue killing one and wounding 3 others. While obviously tragic, this incident could have been much worse were it not for Oscar Stewart. We're gonna tell you about the Army veteran who bolted towards the sound of shooting & ran the shooter off.</p><p>Round 5: Mail bags: we answer some hard hitting questions from NCOs around the military!</p><p> </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
