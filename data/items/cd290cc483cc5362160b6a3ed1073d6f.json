  "description": "The first time <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ihatejoelkim\">Joel Kim Booster</a> vacationed on New York's Fire Island with his friend, comedian Bowen Yang, he brought with him Jane Austen's <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> as a beach read. Over the years, he'd often joke with friends about making a gay version of the novel. Today Booster is the writer and star of Hulu's <em>Fire Island</em>, a queer, Asian romcom based on Austen's classic, set in the titular gay vacation spot. Booster talks with guest host <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elisewho\">Elise Hu</a> about how the film honors his queer friendships, subverts hetero romcom norms, and tells a personal story that feels universal.  <br/><br/><em>You can follow us on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NPRItsBeenAMin\"><em>@NPRItsBeenAMin</em></a><em> and email us at </em><a href=\"mailto:ibam@npr.org\"><em>ibam@npr.org</em></a><em>.</em> ",
