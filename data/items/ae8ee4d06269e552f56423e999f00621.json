While American society has taken precautionary measures to counter the spread of the virus, those most vulnerable to societal neglect remain most impacted. Coronavirus did not create the stark social, financial, and political inequalities that define life for so many Americans, but it has made them more strikingly visible than any moment in recent history. Unfortunately, some of the intersectional dimensions of these structural disparities remain undetected and unreported.\n\nOn Wednesday March 25th, Intersectionality Matters teamed up with the African American Policy Forum (AAPF) to premiere a new virtual conversation series entitled “Under the Blacklight: The Intersectional Vulnerabilities that COVID Lays Bare”.
