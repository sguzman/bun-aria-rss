  "description": "He doesn't love democracy.  He is aging.  He, frankly, doesn't run with a very nice crowd.  Oh, and there are all those invasions and murders and all that spying and so on.  But Vladimir Putin has now won four elections to be Russia's president...and is two-for-two in major superpower elections in the past couple years.  Where can this lead...and what happens if Trump turns up the heat on his patron anytime soon?  Plus--what would be the consequences of ditching the Iran deal (as the U.S. now seems likely to do)?  For the Middle East?  For North Korea?  Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake, Ed Luce and David Rothkopf discuss.
