  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, the Constitution provides no authority to any President of the United States to unilaterally forgive any debt owed to the people without any legislation from congress. This move by Democrats to forgive student loan debt and appeal to their base will affect inflation just like any other spending bill. This unconstitutional move will also cause tuition to go up as well. Then, the government refuses to release the affidavit of the Mar a Lago raid because they want to leak it so they can shape the narrative in the media. Prior court decisions have considered presidential records to be personal property that is archived by the government but not government property. Since there is a five-year period in which the former President can restrict access to his documents (both classified and unclassified) under the Presidential Records Act, Trump has not violated any law and the search against him was unconstitutional. Later, John Solomon founder of Just The News joins the show to discuss the media's bias in their reporting. Solomon reiterated that reporting facts is sorely needed in our nation today. Afterward, Jared Kushner calls in to discuss his new book \"Breaking History: A White House Memoir.\" Kushner walks us through what it was like inside the Trump White House during the chaotic siege of Mueller's Russia witch hunt. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
