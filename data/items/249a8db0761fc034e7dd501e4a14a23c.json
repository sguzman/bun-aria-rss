  "description": "<p>In this 66th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. In this episode, we begin by discussing what the increasing visibility of a viable hypothesis for the origins of SARS-CoV2 says about modern science and politics. Then: Is eating red meat inflammatory? Is saying that eating red meat is inflammatory, inflammatory? What would it mean for evolutionary biologists to “stay in their lane” (and why shouldn’t we)? What does “follow the science” mean when we are being told to wear masks in National Parks? Is the New York Times punking us, or did they seriously just suggest that encrypted messaging services are dangerous because untrue things are sometimes said? What is the null hypothesis—in general, and in particular, with regard to the origins of SARS-CoV2? Does Sony’s classification system of “human, animal and bird” make any sense, and does it matter? And finally: what are sidewinders and how do they move, what are mangroves, and what on Earth could the connection possibly be?<br/><br/>DarkHorse merchandise now available at: store.darkhorsepodcast.org <br/><br/>Find more from us on Bret’s website (https://bretweinstein.net) or Heather’s website (http://heatherheying.com). <br/><br/>Become a member of the DarkHorse LiveStreams, and get access to an additional Q&A livestream every month.
