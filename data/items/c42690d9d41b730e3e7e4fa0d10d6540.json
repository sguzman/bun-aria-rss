  "description": "<p>Nova Scotia means \"New Scotland\" and is known for its coastal views, lobster, fish, blueberries and apples. Halifax is the capital of Nova Scotia, Canada and the largest municipality in the province. Being one of the largest harbors in the world, this city has been witness to two tragic maritime accidents. There have been battles waged here and whole groups of people were driven out when Britain settled the area. For these reasons and others, Halifax has quite a few haunted locations. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Halifax! The Moment in Oddity features Mooning Men and This Month in History features the Supreme Court ruling the 19th Amendment Constitutional.
