  "description": "While President Trump wants to celebrate an uptick in retail sales as states reopen, there's still a long way to go before the economy is back on track. Part of the problem is that the wealthiest Americans are saving their cash rather than spending it. <br/><br/>More and more people are leaving their home without a face covering, but experts tell NPR's Maria Godoy they really do help — some more than others. <br/><br/>There has been growing support of the Black Lives Matter movement among white Americans. But why now? Police brutality isn't new.
