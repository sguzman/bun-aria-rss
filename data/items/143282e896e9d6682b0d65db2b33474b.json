  "title": "War Of The Roses PT 1: Is Her Boss Cheating On Her?!",
  "description": "We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.\nWe loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.\nNot only is she dating her boss, she thinks he's being unfaithful! Is someone else in the office catching his eye? We'll find out!\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
