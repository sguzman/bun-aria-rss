    "media:description": "Evolution is a remarkable process. Any life form from lowly sponges to massive whales can show evidence of how the process of adaptation has worked to its benefit over many long generations. Sometimes an adaptation works so well it becomes a defining characteristic of every branch of that life form’s family tree. Other times they probably fail miserably and die out. But the truly interesting thing is when evolution rolls the dice on something a second time. Some trait, some adaptation, arises in one life form, and then a totally separate life form that is barely related, if at all, evolves similar traits independently. And it happens more than you’d think.\n\nLove content?
