  "description": "<p><p>This week's episode features a potpourri of topics for RA and Whits to dive into. They kick off with Philly's Super Bowl beatdown of the Pats and the ripple effect the game will have going forward. The fellas also get into Alex Burrows's dirtbag knee(s) to Taylor Hall's head and the suspension, Marc-Andre Fleury's return to Pittsburgh (and that time he stunk up Whits's car), and a bunch more before finishing up with #AllRightHamilton questions from Grinnelli.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
