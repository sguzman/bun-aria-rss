  "description": "<p>     Can you believe Michael and Steve are almost finished with four seasons of Talking Sopranos? This week they kick things off by talking about what it’s like to pitch a TV show, movie, or book. The arduous process of selling to executives and how many hurdles you have to go through to get a project produced. It’s amazing anything ever gets made! They also share a few of their biggest hits and misses. Looking back maybe that show for Playboy may not have been the best idea…. </p><p>     Then did you know Michael is an actor, writer, producer, director and inventor. He has a few patents pending but let’s say those patents may be pending for quite a while. Not sure how he has time for all this….and the “Steve Motherf**ks the world” video. </p><p>     After that the guys get into this week’s episode and Tony and Carmella’s marriage is definitely starting to fall apart. Carmella is constantly dreaming about Furio, Furio is dreaming about killing Tony, and Paulie is dreaming of a big switch. BTW is Paulie so cheap that he couldn’t pick up the tab for the old ladies? There’s a great story about how Tony Sirico had a problem with Paulie strangling Minn Matrone because he thought it made him look bad. He complained to David Chase and they had him smother her to death instead. It’s all this week on Talking Sopranos S4 – Ep 12 “Eloise”.
