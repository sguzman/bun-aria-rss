  "description": "Today we'll discuss the Left's cartoonish demonization of \"the rich.\" And we'll also talk about the Right's response to that demonization, which is to present a sometimes equally cartoonish narrative about the free market. Somewhere in the midst of all of this oversimplification is the truth. Also, speaking of cartoonish ideas, a gay media outlet has dubbed a male trans MMA fighter \"the bravest athlete in history\" for beating up a bunch of women.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
