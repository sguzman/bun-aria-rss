  "description": "I kick off today with March Madness… and some of the best matchups for the rest of the tournament. Speaking of basketball… I just got back from my daughter’s first traveling tournament. I shed some light on the increasing travel demand I’m seeing. [0:17] We all know inflation is causing prices to rise everywhere… And we should be prepared for them to soar even higher. [5:12] The Fed recently raised interest rates for the first time since 2018… but it remains well behind the curve fighting inflation. I break down Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s terrible performance. [9:35] Sectors like the auto industry are struggling amid supply chain woes. I explain which sectors will continue to experience volatility… and which ones to watch for opportunities. [12:05] President Biden just signed a game-changing executive order for the crypto industry. I share how individual investors can make a fortune in digital assets over the coming years. [13:32] One sector has been unfairly punished in recent years… But as interest rates move higher, it’s poised to reap the benefits. [17:38] Higher prices will cause consumers to change their spending habits… and you may need to restructure your portfolio…  [20:45] Finally, I take a question about Disney (DIS). Long-term listeners know I’m bearish on this stock… Today, I explain what would cause me to change my tune. [24:26] Enjoyed this episode?
