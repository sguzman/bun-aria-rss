  "description": "In this episode we discuss the primary bedroom, which was formerly called the master bedroom. This is one of the most important rooms in the home, especially if you are wanting to put your home up for sale. We talk about the benefits of having a desk in this room and whether it’s a good idea to have one or not, and then how to fit this in there. Four-poster beds are kind of like a room within a room, so make sure you have a big enough space if this is what you want in your primary bedroom. We also discuss what to do in regards to windows and how to space plan around those with your bed, night stand, or even a guest bed, and we talk about using that window space for a balcony. We also talk about various different bedrooms we have done and the details of how they are planned and spaced out.<br /><br />What do you want that space to feel like? 1:49<br />Desks in your space 2:29<br />Visualize what we’re talking about 5:01<br />Wander Lane 12:12<br />Floor mirror 21:07<br />Rachel Parcell’s room 24:34<br /><br />“But when you walk into any space, you want the space to tell you what it is. You want the space to kind of write that story book for you, and so when you think about a magazine shoot, or a page on a magazine, it shows you exactly what it is, and that’s when you’re orienting your furniture. That’s how you space plan it, so you have that magazine shot as soon as you walk into the room.” 9:35<br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
