Rosemarie Truglio of Sesame Workshop and Tara Conley, a media studies professor at Montclair State University, give us tips. <br/><br/>- Limit their exposure to breaking news.<br/>- For the really big stories, pick a quiet moment and start the conversation by asking what kids have heard and how they're feeling.<br/>- Give facts and context: Let kids know that most scary news events are rare. Show them where it is happening on a map.  <br/>- When they ask why something happened, avoid labels like \"bad guys.\" <br/>- Encourage kids to process the story through play, art, even video.<br/>- Take positive action together.
