  "description": "<p>Tiffany Aliche is also known as the Budgetnista and her mission is to make life-changing financial education accessible to women worldwide. She’s been featured on MSNBC, The Today Show, Forbes- and earlier this year she was instrumental in a new law that passed in New Jersey that will have a massive impact on financial education. We also dive into her history with money and how even though she was raised in a household that prioritized money discussions, she still made some costly mistakes that left her broke before climbing out of that debt. Now, she has already helped over 800,000 women worldwide collectively save more than $100 million, and pay off over $75 million in debt, purchase homes, and transform the way they think about their finances.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Mountain Beer Kolsch by Telluride Brewing Co- a big thanks to Alex there are the brewery for donating this beer to the show!
