  "description": "<p>In studio this week Pete Callaway of <a href=\"http://www.callawaycars.com/\">Callaway Cars</a> joins us. Most people know Callaway for their very potent Corvette packages however they provide solutions for many of GM V8 platforms and Pete shares their origins in modifying BMW 3 series' and first gen VW GTIs. It's not often that we have two VERY fast press cars on hand simultaneously and it's a rare day that one of them is a GT-R and it feels slow by comparison.  Matt and Zack fill us in on the insanity that is the Callaway AeroWagen.</p>\n",
