Some of you may have seen Christian before on our YouTube channel where he talks about interest rates, loan products, and other future financing projections. But today, Christian gets to talk about how he not only<strong> built a large rental portfolio</strong> but did so <strong>while running multiple businesses</strong>.</p><p>Even as full-time workers, many Americans feel like they <strong>don’t have enough time in the day</strong> to relax, let alone invest. So how does someone with a jam-packed schedule, a lot of pressure, and a mountain of responsibilities find time to not only buy one rental but <strong>fifteen rental properties in a year</strong>? To Christian, it took a bit of trial and error, but the answer is simply <strong>making your time as efficient as humanly possible</strong>.</p><p>He’s been able to heavily invest, start and <strong>run one of the top </strong><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/glossary/mortgage-broker\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>mortgage brokerages</strong></a> in the country, work as an agent, and provide insurance to clients as well.
