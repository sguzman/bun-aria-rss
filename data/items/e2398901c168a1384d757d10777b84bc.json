  "description": "<p>Part 1 ~ Present Heart: The Universal Expressions of Love (2018-02-07) ~ Lovingkindness: We awaken our natural lovingkindness by learning to attend to and take in the goodness of this life.</p> <p>This series reflects on four primary expressions of an awake, wise heart: lovingkindness, compassion, joy and equanimity. In each talk we explore the habitual patterning that blocks our full realization of these innate capacities, and the understandings and practices that nurture their unfolding.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely.
