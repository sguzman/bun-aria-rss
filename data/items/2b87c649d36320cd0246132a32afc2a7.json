  "description": "At the age of 14, Taylor Wilson became the 32nd person in human history to achieve nuclear fusion. By the time he reached high school, he'd acquired a deep knowledge base in at least 20 fundamental fields of science and engineering. Taylor also developed a medical device that dramatically lowered the cost of cancer detection. Yet he humbly attributes his success to having insatiable passion and curiosity, not aptitude. Get to know the man that Time Magazine called the next Einstein in this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu.   PULLED QUOTES  “I really believe the best way to learn about a topic is to learn the history.”[4:28] “Being able to be in the room with someone who has knowledge about something that I don’t is the best feeling in the world.” [11:52] “If you’re truly curious and you’re truly passionate about something it doesn’t feel like work.
