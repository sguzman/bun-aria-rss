  "description": "<p>Imagine Joseph Smith, not as the prophet of the Restoration, but as a teenager filled with a cheery temperament. What was Joseph like before he was a Latter-day Saint? We get to know a teenager as he becomes a married prophet as Dr. Michael MacKay explains what it means that Joseph “has a work . . . to do.\"  Suppose each religion and people are like a unique, indispensable fabric woven together by the golden thread of the Gospel,  temple covenants, and the Savior; what is our part in the sewing? Dr. Michael MacKay reminds us that every human being has already chosen the Savior. Join us as we discuss how  Joseph Smith brings forth what is to become the most inclusive religion the world has ever known.</p>",
