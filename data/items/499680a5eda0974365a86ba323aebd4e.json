A longtime college administrator who has held the top athletic job at three different schools, Currie breaks down the ways in which colleges spend money, and make money, at a postseason bowl game. Wake Forrest plays Michigan State in the Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium on Dec. 27th, and the team spent the entire week in New York. Currie discusses the myth schools make a lot of money on bowl games, breaking down the cost of travel, food and lodging for the school’s contingent of players, coaches, admins and family members (Flights up to New York, for example, cost $280,000). Currie also discusses possible changes to the NCAA’s amateurism model, and the expectation that at some point soon, athletes will be able to market themselves and make money while playing college sports.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
