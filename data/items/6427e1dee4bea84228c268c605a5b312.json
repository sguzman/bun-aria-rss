  "title": "Ep 117 | The Dark Horses: From Campus Villains to Political Peacemakers | Bret Weinstein & Heather Heying | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "One day, Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying were biology professors at Evergreen State College. The next, they were \"campus villains\" who dared to speak out when the school told white people to take a “day of absence.” Since then, they have become founding members of the “Intellectual Dark Web” and continued their fight for truth in a world gone woke. But with the world changing faster every day, and not necessarily in a good way, they were hit by a realization: Science and evolutionary biology haven’t changed very much. Humans have. Bret and Heather join Glenn to break down where these changes are leading us, as they explore in-depth in their new book, “A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century: Evolution and the Challenges of Modern Life.” From climate change and capitalism to Afghanistan, our “apparently senile Commander-in-Chief,” and the evolution of sex (among flowers), Bret and Heather make the case that the key to escaping the chaos is right in front of us, if we choose to listen.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
