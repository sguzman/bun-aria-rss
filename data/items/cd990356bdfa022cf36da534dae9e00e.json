  "description": "I wish nothing but the best...for youuuuuuu *in Sofia's best Adele voice*\n\nToday is the big day Sloots. Well, every Thursday is a big day for us, but this one is MAJOR. Today Sofia is coming clean. We’re getting the FULL breakdown of Sofia’s break up. We know this has been a hot topic for quite some time now, surrounded by a lot of speculation - but you're FINALLY about to hear it from the horse's mouth...excuse me, Sloots mouth. Aside from the big news and juicy details you all have been dying for, Sofia also has a RIDICULOUS story about encountering ANOTHER ex in a way that would only happen to her...No seriously, if this situation didn't prove that we're living in a simulation, we don't know what will. Elon Musk, knock it the fuck off. Sofia also tells us about how she flew in Mother Sloot (because what else are you supposed to do when you're going through a breakup?), and not only did her mom come immediately - but also proceeded to kick her while she was down....Lola, you're a real one for that because sometimes you just NEED to hear it. Finally, Sofia tells us why in gods name was she dressed up as a stripper in front of \"Rudy Giuliani\". Whew, that was a mouthful and what a life Sofia lives...good thing we get to listen for pure entertainment! Listen with open arms, ears, and mouths Sloots - this one is a doozy. \n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n\nDipsea: http://www.dipseastories.com/SOFIA for 30 days full access\nZola: http://www.Zola.com/\nOsea: http://www.oseamalibu.com use promo code SOFIA for 10% off\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
