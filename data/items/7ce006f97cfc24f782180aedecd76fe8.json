  "description": "For better or worse, artists write. But why would a visual artist write a novel? How should such a novel be experienced? How does the artist’s novel compare or compete with literary fiction as we know it?\nDavid Maroto, the author of The Artist's Novel: A New Medium (Mousse Publishing, 2020) considers the proliferation of artists writing novels as a sign of the emergence of a new medium. Artists engaging in this new medium do so in order to address artistic issues by means of novelistic devices, favouring a sort of art predicated on process and subjectivity, introducing notions such as fiction, narrative, and imagination. Maroto’s work is the first to explore the subject of the artist’s novel in depth.\nDavid Maroto speaks to Pierre d’Alancaisez about the artist’s novel and the demands it makes on its readers and, as he found out through his own practice, on its curators and publishers. David reads from Benjamin Seror's Mime Radio and voices the mythical satyr Marsyas but, sadly, stops short of singing.\nDavid Maroto is a visual artist, researcher, writer, and curator based in Rotterdam.\n\nDavid Maroto’s first novel Illusion\n\n\n\nThe Book Lovers, a project by David Maroto and Joanna Zielinska\n\nBenjamin Seror’s Mime Radio\n\n\n\nGoldin+Senneby‘s Headless\n\n\nAle Cecchetti’s exhibition at Ujazdowski Castle\n\n\nAlex Cecchetti’s novel Tamam Shud\n\n\n﻿\nPierre d’Alancaisez is a contemporary art curator, cultural strategist, researcher.
