While SSDs have taken over the role of the primary drive in most computing systems, hard drives continue to be the storage media of choice in areas dealing with large amount of relatively cold data. Hard drives are also suitable for workloads that are largely sequential and not performance sensitive. The $/GB metric for SSDs (particularly with QLC in the picture) is showing a downward trend, but it is still not low enough to match HDDs in that market segment.</p>\n\n<p>Since the release of the last HDD guide, the availability of Western Digital's OptiNAND-equipped 22TB drives has improved, and Toshiba's new Pro lines for their X300 and N300 lineups have started coming down in price. The high-capacity last-generation (20TB) models have become a lot more affordable - selling prices are running around 15 - 20% lower than launch MSRPs. These make for an interesting update to our list of recommended hard drives for NAS and desktop usage.</p>\n</p><p align=\"center\"><a href='http://dynamic1.anandtech.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a1f2f01f&cb=489583211' target='_blank'><img src='http://dynamic1.anandtech.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=24&cb=489583211&n=a1f2f01f' border='0' alt='' /></a><img src=\"http://toptenreviews.122.2o7.net/b/ss/tmn-test/1/H.27.3--NS/0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
