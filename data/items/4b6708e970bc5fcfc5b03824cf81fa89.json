  "description": "<p>If you’re not familiar with Huma Abedin, that was her intention. For two decades, Huma has been mostly in the background, as the long-time trusted aide of Hilary Clinton. She was reluctantly wrenched from the shadows thanks to the public downfall of her (now ex) husband Congressman Anthony Weiner who was embroiled in multiple sexting scandals, one of which sent him to jail. Now, Huma is choosing to step into the spotlight and tell her own story with the release of her memoir, “Both/And.” “When I started writing this book, my researcher said the two most common articles out there in the world about you, Huma, are, number one, what is wrong with her and, number two, what is she thinking?,” Huma tells Katie. “And so I chose to put exactly what I was thinking into this book.” On this bonus episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie talks with Huma about her career, her history, her intimate relationship with Hillary Clinton, and the heartache and humiliation of her first love.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
