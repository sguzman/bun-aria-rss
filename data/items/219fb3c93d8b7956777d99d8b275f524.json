  "description": "<p>Have you been feeling doubts about your career recently, or perhaps for quite some time? Maybe you're not sure if you're in the right job, or even in the right field, and you can't figure out if you should try to keep making your current position work, or jump ship to something else.</p>\n<p>Then you'll likely recognize yourself in the stages of career transition my guest will describe. His name is <a href=\"https://josephliu.co/\">Joseph Liu</a>. He's a consultant, coach, and speaker who helps people navigate the challenges of switching careers. In his work, he's seen that there's a recurring pattern individuals follow when thinking about and making this weighty decision, which he calls the \"7 Stages of Career Change.\" Today on the show, Joseph walks us through these stages, which begin with Doubt and Dismay and end with Reflection and Relaunch. With each stage, Joseph explains what typically goes through people's minds, common mistakes that are made, and the best actions to take, which sometimes involves transitioning out of your current career, and sometimes does not. We end our conversation with the considerations to keep in mind if you do decide to make a change.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/careerchange\">aom.is/careerchange</a>.</p>\n",
