  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the news that Carson Wentz will have surgery on his foot and is likely out for 5-12 weeks, what this means for the Colts going forward, if Jacob Eason is going to be the guy, Philadelphia not being happy about the situation either, and everything else going on in NFL training camps around the league. Joining the program is arguably the greatest receiver of all-time, 2021 Hall of Fame inductee, Detroit Lions legend, 6x Pro Bowler, 4x All-Pro, and one of the most dominant players in the history of the NFL, Calvin Johnson. Pat, AJ, and Calvin chat about his career as a Lion, what ultimately went wrong between him and Lions leadership, whether or not he likes guy in the league being compared to him, if he ever considered going elsewhere, what he's doing now with his cannabis company, and what his weekend looks like with his Hall of Fame induction (24:30-44:54). Later, joining the show is the first Olympic Gold Medal winner for the United States in women's Taekwondo, Anastasija Zolotic. Pat and Ana chat about her life leading up to the Olympics, how taekwondo works exactly, what her goals are moving forward, if she has any interest fighting in the UFC eventually, and how she's going to celebrate now that she's an Olympic Gold Medalist (1:11:59-1:25:26). Pat and AJ also dive deeper into the Carson Wentz situation, who's doing the surgery on his foot, if the Colts are going to be able to overcome this, and Jerry Jones giving incredible interviews at Cowboys camp.
