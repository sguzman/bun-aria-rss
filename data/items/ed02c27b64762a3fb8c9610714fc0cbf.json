  "description": "<p>In a (1+1)-dimensional scalar quantum field theory, we calculate the\nleading-order probability of meson multiplication, which is the inelastic\nscattering process: kink + meson $\\rightarrow$ kink + 2 mesons. We also\ncalculate the differential probability with respect to the final meson momenta\nand the probability that one or two of the final mesons recoils back towards\nthe source. In the ultrarelativistic limit of the initial meson, the total\nprobability tends to a constant, which we calculate analytically in the\n$\\phi^4$ model. At this order the meson sector conserves energy on its own,\nwhile the incoming meson applies a positive pressure to the kink. This is in\ncontrast with the situation in classical field theory, where Romanczukiewicz\nand collaborators have shown that, in the presence of a reflectionless kink,\nonly meson fusion is allowed, resulting in a negative radiation pressure on the\nkink.\n</p>",
