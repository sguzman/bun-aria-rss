We have Brian Cook from <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/0AZ3VR0YbFcS0Kgei7L2QF?si=ghk92qZZRn2cr-lqjrrNLw&dl_branch=1\">Russian Circles</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4kRYDoAbgDL7nqeqZhJlA3?si=VC_P57lGT7ahOKcFIsuV0w&dl_branch=1\">Botch</a> and most recently, his newly released solo project <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6NJe0HuOOV2sjrI7SdRGt4?si=-_e95rbdRVOXR0LVIkGACQ&dl_branch=1\">Torment & Glory</a> on the podcast this week. I have admired all of his musical endeavors (if you haven't, also listen to Roy) and was glad to be able to wander around in his brain and discuss why Botch covered a classical song, his sexual identity and the culmination of his solo project.
