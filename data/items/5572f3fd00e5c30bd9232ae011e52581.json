  "description": "Click here for the full episode, including the extended interview with David Sirota and a Biden Stoned Moment.\nDavid Sirota, whose site Daily Poster is now The Lever, returns to Useful Idiots as an Academy-Award nominee for his movie Don’t Look Up. And he’s got a message for the Oscars:\nWe’ve got to do something today about climate change. It’s like a giant comet is headed towards earth and no one seems to care.\n“The movie’s giant audience proves that you don’t have to choose between focusing on important things and not having a big audience, or focusing on stupid, silly things and getting a big audience.”\nIn this interview, David gives us the fun stuff: a tour of his celebrity sitings and stories; and then the dark stuff:\nFossil fuels: “Why are we preserving an industry and jobs if in 10 or 20 years, the livable ecosystem that supports all human life is going to be significantly deteriorated or gone?”\nAnd student debt: “Student debt and Joe Biden are a 40-year story. You have to understand how motivated he has been, how much he believes in the idea of student debt. He has been a sculptor of the laws in this country that govern debt for 40 years.”\nTo put it lightly, David Sirota doesn’t trust Joe Biden.\n“If you want to tell people not to believe anything politicians say, if you really want to deeply disillusion people to not believe the government will ever do something concrete and permanent to help, that seems to be the message that Joe Biden is trying to deliver.\n“This is how you turn a country into the joker.”\nPlus, dems are confused why drug prices (that they set) are so high, Marjorie Taylor Greene thinks we’re pro-pedophile, and a total jerk-off on a flight.\nIt’s all this, and more, on this week’s episode of Useful Idiots.
