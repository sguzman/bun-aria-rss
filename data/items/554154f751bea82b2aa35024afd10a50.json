    "media:description": "This video is an introduction to Galois Theory, which spells out a beautiful correspondence between fields and their symmetry groups.  \n\n__\n\nSOURCES and REFERENCES for Further Reading!\n\nThis video is a quick-and-dirty introduction to Galois theory. But as with any quick introduction, there are details that I gloss over for the sake of brevity. To learn these details rigorously, I've listed a few resources down below.\n \n(a) Galois Theory \n\nGalois Theory notes by Tom Leinster: These notes are by far the best resource out there for learning the subject. They’re completely rigorous, but they’re also written in a very reader-friendly way with lots of examples and motivation. (See link here: https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/gt/gt.pdf)\n\nThis playlist on Galois Theory by Professor Richard Borcherds is a gem. It explains Galois Theory from the ground up, rigorously, in almost complete generality. (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8yHsr3EFj53Zxu3iRGMYL_89GDMvdkgt) \n\n(b) Group Theory\n\nGroup Theory lectures: This playlist by Professor Benedict Gross is a beauty. It goes through the entire group theory syllabus from the ground up, and Professor Gross is a masterful lecturer. (see link here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLelIK3uylPMGzHBuR3hLMHrYfMqWWsmx5)\n\nMUSIC CREDITS:\nThe song is called “Taking Flight”, by Vince Rubinetti.\nhttps://www.vincentrubinetti.com/\n\nTHANK YOUs:\n\nExtra special thanks to Davide Radaelli and Grant Sanderson for helpful conversations while making this video!\n\nSOFTWARE USED:\nAdobe Premiere Pro for Editing\n\nFollow me!\nTwitter: @00aleph00\nInstagram: @00aleph00\n\nIntro: (0:00)\nWhat is the square root of 2?: (1:08)\nFields and Automorphisms: (6:04)\nExamples: (8:55)\nGroup Theory: (16:34)\nThe Fundamental Theorem: (18:25)",
