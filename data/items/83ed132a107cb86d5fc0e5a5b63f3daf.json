  "content": "Are you a music listener and <a href=\"http://www.lastfm.com\">lastfm</a> user? Are you interested in helping out research while having the chance to win a $600 Amazon gift card? Please help us understand online music tastes by completing a survey that will only take around 15 minutes of your time and might even be fun!<br /><br />All you need to do to participate is go to <a href=\"http://musicsurvey.webhop.net/MusicSurvey/\">this page</a> and provide your last.fm username and a valid email. We will check if you meet the requirements (at least 18 y.o. and 5000 scrobbles on lastfm) and we will then send you a link to your personalized survey.<br /><br />Thanks for your time!",
