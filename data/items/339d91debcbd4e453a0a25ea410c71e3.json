Lizzo's \"About Damn Time\" just replaced Harry Styles's \"As It Was\" to become the top song on the Billboard Hot 100. Powered by retro instrumentation, a propulsive groove, meme-worthy lyrics, and a generous dose of slash chords (not the Guns 'n Roses guitarist, the harmonic voicing), Lizzo's hit song marks a deepening of the sound she established in past tracks like \"Juice.\" But on other tracks from her latest album Special, Lizzo aims for new aesthetics. \"Coldplay\"—featuring a rare Chris Martin vocal sample—opts for emotional honestly over pithy affirmations. With the upbeat \"Grrrls,\" Lizzo found herself in an online controversy: she had used a ableist slur in the song's lyrics. Taking the criticism as an opportunity to learn, Lizzo chose to replace the offensive line—but have other artists of pop's past always followed suit when met with fan feedback?\n\nSongs Discussed\n\nLizzo - About Damn Time, Juice, Coldplay, Grrrls\nDaft Punk, Pharrel Williams - Lose Yourself to Dance\nMichael Jackson - Rock With You, They Don’t Care About Us\nQuelle Chris, Chris Keys - Sudden Death\nColdplay - Yellow\nBeastie Boys - Girls, Sure Shot\nTaylor Swift - Picture to Burn\nLady Gaga - Born This Way\nOrville Peck - Born This Way\nElla Fitzgerald - How Long Has This Been Going On\nLearn more about your ad choices.
