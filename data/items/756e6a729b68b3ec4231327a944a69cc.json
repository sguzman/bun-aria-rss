  "description": "<p>Sebastian is a standup comedian and friend of Joe’s. They have been doing standup together for over 20 years and to hear how much love and support they have for each other is really cool. Their conversation was very standup comedy based as you would expect but with some great take aways. Sebastian’s career has skyrocketed over the last few years so it’s great to hear him talk about it and how he’s aware to stay normal through it all.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
