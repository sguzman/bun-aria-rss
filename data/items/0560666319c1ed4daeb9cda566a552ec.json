  "description": "Early adulthood is filled with intense emotions and insecurity. What if you never fall in love? What if you can't find work you’re passionate about? You miss home. You miss close friends. You’re lost in the noise of how you think you should be living and worried about wasting what everyone says should be the best years of your life.\nIn her book \"What Now? Meditation for Your Twenties and Beyond (Parallax Press, 2017), Yael Shy shares mindfulness practices to help twentysomethings learn to identify and accept these feelings and respond—not react—to painful and powerful stimuli without pushing them away or getting lost in them. This is not about fixing oneself or being \"better.\" Readers are encouraged to embrace themselves exactly as they are. You are already completely whole, completely loveable, completely worthy. What Now?  shares practices that help us to wake up to this fact.\nThis uniquely tumultuous developmental period is a time when many first live away from home and engage in all kinds of experimentation—with ideas, substances, relationships, and who we think we are and want to be in the world. Yael Shy shares her own story and offers basic meditation guides to beginning a practice. She explores the Buddhist framework for what causes suffering and explores ideas about interconnection and social justice as natural outgrowths of meditation practice.\nYael is the Senior Director of the NYU Global Spiritual Life Center and the NYU 'Of Many' Institute for Multifaith and Spiritual Leadership, as well as the Founder and Director of MindfulNYU, the largest campus-wide mindfulness initiative in the country. She teaches regularly at MNDFL in NYC and is a sought after speaker, teacher, and writer on meditation, higher education and mindfulness.\nKristie Adloff, Psy.D., is a licensed psychologist and mindfulness teacher with an office in Brookline MA. You can visit her website at www.drkristieadloff.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.
