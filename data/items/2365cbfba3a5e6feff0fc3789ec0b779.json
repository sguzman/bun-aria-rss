  "description": "<p>Clay and Buck \"want to commend\" Tucker Carlson for a revealing Kyle Rittenhouse first TV interview. Buck: \"If Biden had any honor, if he was the good guy Joe from Scranton with rolled-up sleeves… he would apologize like a real man for what he said about Kyle Rittenhouse.\" How many journalists have come forward and admitted their coverage of Rittenhouse was lies? Zero. Clay: If half of mechanics or plumbers disappeared it would be a major issue; if half of journalists did, not so much. C&B respond to MSNBC's Joe Scarborough ripping the \"fascist right\" for making Rittenhouse a hero. Stephen Colbert is neither a \"legal expert\" nor a comedian. Soros-backed liberal prosecutors are the reason for the record-high spike in crime. What the heck is going on in San Francisco? Larry Kudlow on inflation: \"It will get worse.\" The Democratic brand is broken and the infrastructure bill isn’t fixing it. Brit Hume (who C&B say is usually very even-keeled) says Biden is clearly deteriorating and clearly senile.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
