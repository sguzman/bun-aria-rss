  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the debate over America's history with slavery should not be conflated with the current push for critical race theory. It should also be abundantly clear that the Democrat Party started the Ku Klux Klan, Jim Crow and fought against the Civil rights act. Karl Marx despised socialists because they gave cover to the capitalists. Marx felt that capitalism must be destroyed and started anew. This is why the Democrats pretend to fix things that can't be fixed. Critical Theory gets applied to all areas of American life, not just race. This type of collectivist thinking damages the psyche of all races through the victim/oppressor dynamic that Marxism thrives on. Then, in a strategic military maneuver, the IDF faked a ground surge and 160 Israeli fighter jets dropped 450 bombs on Hamas terrorists that were hiding in a series of underground tunnels beneath Gaza City. This triggered Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gave a passionately naive speech on the floor of the House condemning Israel for defending itself. Later, Why is Stacy Abrams important? Liz Cheney is more important than she's ever been because she's been stirring the pot against Donald Trump. Abrams hasn't won an election but she's a perpetual thorn in the side of Republicans which helps Democrats so the media will embrace her. In her interview with Anderson Cooper, she disparaged the Arizona vote audit, yet she never conceded her own electoral defeat because she felt her race for governor of Georgia was stolen from me. Afterward, prosecutors are pressuring the current CFO of the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg, by going after his grandson's school donations to find any 'dirt' they can on Trump. Neither Trump nor Weisselberg has done any wrongdoing; this is simply a fishing expedition in search of anything they can make look like a crime (because they don't have one). Until Republicans treat Democrats reciprocally, this injustice will not end.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
