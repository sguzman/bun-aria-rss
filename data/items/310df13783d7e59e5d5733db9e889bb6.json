  "title": "Mothman - 209",
  "description": "Mothman. West Virginia. From November 1966 to December 1967, many strange sightings and occurrences were happening in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Unidentified flying objects, strange men in black suits, & even a large, winged human-like creature named the Mothman. It all culminated in a tragedy known as The Silver Bridge collapse. Forty-six people died when rush hour traffic, backed up on and off the almost 40 years old structure, went down into and near the Ohio River. Some say that the Mothman was a warning. Others believe that the Mothman caused the collapse. Another theory suggests that the killing of a Shawnee Chieftan about 200 years before was the reason for the disaster. Just what was going on in West Virginia back then? John Keel's book, 'The Mothman Prophecies', is full of information on these strange goings on. Justin & Aaron will break it all down for you in this tale of legends, sightings, and disasters.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
