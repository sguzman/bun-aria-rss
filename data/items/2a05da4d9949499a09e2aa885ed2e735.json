  "description": "It's hard to believe Dwayne Johnson hasn't played a superhero before, but he's finally filling this gap in his resume with <em>Black Adam</em>, in which he joins the DC Universe. Brought out of a tomb after thousands of years, the character Black Adam has a mostly dour demeanor which doesn't exactly play to the wisecracking side Johnson has showed in other films. <em>Black Adam</em> also stars Pierce Brosnan, Aldis Hodge, and Sarah Shahi.
