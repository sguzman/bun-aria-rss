  "description": "<p><p>On Episode 95, we're happy to bring you the #2 U.S.-born goal scorer in NHL history, Keith Tkachuk. Big Walt called it like he saw it when he played and, thankfully, nothing has changed. In one of the more entertaining interviews we've conducted, Tkachuk talks about what it's like to have two sons become first round draft picks, when he first recognized their talent, what wisdom he imparted on them, why Chris Pronger was a prick to practice against, why Pronger is one of the best ever, the difference in young stars from his day vs. today, losing a bunch of chiclets for the first time in his career...two months before retirement, playing for Herb Brooks, almost finishing his career in his hometown, what his draft day was like, and a shitload more. This was a fun one. The fellas also break down the Domi/Galchenyuk and Hoffman trades, Trotz to Long Island, and issue an apology for a mistake on the previous ep.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
