    "media:description": "#chinainsights#hujintao\nThe first meeting after the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party CCP ended on October 23rd, granting the CCP leader Xi Jinping a third term as the top leader, and the seven most powerful members of the CCP, the new generation of Politburo Standing Committee members were presented. We see that this is the team thatâ€™s the least competent in governing the country. \nA signal had been dropped the day before. On Oct. 22nd, at the closing of the 20th Communist Party Congress, the world was surprised to see an unprecedented scene. Former Communist Party leader Hu Jintao was \"persuaded\" to leave the podium in advance. \nHow and why?\n\nHave questions? Do you have something to share with us about China?
