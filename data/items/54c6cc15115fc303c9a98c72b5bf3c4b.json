We had never actually met. Now we have. At <a href=\"http://healthfest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Healthfest</a> in Marshall, TX a few months back I had the opportunity to spend an entire weekend with Josh. It was a memorable experience that left me more impressed than ever with this fine young man. Not just because he has overcome tremendous obstacles to restore and maintain his health. Not just because he continues to impressively evolve as an athlete and runner. But because of the exemplary human being he has become. A big spirit who continues to grow. A giant heart and shining example of service — constantly educating and inspiring his loved ones and community at large.</p><p>The story — as laid out in his self-penned manifesto <a href=\"http://joshlajaunie.com/2013/11/20/free-josh-lajaunie/\" target=\"_blank\">“Free Josh LaJaunie”</a>– goes like this:</p><p>In November of 2013, this guy I had never heard of called&nbsp;Josh LaJaunie tweeted me his before and after pictures. The change was so astonishing, my first thought was, can this be real?&nbsp;The 400+ pound guy on the left bore almost no resemblance to the guy on the right, a super fit, handsome young man running with a big smile on his face.</p><p>Chris Farley had morphed into Bradley Cooper. But how?</p><p>On a lark, I invited him on the podcast. I had no idea his story — more importantly his ability to own and tell his story — would be so extraordinary. The experience left me and everyone who tuned in indelibly changed. Ever since, I have felt inexplicably bonded to a guy I never actually met.</p><p>In short,&nbsp;Josh accomplished what some would deem impossible, dropping over 200 pounds and a life-long addiction to unhealthy foods & lifestyle habits to discover a passion for running. A journey that led him to completing multiple marathons and more recently his first ultramarathon. He didn't just lose weight. And he didn't just keep the weight off. He became an athlete.</p><p>A real athlete.</p><p>Most impressive is how he faced, battled and overcame astounding, impossibly entrenched cultural obstacles to change everything about how he lives his life. A gift he now freely and quite joyously shares, permanently transforming the lives&nbsp;of everyone who crosses his path.</p><p>Born & bred in southern Louisiana, Josh is a 100% genuine, authentic, self-avowed “swamp dweller” from Bayou Lafourche. A big kid with an even bigger heart surrounded by a loving nuclear and extended family united by their shared adoration of food. Josh was a standout high school football player, recruited to play college ball. But disillusioned by college life in Arkansas, he dropped out of school, only to&nbsp;return home, aimless and unmoored.
