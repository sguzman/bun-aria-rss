  "description": "<div>COVID-19 has triggered a severe recession and policymakers in European Union countries are providing generous, largely indiscriminate, support to companies. As the recession gets deeper, a more comprehensive strategy is needed. This should be based on four principles: viability of supported entities, fairness, achieving societal goals, and giving society a share in future profits. The effort should be structured around equity and recovery funds with borrowing at EU level.<br>\n<em><br>\nIn this episode we discuss the proposal for a recovery plan outlined in a recent paper by Julia Anderson, Simone Tagliapietra and Guntram Wolff which can be read here <a href=\"https://www.bruegel.org/2020/05/rebooting-europe-a-framework-for-a-post-covid-19-economic-recovery/\">https://www.bruegel.org/2020/05/rebooting-europe-a-framework-for-a-post-covid-19-economic-recovery/</a> <br>\n<br>\nParticipating to this episode:<br>\n<br>\nMaria Demertzis, Deputy Director, Bruegel<br>\nGiuseppe Porcaro, Head of Outreach and Governance, Bruegel<br>\nSimone Tagliapietra, Research Fellow, Bruegel<br>\nGuntram Wolff, Director, Bruegel <br>\n</em><br>\n\n</div>\n",
