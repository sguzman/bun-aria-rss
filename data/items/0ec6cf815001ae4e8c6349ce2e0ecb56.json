Over the past few months, as our daily lives have changed in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we’ve seen people turning to YouTube more than ever. As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, we’ve created <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=int&amp;utm_campaign=HYTW&amp;utm_content=HYTWBPUS\" target=\"_blank\">How YouTube Works</a>&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #4d5156; font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">—</span>&nbsp;a new website designed to answer the questions we most often receive about what we're doing to foster a responsible platform for our community, and explain our products and policies in detail. How YouTube Works will launch in the U.S. today with plans to launch in more countries over time, starting in mid-June.<br /><br /><h3>Answering the important questions </h3><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=int&amp;utm_campaign=HYTW&amp;utm_content=HYTWBPUS\" target=\"_blank\">How YouTube Works</a> addresses some of the important questions we face every day about our platform&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; color: #4d5156; font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">—</span>&nbsp;involving topics such as child safety, harmful content, misinformation, and copyright, as well as tackling timely issues as they arise, like how we have responded to the COVID-19 crisis and how we support elections.
