  "description": "<p>Last week's conversation with David Mankin sparked a conversation about process. This week, we're sharing our own processes and discussing our own ideas about, and approaches to, painting. As you might have guessed there are some differences, but we both share a belief in the importance of process in art-making. We think knowing what works for you is a vital piece of the artistic puzzle. In a wide-ranging conversation we cover the role of ideas in our art-making and discuss the assertion that all artists must know what they are exploring in their work.&nbsp;We also discuss whether inspiration comes externally or internally (or both) and the importance of reflection and thought in our work. Finally, we share the questions we are currently asking ourselves in order to move our work forward.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Louise's book Life Force can be pre-ordered at:<a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e1489dm/metadata/edit\"> </a><a href=\"//\">https://www.louisefletcherart.com/book&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>In the Heights trailer <a href=\"//\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0CL-ZSuCrQ</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
