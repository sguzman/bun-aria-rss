Joe and his team have been making quite a few headlines this year to name a few - they’ve raised $4M dollars in funding for this project from firms like Ludlow ventures and creators like Casey Neistat, Joe was recently named to Forbes 30 under 30 list, and they’ve been trending multiple times for releasing a number of one-off “drops” such as Presubscribe.me which helps creators understand how many people who pay for their content, or OnlyTweets which creates a paywall protected twitter account for creators.\nOn this episode we talk to Joe about his journey into the creator world, how we went from the founding team at YikYak to the product team at Facebook and then eventually why he took the jump to leave his stable job and pursue building Stir.",
