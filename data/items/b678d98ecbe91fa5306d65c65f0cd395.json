  "description": "Senior Sociopaths: How to Recognize and Escape Lifelong Abusers (Anderly Publishing, 2022) is the first book to examine antisocial behavior in the over-50 crowd. This is a far bigger problem than anyone realizes. In America, 14 million people over age 50 could be diagnosed with antisocial, narcissistic, borderline or histrionic personality disorders, or psychopathy. They are not locked up in jails or mental institutions. They live among us, scamming and abusing almost everyone in their lives.\nThis book is written for the millions of people who are trying to get along with a supposedly mature romantic partner, spouse, parent, family member, work colleague or neighbor, but face never-ending turmoil. It reveals hundreds of stories of shocking deceit and manipulation. Readers will learn that they're not alone and they're not crazy — they're dealing with disorder. They will also learn how to escape and recover from the abuse.\nSenior Sociopaths is based on surveys of nearly 2,400 people who lived through the damage inflicted by these disordered people over age 50. They tell shocking, detailed stories about their entanglements, and offer advice on how to escape and recover.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
