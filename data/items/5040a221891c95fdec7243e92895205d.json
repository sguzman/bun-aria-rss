When it comes to data analysis, it’s easy to fall into routine. But no matter how much of a whiz you are at formulas or pivot tables, superb spreadsheet skills only take you so far if you’re working with multiple versions or outdated datasets.</p><p>On average, <a href=\"https://www.bettercloud.com/monitor/state-of-cloud-it-2016/\">employees spend</a> up to eight hours each week—an entire work day—searching for and consolidating information. What if businesses spent their time applying data insights instead of tracking them down?</p><p>We designed cloud-based tools, like Google Sheets, to make it easier to quickly organize and analyze information in one place. Here are five reasons why you should try using Sheets.</p><h2>1. Your data always stays up to date.</h2><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\"><div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>2. You can use Google’s artificial intelligence to speed up analysis.</h2></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\"><div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>3. You can help keep your data secure.  </h2><p>We built <a href=\"https://goo.gl/B7LAAd\">security features</a> across G Suite to help you manage your most sensitive business information. Sheets is no exception.</p><p>Clicking “Share” in the upper righthand corner of your Sheet determines access settings for individual team members, so you stay in control of who can view, edit or comment on your documents. Additional IRM (Information Rights Management) controls allow you to easily <a href=\"https://goo.gl/UB72Xm\">disable options</a> to download, copy or print spreadsheets, and you can <a href=\"https://goo.gl/1kWg8c\">set expiration dates</a> if you need to suspend access to confidential information. Admins also have the power to restrict file sharing within an organization or to allowlist domains.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>4. You can work the way you’re used to working.</h2><p>We get it—you need tools that won’t interrupt work processes (especially if you’ve used those processes forever). That’s why we’ve baked in functionality that teams are used to using.</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Let’s start with functions.</b> You can use <a href=\"https://goo.gl/oB5TdU\">hundreds of functions</a> that you’re used to working with, like VLOOKUP, SUMIFS and IPMT. We’ve also created unique-to-Sheets functions to help you crunch numbers in new ways, like: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/FmCK9T\">FILTER</a> to quickly organize a spreadsheet according to an input, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/cMhg1r\">QUERY</a> to pull specific results out of a central dataset or <a href=\"https://goo.gl/ZEgN9n\">GOOGLEFINANCE</a> to source data directly from <a href=\"http://google.com/finance\">Google Finance</a>. Outside of functions, you can also <a href=\"https://goo.gl/NAM878\">create pivot tables</a> to analyze your data (or let Sheets <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/pivot-cloud-intelligent-features-google-sheets-help-businesses-uncover-insights/\">do it for you</a>.).<br/></li><li><b>What about organization?</b> Color cells using <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/78413\">Conditional Formatting</a>, create drop-down lists with <a href=\"https://goo.gl/9i2XJD\">Data Validation</a> or <a href=\"https://goo.gl/F4ErxA\">freeze headers</a> at the top of your sheet, to make your data presentation-friendly. Once your data is organized, you can <a href=\"https://goo.gl/zxkphV\">visualize</a> it in pie charts, bar charts, line charts—<a href=\"https://goo.gl/QnjqXi\">charts galore</a>. <br/></li><li><b>Editing on the fly.</b> Sheets is available online and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/8ZE74o\">offline</a>—and on desktop web browsers, and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/ZtfHqz\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/rbuXwq\">iOS</a> apps—which means your teams don’t have to stop working during business travel or when Wi-Fi is down.<br/></li></ul><p></p><h2>5. You can automate processes.</h2><p>When information is in one place, it’s easier to automate processes. Let’s say you need to order supplies for your office. Instead of emailing back-and-forth to coordinate purchases you can use G Suite apps instead.</p><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\"><div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p></p><p>Let data drive your business decisions. <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/products/sheets/\">Learn how</a> you can access insights using Sheets or visit the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/Ny75JZ\">G Suite Learning Center</a> for specific product tips.</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>",
