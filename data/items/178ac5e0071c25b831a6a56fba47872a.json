  "description": "<p>Wednesday 5/30 - One thing that was known today is that everybody wants smoke! After Pusha T's recent diss to Drake, it had a lot of people looking at Drake side way's, especially because Pusha T revealed things that no one knew! But does Drake have enough beige rage to come back at Pusha T? so we opened up the phone lines to see what our listeners thought. But with all this commotion we definitely needed Pusha T to make sense on some things he said on the record, so he called in to explain. Also, after Roseanne went on a racist twitter comments on Valerie Jarrett, the ABC president was not having it and cancelled the reboot of Roseanne, in fact Charlamagne even made her \"Donkey of the Day\". We also opened up the phone lines to see what our listeners thought of her tweets.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
