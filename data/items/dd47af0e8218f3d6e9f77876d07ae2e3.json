  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week, we’re talking about one of Sarah’s favorite recent historicals, Diana Quincy’s beautiful <em>Her Night With the Duke</em>, which was on our 2020 Best Romance of the Year list. This one fires on many cylinders, and the conversation it inspired covers a lot of ground. We talk about how you won’t get a better Bridgerton read-alike than this one, about the third-act breakup, why it works and the work it does in a romance, about why widows are allowed to be sexy, about responsibility and aristocracy, about hot golf, and about how modern historicals are really doing the business. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thanks to Avon Books, publisher of Eva Leigh’s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3xjTvPX\"><em>The Good Girl’s Guide to Rakes</em></a><em>, </em>and Kelly Cain, author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KCpHC3\"><em>An Acquired Taste</em></a>, for sponsoring the episode.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our next read along is Julie James’s <em>Something About You</em>.
