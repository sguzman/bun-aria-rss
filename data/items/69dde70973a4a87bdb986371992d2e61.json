  "description": "<p>EPISODE 65 - ANDREY ZVYAGINTSEV & MIKHAIL KRICHMAN - Director & Cinematographer Team - Part 1</p> <p>Team Deakins have an amazing conversation with the Russian collaborative team of Andrey Zvyagintsev and Mikhail Krichman (LOVELESS, LEVIATHAN, THE BANISHMENT). We have been avid fans of their films for years and so this was very special to us. Their films are: The Return, The Banishment, Elena, Leviathan and Loveless. We speak about so many things that we had to make two episodes from the result! In this episode we learn about their unique collaborative process of 20 years, their experiences on The Return, The Banishment and Elena. We speak about VFX, how Andrey works with his actors and how they battle unpredictable elements, like children and weather. A great conversation with true masters of filmmaking!</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: The Return, The Banishment, Elena, Leviathan, Loveless</p>",
