Crowd-source funded, rejected by the film festival circuit and lacking distribution, Kip and Keegan spent the last year traveling the country in a van attending independently organized, homespun screenings. Getting the word out one screen at a time, one audience at a time.</p><p>Then something truly amazing happened. The film fell into the hands of Leonardo DiCaprio. The biggest movie star in the world didn't just fall in love with the movie, he came on board as Executive Producer with a mission: that&nbsp;Cowspiracy&nbsp;become required viewing for everyone and anyone who gives a slightest damn about the health of our planet.</p><p>This week that mission moves towards reality. On Tuesday, September 15, Cowspiracy will premiere on Netflix worldwide.&nbsp;For those of you that have already seen the film, this is a new and improved cut — tighter with updated facts, it demands another view.</p><p>The impact of Leonardo's name and credibility on the film's reach is astronomical and cannot be overstated. I am extremely proud to be an early supporter and associate producer on this&nbsp;project. I'm excited for mainstream audiences to finally discover this important film.
