They will slow China for years in their ability to do both advanced computing and to build top-end military technology. Many are saying, however, that this is a bit like provocations before Pearl Harbor, saying it's so big that it could push China into going after Taiwan or otherwise escalating against the US. I am personally ok with that, because I think China has been too brazen in their attacks against the US, especially in the cyber space, with relatively few repercussions. I just hope that the world can break their supply chains out of China as quickly as possible, similar to what Apple is doing, and that it'll force China to chill out and be friendly again. Their aggression is somewhat understandable as a response to The Great Humiliation, but they've overdone it and become a global menace. And I hope this, and other measures like it, help them dial that back. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/07/biden-administration-tech-restrictions-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:source sans pro,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">MORE</span></span></a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Is China About to Rise or Fall?</strong><br />\nOne of the trends I'm reading most about, and listening to experts most about, is the future trajectory of China. There are two main narratives right now: 1) China is about to crush America and become the dominant world power, and 2) China has unbelievable weaknesses right below the surface, and they're about to materialize and hobble the country. Despte having read multiple books about China and its future, and having listened to dozens of hours of experts debating this, I don't feel like I have a good grasp of things. The best thing I feel I have is a good understanding that these are the primary narratives, which I guess is something. The arguments that they're ascending are easy: So many people, so many people getting a good education, they're stealing the world's intellectual property, they're becoming the world's dominant bullies, which they can because they make everything for everyone, and they also have a functioning government that is thinking very long-term about the success of the country (which the US does not have). The arguments for China's fall are far less discussed, but they include a huge problem of not having enough young people, a major real estate crash, and the fact that so many smart young people are not actually in China because they left to the US or Canada or Europe. Which way this will go is one of the most important variables in the world's future right now, as it will significantly determine other major issues such as North Korea, Taiwan, and Russia. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2022/05/01/is-china-in-decline/?sh=1491f3a53839\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:source sans pro,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">MORE</span></span></a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Luxury Surveillance Becomes the Norm</strong><br />\nI just read <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/10/amazon-tracking-devices-surveillance-state/671772/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a good article</a> about Luxury Surveillance that definitely resonated. Well, mostly. I think there are many people, especially in the security community, who share his desire not to be tracked. But I'd argue most rich people will be fine with it, as long as it's done to their advantage. To me it's is about tradeoffs. What are the benefits of perfect life tracking and ubiquitous personal surveillance? And what are the downsides? How would you like to know everything about everything around you? Who's near your house, how many times they've been there? Whether they've been reported elsewhere? Whether you're walking into a dangerous neighborhood? Etc. I'd argue that as the tech gets better, the downsides will reduce relative to the upsides&mdash;specifically for the top 10% of earners. Those who can pay for it will get all this tracking and monitoring without a lot of the data-broker-drama that comes with it. For the less well-off, they will get that tracking at the cost of their whereabouts and preferences. I don't see the big breach of one's data as a major risk here. Security for these services will be better, just the same as bank and brokerage security is decent for those who use them today. It'll be decent because the rich will demand that it is, and because they also demand to use these technologies. In short, those who are unwilling to share any data will fall in numbers over time. The benefits of providing that data will simply outpace the negatives, and those from the old school who refuse on principle will age out. Hard to imagine, but I think that's where it's going.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/10/amazon-tracking-devices-surveillance-state/671772/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:source sans pro,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">MORE</span></span></a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#01349a\"><span style=\"font-family:lato,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></span></p>\n\n<hr style=\"color:#01349a; background-color:#01349a; height:.5px; border:none;\" />\n\n<p><br />\nAs I move towards my transition to doing UL full-time, which will include the show, building products, consulting, writing books, and other creative endeavors, my creative forces are spinning up again.

I now have had a number of visitors, and my feeder level is starting to drop a bit. I've learned a few things as well, which some of you pointed out. 1) You have to provide cover. The feeder is next to a tree that's gaining some mass, so that's probably helping. 2) You want to be conscious of who you're attracting. Some birds are migratory and there's a theory that it's disruptive to provide permanent food to those who orient their lives around following it. I'm going to keep researching this, but I think the visitors I'm getting are called Cow Birds, which I think are just local types.<br />\n<br />\nFinishing Ryan Holiday's latest book on discipline.
