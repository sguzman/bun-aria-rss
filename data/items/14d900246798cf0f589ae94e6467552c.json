  "title": "Ep 224 | Phil Robertson's Answer to Cancel Culture and the People in Power Who Want to Silence You",
  "description": "Phil and Al share the best response to people in power who want to censor, silence, and punish you. They offer a blueprint for standing up for what's right in a culture where conservative Christians are canceled for their beliefs. But first, Phil gives his Super Bowl review, and it's not pretty. He also talks about the sermon he preached on hope. Al and Phil get a good chuckle out of Acts 5, and Al points out how much Phil's \"Duck Dynasty\" experience mirrors that text.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
