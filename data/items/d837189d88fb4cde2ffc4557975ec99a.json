  "description": "<p>r/Pettyrevenge In today's episode, OP's entitled mom decides to steal OP's car, even though OP is the one who made all the payments for it. OP was just a teenager when she first bought the car, so OP's mom was able to trick her by convincing OP to put the car in the mom's name, which enabled her to steal it after OP made the last payment. OP wasn't about to accept this without a fight, so she hid dead fish in the car's upholstery. Enjoy your stinky ride!</p>\n",
