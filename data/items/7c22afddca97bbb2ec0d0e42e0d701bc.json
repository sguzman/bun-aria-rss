  "description": "<p>A fall garden can be an incredible way to extend your growing season and add extra food reserves for the long winter.  However, for quite some time I held the belief that a fall garden was something you started in the fall.  While I’d like to say I learned my lesson after missing it the first time, this definitely wasn’t the case.  In today’s episode I explain how to determine when you start planting your fall garden, when to harvest, and what types of foods will grow in your climate at this time of year.  If you’re like me and looking to squeeze every last drop from your garden this year this is the episode for you.</p><p>A big thanks to our August sponsor— Union Wireless!
