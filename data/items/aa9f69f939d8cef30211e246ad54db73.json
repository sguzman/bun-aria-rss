  "description": "<p>Probably A Podcast is back for a new season and Shannon is here to update you on her life and travels. The plane they take from Nashville to London? Not a vibe, but she made it to James’ family trip to Portugal. She discusses how long distance is affecting her and if it’s changed since her relationship first started. Did she tan topless when she found out who thinks tan lines are tacky? Is James going to come visit the US? What the fuck is Dey House? Where is she going next? Listen to episode 31 and find out all of this and more. </p>",
