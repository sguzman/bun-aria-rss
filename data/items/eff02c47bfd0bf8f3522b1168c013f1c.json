  "description": "<p>Symmetric mass generation is a novel mechanism to give gapless fermions a\nmass gap by non-perturbative interactions without generating any fermion\nbilinear condensation. The previous studies of symmetric mass generation have\nbeen limited to Dirac/Weyl/Majorana fermions with zero Fermi volume in the free\nfermion limit. In this work, we generalize the concept of symmetric mass\ngeneration to Fermi liquid with a finite Fermi volume and discuss how to gap\nout the Fermi surfaces by interactions without breaking the U(1) loop group\nsymmetry or developing topological orders. We provide examples of Fermi surface\nsymmetric mass generation in both (1+1)D and (2+1)D Fermi liquid systems when\nseveral Fermi surfaces together cancel the Fermi surface anomaly. However, the\nU(1) loop group symmetry in these cases is still restrictive enough to rule out\nall possible fermion bilinear gapping terms, such that a non-perturbative\ninteraction mechanism is the only way to gap out the Fermi surfaces. This\nsymmetric Fermi surface reconstruction is in contrast to the conventional\nsymmetry-breaking mechanism to gap the Fermi surfaces. As a side product, our\nmodel provides a pristine 1D lattice regularization for the (1+1)D U(1)\nsymmetric chiral fermion model (e.g., the 3-4-5-0 model) by utilizing a lattice\ntranslation symmetry as an emergent U(1) symmetry at low energy. This opens up\nthe opportunity for efficient numerical simulations of chiral fermions in their\nown dimensions without introducing mirror fermions under the domain wall\nfermion construction.\n</p>",
