Joining the program like he does every Friday, is the star of season's 3 and 4 of Last Chance U, Coach Jason Brown. Pat, AJ, and JB chat about his thoughts on college football as a whole, Urban Meyer, Lane Kiffin's comments last week before the Alabama game, who he thinks the next college coach will be to make the jump to the NFL, and his college picks for this weekend (18:32-40:11). Next, the starting TE for the Buffalo Bills, Dawson Knox, joins the show to chat about his time in Buffalo so far, what Josh Allen is like in the locker room and on field, the Bills Mafia fans, what he learned from the TE Summit, how this week's matchup against the Chiefs is an important one, and much more (42:15-59:29). Next, Pro Bowler, RB for the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Jones joins the show to chat about how the season has been going so far, not getting complacent after getting a contract, his interests in cryptocurrency, what it's like playing with Aaron Rodgers, if he's boys with Lil Wayne, and having an \"unfamiliar\" opponent this weekend in the Bengals (59:33-1:13:15). Later, Pat and AJ go through the entire week 5 NFL slate and pick every single game against the spread as they preview another pivotal week of the NFL season (1:14:24-1:42:34).
