  "description": "Click here for the full episode, including an explosive extended interview with Scott Ritter.\nFormer US Marine Corps intelligence officer and Chief UN Weapons Inspector Scott Ritter resigned his post in protest of US war mongering.\nImmediately, he was mocked by Joe Biden. And when the FBI came after him, well, as he puts it, it went something like:\n\nSo when he joined the Useful Idiots to discuss Joe Biden, he (like many of our recent guests), didn’t have much nice to say.\n“The marine in me says he stinks. He went to war knowing it was a lie and his chief of staff told me he knew it was a lie. And yet he held a hearing that lied to the American people about a threat that put marines, soldiers, sailors, and airmen’s lives at risk. People died. And not just our people, Iraqis. They didn’t deserve this, but they got it.\n“And the person that gave it to them? Joe Biden. He’s the President of the United States today, and I have zero use for the man. That’s about as honest as I can get.”\nHe details Biden’s terrible approach to the war in Ukraine and the simple steps he’d need to end the whole thing and reach peace. But of course, Biden’s gonna Biden.\nAnd hear the extended episode where Ritter shares some explosive takes and seething views of the government whose war crimes have led to countless deaths.\nOh, and if you want to win our hearts, take advice from Scott Ritter with quotes like:\n“You guys probably get far more viewers than CNN does, so you’re far more influential.” He’s right, especially after CNN+ officially shut down this week (thanks to viewers like you).\nPlus, Biden’s Trumpian approach to Assange, an MSNBC pundit joins the war, and Katie and Wilson debate whether Ted Cruz meant that Mickey would be “going at it” with Pluto or with Goofy.\nIt’s all this, and more, on this week’s episode of Useful Idiots.
