Get 10% OFF BEVEL CLICK HERE: http://bit.ly/85SouthxBevel The 85 South Show hit the road and came to a sold out packed house in Greenville, South Carolina. You know they had to sing the hit \"Everybody Has Roaches\" plus brand new songs about things like drug dealers body type and you know they had to roast the entire audience. In Part 1, the show gets pretty wild but the team also takes a moment to examine the events in Charlottesville and provide insight. Chico Bean, Karlous Miller, And Chico Bean get to know the crowd with there own individual stand up performances and then they crank up the podcast! Plus two lesbians get in on the roasting action and you wouldn't believe what happens when the crew spots them front and center. ▶subscribe AND SHARE our videos!!! https://bitly.com/85tube ▶INTAGRAM! https://www.instagram.com/85southshow/ ▶ TWITTER https://twitter.com/85SouthShow ▶FACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/85southshow/ KARLOUS MILLER - https://www.instagram.com/karlousm/ DCYOUNGFLY - https://www.instagram.com/dcyoungfly/...
