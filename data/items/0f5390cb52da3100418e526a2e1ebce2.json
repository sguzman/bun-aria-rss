It's been called the most influential business book of the 20th century and the principles it espouses have become embedded in our culture. <em>The 7 Habits</em> has had a big impact on my own life since the first time I read it over 20 years ago as a high schooler. A 30th anniversary edition of the book is out with new insights from the late Stephen Covey's children. Today, it's my pleasure to speak to one of them, <a href=\"http://franklincovey.com/\">Stephen M.R. Covey</a>. Stephen is the oldest of the Covey children, played an instrumental role in the launch of the first edition of <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>, as well as in his father's company, Franklin Covey, and is himself the author of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416549005/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1416549005&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Speed of Trust</em></a>. Today on the show, Stephen and I discuss why <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em> has had such staying power and why it's just as relevant today as it was 30 years ago. We then walk through the seven habits, exploring how each is lived individually, as well as work together to create a flourishing life. If you've never read <em>The 7 Habits</em>, this episode is a great introduction. And if you've read it before, this is a succinct refresher on a set of principles worth building your life around.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/sevenhabits\">aom.is/sevenhabits</a>.</p>\n",
