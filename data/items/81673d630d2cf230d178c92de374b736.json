  "title": "Ep 126 | EcoHealth Alliance's Peter Daszak: Hero or Villain? | Matt Ridley | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Like most people, science journalist Matt Ridley just wants the truth. When it comes to the origin of COVID-19, that is a tall order. Was it human-made? Did it leak from a laboratory? What is the role of gain-of-function research? Why China, why now? Ridley’s latest book, \"Viral: The Search for the Origin of COVID-19,\" is a scientific quest to answer these questions and more. A year ago, you would have been kicked off Facebook for suggesting COVID originated in a lab. For most of the pandemic, the Left practically worshipped Anthony Fauci. But lately, people have been poking around. And one of the names that appears again and again is Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance and a longtime collaborator and funder of the virus-hunting work at Wuhan Institute of Virology. In this episode of the Glenn Beck Podcast, Matt reveals the whole tangled web.  \n \nSponsor: \n\nPreborn partners with clinics in the highest abortion-rate cities and regions. Preborn has a passion to save babies and to see these women come to Christ. Over the past 15 years, they’ve counseled over 340,000 women considering abortion: More than 169,000 babies have been saved, and over 51,000 women have surrendered their lives to Christ.
