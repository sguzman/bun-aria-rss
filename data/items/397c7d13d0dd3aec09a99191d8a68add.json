    "media:description": "Villano Antillano discusses her journey, career, how she is breaking barriers in music and how we can acknowledge the intersectionalities within the Latinx community.\n\nVillano Santiago Pacheco, known by her stage name, Villano Antillano, has been one of the pioneers of the queer movement within the urban genre in Puerto Rico. Born in Bayamón, Villano Antillano considers herself a transfemme woman whose approach to music is as challenging and irreverent as it is magnetic and revolutionary. As an audio-visual artist, she is the true owner of the \"flow\" and the chanting. Her songs go beyond the trap and urban genres – they are revealing lyrics that tell the beauty and also the horror of growing up as a queer person in the Caribbean. Additionally, Villano is the first trans artist in the world to reach the top 50 Spotify Global and the most listened to trans artist in the world today.\n\nModerated by Jacqueline Serrano.",
