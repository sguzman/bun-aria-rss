Today we're speaking with Dr. Ben Van Handel, Ph.D. He is a stem cell biologist and also the co-founder of Heraux.

He will also talk about some of the most common skin conditions like acne, rosacea, and eczema, how they all have an inflammatory component, and the best ways to treat them. Also, he's going to talk about the chemistry behind some of the most popular skincare ingredients like retinol, peptides, and vitamin C, to explain how they work in the skin and make complicated biological processes like epigenetic, stem cell regeneration, and autophagy.</span></p>",
