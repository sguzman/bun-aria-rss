Amber Heard’s legal team claims a person not called to jury duty was inadvertently seated on the jury for Johnny Depp's defamation lawsuit.   At issue is juror number 15. Heard's legal team says a 52-year-old man responded to a jury summons and was seated on the jury, but the summons was for a 77-year-old man with the same last name living at the same address.   Judge Azcarate wrote “there is no evidence of fraud or wrongdoing” during the six-week civil trial, according to Fox News. Azcarate said the summons listed the juror’s legal name but not a birthdate. The juror reportedly went on to list his birthdate on a juror questionnaire.
