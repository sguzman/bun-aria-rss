Comedian/Writer/Producer April Kidwell and her butt buddy Scott are having a hard time in their relationship, going from broken limbs to life tragedy to a sports injury that breaks *another* leg. So they escape by going on holiday and pushing each other’s wheelchairs from Space Mountain to Star Wars World - and then polish it off with an inaugural booty blast back in the hotel room.
