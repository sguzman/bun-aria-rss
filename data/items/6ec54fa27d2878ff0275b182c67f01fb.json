  "description": "<div>\n<strong>FAM!! Season 2 of the Obsessed Network Original Podcast \"Strange & Unexplained With Daisy Eagan\" launches today!</strong><br>\n<br>\nIn case you aren't familiar, “Strange & Unexplained is a podcast about all the things that make us wonder. Each week host Daisy Eagan tells the tale of something strange–sometimes it’s paranormal like a haunting or alien encounter, other times it Earthly like an unexplained disappearance or an unsolved murder. But it’s always a twisted tale of something just beyond what we can easily understand.  And each story is told with Daisy’s trademark blend of  humor, sass, and skepticism. <br>\n<br>\nIn this episode, Daisy investigates what lurks inside the walls - Hidden Rooms: <br>\nHave you ever had one of those dreams where you discover other rooms in your <br>\napartment? Like, suddenly there’s a door you never noticed before, and beyond it<br>\nis all the extra space you always wish you had? Or maybe you’ve had the <br>\nnightmare version where you open your closet door and instead of your clothes, <br>\nyou’re looking at some kind of medieval torture dungeon. What would you do if <br>\nyou actually found a hole in your home leading to somewhere else. <br>\n<br>\nFind and follow \"Strange And Unexplained With Daisy Eagan\" wherever you get your podcasts.</div>\n",
