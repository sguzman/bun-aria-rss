    "media:description": "How do we capture the meaning of \"may\" or \"can\"? What kinds of linguistic math do we need to understand them? In this week's episode, we take a look at modality: where words like \"must\" fit in our meanings; how we consider many ways the world could be to account for their semantics; and how the same string of sounds can have a lot of flavours.\n\nThis is Topic #90!\n\nThis week's tag language: Cornish!\n\nRelated videos:\nLogical Connections: How Logical Is Language? https://youtu.be/lw4ykgRtv3Q\nLet's Talk About Sets: How Do We Build Meaning with Math? https://youtu.be/M96aiDk2ePw\nQuantifying Sets and Toasters: What Does \"Most\" Even Mean? https://youtu.be/U1l3C_hmjqM\n\nLast episode:\nRelatively Close: How Can Sentences Work Like Adjectives? https://youtu.be/Bra5gExyPbY\n\nOther of our semantics and pragmatics videos:\nTopic of Focus: How Do We Signal What's Important When We Talk? https://youtu.be/gZ6o8yFvJYI\nDownward Spiral: Why Can't \"Any\" Go Just Anywhere? https://youtu.be/vd8cjyxHQdw\nBuilding Common Ground: How Do We Build Shared Worlds in Conversation? https://youtu.be/gQqXmhqM13U\n\nOur website also has extra content about this week's topic, on the syntax of modals, at: http://www.thelingspace.com/episode-90/\n\nFind us on all the social media worlds:\nTumblr: http://thelingspace.tumblr.com/\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/TheLingSpace\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thelingspace/\n\nAnd at our website, http://www.thelingspace.com/ !\nYou can also find our store at the website, https://thelingspace.storenvy.com/\n\nWe also have forums to discuss this episode, and linguistics more generally.\n\nSources:\nA good portion of the presentation was based off of Kai von Fintel's Intensional Semantics notes (http://web.mit.edu/fintel/fintel-heim-intensional.pdf)\n\nWe also consulted Angelika Kratzer's papers from 1977, 1981, and 1991, where all these ideas about modality originally come from:\n\nThe 1977 paper: http://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/s08/semantics2/kratzer77.pdf\n\nThe 1981 paper: http://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/s08/semantics2/kratzer81.pdf\n\nThe 1991 paper: https://udrive.oit.umass.edu/kratzer/kratzer-modality.pdf\n\nFor background -- historical and otherwise -- we consulted Basic Concepts in Modal Logic (https://mally.stanford.edu/notes.pdf) and William Starr's lecture notes: (http://williamstarr.net/teaching.html). \n\nFinally, we drew some inspiration from Seth Cable's recent (and wonderfully lucid) Formal Semantics notes: http://people.umass.edu/scable/LING620-SP17/Handouts/\n\nLooking forward to next time!",
