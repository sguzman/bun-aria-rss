  "description": "<p>Jessica St. Clair and June Diane Raphael waste no time getting INTO ALL OF IT on the inaugural episode of “The Deep Dive.” They check in on their precarious mental states and relive memories from their first friend date almost 15 years ago when their first guest, Casey Wilson (Happy Endings, Bitch Sesh podcast) took a risk and asked Jessica what she was “doing with her pubes.” They discuss how to begin the healing process from the trauma of the pandemic (which in a perfect world would involve having sex with numerous strangers and doing a ton of hallucinogenic drugs in a hut in the desert.) Then, Casey Wilson joins to speak on her own healing journey, from psychics to kitchen healers and most recently, a gift certificate she was given to go see a wizard.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can find Casey's book, The Wreckage Of My Presence here:</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-wreckage-of-my-presence-casey-wilson?variant=32258231664674__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!MPpfCs4bZ2CYIzaXDOotIRaWYc2OuDcs6J9tTndDmjbQV0K9OmcOhOX9Mn-xJg$\">https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-wreckage-of-my-presence-casey-wilson?variant=32258231664674</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can follow The Deep Dive on Twitter @thedeepdivepod </p>\n<p>June Diane Raphael @MsJuneDiane on Twitter @junediane on Instagram</p>\n<p>Jessica St. Clair @Jessica_StClair on Twitter @stclairjessica on Instagram</p>\n<p>Check out the Jane Club at <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.janeclub.com/__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!MPpfCs4bZ2CYIzaXDOotIRaWYc2OuDcs6J9tTndDmjbQV0K9OmcOhOVXLMdwTw$\">www.janeclub.com </a></p>\n",
