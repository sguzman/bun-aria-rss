  "description": "<p>Beach House is a psych-pop band with a die-hard cult following. Since their 2006 debut album, their lush, cinematic sound has been sampled by artists like Kendrick Lamar and The Weeknd. And Kanye recently posted a picture on Instagram collaborating with Beach House in the studio. </p><p>In January, Beach House began releasing their most ambitious project yet—a double album that debuted at number one. It’s called <em>Once, Twice, Melody</em> and it’s their first entirely self-produced album and the most dynamic in scope. On today’s episode Broken Record producer Leah Rose talks to Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally of Beach House about the inner-workings of their unique creative partnership. They also talk about how the warmth of Bob Marley’s music has indirectly inspired the band, and they explain why sometimes you have to just get over yourself for the sake of show business. </p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord\">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Hear a playlist of all of our favorite Beach House songs <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2B2go2CornnTa1G2tzBgUD?si=e453f73a2ba14100&pt=090ff2380175204157eb758df3eeacf0\"><u>HERE.</u></a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
