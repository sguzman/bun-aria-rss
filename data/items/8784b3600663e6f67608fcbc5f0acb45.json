Most of us try to lose weight from frustration, restriction and punishment. Ummm, that rarely works and when it does it doesn't last. I lost 100lbs because I decided to start caring and telling myself I deserved more. We will talk today about building motivation, having compassion for yourself, and figuring out how to lose weight for the long haul.</p> <p> </p>",
