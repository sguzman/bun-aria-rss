  "description": "<p>Rasputin is one of the strangest historical figures out there. He was a Siberian peasant who ended up becoming part of the Tsar's inner circle due to his alleged healing abilities. He also helped getting Russia's royal family murdered when the Russian people came to believe he was possessed by the Devil, partly because he was sleeping with about half of St. Petersburg, holding odd religious orgies, and doing stuff like getting drunk and waving his penis around at restaurants. Not cool for a guy the country assumes his sleeping with the Tsarina. Learn all about this mad monk and Russia's transition from imperialism to communism in a truly fascinating suck!   This episode of Timesuck is brought to you by the Fantasy Footballers podcast. https://www.thefantasyfootballers.com/ The best fantasy football advice you can find and the most fun you'll have listening to it.
