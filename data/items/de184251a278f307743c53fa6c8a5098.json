Tell yourself, tell other people, repeat it like crazy, and then make sure that you embody the emotion…” [13:32]<br /><br />“People can hate you all they want, but if you can outperform them they can’t stop you!” [14:37]<br /><br />“I trust myself to do two things; one, leave it all out on the field.
