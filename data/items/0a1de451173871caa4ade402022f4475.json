    "media:description": "Topos Institute Colloquium, 6th of October 2022.\n———\nThe formalisation of mathematics with proof assistants has recently seen a \nconsiderable increase in activity, with fast-expanding, flourishing communities attracting computer scientists, mathematicians and students. I will discuss the philosophy and motivation behind the use of modern proof assistants to formalise mathematics, referring to the state of the art and potential of the area and to recent developments involving the formalisation of advanced, research-level mathematics. I will share my experiences from my participation in the ERC project \"ALEXANDRIA: Large-Scale Formal Proof for the Working Mathematician\" (https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/Grants/Alexandria/) at the University of Cambridge led by Professor Lawrence C. Paulson FRS and I will give an overview of the main contributions and achievements of the project so far.",
