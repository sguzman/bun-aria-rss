  "description": "<p>Some of the most infamous trials in American history revolve around a small town in Massachusetts named Salem. Salem and witches have become intertwined through the years and a study in human psychology surrounding the events of the Salem Witch Trials reveals a very heinous side to humanity. The use of the terminology \"witch hunt\" was inspired by the Salem Witch Trials. Today, we explore not only the historic events themselves, but what led several communities to turn on their neighbors leading to deadly results. We also will look at the tales of curses and hauntings that spawned from the Salem Witch Trials. Moment in Oddity features the Palm Sunday Case and This Day in History features the first time prize fighting rules were put to paper.</p> <p>The History Goes Bump Podcast is completely listener supported and we want to keep it ad free and sponsor free.
