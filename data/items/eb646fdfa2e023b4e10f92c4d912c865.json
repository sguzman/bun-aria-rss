  "description": "<p>In this psalm of David, we see David’s desire to behold the beauty of God. It is the beauty of God, in fact, that allows David to hold his head high even though his enemies surround him. To find God beautiful means that the perception of him— his attributes, names, and actions— brings pleasure. This sermon will explore the beauty of God: 1) Why we need it; 2) What it is; 3) How it changes our lives.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 8, 2011. Series: To Know the Living God – The Adequacy of God. Scripture: Psalm 27:1-14.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
