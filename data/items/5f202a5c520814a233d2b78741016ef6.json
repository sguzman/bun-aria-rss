This is one of the darkest episodes of History on Fire. But there are reasons for this journey into the heart of darkness. The stories of Sand Creek and My Lai offer an opportunity to explore human agency, the choices separating good and evil, and how some individuals can choose to become sources of light even in the most horrible circumstances. In this first part, we will explore the events that in Colorado in the late 1850s and early 1860s led to a dramatic clash between the Cheyenne tribe and the United States. Within the context of this painfully ugly story, 26-year-old Captain Silas Soule offers a shining example of heroism.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">This episode is sponsored by the CNN Original Series&nbsp; “Pope: The Most Powerful Man in History.” This dramatic six part series is narrated by Liam Neeson and links recent news events surrounding the Vatican to their unexpected historical origins in the Catholic Church. <strong>“POPE” AIRS SUNDAYS AT TEN PM EASTERN ON CNN. </strong>It premieres on Sunday, March 11 at 10 pm Eastern.</p><p class=\"\">This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.blueapron.com/onfire\">www.blueapron.com/onfire</a> For less than $ 10 per meal, Blue Apron delivers straight to your door seasonal recipes along with pre-portioned ingredients to make delicious, home-cooked meals.
