  "description": "On today's show, Pat discusses whether or not he thinks having a QB on a rookie contract and paying other pieces is the way to win a Super Bowl for the foreseeable future, and the guys look ahead to tonight's Vikings vs. Rams game and how Sean McVay has had so much success this early, and Pat explains why he misses watching Lev Bell play football. Later, the voice and face of college football, King of College Gameday, Kirk Herbstreit, joins the show. They discuss how his career has gotten to the point it's currently at, his ridiculous travel schedule, what it's like working with Lee Corso on a weekly basis, what some of his favorite college football environments are, and who he thinks will win the National Championship this year (57:50-1:18:23). It's a good one. Cheers.\n",
