    "media:description": "The first global financial crisis erupted in the autumn of 1987 on a day known as “Black Monday.” A chain reaction of market distress sent stock exchanges around the world plummeting in a matter of hours. In the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 22.6 percent in a single trading session, a loss that remains the largest one-day stock market decline in history.  At the time, it marked the sharpest market downturn in the United States since the Great Depression.\n\nIn today's video we look at the causes of the 1987 crash, discuss program trading and portfolio insurance and how the crash forever changes stock markets around the world.\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nPatreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\n\nVisit our website: www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://twitter.com/PatrickEBoyle\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join",
