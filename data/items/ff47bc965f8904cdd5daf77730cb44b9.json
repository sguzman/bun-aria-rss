  "description": "<p>May 4, 2007. Belton, MO. Seventeen-year-old Kara Kopetsky walked out of her high school on May 4, 2007, and disappeared without a trace. From those early days, her mother, Rhonda, suspected Kara’s ex-boyfriend, Kylr Yust, was involved in her disappearance, but there was no way to prove it without physical evidence. So Rhonda waited for a crack in the case. On September 8, 2016, 21-year-old Jessica Runions was last seen leaving a party with Kylr Yust and disappeared afterward. Two missing women almost ten years apart with connections to a single man. Was it a coincidence? Or was Kylr Yust involved in two disappearances and possible murders?</p><p>All caught up on Gen Why episodes? Get more here: www.patreon.com/generationwhy</p><p>Listen ad free with Wondery+.
