That <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/10/ada-lovelace-walter-isaacson-innovators/\">Ada Lovelace</a> was Byron's daughter is kind of wild, but we're glad she's known for <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-ada-lovelace\">being her own person</a>. Despite Sarah trying to create an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_authorship_question\">authorship question</a> for Byron, that's not really a thing.
