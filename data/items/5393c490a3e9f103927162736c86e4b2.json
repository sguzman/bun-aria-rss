  "description": "<p>Alec Baldwin speaks with two individuals using media to inspire, inform – and transform –  civic engagement in America.  Civil rights attorney Scott Hechinger is the founder and executive director of Zealous, an organization harnessing the power of storytelling for social justice. Hechinger believes that inaccurate narratives on crime and policing help shape perception<em> and</em> policy - and he’s seeking to change that. With Zealous, Hechinger works with public defenders and advocates on campaigns that aim to change a broken criminal justice system and push for true public health and safety. Robert Greenwald is the founder of Brave New Films, a non-profit whose goal is to educate and mobilize the public on social issues like voter suppression, immigration and war profiteering. Greenwald is an Emmy- and Peabody-winning director of television and film, including “Xanadu” and “The Burning Bed,” but pivoted to documentary and put his talents to work for political action.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
