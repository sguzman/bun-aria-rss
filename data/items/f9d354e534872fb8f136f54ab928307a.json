  "description": "<p>Grant takes us back to mid-century America to talk about an emblematic episode of the Cold War. During the Second World War, a number of Americans went behind the government's back to aid an ally. Less than ten yers later, two of them were blamed for millions and millions of deaths, and sentenced to death on coerced and extremely tenuous testimony. Can the letter of the law stand against its use as a weapon? Did an act of state cruelty feed further cruelty, and could clemency have reduced fear? Is this just a game of chicken gone wrong?</p>\n<p>Please help our show succeed by sharing it. Send a link to someone you know and tell them what you enjoy about History Honeys.
