  "description": "<p>The theory of f(R)-gravity is one of the theories of modified Einstein\ngravity. The vacuum solution, on the other hand, of the field equation is the\nsolution for black hole geometry. We establish here an asymptotically flat\nrotating black hole solution in an f(R)-gravity. This essentially leads to the\nmodified solution to the Kerr black hole. This solution exhibits the change in\nfundamental properties of the black hole and its geometry. It particularly\nshows that radii of marginally stable and bound orbits and black hole event\nhorizon increase compared to those in Einstein gravity, depending on the\nmodified gravity parameter. It further argues for faster spinning black holes\nwith spin (Kerr) parameter greater than unity, without any naked singularity.\nThis supports the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis.\n</p>",
