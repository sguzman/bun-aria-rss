    "media:description": "In this video I'll show how to create Linear Regressions with StatsModels. We'll explore the awesome datasets provided by StatsModels. I'll also be showing how to work through 2 examples using a combination of NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels and Seaborn.\n\nWe'll explore whether a professors rating has anything to do with how attractive they are. Also we'll explore how to get bigger tips.\n\nCode is Here : https://github.com/derekbanas/StatsModelsRegressions\n\nI will be covering TensorFlow in detail over the next few weeks. \n\nMY UDEMY COURSES ARE 87.5% OFF TIL June 28th ($9.99)\nhttps://www.udemy.com/\n\n➡️ Python Data Science Series for $9.99 : Highest Rated & Largest Python Udemy Course + 56 Hrs + 200 Videos + Data Science https://bit.ly/Master_Python_34\n\n➡️ New C++ Programming Bootcamp Series for $9.99 : Over 23 Hrs + 53 Videos + Quizzes + Graded Assignments + New Videos Every Month https://bit.ly/C_Course_34\n\nI Live Code Here : https://www.twitch.tv/derekbanas\n\nProbability in One Video : https://youtu.be/sEte4hXEgJ8\nStatistics in One Video : https://youtu.be/tcusIOfI_GM\nNumPy in One Video : https://youtu.be/8Y0qQEh7dJg\nPandas in One Video : https://youtu.be/PcvsOaixUh8\nMatplotlib in One Video : https://youtu.be/wB9C0Mz9gSo\nSeaborn in One Video : https://youtu.be/6GUZXDef2U0\nPlotly in One Video : https://youtu.be/GGL6U0k8WYA\nDatasets Mentioned : https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html\nFree Math Quizzes : https://bit.ly/LAQuizzes\n\n#Python #DataScience #StatsModels\n\nThe most in demand skills in the world right now are in Data Science & Machine Learning!
