But sometimes the best way to achieve a goal is to actually subtract something from your life, and to stop doing the things that are making you miserable.<br />That's the approach today's guest took in his latest book, How to Be Miserable: 40 Strategies You Already Use. His name is Randy Paterson, and he's a psychologist. Today on the show, we discuss the things he's seen with his patients -- common lifestyle choices and thinking patterns -- that make them miserable, and what you can do to eliminate those things from your life.</p>\n",
