  "description": "America has forgotten how blessed it has been throughout its history. But Michael Medved hasn’t just studied history – he’s lived it. He worked on the Robert F. Kennedy campaign on the day he was shot. He went to Yale Law School with Bill and Hillary Clinton. He’s a former liberal activist who argues what the modern-day Left adamantly refutes: America is a kingdom of kindness, blessed by God. Film critic, best-selling author, acclaimed conservative radio host, and proud American, Michael sits down with Glenn to discuss his latest book, “God’s Hand on America: Divine Providence in the Modern Era.” From freedom to electricity, America has made the world a better place. But if we’re not grateful, we’ll only feel guilty.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
