  "description": "Today we talked to Seth Markle about his book, A Motorcycle on Hell Run: Tanzania, Black Power, and the Uncertain Future of Pan-Africanism 1964-1974, published by Michigan State University Press in 2017 as part of the Ruth Simms Hamilton African Diaspora Series. Providing extensive insight into the importance of Tanzania in the emergence of a new form of Pan-Africanism in the 1960s, Markle conveys both the character of modern nationhood in Tanzania as well the activists in the diaspora who shaped and were affected by it. Markle highlights the international connections that defined the African Diaspora and Pan-Africanism throughout the 1960s and 70s. His book is a story about the networks and friendships that tie together Julius Nyerere’s Tanzania to the pivotal figures and ideas of the twentieth century, including Malcolm X, A.M. Babu, Stokely Carmichael, and Walter Rodney.\n\nSeth Markle is an Associate Professor of History and International Studies at Trinity College. He also serves as the Director of the Human Rights Program; Coordinator of the International Studies Program’s Africa concentration and Interdisciplinary Minor in African Studies and is the Faculty Advisor to Trinity’s International Hip Hop Festival.\n\n\n\nJacob Ivey is an Assistant Professor of History at the Florida Institute of Technology. His research centers largely on the British Colony of Natal, South Africa, most notably European and African systems of state control and defense during the colony’s formative period.He tweets @IveyHistorian.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
