Here we talk about the concept of standard deviation for random variables. We show some important properties you can use in calculations. We also look at examples. In particular, we consider the normal distribution in R.\n\nI hope that this helps students, pupils and others. Have fun!\n\n#ProbabilityTheory\n\n(This explanation fits to lectures for students in their first and second year of study: Mathematics for physicists, Mathematics for the natural science, Mathematics for engineers and so on)",
