Get his book Haunted Hills and Hollows: What Lurks in Greene County Pennsylvania on Amazon.\nThe Most Haunted County in America The far southwest corner of Pennsylvania looks on the surface to be a pleasant rolling, river-cut landscape carpeted with vegetation and trees. But underneath is a bloody history and a supernatural reality brimming with ghosts, aliens, unknown creatures – and things that can change a person’s life forever. Kevin Paul, a native of Greene County, and paranormal researcher Rosemary Ellen Guiley take you deep into Greene County’s dark and unexplored corners to uncover a twilight world that exists alongside of us, waiting for us to be in the right place at the right time to make itself known.

From haunted locations and ghostly apparitions to encounters with UFOs, Bigfoot and other bizarre creatures, it’s a real page turner full of mysterious paranormal accounts.” – Stan Gordon UFO-Bigfoot researcher and author “I have been out in the field investigating with Kevin Paul and Rosemary Ellen Guiley and have seen for myself the weird and unexplained phenomena that exist here.” – John Zaffis, star of Haunted Collector and co-author of Demon Haunted: True Stories from the John Zaffis Vault.\n\nWanna get creeped out?
