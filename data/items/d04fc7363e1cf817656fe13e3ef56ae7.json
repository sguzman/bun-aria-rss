The iPhones look nearly identical. And so do the AirPods Pro 2.</p>\n\n<p>The exception was the Apple Watch Ultra, which is a rather new form factor. Beefier. With some extra features. But utlimately it&#8217;s still 90% the same as the Series 8.</p>\n\n<p>I would argue this is a good thing. It means they think they&#8217;re getting close to the ultimate forms of these products. And I agree. With a few exceptions that I can&#8217;t wait to see filled in.</p>\n\n<h2>1. USB-C</h2>\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/apple-iphone-13-pro-4.jpg-650x366.webp\" alt=\"apple-iphone-13-pro-4.jpg\" width=\"650\" height=\"366\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138242\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"note\">Or Thunderbold, but with a USB-C connector.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>\n\n<p>Yeah, I know, everyone gets this one. It&#8217;s just time to unify everything behind a single connector. Nuff said already.</p>\n\n<h2>2. A Round Apple Watch</h2>\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/apple-watch-round-6-650x412.jpg\" alt=\"apple-watch-round-6\" width=\"650\" height=\"412\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138239\" /></p>\n\n<p>I was a watch guy before I was an Apple guy, and I am bummed about wasted real estate with the round watch faces that sit inside the Apple Watch&#8217;s rectangular form factor.</p>\n\n<p>I would love something that looks more like a Submariner, but with the Apple buttons on it. I&#8217;d pay thousands for it. Probably. I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s taken this long, but I hope it comes soon.</p>\n\n<h2>3. High-Resolution Audio on AirPods</h2>\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/high-res-airpods-650x488.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138245\" /></p>\n\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/\">Airpods Pro 2</a> have improved drivers and algorithms that measurably improve their sound, but as a mid-level audiophile (shudder) I am still waiting for the final piece of lossless and high-quality audio. It&#8217;ll require a new protocol, but that shouldn&#8217;t be too much of an obstacle. f</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a small point, and things already sound great, but if you&#8217;re into audio it&#8217;s pretty annoying to know the source is lossless/high-quality, and the drivers are excellent, but that the protocol is stripping quality from your audio.</p>\n\n<h2>4. TouchID Under the Glass</h2>\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/iPhone-12-Touch-ID-Feature-Img-650x366.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone-12-Touch-ID-Feature-Img\" width=\"650\" height=\"366\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138241\" /></p>\n\n<p>FaceID keeps getting better, but I&#8217;d love if it was eventually paired with TouchID that activates when you put your thumb on the screen.</p>\n\n<p>It might not be better or faster when you&#8217;re looking at the screen, but there are enough times when you blink, or look away, or at a bad angle, and you don&#8217;t land a FaceID authentication. So it&#8217;d be brilliant to have both.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Unification of The Naming</h2>\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/4356629_original-12.jpg-650x325.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"325\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138246\" /></p>\n\n<p>Finally, just a naming gripe which I don&#8217;t really fault them for but can&#8217;t wait for them to fix.</p><div class=\"inline-auto-newsletter\"><div class=\"inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b\">\n<div class=\"text-lg font-bold\">The UL Newsletter: Finding the Patterns in the Noise…</div>\n<div class=\"text-sm text-gray-700 max-w-lg\">Get a weekly analysis of what's happening in security and tech—<em>and why it matters</em>.</div>\n<div class=\"mt-2\"><form action=\"https://danielmiessler.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292&id=49fdb7d723\" method=\"post\" name=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" class=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form validate inline\" novalidate > \n            <div>\n            <div class=\"mc-field-group\">\n            <input  placeholder=\"your best email\" type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" class=\"required email\" id=\"mce-EMAIL\">\n            <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" name=\"subscribe\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe\" class=\"button text-system\">\n            </div>\n            <div style=\"position: absolute; left: -5000px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"b_6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292_49fdb7d723\" tabindex=\"-1\" value=\"\"></div>\n            </div>\n            </form></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Silicon has Normal, Max, and Ultra</li>\n<li>iPhones have Normal, Plus, Pro, and Max</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Plus there are the iCloud tiers, which might be too hard to bring in. But can we try to standardize a bit?</p>\n\n<p>I do see the problem. iCloud and other services they&#8217;re following the Disney+ naming convention. And with iPhones you have to have a ladder in both the regular line and the Pro line, and the steps on those ladders have to be distinct to avoid confusion.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe the answer is unifying the line and just having more steps. So it&#8217;s just:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone</li>\n<li>iPhone Plus (larger base model)</li>\n<li>iPhone Pro  </li>\n<li>iPhone Pro Plus</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I think the challenge is differentiating size vs. performance. Those two things need different laddering terminology.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps Plus can be the size difference, while Pro, Max, Ultra are the performance tiers.</p>\n\n<p>And with Apple Silicon, it just becomes:</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=3></div>\n\n<ul>\n<li>M2 </li>\n<li>M2 Pro</li>\n<li>M2 Max</li>\n<li>M2 Ultra</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Not sure they should have that many tiers though.</p>\n\n<p>—</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, these are the things I think they should sort out to arrive at the peak of this line of products for the next five years or so.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>USB-C</li>\n<li>A Round Apple Watch</li>\n<li>High-res Audio</li>\n<li>Touch-ID Under the Glass</li>\n<li>Unified Naming</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let me know if you have any other ideas.</p>\n</p>"
