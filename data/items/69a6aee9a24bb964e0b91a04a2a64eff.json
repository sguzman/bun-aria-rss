  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease Podcast, Clay Newcomb takes us back to the site of an ancient bison kill, the one found by George McJunkin on part one of this series. After George’s death it would become known as the Folsom site. It was here that stone tools made by humans were found with a relic form of Pleistocene bison, Bison antiquus, and forever planted an indisputable datapoint into the debate of human antiquity in North America. We’re going to talk with Ol Steve Rinella of MeatEater and the nation’s leading expert on the Folsom Site, Dr. David Meltzer of SMU, who literally wrote the book on Folsom. Dr. Meltzer went back, 70 years after its initial excavation, and excavated it again to find more answers. They discuss the archeological processes that verify the site, what Dr. Meltzer found when he went back, and speculate on how the bison kill took place. I really doubt you’re going to want to miss this one. . .</p><p><br></p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p><p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p><p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p><p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/products/bear-grease-hat\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
