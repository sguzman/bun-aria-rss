  "content": "<a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/research/data/\">Realtor.com</a> has monthly and weekly data on the existing home market. Here is their weekly report released today from Chief Economist Danielle Hale: <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/research/weekly-housing-trends-view-data-week-oct-29-2022/\">Weekly Housing Trends View — Data Week Ending Oct 29, 2022</a>.  Note: They have data on list prices, new listings and more, but this focus is on inventory. <blockquote>• <b>Active inventory continued to grow, increasing 40% above one year ago</b>.  This is the third week of a more notable step up in inventory gains after rough stability since July.<br />...<br />• <b>New listings–a measure of sellers putting homes up for sale–were again down, dropping 13% from one year ago</b>.  This marks the seventeenth week of year over year declines in the number of new listings coming up for sale.</blockquote><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidCHhw_3vrPsbXKbHb5mQxwGXkIyS7orrlXoBYaleqmcOA5EngtxJsRru_N25o6Y_Vg44lxeUOcOoUgZWLns3n-aKPPW3-siQQeYE-G5EWbf_kWQPSZ3lZcRQS6NblAeSxSSoZlw4gGbB4CCRASl6mA1p-V8L4RiRf52CT8-lrM8Ws2aJvNg/s1019/RealtorNov32022.PNG\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"Realtor YoY Active Listings\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidCHhw_3vrPsbXKbHb5mQxwGXkIyS7orrlXoBYaleqmcOA5EngtxJsRru_N25o6Y_Vg44lxeUOcOoUgZWLns3n-aKPPW3-siQQeYE-G5EWbf_kWQPSZ3lZcRQS6NblAeSxSSoZlw4gGbB4CCRASl6mA1p-V8L4RiRf52CT8-lrM8Ws2aJvNg/s320/RealtorNov32022.PNG\" style=\"border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); float: right; margin: 10px;\" /></a>Here is a graph of the year-over-year change in inventory according to <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/research/data/\">realtor.com</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Note the rapid increase in the YoY change earlier this year, from down 30% at the beginning of the year, to up 29% YoY at the beginning of July.<div><br /></div><div>Then the Realtor.com data was stuck at up around 26% to 30% YoY for 14 weeks in a row.&nbsp; This was due to the slowdown in new listings, even as sales had fallen sharply.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now YoY inventory is increasing again with even higher mortgage rates, suggesting sales are off more than new listings.</div>",
