  "description": "Our Gospel for this week ends with one of the most haunting lines in the New Testament. Jesus says, \"when the Son of man returns, will he find faith on the earth?\" The Christian faith has faded away, even in lands where it was once vibrant: Egypt, Turkey, North Africa, etc. Will it endure in Western Europe, in our country? The cultivation of the faith is obviously God's work first, but it is also ours. What are we doing to make sure that the Christian Gospel is successfully passed on to the next generation?",
