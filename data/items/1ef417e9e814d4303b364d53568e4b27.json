  "description": "<p>Many of us have our own personalized, specific goals when it comes to our money, so it’s no surprise that we also have many different views of what financial independence means to each of us. Since tomorrow is the 4th of July, we wanted to take a moment and reflect on how our views of financial independence have changed over the years. We also posted this question in the How To Money Facebook group, and we look forward to digging into and sharing your wisdom regarding what financial freedom means to you! Just like we often discuss regarding knowing the ‘why’ behind our money, when we’re able to identify why it is we’re seeking after financial freedom, we can endure almost any ‘how.’ Happy 4th!</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed an Order of Magnitude by Edmund’s Oast which you can find on Untappd. A big thanks to Andrew in South Carolina for donating this amazing beer to the show!
