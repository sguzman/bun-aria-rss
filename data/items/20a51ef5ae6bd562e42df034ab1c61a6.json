Since people kept on starring this library on\nGitHub, I thought I would do them all the favour of fixing these errors by\nimplementing an idea I had for a new layout algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>I tested this new algorithm, and found that it works exceedingly well. In\nfact it far surpasses the <a href=\"http://www.cs.uic.edu/~wilkinson/Publications/venneuler.pdf\">best published academic research on laying out\narea proportional Venn and Euler\ndiagrams</a>. Iâ€™ve included some interactive graphs showing\nthe performance on this benchmark here, as well as a visualization of how this\nalgorithm works.</p>\n\n<p class='more'><a href='http://www.benfrederickson.com/better-venn-diagrams/'>Read more ...</a></p>\n     "
