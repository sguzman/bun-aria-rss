    "media:description": "In algebra, doing math with negative numbers is simple. By putting a negative sign in front of a number, the number is known to have negative value. But how does this work with binary numbers? \n\nBinary numbers cannot be \"negative\". By saying that a number is either unsigned or signed, the most significant bit of the number will denote if the number is positive or negative, allowing us to do math just like we would with any other number.\n\nüè´ COURSES üè´\nhttps://www.lowlevel.academy/courses/\n\nüî• SOCIALS üî•\nLow Level Merch!: https://www.linktr.ee/lowlevellearning\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lowlevellearning\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/lowlevellearni1\nFollow me on Twitch: https://twitch.tv/lowlevellearning\nJoin me on Discord!: https://discord.gg/gZhRXDdBYY",
