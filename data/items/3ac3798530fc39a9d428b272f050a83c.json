  "description": "<p>Genghis Kahn. Damn. I knew the dude was a renowned conqueror. Did NOT know he conquered like no other before or since. At the height of their army, perhaps no army in the world was more feared than the Mongol horde. Mongolian archers were second to none. They planned and prepared more than their adversaries. Their tactics were more ruthless. You'll learn a lot about what the Mongols accomplished during the reign of Genghis today, and also a lot about ancient Mongolia. A fascinating and unique land.
