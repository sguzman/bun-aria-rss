  "description": "<p>Holy wow! I can’t believe that the singer of The Bouncing Souls, Greg Antonni, is on the show today! If you don’t know who The Bouncing Souls are please check your pulse as they are probably one of the best punk bands around today and potentially of all time. Greg opens up to us about his life in and around New Jersey, the major label rush of the 90’s as well as his “kid music” project with his wife Play Date. It’s always refreshing to know that no matter how long you’ve been doing something, you can still be enthusiastic about the future and Greg is a shining example of that.
