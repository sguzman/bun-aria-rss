  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Ambassador Richard Grenell joins the show in his very first interview since completing his tenure as Director of National Intelligence. Grenell says that it’s not plausible to believe that the Obama White House was unaware of the spying on Donald Trump, whether or not it was directed by the White House or leaked by the White House remains to be seen. Grenell noted that career intelligence professionals are afraid to brief Congress because their careers would end if the public knew what was being classified and why. The Country can't have oversight if Congress will have staffers write letters and leak them to the press before those letters even arrived at their intended recipients. With respect to General Mike Flynn, Grenell said that lots of things are over-classified beyond protecting sources and methods, but used to cover up mistakes by the FBI and protect the reputations of others. Sadly, some in Congress cherry-pick the Intel they want to leak to the media. There is a culture of middle management that looks the other way when it comes to politically weaponizing the government against rivals. Later, GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy calls in to announce a lawsuit by the Republicans against Democrat Speaker Nancy Pelosi for members of Congress not showing up to work and voting by proxy. Since when is Congress not essential? Afterward, if Twitter, a major international cooperation — whose employees have donated to Democrat campaigns to the tune of 99% — is intending to influence an election by censoring or effecting speech to benefit one political party or another, it could be considered an illegal in-kind contribution. Since Twitter isn't the press, per se, they don't have the same rights as the media.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
