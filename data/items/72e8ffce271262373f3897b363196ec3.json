  "description": "<p>Spooktober continues with … CrEePy cRawLies. And dark woods and solo hiking and Forest Entomologist Dr. Kristen Wickert a.k.a. KayDubs the Hiking Scientist. We chat about everything from Moth Man to chubby caterpillars to spiderwebs to fungus. She tells us how to look for big beautiful moths, what footwear is best for hitting the trail, which bugs to kill and which to cheer on, how to deal with mosquitos in your yard and ticks in your pants and why the woods feel like home. By the end, you’ll be lacing up your whatevers, walking softly and looking closely. </p>\n<p>Dr. Kristen Wickert aka KayDubs the Hiking Scientist on Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kaydubsthehikingscientist/?hl=en\">https://www.instagram.com/kaydubsthehikingscientist/</a></p>\n<p>Her website: <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/Kaydubsthehikingscientist\">https://linktr.ee/Kaydubsthehikingscientist</a></p>\n<p>KayDubs’ Patreon: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Kaydubsthehikingscientist\">https://www.patreon.com/Kaydubsthehikingscientist</a></p>\n<p>KayDubs' YouTube channel: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ3oAFNfgWCDPSKtH59-R1g?app=desktop\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ3oAFNfgWCDPSKtH59-R1g?app=desktop</a></p>\n<p>A donation went to: <a href=\"https://www.blackinappalachia.org\">blackinappalachia.org</a></p>\n<p>Sponsors of the show: <a href=\"http://www.alieward.com/ologies-sponsors\">www.alieward.com/ologies-sponsors</a></p>\n<p>More links at <a href=\"http://alieward.com/ologies/forestentomology\">alieward.com/ologies/forestentomology</a></p>\n<p>Transcripts & bleeped episodes at:<a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-extras\"> alieward.com/ologies-extras</a></p>\n<p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month:<a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\"> www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ologiesmerch.com/\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes and now… MASKS.
