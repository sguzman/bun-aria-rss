  "description": "In this episode, we hear two interviews with author Namwali Serpell. Her two novels look at some variation on what it means to be part of a mixed-race family. First, NPR's Scott Simon talks to Serpell about her 2019 debut <em>The Old Drift</em> in which the author considers how immigrants that came to Zambia gave the country a new identity through unity and love. Then, Serpell and NPR's Juana Summers discuss her second novel <em>The Furrows</em>, which looks at grief  – and how it doesn't necessarily get easier with time. ",
