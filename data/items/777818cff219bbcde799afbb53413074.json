  "title": "Simran Jeet Singh, \"The Light We Give: How Sikh Wisdom Can Transform Your Life\" (Riverhead, 2022)",
  "description": "An inspiring approach to a happier, more fulfilling life through Sikh teachings on love and service. \nAs a boy growing up in South Texas, Simran Jeet Singh and his brothers confronted racism daily: at school, in their neighborhood, playing sports, and later in college and beyond. Instead, Singh delved deep into the Sikh teachings that he grew up with and embraced the lessons to seek the good in every person and situation and to find positive ways to direct his energy. Singh reaches beyond his comfort zone to practice this deeper form of living and explores how everyone can learn the insights and skills that have kept him engaged and led him to commit to activism without becoming consumed by anger, self-pity, or burnout. Part memoir, part spiritual journey, The Light We Give: How Sikh Wisdom Can Transform Your Life (Riverhead, 2022) is a transformative book of hope that shows how each of us can turn away from fear and uncertainty and move toward renewal and positive change.\nRaj Balkaran is a scholar, online educator, and life coach.
