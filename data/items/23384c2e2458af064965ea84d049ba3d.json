  "description": "<p>EPISODE 149 - JOHN TURTURRO - Actor</p> <p>Team Deakins enjoys a great conversation with frequent collaborator, actor John Turturro (BARTON FINK, THE BIG LEBOWSKI, TRANSFORMERS). His stories made us laugh a lot in parts - especially when he describes his first professional audition with Michael Badalucco for DiNiro and Scorsese for the movie Raging Bull! He also shares what working with the great Robbie Muller taught him (“you don’t have to do more”) as well as his experience of working with Francesco Rosi and Pasqualino De Santis on The Truce, where he realized he was a part of the frame. We also talked a lot about his experiences working with the Coen Brothers including what his real-life inspiration was for his character in Miller’s Crossing and how he prepped for Barton Fink. He explains that while professional acting is great, once in a while, it’s good to get back to the responsible amateur in you! We cover lots of ground and it’s an episode not to miss!</p>",
