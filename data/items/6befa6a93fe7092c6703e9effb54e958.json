    "media:description": "Topology was barely born in the late 19th century, but that didn't stop Henri Poincaré from making what is essentially the first conjecture ever in the subject. And it wasn't any ordinary conjecture - it took a hundred years of mathematical development to solve it using ideas so novel that they were worth at least a million dollars.\n\nHere I talk about the Poincaré Conjecture by introducing fundamental topological concepts like homeomorphisms and homology, and eventually talk about its solution through Ricci Flow.\n\nNote: At 12:25, it's 3-Manifold, not 3D Manifold. I don't know what possessed me to say 3D.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMusic Credits:\n\nInspired by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3918-inspired/\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nWind Of The Rainforest Preview by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5729-wind-of-the-rainforest-preview\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nWholesome by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5050-wholesome\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nThe Forest and the Trees by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4494-the-forest-and-the-trees\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nMusic: https://www.purple-planet.com\n\nhttp://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImage Credits:\n\nTesseract, 24-cell and Tetrahedral Compound: Robert Webb's Stella software is the creator of this image.
