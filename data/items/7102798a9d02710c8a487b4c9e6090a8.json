  "description": "<p>IT’S NEVER GOING TO BE PERFECT. We all have this vision of the ideal life. We work hard and get everything done. All of our relationships are in great shape. We take time to exercise and eat right. But the truth is, there is no magical destination. And even if we reach that place, it could all be destroyed in an instant by one of life’s famous curveballs. Instead of looking at balance like a happily ever after, look at it as something you constantly need to reevaluate and adjust. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Jay Papasan where he shared his philosophy of counterbalance. Jay Papasan is the co-author of The One Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results. He wants you to be purposeful about the way you spend your time. Learn how to tackle the myth of work/life balance in Episode 885.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nAbout work/life balance and if it’s possible (02:00)<br />\nWhy balance is a verb, not a noun (02:30)<br />\nHow to counterbalance (03:00)<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode, check out the video, show notes, and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/885 and follow at instagram.com/lewishowes</p>\n",
