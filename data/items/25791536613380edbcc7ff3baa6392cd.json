  "description": "Contributor(s): Dr Connson Locke, Professor Elizabeth Samet, Professor Ben Voyer | Welcome to LSE IQ, a monthly podcast from the London School of Economics and Political Science, where we ask leading social scientists - and other experts - to answer an intelligent question about economics, politics or society. If you do a quick Amazon search on ‘leadership books’ you’ll get nearly 200,000 results. These books promise to reveal the leadership secrets of luminaries such as Steve Jobs, notable explorers, military figures, and numerous sports men and women. Whether we’re seeking to improve our own ability to lead or wondering why those around us aren't better at it, there’s plenty of advice out there. In this episode of LSE IQ, Sue Windebank looks at the research and asks, 'What makes a great leader?' This episode features: Dr Connson Locke, Senior Lecturer in Practice, LSE Department of Management; Professor Elizabeth Samet, Department of English & Philosophy, US Military Academy, West Point and; Professor Ben Voyer, Visiting Fellow, LSE’s Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science.
