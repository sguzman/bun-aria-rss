  "description": "Ed Gein. Plainfield, Wisconsin. November, 1957. A man who did odd jobs was either pitied or teased by those who knew him. Behind the scenes, he had grown up in an abusive home. He would lose his entire family in a span of less than five years. It was the loss of his mother, though, that seemed to have a profound effect on Edward Theodore Gein. Unbeknownst to the others in the town, Ed was robbing graves of recently buried women at night from local cemeteries. In his quest to bring his mother back to life he would also resort to capturing and killing women who reminded him of his mom. In November of 1957, authorities would seek out Ed after the abduction and murder of a store owner named Bernice Worden. Her son was convinced that Ed was responsible. It wouldn't take long before Gein's nightmarish collections would be revealed. Who was Ed Gein and why did he do the things that he did? \n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
