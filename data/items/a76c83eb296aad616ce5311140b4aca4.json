  "content": "<p>We finished the <span class=\"caps\">NBA</span> regular season strong, with correct guesses on 41 of 56 games this past week &#8212; 73% accuracy. Overall, our season average was roughly 65%. This is significantly lower than those returned by the bookies this year, whose accuracy overall sat just under 70%. The differences there likely have much to do with information relating to individual players (eg injuries) that would be difficult to take into account in our team-centric modeling approach. It also took us a number of weeks to come up with a solid way of choosing our model&#8217;s hyperparameters. With these issues identified/settled, we anticipate improvements on these numbers next year. We won&#8217;t be modeling the <span class=\"caps\">NBA</span> playoffs, so this will be our last basketball post for the current season &#8212; we had a&nbsp;blast!</p>\n<p>With regards to the <span class=\"caps\">MLB</span>, in our first week, we guessed correctly on 52/93 games, giving 56%. A somewhat poor result, fueled in part by the lackluster Giants. New predictions are up, with better accuracy hoped for this&nbsp;week!</p>",
