I really love your show and it is great therapy for people whom have had encounters”</p> <p>I will also be welcoming Ed to the show.

I was 14 and it scared the **** out of me.</p> <p>Since then and up until about a year ago I used to have horrible nightmares several times a year about Big Foot. The nightmares stopped late last year when I finally admitted to myself, and to a few close family members, what I saw.</p> <p>Up until about a year ago I had never told anyone about my experience.”</p>",
