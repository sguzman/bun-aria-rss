  "description": "<p>In this special episode, Scot and Jeff discuss Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker with David Lowery, the main singer/songwriter and bandleader for both groups.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Introducing the</span></strong><span><strong> Band</strong>:<br />\n</span>Your hosts Scot Bertram (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScotBertram\">@ScotBertram</a>) and Jeff Blehar (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EsotericCD\">@EsotericCD</a>) with guest David Lowery (<u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidclowery\">@DavidCLowery</a></u>). He’s the main singer/songwriter and bandleader for Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker. David also is lecturer in music business at the University of Georgia, chief muckraker at The Trichordist, an artist rights activist, and 2014 Chamber of Commerce Global Intellectual Property Champion.</p>\n<p><span><strong>David’s Music Pick: Camper Van Beethoven/Cracker</strong></span>:<br />\nHow did we do this? We have David Lowery joining the show, the ringleader of two of the best bands in the past 35 years. Camper Van Beethoven merging of punk, folk, ska, and world music was unlike anything else happening at the time and, frankly, just about anything happening now. Cracker took a step forward when Camper broke up, embracing Americana and country along with traditional rock ‘n’ roll elements. David spends more than three hours with us, walking us through the beginnings of CVB to the most recent releases from both band. We ask about some random CVB/Cracker trivia and also discuss music in the modern streaming era, copyright law, and the Music Modernization Act, which has been one of David’s causes for years now.</p>\n<p>No, really. The actual David Lowery is on this podcast with us. You must listen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n",
