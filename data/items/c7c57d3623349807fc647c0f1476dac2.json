I mean, sure, we can come up with explanations such as the idea that continuous thinking requires a greater cognitive load, but it&#8217;s not just that, right?  Even when people have all the time in the world, they&#8217;ll often inappropriately dichotomize.  I guess it&#8217;s related to essentialism (what isn&#8217;t, right?), but that just pushes the question one step backward.</p>\n<p>As Liberman puts it, the key fallacies are:</p>\n<blockquote><p>1. Thinking of distributions as points;<br />\n2. Inventing convenient but unreal taxonomic categories;<br />\n3. Forming stereotypes, especially via confirmation bias.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong>  In a follow-up <a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=56746\">post</a>, Liberman links to <a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LibermanAmazon062022.pdf\">slides from a talk</a> he gave with several good examples of bad dichotomization in science reporting.</p>\n",
