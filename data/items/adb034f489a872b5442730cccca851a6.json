  "description": "It’s cliche to say, in today’s legal market, that only law firms that do “bet the ranch” litigation can charge top rates. Gibson Dunn isn’t just one of those “bet the ranch” type of firms. As Bloomberg Businessweek’s Paul Barrett notes, the firm has been called on by clients to replace both Jones Day and Skadden Arps: “when things kind of go bad and you need to be rescued, you call on Gibson Dunn to come up with some type of innovative strategy to get you out of the soup.”\n\nOnce again we’re taking a full episode of the Big Law Business podcast to do a deep dive on a single law firm, Gibson Dunn. A firm that consistently ranks among the top in the U.S. in gross revenue, profits per partner, and revenue per lawyer. Their clients include Chevron, Apple, and even New Jersey Governor, Chris Christie. Paul Barrett, our guest for this episode, knows the firm well, having written extensively about Chevron’s legal battles in Ecuador in the pages of Businessweek and Bloomberg.com, and his book, Law of the Jungle.\n\nSponsored by Bloomberg Law\nwww.bna.com/bloomberglaw?promocode=BLBBLAW\n\nSubscribe to the Big Law Business podcast on iTunes.\nitunes.apple.com/us/podcast/big-l…d1074067483?mt=2\n\n\nDiscussed in this episode:\n\nWhat Do Chevron, Apple, and Chris Christie Have in Common?\nhttps://bol.bna.com/what-do-chevron-apple-and-chris-christie-have-in-common/\n\nWhat’s Culture?
