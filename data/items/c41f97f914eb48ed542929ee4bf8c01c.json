  "description": "<p>Kelly joins me on this Halloween Special for 2019 and we share an overview of the history of paranormal television in the United States. My love for Halloween and creepy stuff comes from the stuff I watched on television when I was a kid. I cut my teeth on reruns of the Twilight Zone and watching the classic Universal Monster Movies. But what got me checking out the weird books from the library were the paranormal based television shows and I continue to binge on them as an adult. This won't be exhaustive, but will touch on our favorites. Then we are joined by author Kevin Killen to discuss his book Ghosts and Me and then we share listener stories of the unexplained! Happy Halloween!</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/10/halloween-episode-2019.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/10/halloween-episode-2019.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>The following music is from <a href= \"https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/\">https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/</a>:</p> <p>\"Vanishing\" by Kevin MacLeod (Moment in Oddity)<br /> \"In Your Arms\" by Kevin MacLeod (This Month in History)<br /> License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Creepy Castle by Stockmusic on Comic Caper Jingles<br /> Circus Freaks and Gothic Shrieks by 5 Alarm Music<br /> Ominous Transition by 5 Alarm Music</p>",
