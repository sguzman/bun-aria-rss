  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Screens are making us into animals rather than creative image-bearers of God, says Wheaton College communication professor Read Schuchardt. Our addiction to our devices and social media means we’re losing the ability to self-regulate and reason. Instead, like infants or animals, Schuchardt says we merely react to external stimulation. In a wide-ranging conversation, he talks with Skye about new research about smartphones, the importance of boredom, and the spiritual implications of our social media age. Also this week, N.T. Wright says the solution to the problems facing American Christianity is deeper engagement with the Bible, while Jerry Falwell Jr. says the answer is fighting liberals. Who’s right? Plus, American Airlines apologizes to a Satanist.</p>",
