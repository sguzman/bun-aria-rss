  "description": "<p>Chris Giancarlo, aka CryptoDad, is the former chair of the CFTC, the governing body that oversees Commodity Futures Trading. He's now an advisor in crypto, a senior advisor at a law firm, and of course, a father.</p> <p>This conversation circles around many of the topics Chris covers in his new book, 'The Fight for the Future of Money.' We move through the specifics like the differences between Futures and Spot ETFs, but then we turn towards the big picture.</p> <p>What are American values? How do we instantiate them into our digital institutions? America has a remarkable history of saying 'yes,' and the stakes couldn't be higher as America decides whether to say yes to credibly neutral, decentralized protocols.</p> <p>✨ EPISODE DEBRIEF ✨<br /> <a href= \"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/exclusive-debrief-the-fight-for-the\"> https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/exclusive-debrief-the-fight-for-the</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 📣 DHARMA | From Dollars to DeFi in a Tap!<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/dharma\">https://bankless.cc/dharma</a> <br />  ------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  ------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>💰 GEMINI | FIAT & CRYPTO EXCHANGE<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/go-gemini\">https://bankless.cc/go-gemini</a> </p> <p>🔀 BALANCER | EXCHANGE & POOL ASSETS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/balancer\">https://bankless.cc/balancer</a> </p> <p>👻 AAVE | LEND & BORROW ASSETS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/aave\">https://bankless.cc/aave</a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"http://bankless.cc/uniswap\">http://bankless.cc/uniswap</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 6:30 Chris Giancarlo<br /> 10:06 CryptoDad & BTC Futures<br /> 18:27 Facing Resistance<br /> 22:13 Fear & Regulation<br /> 28:02 Vindicated<br /> 31:55 Futures vs Spot ETFs<br /> 41:29 Liquidity & Price<br /> 47:00 ETH Futures<br /> 53:09 Trust in Money<br /> 58:00 Getting the Values Right<br /> 1:04:43 Will People Care?<br /> 1:10:31 The CFTC’s Approach<br /> 1:16:03 Encouraging Innovation<br /> 1:21:31 Regulatory Clarity<br /> 1:26:44 Free Markets & Free People<br /> 1:33:56 The Crypto Dad<br /> 1:37:37 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>CryptoDad on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/giancarloMKTS?s=20\">https://twitter.com/giancarloMKTS?s=20</a> </p> <p>The Fight for the Future of Money:<br /> <a href= \"https://www.chrisgiancarlo.org/book\">https://www.chrisgiancarlo.org/book</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
