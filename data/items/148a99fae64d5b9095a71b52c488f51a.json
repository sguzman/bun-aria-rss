  "description": "As you know, it’s my mission to help teach you how to build the MINDSET and SKILLS that will help you live an extraordinary life - and over the last few months I’ve been working hard behind the scenes to help create a brand-new tool that will help you do that. It’s called Kyzen - and I am proud to announce that I will be bringing it to the world later this year to challenge you to empower yourself and accomplish greater things in life. To learn more, join my Discord at <a href=\"http://impacttheory.com/discord\" rel=\"noopener\">http://impacttheory.com/discord</a><br /><br />Big goals require DISCIPLINE. By it's very nature, discipline requires you to do hard things - and that is a skill you can LEARN. I'm teaching my process to build Ironclad Discipline in a new workshop - you can register at discipline.impacttheory.com!<br /><br />On Today's Episode: <br /><br />Are you struggling with gaining the respect from your family, your workplace, or friends? How can you command their respect and be acknowledged for your many accomplishments? In this Q & A with Tom, class is in session, so get ready to learn the truth about the respect so many of us value and want to have more of. Tom talks about being so ridiculously good that you can’t be ignored, but he also gives you actionable tips and areas to focus on if you want to gain the respect you deserve from your family and workplace, even if you are at your lowest point. In the words of Kobe Bryant, “Boos don’t block dunks,” and your respect is more about you than anyone else.<br /> <br />SHOW NOTES:<br /> <br />Family Respect | Tom discusses being so good you can’t be ignored and earning respect  [0:22]<br />Career Respect | The value of consistently over delivering to make real demands [5:34]<br />Demanded Respect | Why swag and not wanting from anyone is key to respect [10:28]<br />Respected Compassion | Being hard core and being the champion for others [15:35]<br />Respect from Failures | How to earn respect through failures and consistency [21:33]<br />Cultural Differences | Tom’s advice to live radically different from the cultural norm [27:25]<br />Respect Summed Up| Tom confirms respect is a consequence of your confidence [31:28]<br /> <br />QUOTES:<br /> <br />“Be so good they can’t ignore you” getting so good at something that you can’t be denied<br />“If you can be ignored the only way out of that is to continue to get better, get to the point show it so many times that it is just self evident” [1:26]<br /> <br />“If you really want an extraordinary life, trying to optimize for your dollars in the short term is a losing proposition.
