  "description": "You might have heard that Bill Gross recently retired from his portfolio manager role at Janus Capital Group. There are few names in the investment world, more recognizable than Bill Gross. The so-called bond king reinvented the way investors think about debt. For years, he's been a staple in the pages of Barron's, and he sat on Barron's annual roundtable of top investors.\n\nBarron's senior writer Mary Childs has covered Bill Gross' career for several years and is working on a book about him. The Readback team thought this was a good time to re-release one of our favorite episodes of the podcast in which Mary talks about a more obscure side of the bond king: His love of stamps.\n\nThe Readback is a weekly, financial podcast from Barron's. Hosted by Alex Eule and produced by Mette Lützhøft.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
