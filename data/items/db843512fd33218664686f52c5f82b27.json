  "description": "<p>The main objective of the present paper is to introduce and study the\nfunction $_pR_q(A, B; z)$ with matrix parameters and investigate the\nconvergence of this matrix function. The contiguous matrix function relations,\ndifferential formulas and the integral representation for the matrix function\n$_pR_q(A, B; z)$ are derived. Certain properties of the matrix function\n$_pR_q(A, B; z)$ have also been studied from fractional calculus point of view.\nFinally, we emphasize on the special cases namely the generalized matrix\n$M$-series, the Mittag-Leffler matrix function and its generalizations and some\nmatrix polynomials.\n</p>",
