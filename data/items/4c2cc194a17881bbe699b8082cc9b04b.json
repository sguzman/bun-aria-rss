Then you hit a point when you forget that feeling and you have to meet it again.“</p><p>Rodrigo Sánchez</p><br><p><br></p><p>It’s one thing to be an artist. But to become a successful creative — revered for your art — is quite another thing altogether.</p><p>Even more rare are the few who deftly navigate the vicissitudes of an acclaimed artistic career (or any career for that matter), with a highly conscious, devotional approach.</p><p>Musicians Rodrigo&nbsp;Sánchez and&nbsp;Gabriela&nbsp;Quintero –&nbsp;popularly known as the Mexican acoustic rock guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela —&nbsp;are not only incredible masters of their craft, they fully embody this ethos. It's a sensibility that has carried them from obscurity in Mexico. To busking on Grafton Street in Dublin. And ultimately to playing premier sold out venues all across the globe.</p><p>Along the way, Rod & Gab have performed at the White House for the Obamas. They've collaborated on film scores with world renowned composers like Hans Zimmer. And lent their talents to television shows like Breaking Bad — all while staying true to themselves and their utterly unique Metallica meets Flamenco artistic sensibility.</p><br><p>For those unfamiliar with this&nbsp;dynamic duo, prepare to be amazed.</p><p>I had the&nbsp;good fortune to witness them perform live at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles the night before this conversation. Unlike anything I had previously seen or heard, it was a transcendent experience that defies attempts to adequately describe.</p><p>Fortunately, I don't have to. Today, in addition to the quality conversations you've come to expect with this show, we expand the format to weave a mini-concert into the experience — a rare treat certain to delight.</p><p>Beyond the acoustic wall of sound, this is a conversation about a creative spark that began with heavy metal roots in Mexico City. It's about how busking on the streets of Dublin led to a huge break. And the extraordinary career that followed.</p><p>We discuss the influences and evolution of Rod and Gab's unique style. The importance of mastery in their musicianship and personal lives. And we explore the role meditation, spirituality and veganism has played in their self and career development.</p><p>Gab and Rod call it Mettavolution.</p><p>Intercut with live performance, along the way they share amazing stories. What it was like playing Letterman. Performing for the Obamas. And working on big Hollywood films like Pirates of the Caribbean.</p><p>Lastly, this is an episode you're going to want to watch on YouTube. It's one thing to hear Rod & Gab perform.
