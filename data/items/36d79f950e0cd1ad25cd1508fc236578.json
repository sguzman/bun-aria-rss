  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, our federal government, State Department, and White House are afraid of a stalemate between Ukraine and Russia because they feel Putin will use nuclear weapons. China has now pledged to financially support Russia in financing their war. So, the Ukrainians will continue suffering because Putin doesn't care if he has to gas them in order to win. Then, the State Department is slowly realizing why the U.S should be interested in Ukraine after testimony in the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee over research from Ukrainian bio labs might end up in Russian hands if toppled. Later, America needs to be the muscular society it's always been. We must embrace capitalism to lower the cost of gas and reject the phony green new deal. The progressives' primitive look on energy is breaking the pockets of Americans under the ambiguity catchphrase ‘climate change.' Afterward, Sen. Lindsey Graham calls in to discuss his call for Putin to be taken out. Graham blasted the Biden Administration for reneging on the deal to swap F-16 jets with Poland so they'd, in turn, donate Mig-29 jets to Ukraine. Graham made it clear that the U.S must be sterner and less afraid of Putin's threats and instead fear what happens globally if he wins.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
