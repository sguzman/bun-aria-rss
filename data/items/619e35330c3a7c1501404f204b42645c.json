Some of her biggest hits include Cher’s “If I Could Turn Back Time,” Celine Dion’s “Because You Loved Me,” and Aerosmith’s “I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing.” </p><p>Over the span of her 35 year-career, Diane Warren has penned hits for hip-hop, country, R&B, and adult contemporary artists. In late August she finally released her own album, <em>The Cave Sessions Volume 1</em>, The genre-spanning project is modeled after DJ compilation albums and brilliantly shows off Warren’s incredible range as a writer. </p><p>On today’s episode Rick Rubin talks to Diane Warren about how she decided to become a songwriter when she was just 11-years-old. And how her parents built a shed in their backyard where she could work out her early arrangements. Warren also talks about her one and only music teacher—who told her dad she had no future in music—and why she feels she has yet to write her best work.</p><p><br></p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord\">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out our favorite Diane Warren songs <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/59683mSjSn1tDZ9SQYUZ3z?si=519ff5e13c314dc6\"> HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
