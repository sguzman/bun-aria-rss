  "description": "We first started working on mobile-first indexing a number of years ago. Since then, we\n      switched to indexing the majority of web pages with Googlebot-Smartphone. We've now\n      determined that some sites are still not ready to be shifted over due to various,\n      unexpected challenges. Because of this, we're now leaving the timeline\n      open for the last steps of mobile-first indexing.",
