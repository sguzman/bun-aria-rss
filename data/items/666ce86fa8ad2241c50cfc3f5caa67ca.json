  "description": "<p>The spirits business is a $677 billion annual industry. Although liquor is an extremely lucrative business, it is extremely difficult to own a spirits company. In the search of an independently owned and operated brand, we found Myriam and Stevens Charles who are the owners of LS Cream Liqueur. LS Cream is an award-winning Haitian-inspired cream liquor known in the Caribbean as Kremas. Myriam and Stevens are a power couple from Montreal Canada. On EYL 87, they explained in detail the process of manufacturing liquor, the process of distribution, and the ins and outs of running an international business that covers America, Canada and the Caribbean. During the episode, they walked us through the complicated world of owning a liquor brand. We also discussed entrepreneurship in Canada, the connection to business opportunities that exist for entrepreneurs on both sides of the border, and how to do business in our neighboring countries. #entrepreneur #canada #Kremas --- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a> Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support\">https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
