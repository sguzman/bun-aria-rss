  "description": "Our audiobook tease this week is HITCHING THE COWBOY by Kennedy Fox\n\nWedding bells are the last thing on twenty-two year old Riley Bishop’s mind, but that’s exactly what he hears after waking up in Vegas next to a woman he just met—his new wife.\n\nHe never saw her coming, but she might be worth the risk.\n\nZoey Mitchell is high on life, free spirited, and adventurous. However, learning she married a rowdy cowboy after a night of partying is not what she expected—even for her.\n\nShe’s risking it all, gambling with her heart.\n\nDeciding to give their instant marriage a chance, Zoey moves from her big city life to a small town Texas ranch. She has to know if their connection is based on more than just a wild one-night stand before announcing to her family that she got hitched.\n\nOne moment changes everything—for better or worse—and a secret could destroy them both.\n\nAmazon: https://amzn.to/2UqbD5Z\nAudio: https://amzn.to/36CSkvM\niBooks: https://apple.co/3nlwTGu\nKobo: https://bit.ly/36CSljk\nNook: https://bit.ly/3ptYKpK\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nADS\nCara Dee Breaking Free & With Brave Wings\nEvie Mitchell - The X List\nFrankie Love Mail Order Brides for Christmas\nRochelle Paige – Charity\nSophie Lark Brutal Prince\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
