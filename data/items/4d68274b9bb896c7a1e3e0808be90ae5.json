  "description": "<p>On September 30, 1994, 20-year-old Jarrod Green disappeared from Searcy, Arkansas. Jarrod had indicated to his family that he had plans to meet with someone that night. During a phone call with his girlfriend, Jarrod was clearly upset but wouldn't tell her what was wrong. Jarrod had previously given a gun to a friend and retrieved the gun, saying he needed it for protection. Jarrod never made it home that evening and was never seen or heard from again. Days later, Jarrod's car was found abandoned in the parking lot of a local store. The car doors were left unlocked, windows rolled down, and the keys were on the floor. Jarrod's case went cold, his family didn't hear from law enforcement, and it felt like he was forgotten.</p><p>Meanwhile, dark stories continued to grow and spread through the community like a cancer. Not even a year later, someone else in Jarrod's circle disappeared. Another one took his own life and reportedly confessed to playing a role in Jarrod's murder beforehand.
