  "description": "<p>More people died last year from a drug overdose than from gun shootings, motor vehicle accidents, drownings and AIDS combined! Few people bring greater research and insight to this issue than Dan Ciccarone, a physician and professor at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), who has studied illicit drug markets, communities and consumers for two decades. We talked about the role of prescription opioids and street heroin, why the fentanyls are so deadly, and why COVID made the problem worse. I asked him why overdoses increasingly involve stimulant drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine, why fatal overdose rates vary so greatly around the country, and why so few other countries are suffering similar problems. And we talked about what needs to be done, including lessons from abroad, to dramatically cut the number of people dying this way.</p><p>Listen to this episode and let me know what you think.
