  "description": "Two (originally children's) tales that underscore the shocking brutality of the world in which these stories were told. The first one is that of three roommates: a sausage, a bird, and a mouse, who decide to mix things up for once. The second is the Robber Bridegroom, a story where a woman has to marry a man who horrifies her...and the lengths she'll go to in order to get out of it. The creature is the Roperite, a vengeful, narcissistic bird who just can't get over the Roadrunner's good luck. -- Sponsor: Simplisafe!
