A belief may be holding us back from reaching our goals and feeling truly content and we may not even be conscious that we have it. I’ve experienced how powerful it can be to recognize limiting beliefs and do the work to change them. I knew that I had traumatic experiences as a child that impacted me as an adult, but I had no idea how deeply they were affecting me. Working with a coach helped me identify the root of the belief (similar to the Functional Medicine approach to health) so that I could see the pattern and begin reframing what I know to be true.&nbsp;</p><br><p>I’m so excited that my coach and good friend Shelly Lefkoe is today’s podcast guest. Shelly is a co-founder and Vice President of Lefkoe Institute, a San Francisco Bay Area firm whose mission is “To significantly improve the quality of life on the planet by having people recreate their lives and live as the unlimited possibilities they are.” Shelly has had the privilege of helping thousands of clients worldwide rid themselves of a wide variety of problems including phobias, relationships that never seem to work, violence, procrastination, unwillingness to confront people, health and wellness issues, and sexual dysfunction. Her clients have been able to eliminate emotional patterns such as fear, hostility, shyness, anxiety, depression, worry about what people think of them, and a negative sense of themselves.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Thrive Market, Athletic Greens, and Four Sigmatic.</p><br><p>Thrive is offering all Doctor's Farmacy listeners an amazing deal.
