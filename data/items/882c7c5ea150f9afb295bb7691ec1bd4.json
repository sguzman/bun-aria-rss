  "description": "<p>Bowen Yang (platinum blonde, super-immune, Erika, corn silk-era) and Matt Rogers (still brunette, super-immune, Rinna, still charizard-era) gather together after a fabulous trip to Mexico City to record a \"culture catchup\" episode of their podcast Las Culturistas (critically acclaimed). And wow, has culture occurred. The name Che Diaz ring a bell? \"Hey, it's Che Diaz!\" How about now? Also, Mary M. Cosby, exiting the world stage? Major news, indeed. The Elmo-Zoe feud down on Sesame Street? You could say the hosts are bravely taking a side. And oh, the power of cinema. Matt and Bow review The Power of the Dog, Being The Ricardos, The Lost Daughter, Don't Look Up, Free Guy and Licorice Pizza. All this, praise for the final season of Search Party, a celebration of the renewal of The Morning Show for a third season (congrats third graders, you're the real heroes, mamas), thoughts on new Drag Race, Project Runway and Euphoria, and a whole lot of bullshit in between. Las Cultch? Is back. She suffered... and she is still that girl.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
