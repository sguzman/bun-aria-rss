  "description": "<p>Acoustic-based fault detection has a high potential to monitor the health\ncondition of mechanical parts. However, the background noise of an industrial\nenvironment may negatively influence the performance of fault detection.\nLimited attention has been paid to improving the robustness of fault detection\nagainst industrial environmental noise. Therefore, we present the Lenze\nproduction background-noise (LPBN) real-world dataset and an automated and\nnoise-robust auditory inspection (ARAI) system for the end-of-line inspection\nof geared motors. An acoustic array is used to acquire data from motors with a\nminor fault, major fault, or which are healthy. A benchmark is provided to\ncompare the psychoacoustic features with different types of envelope features\nbased on expert knowledge of the gearbox. To the best of our knowledge, we are\nthe first to apply time-varying psychoacoustic features for fault detection. We\ntrain a state-of-the-art one-class-classifier, on samples from healthy motors\nand separate the faulty ones for fault detection using a threshold. The\nbest-performing approaches achieve an area under curve of 0.87 (logarithm\nenvelope), 0.86 (time-varying psychoacoustics), and 0.91 (combination of both).\n</p>",
