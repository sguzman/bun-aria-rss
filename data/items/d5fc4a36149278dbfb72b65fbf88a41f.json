  "description": "This is a list of some causal inference resources, which I update from time to time. You can also check out my posts on causal inference and A/B testing.\nBooks:\nCausal Inference: What if by Miguel Hernán and Jamie Robins: The most practical book I&rsquo;ve read. Highly recommended. Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments : A Practical Guide to A/B Testing by Ron Kohavi, Diane Tang, and Ya Xu: Building on the authors&rsquo; decades of industry experience, this is pretty much the bible of online experiments, which is how causal inference is often done in practice."
