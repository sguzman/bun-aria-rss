  "description": "\"The FBI Way\" is a terrific new book from 25 year FBI veteran and MSNBC contributor Frank Figliuzzi. It details the values within the FBI that have enabled it to succeed so frequently in the past as well as discussing where mistakes have been made and how they have been remedied. The book is rich with stories many of which intersect with the headlines of the past few years. We discuss the book with Frank but also explore his views on the insurrection on Capitol Hill, on accountability, and on America's urgent need to pass a domestic terrorism law. It's a riveting discussion. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
