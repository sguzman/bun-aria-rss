  "title": "How Uncle Si and Godwin Met Their Wives",
  "description": "Si talks about meeting his wife in an unexpected place, but it's hard to top Godwin's \"Jerry Springer\"-worthy story of how he met his woman. Martin has questions about hot dog eating contests and the people who enter them. Si recalls the time Willie became an accidental panhandler. Godwin made a top-shelf meal from the bread JD brought in, and now he's ready to rate your sammich. The boys talk about a venom-spitting snake on the loose, getting rid of pests, the best places to visit in West Monroe, and how to find people to date when church isn't working. And Si calls BS on Martin's biology lesson. \n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
