But watching Insecure also became a large part of our production process as a team. We have a group chat where we share our reactions to the episodes, we discussed which episodes we would recap, and what topics we wanted to delve deeper into. So not only are we saying goodbye to the show, we’re also saying goodbye to that piece of our work together. So we wanted to share our thoughts about what this has meant to our work, our thoughts on the finale, and some thoughts on the documentary that was released to accompany the finale detailing more of the behind the scenes action.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>Check out a playlist of all of the Insecure related episodes <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1HWzLJ1sgWXD5OSUaUtA3Y?si=e34ce43ba9c0407d\">here</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p><p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
