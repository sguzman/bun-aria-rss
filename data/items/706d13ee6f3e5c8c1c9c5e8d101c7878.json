  "description": "Many people think they need to change their lives before they can draw near to God. They need to clean up a few things. But we can’t clean up our own lives. We can’t bring the change God wants to bring in our lives. He had to come to us through Jesus, and He has brought us salvation through Jesus’ blood. Only Jesus Christ can change your life. There’s no mess you’ve made that He can’t help you clean up. In Jesus, you are made right with God. There is nothing that God cannot do for you through Jesus Christ. There’s nothing on the inside of you that would make you distant from God. He loves you just the way you are! Whatever you’re facing today, God wants you to know: “I’m right here. I’m an up close and personal God. Come close to Me and know that I will help you.”<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
