  "title": "Rodrigo Zeidan, \"Economics of Global Business\" (MIT Press, 2018)",
  "description": "I spoke with Professor Rodrigo Zeidan of New York University, Shanghai. He has just published Economics of Global Business (MIT Press, 2018), a great book with innovative real-world macroeconomic analyses of timely policy issues, with case studies and examples from more than fifty countries. The book is particularly suitable for use as an introduction to macroeconomics for business students. If you are looking for something accessible that covers also the most contemporary topics (inequality, climate change, migration, sustainability, austerity, financial crisis…), go and buy it.\nIt is a beautiful book written having in mind students with no previous education in economics. It is original in its style, in the selection of themes and in the approach to policy making. The book is divided into two parts and 15 chapters. The preface starts with an amazing personal story of his infancy.\nAfter presenting analytical foundations, modeling tools, and theoretical perspectives, Economics of Global Business goes a step further than most other texts, with a practical look at the local and multinational tradeoffs facing economic policymakers in more than fifty countries. Topics range from income equality and the financial crisis to GDP, inflation and unemployment, and, notably, one of the first macroeconomic examinations of climate change. Written by a globetrotting economist who teaches and consults on three continents, Economics of Global Business aims not for definitive answers but rather to provide a better understanding of the context-dependent rationales, constraints, and consequences of economic policy decisions.\nThe book covers long-run and short-run growth (with examples from the United States, China, the European Union, South Korea, Japan, Latin America, Africa, Australia, and Vietnam); financial crises and central banks; monetary and fiscal policies; government budgets; currency regimes; climate change and macroeconomics; income inequality; and globalization. All chapters rely on recent and historical examples of economic policy in action.\nRodrigo Zeidan is an Associate Professor of Practice of Business and Finance at New York University Shanghai and a Visiting Professor at Brazil's Fundação Dom Cabral and Copenhagen Business School. His more recent research focuses on Sustainable Finance, alongside issues in Corporate Finance and Development Economics. Alongside his article in Nature Sustainability, his research has been published in the Journal of Corporate Finance, Harvard Business Review, Journal of Business Ethics and Journal of Environmental Management, among others. Rodrigo has written extensively for media outlets, including the The New York Times, World Economic Forum, Bloomberg, Americas Quarterly and Financial Times.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
