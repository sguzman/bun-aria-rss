  "description": "In today’s episode, Sharon is joined by podcaster Jeff Dauler and the two sit down and talk about Alaska’s 1964 earthquake–the largest earthquake ever recorded. While scientists said that the quake made the earth “ring like a bell” and the shaking and subsequent landslides and tsunamis devastated many Alaskan towns and cities, it also led to modern geological insights about how the earth’s crust is understood. They also talk about the lead scientist–a pioneer in her field–who led the efforts to identify potential future disasters and develop safety protocols.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
