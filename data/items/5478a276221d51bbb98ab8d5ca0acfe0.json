Minihane responds to the media panic over New Orleans Saints QB Drew Brees saying he doesn't like it when the American flag is disrespected (0:13:40). Ellie Schnitt, the host of Barstool's podcast Schnitt Talk, fought back against Minihane's criticism of her comments on recent protests, rioting, and looting (0:24:10). Happily, the affray introduces us to Gina -- the protest tutor you will come to love.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
