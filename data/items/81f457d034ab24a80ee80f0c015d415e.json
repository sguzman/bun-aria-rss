  "title": "Ep. 849 - Brain Dead Supreme Court Justice Calls Unborn Babies Brain Dead",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, starring bestselling children’s author Matt Walsh, the Supreme Court hears a case that very well could overturn Roe v Wade. During arguments, Justice Sotomayor helpfully demonstrated the scientific and moral vacuousness of the pro-abortion side. We’ll look at that today. Also, my event at SLU went forward yesterday, despite the mob of protesters who stood outside blocking traffic. I tried to go out and talk to them but the conversation was not productive. And the Waukesha mass murderer complains that he’s being “demonized” for plowing his car into a parade and killing six people. Alec Baldwin makes himself the victim in his first interview since he shot and killed a woman on a movie set. And Australia hunts down three teenagers who escaped a quarantine camp. Finally, in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll take a look at the worst Christmas comedy of all time, just released by HBO. \nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.
