  "title": "Ep 129 | ‘The Media Is an Assembly Line to Hell' | Andrew Yang | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "It didn’t take long for Andrew Yang to learn how vicious and broken the media and our two-party political system are. During his 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, he felt the system’s corruption firsthand. So now, he’s on a mission to fix it — and he started by leaving the Democratic Party behind to form a new one: The Forward Party, which he outlines in his newest book, \"Forward: Notes on the Future of Our Democracy.\" Yang joins Glenn for a conversation that the two-party system says should never happen, but that results in something rare: allies in the fight to prepare for the greatest upheaval mankind might ever have seen — the automation-fueled “revolution of all things.” While Glenn and Andrew debate climate change and Yang’s trademark $1,000 universal basic income proposal, they find common ground on tech, cryptocurrency, and disturbing political trends that would have the Founding Fathers rolling in their graves.\n\nSponsor: \n\nPreborn - Will you help rescue 10,000 babies’ lives?
