  "description": "<p>The slightly directionless, unnamed narrator of Katie Kitamura’s fourth novel, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/books/review/intimacies-katie-kitamura.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Intimacies,”</a> takes a job as a translator at an international criminal court. On this week’s podcast, Kitamura talks about the novel, including her realization about the book’s title.</p><p>“‘Intimacy’ as a word is something that we think of as desirable, and something that we seek out, in our relationships in particular, but also in our friendships and in all the people that we care about,” Kitamura says. “But I think it’s a plural for a reason, which is that there’s a lot of different kinds of intimacies in the novel, and a lot of them are not desired, they’re imposed on the narrator. It was only when I finished writing the novel that I realized that there are multiple incidents of sexual harassment, sexual intimidation in it, sprinkled throughout. Afterward, I understood it, because a novel is really about power, and sexual harassment is of course about power, rather than desire. So it made sense that there would be these little negotiations and these trespasses and these forced forms of intimacy.”</p><p>The acclaimed writer and director James Lapine visits the podcast to talk about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/books/review/putting-it-together-james-lapine.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Putting It Together,”</a> his new mix of memoir and oral history about his first collaboration Stephen Sondheim, creating the musical “Sunday in the Park With George.”</p><p>“Part of the pleasure in writing the book was rediscovering who I was at the time, because you’re so involved in something — you’re not outside of it — and maybe it takes 35 years to look back at it to realize what was actually going on,” Lapine says. Writing the book was “an excavation of sorts, both of the show and the creative process and what it’s like for someone in my position, as a writer and a director, to do his first Broadway show.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Tina Jordan looks back at Book Review history as it celebrates its 125th anniversary; Elizabeth Harris has news from the publishing world; and Dwight Garner and Jennifer Szalai talk about books they’ve recently reviewed. Pamela Paul is the host.</p><p>Here are the books discussed by the Times’s critics this week:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/books/review-until-proven-safe-quarantine-geoff-manaugh-nicola-twilley.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Until Proven Safe”</a> by Geoff Manaugh and Nicola Twilley</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/books/review-afterparties-anthony-veasna-so.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Afterparties”</a> by Anthony Veasna So</p>\n",
