However, she made up for it with the best Christmas gift ever to her husband thanks to artist Lacy Freeman\n\nHow the idea for Parish-Hadley: Tree of Life came about, which lead to him first writing Luminous Interiors\n\nHow he handles clients that “ghost” him, and the reasons why he would possibly turn potential clients down\nHow Brian’s design creates a joyful scrapbook in people’s lives, to cover the beauty and art that makes up their personal lives\nHow working with Parish-Hadley informed the unique way he lays out a room\nBrian’s tips for creating a composition that works, including why you should never leave home without a folding ruler\nThe glamorous makeover Brian gave to a storied New York apartment, and his tips to deviating from the expected path of design\nHow we can shop for art on a budget, and where Brian finds art for his clients\nHow designing for a yacht differs from designing for a home\nThe importance of finding a mentor when developing an understanding of cost, and honing in on what art and pieces speak to you\nSimple easy ways to refresh your space and continue with maintenance that won’t break the bank",
