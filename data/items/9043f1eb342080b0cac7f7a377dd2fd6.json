Earl Mitchell delves into the step-by-step process for new users on his blog, <a href=\"http://rotoquant.com/2014/10/16/official-nfl-megatool-user-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">The Rotoquant</a>.</p>\n<p>But some of you are probably just plain old tired of all this &#8220;Deflatriots&#8221; business and of having your television occupied  by football games, news, talking heads, and commercials from September through February, because after a while, the teams start to blur together. Fortunately, with the help of the Wolfram Language, you can pick your team out of the crowd using this <a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Graph.html\"><tt>Graph</tt></a> of NFL logos we created by pulling the images from our Wolfram Knowledgebase and using <a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Nearest.html\"><tt>Nearest</tt></a> to organize them by graphical similarity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/teams\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/35/2015/01/american-football-logos-arranged-with-Nearest-by-graphical-similarity-5052.png\" alt=\"NFL logos arranged with Nearest by graphical similarity\" title=\"NFL logos arranged with Nearest by graphical similarity\" width=\"505\" height=\"438\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29103\" srcset=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/35/2015/01/american-football-logos-arranged-with-Nearest-by-graphical-similarity-5052.png 505w, https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/35/2015/01/american-football-logos-arranged-with-Nearest-by-graphical-similarity-5052-300x260.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re one of those who are weary of all the football hoopla, then let us soothe your soul with a time-honored and longstanding tradition of cuteness: Animal Planet&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/puppy-bowl/\" target=\"_blank\">Puppy Bowl XI</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/puppy-bowl/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/35/2015/01/PuppyBowl-505.png\" alt=\"Puppy Bowl XI\" title=\"Puppy Bowl XI\" width=\"505\" height=\"411\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29107\" srcset=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/35/2015/01/PuppyBowl-505.png 505w, https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/35/2015/01/PuppyBowl-505-300x244.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" /></a></p>\n<p>With celebrities such as Katty Furry performing in the halftime show, it promises to be the most adorable sports game you&#8217;ll watch all year. The competition will be fierce, with 57 shelter-donated puppies—all up for adoption!—fighting for the honor to be the Bissel MVP (Most Valuable Puppy).</p>\n<p>Past MVPs have included Max and Abigail, both <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=jack+russell+terrier&lk=4&num=1\">Jack Russell Terriers</a>, and the last MVP, Loren, was a <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=brittany+dog\">Brittany</a>, a breed not present in 2015&#8217;s lineup.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=jack+russell+terrier&lk=4&num=1\"><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/35/2015/01/jack-russell-terrier-in-wolfram-alpha-505.png\" alt=\"Jack Russell Terrier in Wolfram|Alpha\" title=\"Jack Russell Terrier in Wolfram|Alpha\" width=\"505\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29109\" srcset=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/35/2015/01/jack-russell-terrier-in-wolfram-alpha-505.png 505w, https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/35/2015/01/jack-russell-terrier-in-wolfram-alpha-505-300x207.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" /></a></p>\n<p>It’s not unlikely that one of the eight <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=labrador+retriever\">Labrador Retrievers</a> will take home the prize for the first time ever. Again using the Wolfram Language, here&#8217;s the breakdown of Puppy Bowl breeds:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/35/2015/01/dog-breeds-in-puppy-bowl-xi-5051.png\" alt=\"Breed representation in this year&#039;s Puppy Bowl\" title=\"Breed representation in this year&#039;s Puppy Bowl\" width=\"505\" height=\"429\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-29101\" srcset=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/35/2015/01/dog-breeds-in-puppy-bowl-xi-5051.png 505w, https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/35/2015/01/dog-breeds-in-puppy-bowl-xi-5051-300x254.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" /></p>\n<p>But who knows, one of those <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=snoopy+curve\">Beagles</a> could come out of the end zone and snatch the victorious touchdown from right under their wet noses.
