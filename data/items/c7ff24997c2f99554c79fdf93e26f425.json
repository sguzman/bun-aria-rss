  "description": "One of the best things about working with Baby lock is meeting the other ambassadors that work in with the machines. Mallory Donohue make a lot of things, specializing in clothing. I first ‘found her’ by her wonderful videos on how to use the Sashiko machine. She and her mom Zede run SewHere.com. Which is about teaching sewing for everyone via their website, videos, FaceBook lives, and podcasts. We chat about making clothing that fits as we quilters have amazing fabric we can use for things other than quilts!\n----\nWho do I turn to for questions on the quilting design program Electric Quilt? My good friend Nancy Mahoney! She has been using the program for years, is and EQ Ambassador, and knows the ins and outs. I wanted to tell you about some of the features you might not know about with Nancy as our guide!\n---------\nI was so excited to see Jenny Wilding Cardon’s book Visible Mending. The idea of artfully mending items is on the upswing and her book has so many fantastic ways to do this. Things we quilters will love! I first saw visible mending in about 1973 when one of the girls a few grades older than me was doing this to her favorite jeans. The one I remember most was a pocket, with zipper, on the inside thigh of her jeans. She kept her lunch money there.. it was the 70s.. the jeans had elephant bells and she was very on trend! Jenny also works for Martingale as an editor in charge of their online blog, facebook and Instagram account. She is incredible, you are going to love her!\n================\nVisit American Patchwork & Quilting at www.allpeoplequilt.com.\nVisit host Pat Sloan at www.patsloan.com.\n================\nBONUS for our podcast subscribers!
