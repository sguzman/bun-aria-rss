  "description": "The notorious stock-to-flow model that was perfectly predicting the direction of Bitcoin's movement until the massive correction we saw in May and June suggests that the king crypto (BTC) will reach $72,000 this week, but it is unlikely to happen.\n\nPreviously, a Fidelity analyst explained why S2F is no longer accurate and will not be in the future. S2F's main source of prediction is the scarcity of the asset, which cannot drive the Bitcoin price alone, especially in modern markets.\n\nWith Bitcoin, we should add adoption to scarcity to see better results. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to accurately calculate the technology's adoption rate in the future even if we compare it to similar technologies like mobile devices or the internet.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
