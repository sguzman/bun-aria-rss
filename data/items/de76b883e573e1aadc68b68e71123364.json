  "content": "<p>I recently visited the UK Meteorology Office, a moderately large organization\nthat serves the weather and climate forecasting needs of the UK (and several\nother nations).  I was there with other open source colleagues including <a href=\"https://joehamman.com/\">Joe\nHamman</a> and\n<a href=\"https://dopplershift.github.io/\">Ryan May</a> from\nopen source projects like\n<a href=\"https://dask.org\">Dask</a>,\n<a href=\"https://xarray.pydata.org\">Xarray</a>,\n<a href=\"https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">JupyterHub</a>,\n<a href=\"https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/\">MetPy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/v0.16/\">Cartopy</a>,\nand the broader <a href=\"https://pangeo.io\">Pangeo community</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This visit was like many other visits I’ve had over the years that are centered\naround showing open source tooling to large institutions, so I thought I’d\nwrite about it in hopes that it helps other people in this situation in the\nfuture.</p>\n\n<p>My goals for these visits are the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Teach the institution about software projects and approaches that may help\nthem to have a more positive impact on the world</li>\n  <li>Engage them in those software projects and hopefully spread around the\nmaintenance and feature development burden a bit</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-1-meet-allies-on-the-ground\">Step 1: Meet allies on the ground</h2>\n\n<p>We were invited by early adopters within the institution, both within the UK\nMet Office’s <a href=\"https://www.informaticslab.co.uk/\">Informatics Lab</a> a research /\nincubation group within the broader organization, and the Analysis,\nVisualization, and Data group (AVD) who serve 500 analysts at the Met Office\nwith their suite of open source tooling.</p>\n\n<p>Both of these groups are forward thinking, already use and appreciate the tools\nthat we were talking about, and hope to leverage our presence to evangelize\nwhat they’ve already been saying throughout their institution.  They need\noutside experts to provide external validation; that’s our job.</p>\n\n<p>The goals for the early adopters are the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Reinforce the message they’ve already been saying internally, that these\ntools and approaches can improve operations within the institution</li>\n  <li>Discuss specific challenges that they’ve been having with the software\ndirectly with maintainers</li>\n  <li>Design future approaches to adopt within their forward-thinking groups</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So our visit was split between meeting a variety of groups within the\ninstitution (analysts, IT, …) and talking shop.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-2-talk-to-it\">Step 2: Talk to IT</h2>\n\n<p>One of our first visits was a discussion with a cross-department team of people\narchitecting a variety of data processing systems throughout the company.  <a href=\"https://joehamman.com/\">Joe\nHamman</a> and I gave a quick talk about Dask, XArray, and the\nPangeo community.  Because this was more of an IT-focused group I went\nfirst, answered the standard onslaught of IT-related questions about Dask, and\nestablished credibility.  Then Joe took over and demonstrated the practical\nrelevance of the approach from their users’ perspective.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve done this tag-team approach a number of times and its always effective.\nHaving a technical person speak to technical concerns while also having a\nscientist demonstrating organizational value seems to establish credibility\nacross a wide range of people.</p>\n\n<p>However it’s still important to tailor the message to the group at hand.\nIT-focused groups like this one are usually quite conservative about adding new\ntechnology, and they have a constant pressure of users asking them for things\nthat will generally cause problems.  We chose to start with low-level technical\ndetails because it lets them engage with the problem at a level that they can\nmeaningfully test and assess the situation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-3-give-a-talk-to-a-broader-audience\">Step 3: Give a talk to a broader audience</h2>\n\n<p>Our early-adopter allies had also arranged a tech-talk with a wider audience\nacross the office.  This was part of a normal lecture series, so we had a large\ncrowd, along with a video recording within the institution for future viewers.\nThe audience this time was a combination of analysts (users of our software),\nsome IT, and an executive or two.</p>\n\n<p>Joe and I gave essentially the same talk, but this time we reversed the order,\nfocusing first on the scientific objectives, and then following up with a more\nbrief summary on how the software accomplishes this.  A pretty constant message\nin this talk was …</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>other institutions like yours have already adopted this approach and are experiencing transformative change as a result</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We provide social proof by showing that lots of other popular projects\nand developer communities integrate with these tools, and that many large\ngovernment organizations (peers to the UK Met Office) are already adopting\nthese tools and seeing efficiency gains.</p>\n\n<p>Our goals for this section are the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Encourage the users within the audience to apply pressure to their\nmanagement/IT to make it easier for them to integrate these tools to their\neveryday workflow</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Convince management that this is a good approach.</p>\n\n    <p>This means two things for them:</p>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>These methods are well established outside of the institution,\nand not just something that their engineers are presently enamored with</li>\n      <li>These methods can enable transformative change within the organization</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-4-talk-to-many-smaller-groups\">Step 4: Talk to many smaller groups</h2>\n\n<p>After we gave the talk to the larger audience we met with many smaller groups.\nThese were groups that managed the HPC systems, were in charge of storing data\non the cloud, ran periodic data processing pipelines, etc..  Doing this after\nthe major talk is useful, because people arrive with a pretty good sense of\nwhat the software does, and how it might help them.  Conversations then become\nmore specific quickly.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-5-engage-with-possible-maintainers\">Step 5: Engage with possible maintainers</h2>\n\n<p>During this process I had the good fortune to work with <a href=\"https://github.com/dkillick\">Peter\nKillick</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/bjlittle\">Bill\nLittle</a> who had done a bit of work on Dask in the\npast and were interested in doing more.  Before coming to the Met Office we found\na bug that was of relevance to them, but also involved learning some more Dask\nskills.  We worked on it off and on during the visit and it was great to get to\nknow them better and hopefully they’re more likely to fix issues that arise in\nthe future with more familiarity.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-6-engage-with-other-core-developers\">Step 6: Engage with other core developers</h2>\n\n<p>Between the visitors and our hosts we had several core developers present on\nrelated projects (XArray, Iris, Dask, Cartopy, Metpy, …).  This was a good\ntime not just for evangelism and growing the community, but also for making\nlong-term plans about existing projects, identifying structural issues in the\necosystem, and identifying new projects to fix those issues.</p>\n\n<p>There was good conversation around the future relationship between\n<a href=\"https://xarray.pydata.org\">Xarray</a> and\n<a href=\"https://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/\">Iris</a> two similar packages that\ncould play better together.  We discussed current\n<a href=\"https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">JupyterHub</a> deployments both\nwithin the UK Met office, and without.  Developers for the popular\n<a href=\"https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/\">Cartopy</a> library got together.  A couple of\nus prototyped a very early stage unstructured mesh data structure.</p>\n\n<p>These visits are one of the few times when a mostly distributed community gets\ntogether and can make in-person plans.  Sitting down with a blank sheet of\npaper is a useful exercise that is still remarkably difficult to replicate\nremotely.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-7-have-a-good-time\">Step 7: Have a good time</h2>\n\n<p>It turns out that the Southwest corner of England is full of fine pubs, and\neven better walking.  I’m thankful to <a href=\"https://pelson.github.io/\">Phil Elson</a>\nand Jo Camp for hosting me over the weekend where we succeeded in chatting\nabout things other than work.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mrocklin.github.io/blog/images/sw-england.jpg\"><img src=\"https://mrocklin.github.io/blog/images/sw-england.jpg\" width=\"50%\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mrocklin.github.io/blog/images/uk-met-pub.jpg\"><img src=\"https://mrocklin.github.io/blog/images/uk-met-pub.jpg\" width=\"50%\" /></a></p>"
