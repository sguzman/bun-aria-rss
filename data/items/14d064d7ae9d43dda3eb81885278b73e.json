  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">President of the Barna Group, David Kinnaman, is back to talk about the latest research on race and racism in the American church. Is the divide between black and white Christians shrinking, and is 2020 a true turning point or just an emotional release before a return to old ways of operating? Also this week, how can constellations help us understand the hysteria about Antifa? And does the evangelical emphasis on individual salvation contribute to racial resentment?
