Scene shifts to a German town or village with American Army trucks passing by and German civilians (women, children, a few older men) in a queue, several doors down from the Konditorei (patisserie or bakery). Directional sign pointing toward 67th Medical Evacuation Hospital implies the location is in or near Bonn, as the 67th was located there until March 31, 1945. Scene changes to an elevated view of the Rhine River from the Northwest looking toward the Victor Bridge pontoon bridge, one other pontoon bridge, and the wrecked Ludendorff Bridge (also known as the Remagen Bridge), in the distance, at Remagen, Germany.
