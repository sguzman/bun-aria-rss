At stake is a $1.3 billion cash infusion that Trump Media & Technology Group, which operates Trump’s Truth Social app, stands to receive from Digital World. Digital World subsequently confirmed it did not get enough shareholder votes in favor of the proposal and pushed back the vote deadline by two days. Shares of Digital World Acquisition Corp fell as much as 27% after Reuters revealed the news.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reutersagency.com/en/reutersbest/article/reuters-reveals-deal-partner-for-trumps-truth-social-fails-to-get-backing-for-spac-extension/\">Reuters reveals deal partner for Trump&#8217;s Truth Social fails to get backing for SPAC extension</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reutersagency.com/en/\">Reuters News Agency</a>.</p>\n"
