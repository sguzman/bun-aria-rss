  "description": "Our audiobook tease this week is Wealthy & Wanted by Alexa Riley!\n\nNarrated by John Strike.\n\nDotty Spencer is desperate. She’s been promised to a man she doesn’t love and is looking for a way out. When she answers an ad for a cleaning woman, she never expects her new boss to be the one.\n\nClay Walker takes one look at Dotty and knows this was a mistake. He isn’t ready for a woman to steal his heart and make him feel things he doesn’t want to. He’s mad as hell that she’s forcing him to open up to what could only be described as love.\n\nWealthy & Wanted: https://bit.ly/35cSKsf\nNaughty and Notorious: https://bit.ly/3dDx0tr \n\nAlexa Riley\nHalloween Bites: https://bit.ly/3jWCrpP\n\nMentioned Books\nHer Christmas Cowboy by Jessica Clare: https://amzn.to/2T6UY71\nShe&#039;s Mine by Jenika Snow: https://amzn.to/3kcbjmN\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nAds Played in Intro\nThe Hitman&#039;s Obsession by Jagger Cole: https://amzn.to/2T89YkW\nThieves & Liars by Rebecca Wilder: https://amzn.to/2HdWMsn\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
