    "media:description": "I show that it's theoretically possible to achieve a double goomba escort, where both goombas walk outside of their home ranges. For convenience, I did this on a testing course that consists of just one giant floor. Thanks to Frame (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCykzKN-KVV6bG2HfxFNqm6g) for suggesting this idea.\n\nTo find this scenario, I simulated 2 goombas with code until one of them walked unnaturally far away from its home. This was the result.\n\nNote that this doesn't help us collect the JRB chest star in 0 A presses. This is because even if one of the goombas was at the star, it would unload if Mario went over there himself, since the goombas are only loaded when Mario is near the goomba spawner.\n\nNote that at the end of the video, one of the goombas deactivates because it moves too far away from Mario. This is different from the goomba unloading from Mario being too far away from the goomba spawner.",
