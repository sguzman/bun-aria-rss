  "title": "How to topple dictators and transform society (with Erica Chenoweth)",
  "description": "The 2010s witnessed a sharp uptick in nonviolent resistance movements all across the globe. Over the course of the last decade we’ve seen record numbers of popular protests, grassroots campaigns, and civic demonstrations advancing causes that range from toppling dictatorial regimes to ending factory farming to advancing a Green New Deal.  \nSo, I thought it would be fitting to kick off 2020 by bringing on Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist at Harvard specializing in nonviolent resistance. At the beginning of this decade Chenoweth co-authored Why Civil Resistance Works, a landmark study showing that nonviolent movements are twice as effective as violent ones. Since then, she has written dozens of papers on what factors make successful movements successful, why global protests are becoming more and more common, how social media has affected resistance movements and much more. \nBut Chenoweth doesn’t only study nonviolent movements from an academic perspective; she also advises nonviolent movement leaders around the world (including former EK Show guests Varshini Prakash of the Sunrise Movement and Wayne Hsiung of Direct Action Everywhere) to help them be as effective and strategic as possible in carrying out their goals. This on-the-ground experience combined with a big-picture, academic view of nonviolent resistance makes her perspective essential for understanding one of the most important phenomena of the last decade -- and, in all likelihood, the next one.\nReferences: \n\"How social media helps dictators\" by Erica Chenoweth\n\"Drop Your Weapons: When and Why Civil Resistance Works\" by Erica Chenoweth\nBook recommendations: \nThese Truths by Jill Lepore\nNonviolence: The History of a Dangerous Idea by Mark Kurlansky\nFrom #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation by Keenga-Yamahtta Taylor\nIf you enjoyed this podcast, you may also like: \nVarshini Prakash on the Sunrise Movement's plan to save humanity \nWhen doing the right thing makes you a criminal (with Wayne Hsiung) \n\nMy book is available for pre-order!
