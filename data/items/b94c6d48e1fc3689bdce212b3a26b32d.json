In the United States, up to 20% of infected individuals are hospitalized and those with a chronic disease are at an exponentially higher risk of hospitalization than someone who is metabolically healthy. Unfortunately, only 12% of us in the U.S. are metabolically healthy. So one of the best things we can do for our individual bodies, and our collective body is to fix our metabolic health as fast as possible.</p><br><p>In every infection, there are two factors at play: the microbe and the host. While we can’t control the microbe, we have extraordinary control over us, the host. This is why it is so important to support your immune system so you are more resilient to infection.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Elizabeth Boham to discuss how we can build resiliency to both prevent poor outcomes and recover from COVID-19 using the principles of Functional Medicine.</p><br><p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices functional medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing. Dr. Boham has contributed to many articles and wrote the latest chapter on Obesity for the Rankel Textbook of Family Medicine. She is part of the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine and has been featured on the Dr. Oz show and in a variety of publications and media including Huffington Post, The Chalkboard Magazine, and Experience Life. Her DVD Breast Wellness: Tools to Prevent and Heal from Breast Cancer explores the functional medicine approach to keeping your breasts and whole body well.</p><br><p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"https://drhyman.com/blog/2020/03/19/house-call-show-notes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">drhyman.com/uwc</a></p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Paleovalley.
