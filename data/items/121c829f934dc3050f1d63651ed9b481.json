And we got so many fantastic ideas from kids all over the world: a solar cooler, a chimney that changes carbon dioxide to oxygen, a slide that gives you an ice cream cone at the bottom, and more. Some kids would like to invent robots that do their chores, flying cars, teleporting devices to take them back in time, and even a bully behavior zapper. </p>\n\n<p>This episode is all about creativity! But how do you take a great idea and turn it into reality? We’ll get advice from teenage brothers Ayaan and Mika’il Naqvi, who invented, patented and now sell Ornament Anchor after Ayaan came up with the idea in fourth grade. </p>\n\n<p>Download our learning guides: <a href=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/b7/7b/a06a41bc4c6799db175fd0f21132/what-would-you-invent-ideas-from-kids.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PDF</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jVtqAQgKnutAoVQdhiZ9lNw-P6t8jqIffeqefdAp1ZQ/copy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google Slide</a> | <a href=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/d8/15/d243fc144139ac2afe9a45600c2c/but-why-170-inventions-transcript.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>What would you invent?
