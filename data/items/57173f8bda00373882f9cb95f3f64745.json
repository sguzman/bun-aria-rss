  "description": "Ben Padilla. May 25, 2003. A plane in Angola is being repaired after sitting idle for 14 months. A company had been leasing it, but had not been making payments on it and had accrued a massive bill just sitting at an airport. The owner of the plane had hired a man, Ben Padilla, to oversee a team of mechanics to get the 727 flight-ready. All of the seats beyond the cabin had been removed so that the plane could carry more than 5000 gallons of diesel fuel in 10 large tanks. For unknown reasons the plane would suddenly enter a runway and take off. Onboard were Padilla and a man from the Republic of Congo, John Mutantu. The plane and its occupants would not be seen again. Why was the plane stolen and where are the two men?\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
