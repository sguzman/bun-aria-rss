  "description": "<p>The development of four-lane highways and interstates in the 1950’s and 1960’s created a huge surge in car travel.  In a time before the minivan, families would pile in the station wagon or the Airstream and hit the road to discover America.  Roadside motels sprung up everywhere and car culture exploded.  Sports cars like the wildly famous Mustang defined cool, and what better than to drive around LA or Palm Springs, or anywhere, really, than in a cool car.  Today we explore cars and trailers and Modernism with three guests:  Susan Skarsgard, author of <em>Where Today Meets Tomorrow: Eero Saarinen and the General Motors Technical Center</em>; Tom Dolle and Jeff Stork, authors of <em>Glamour Road: Color, Fashion, Style, and the Midcentury Automobile,</em> and returning podcast guest Eric Bricker, producer of <em>Alumination,</em> a new film about the iconic Airstream travel trailer.</p>",
