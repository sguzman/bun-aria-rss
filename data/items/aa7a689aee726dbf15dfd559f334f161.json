  "description": "In 2004, Dr. Jennifer L. Morgan’s Laboring Women: Reproduction and Gender in New World Slavery (University of Pennsylvania Press) was published. Sixteen years later, Morgan’s Laboring Women stands tall as one of the most important historical texts in the history of the academy.\nBuilding on Dr. Deborah Gray White’s literal field building and seminal 1985 monograph, Ar’n’t I A Woman?: Female Slaves in the Plantation South, Laboring Women clearly added to White’s tradition, but also helped blaze a trail in her own right. Laboring Women was the first historical text to focus on Black women’s reproductive labor under New World slavery in the early modern period.\nLaboring Women is also critically important to scholarly understandings about African and African American history, reproduction, gender, sexuality, capitalism, and MORE! To say the least, since 2004, the game wasn’t the same, anymore! Learn why by listening to the conversation! Enjoy New Books in African American Studies listeners.\nDr. Jennifer L. Morgan is Professor of Social & Cultural Analysis & History; Chair of the Department of Social & Cultural Analysis where she focuses on the history of the Black Atlantic World; comparative slavery, gender and sexuality studies.\nAdam McNeil is a third-year PhD Student in the Department of History at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.
