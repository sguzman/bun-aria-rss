    "media:description": "This is arguably the world's biggest rotten-tail project, a place called Xiong'an that was considered a partial replacement for Beijing. Itâ€™s located in Hebei province, a neighboring province to Beijing, and was a personal dream of the Chinese Communist Party Leader Xi Jinping. Unfortunately, the project, which was billed as a \"millennium project and a major national event,\" fell apart after only five years, demonstrating a complete crash of Xi's dream.\n\nHave questions?
