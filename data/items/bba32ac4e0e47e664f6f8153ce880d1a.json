  "description": "Private barrel selections are becoming the hot new item. These carefully selected barrels are brought into a store and chosen for a particular audience. However, can every one be a winner? Do you trust who picked it? Just because a label said it was chosen by a master distiller, did he really pick it or was it leftovers from other barrel picks? And of course, we have to cover stickers because it's the hotness. It's a podcast that is both fascinating and intriguing and will make you think twice about going into a unknown store to purchase a random barrel pick.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about family and the new  Bourbon Hall of Fame inductees.\n\nRyan, when you go into a store and look for a single barrel pick, what do you gravitate towards?\n\nBack on  Ep 124 we covered creating a barrel picking group and we've talked about individual barrel picks before but we're going to deep dive today\n\nWhat makes barrel picks more special than their standard bottling counterpart?\n\nAre all barrel picks always better than their standard releases?\n\nIf a store picks samples out of a box, are they all just rejects?\n\nIs three samples really enough to go off of?\n\nWhat about stickers that say \"selected by the Master Distiller\"?\n\nMichael Iurato​ asks \"I have not had that many store picks but from my experience it seems like the single store pick is usually better than when a major chain or the state run liquor outlet does a pick. Would you agree?\"\n\nTalk about what it means to have a bourbon group together vs having a store pick for you\n\nIs it really possible to pick a barrel based on the tastes of the customers for a store? I mean everyone is different\n\nIs having \"after market\" stickers a good thing?\n\nIs there too much hype train on them?\n\nLet's speculate.
