And large-scale deficiencies of nutrients in our population—including omega-3 fats, vitamin D, folate, zinc, magnesium, and iron—have been well documented. So what do we need to know when it comes to combating these deficiencies with supplementation?</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Elizabeth Boham to discuss common nutrient deficiencies and what you need to know about determining what supplements are best for you.</p><br><p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices functional medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing. Dr. Boham has contributed to many articles and wrote the latest chapter on Obesity for the Rankel Textbook of Family Medicine. She is part of the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine and has been featured on the Dr. Oz show and in a variety of publications and media including Huffington Post, The Chalkboard Magazine, and Experience Life. Her DVD Breast Wellness: Tools to Prevent and Heal from Breast Cancer explores the functional medicine approach to keeping your breasts and whole body well.</p><br><p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"https://drhyman.com/blog/2020/03/19/house-call-show-notes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">drhyman.com/uwc</a></p><br><p>This episode is brought&nbsp;to you by Audible.com.
