  "description": "<p>In 1899 two newspaper giants were fighting for control of the New York readership, and tried to squeeze their distributors for an extra advantage. Those distributors were self-employed child laborers, who organized themselves and halted the entire distribution system until their demands were met. This drama, a nearly forgotten footnote in US labor history, was dramatized in a commercial flop of a film, and re-dramatized in a successful Broadway musical. Can a success set a precedent if it's forgotten? Does an adaptation have a duty to be accurate; and what if the facts are lost? How can an unpopular work become more sucessful after being changed for the worse?</p>\n<p>Links!</p>\n<ul><li><a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104990/'>Newsies (1992)</a></li>\n<li><a href='http://www.newsiesthemusical.com/'>Newsies the Musical</a></li>\n<li><a href='http://www.headstuff.org/2015/02/artemisia-gentileschi-renaissance-painter/'>Artemisia Gentileschi, Renaissance Painter</a>, by listener Ciaran</li>\n<li><a href='https://soundcloud.com/user-632536400'>SEX ARCHIE</a> (<a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/sex-archie/id1207818205?mt=2'>iTunes</a>/<a href='http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/history-honeys/sex-archie?refid=stpr'>Stitcher</a>/<a href='http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:288025582/sounds.rss'>RSS</a>) <a href='https://twitter.com/Sex_Archie'>twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href='http://www.alcohollywood.com/warcraft-2016/'>Warcraft on Alcohollywood</a></li>\n<li><a href='http://www.sixfeatsunder.com/mouse-guard/'>Mouse Guard by Six Feats Under</a></li>\n</ul>\n\nPlease help our show succeed by sharing it.
