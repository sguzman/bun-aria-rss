  "description": "In this, our second year in review episode for the year ahead we look at US domestic developments in the next 12 months.  The bad news is--they're pretty bleak.  The good news is--we tell them to you in advance so you can sleep through the whole year or just settle into a drunken stupor.  Join Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake, Ed Luce, David Sanger and Deep State Dog for a great conversation about what will surely be the very worst year in Donald Trump's life.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
