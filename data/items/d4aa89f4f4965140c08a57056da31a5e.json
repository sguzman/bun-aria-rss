  "description": "<p>The Battle of Gettysburg is perhaps the most famous battle of the Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln even gave one of his most enduring speeches from Gettysburg and named it the Gettysburg Address. Nearly every American knows the first line, which reads, \"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" Many men died during that battle and it was truly the turning point of the war and the beginning of the defeat of the Confederacy. Perhaps this is why the Battle of Gettysburg continues to this day. Not just as a part of re-enactments, but as ghostly battles continuing on the field. Countless witnesses have reported seeing the battle, hearing the sounds of the battle and bumping into ghostly soldiers. Today, we explore the history and hauntings of Gettysburg. The Moment in Oddity features the Nagyrev Poisonings and This Day in History features the railway opening in Dublin.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a title= \"http://historygoesbump.com\" href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Become an Executive producer and help support the show:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/10/hgb-podcast-ep-74-gettysburg.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/10/hgb-podcast-ep-74-gettysburg.html</a></p>",
