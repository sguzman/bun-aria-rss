  "title": "My Kids Are Out of Control, What Should I Do?",
  "description": "When your child's actions and words seem totally out of control, it means they *feel* out of control. In these moments, kids need our help differentiating between their behavior and their feelings: They're a good kid having a hard time, not a bad kid doing bad things. In today's episode, Dr. Becky talks with three parents about navigating tantrums at their worst. She talks through trusting yourself as your family's sturdy leader (especially when family members don't understand your approach), and walks through multiple strategies to use inside and outside of the moment. \n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
