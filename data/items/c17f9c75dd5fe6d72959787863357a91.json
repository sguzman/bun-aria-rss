  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! Our guest this week is the single best gold-stock analyst I know, John Doody. He is the editor for the now-famous Gold Stock Analyst Newsletter. To start off the interview, John and I talk about gold's biggest misconception. The truth is, we do NOT know what the price of gold will be going forward. However, after recent pullbacks, John reassures investors by giving us the big picture. He explains how one \"inevitable\" key factor will ultimately drive the price of gold... and that nothing else we hear matters. John's \"old-school\" mentality is one of a kind. He is a fundamentalist. He tells listeners how to protect their savings, and as you will hear, its not only about gold. Later in the episode, John breaks down his secrets to finding the world's most undervalued mining stocks. His analysis includes the biggest names in the industry, junior miners, and the \"least risky\" business models to invest in. I don't say this often, but I believe we're on the brink of a once-in-a-decade opportunity.",
