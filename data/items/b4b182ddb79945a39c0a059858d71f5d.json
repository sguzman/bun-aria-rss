  "description": "Jalen & Jacoby are gonna get you right for NFL Week 3, they break down the big games, they cover the Browns win over the Steelers, they've got Jerry Jones news... but the real story today, is Ben Simmons. For the first time in what feels like well over a year, Ben Simmons spoke publicly, earnestly, and candidly about how his time in Philly ended. He joined J.J. Redick for a conversation that lasted over an hour, and touched on EVERY TOPIC you wanted to hear... the shooting, the breakup with Embiid and Doc, the infamous (and frankly over-played) Trae Young non-dunk... and you know what? It was good. So we got into it -- tap in! \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
