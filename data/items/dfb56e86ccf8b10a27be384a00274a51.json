Given the picture of the cookie with the candies, I&#8217;d say the probability of getting a bite with no candies is more like 1/10.</p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s all this with the prior distribution:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-24-at-9.46.05-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" /></p>\n<p>This demonstrates a general point that we see in Bayesian analysis: lots of obsessing over the prior, but the likelihood is set up without much thought at all!  Obv the numbers in the cookie example are arbitrary:  for the purpose of teaching, it doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s 1/3 or 1/10 or whatever.  The larger problem comes both in teaching and in practice, when people use likelihoods that are way off, and they never even think to check.</p>\n",
