  "description": "<p><p>Two-time Stanley Cup winner Conor Sheary of the Pittsburgh Penguins and \"Stool Scenes\" creator Ben \"Young Pageviews\" Friedman join Episode 71 of Spittin' Chiclets. Sheary talks about his journey from undrafted ZooMass player to a guy seeking the NHL's first three-peat in 35 years. He also talks about his team's confidence regarding another Cup, Phil Kessel's salad, and the annual spring influx of U.S. college players to NHL rosters. YP checks in to talk about why the Blues have deadened his inner fan, his eliteprospects.com page, and how his 'shooters shoot' attitude landed him a career at Barstool. RA and Whits also discuss the Wild Card races in each conference, updated Cup odds, and the impact of adding college players when their seasons end. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
