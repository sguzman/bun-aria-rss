  "description": "<div>In July 2014, 18-year-old Conrad Roy died by suicide in his car at a parking lot in Fairhaven, Mass. Police soon discovered a series of alarming text messages from his girlfriend, 17-year-old Michelle Carter, that seemed to encourage him to kill himself. This discovery sparked sensational headlines nationwide, leading to a trial that raised difficult questions about technology, social media and mental health, while asking if one person can be held responsible for the suicide of another. Â <br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Part 2 follows the defense as they present their case and the shocking new information they present may force us to see the case, and the suicide, in a new way.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?
