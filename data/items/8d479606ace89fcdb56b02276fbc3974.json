  "description": "Coming to a PTA meeting near you, Sofia and her hellchild! \nYep! Sofia is having a baby! Clear your schedule because everyone knows she is NOT watching after that thing. Baby Sloot was decided upon AFTER Sofia abandoned her boyfriend and a Sloot Media employee at the St. Regis hotel to fend for themselves while she proceeded to get blackout drunk - only to wake up in a random hotel room next to a couple partaking in intercourse! Just Sofia things. Sofia also teaches us a VERY important Sloot University lesson regarding GIRL CODE, telling us all the do’s and dont’s of friendship in womanhood…which we know she knows ALL about. PRO TIP: Sending pussy pics to your friends boyfriend is a no go! Anyway, Sofia’s baby is screaming and she’s probably in a ditch somewhere so tune in!
