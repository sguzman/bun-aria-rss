  "description": "<p>Over the past year, near-total abortion bans have been instituted across America, including in Texas and Oklahoma. In December 2021, Beyond the Scenes host Roy Wood Jr. sat down with Texas-based OB/GYN and abortion provider, Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi, to discuss Texas’s new policies. In light of the Supreme Court leak that threatens Roe v. Wade, Dr. Moayedi rejoins Roy and executive director and founder of We Testify, Renee Bracey Sherman, to discuss where abortion rights are headed, how Texans and Oklahomans are already living without the protections of Roe v. Wade, and why voting isn’t the most effective solution for supporting abortion rights.
