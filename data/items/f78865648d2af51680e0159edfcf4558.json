  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Here’s an interview I did where we discussed the decline of the print industry and how the companies in those spaces should navigate the obvious shift to digital. The thing is that it’s not just theory, it’s execution that matters. The issue we’re facing these days is that media companies that are selling print don’t have to put the same amount of effort or planning in print as they would in Facebook and it also doesn’t hurt that they’re reaping the benefits from higher margins. And don’t even get me started on the lack of metrics media companies are held to when pushing print campaigns … Listen for more on how the media industry is shifting and how legacy companies that don't adjust are going to die. </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5155070.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
