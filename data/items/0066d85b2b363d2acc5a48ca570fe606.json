He may have captured our teen hearts but we’re also interested in what he’s been up to since then, on TV and on stage: Fringe, The Affair, When They See Us, Children of a Lesser God… Joshua brings a preternaturally mature persona that makes our eyes shine and our [REDACTED] tingle. \nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit.
