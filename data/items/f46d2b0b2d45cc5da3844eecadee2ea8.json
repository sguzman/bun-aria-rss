WannaCry observers focus on North Korea as a possible source. Palo Alto Networks' Rick Howard has research on Shamoon. Joyce Brocaglia from Alta Associates and the Executive Women's Forum shares results from the 2017 Women in Cyber Security Survey. And no one, yet, knows who the ShadowBrokers are with any certainty.
