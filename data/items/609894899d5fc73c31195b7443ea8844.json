The band has turned a lot of heads within the hardcore and punk world, so I had to have her on the show. We discuss a lot of things including her being a \"horse girl\", fashion and RBS (real bay shit). It's an insightful conversation and stoked to have had it.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
