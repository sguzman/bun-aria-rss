  "description": "<div>2020 has been the most eventful year in the last half-century, with much of the focus falling on the behavior and tactics of the police. Jason Bassler has been watching them well before it was the cool thing to do, and he brings a unique perspective to the show.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Jason is the founder of Police the Police and the co-founder of The Free Thought Project, and he explains how the culture, laws, and external forces help to shape the way that the police behave towards the general public.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Should we disband the police altogether, defund them, retrain them, pressure the unions, or just deal with what we currently have? Jason gives his thoughts on what can be done to change a culture that has allowed some of the worst people in our society to become police officers and operate with virtual impunity because they are protected by a “thin blue line”.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sponsors:<br>\n</strong>Emergency Preparedness Food:<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.preparewithmacroaggressions.com/\">www.preparewithmacroaggressions.com</a><strong><br>\n</strong>Chemical Free Body: <a href=\"http://www.chemicalfreebody.com/\">www.chemicalfreebody.com<br>\n</a>Use the promo code: \"<strong>MACRO\"</strong> for a discount on all purchases!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Online Connection:</strong>\n</div>\n<div>Website: <a href=\"http://www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com/\">www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com</a>\n</div>\n<div>Facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol\">www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macroaggressio3\">www.twitter.com/macroaggressio3</a><br>\nTwitter Handle: @macroaggressio3<br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q\">www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q</a><br>\nApple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://apple.co/2LjTwu5\">https://apple.co/2LjTwu5</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Purchase \"The Octopus Of Global Control\"<br>\n</strong>Amazon:<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr\">https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr</a><br>\nBarnes & Noble: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ\">https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ</a>\n</div>\n",
