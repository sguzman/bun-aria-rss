  "description": "<p>Recently, Google engineer Blake Lemoine made international news with his claims that the company's creation LaMDA - Launguage Model for Dialogue Applications - has become sentient. While Google does describe LaMDA as \"breakthrough conversation technology,\" the company does not agree with Lemoine -- to say the least. In part two of this two-part series, Ben and Matt explore the critics' responses -- as well as Lemoine and LaMDA's takes. (Note: shortly after this recording, Lemoine was officially fired from Google.)</p><p><a href=\"https://static.macmillan.com/static/fib/stuff-you-should-read/\" rel=\"payment\">They don't want you to read our book.: https://static.macmillan.com/static/fib/stuff-you-should-read/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
