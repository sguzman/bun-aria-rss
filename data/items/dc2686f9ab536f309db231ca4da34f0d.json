Over the past two decades, China has begun investing deeply in the continent. Through loans for large-scale infrastructure projects and economic integration, the Asian giant has made a large footprint in Africa. As a result, African nations have begun politically leaning towards China over western nations. In response, western nations have begun their own programs to increase relations with Africa and reestablish strong diplomatic ties. Over the coming decades, Africa will certainly serve as an arena between China and the West, with both sides seeking to gain allies and increase their global influence.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider subscribing to Futurology for more similar content!\n\nThank you to the following sources!\n\nInformation\nhttps://www.fpri.org/article/2022/01/chinese-economic-engagement-in-africa/#:~:text=Between%202001%20and%202018%2C%20China,in%2078%25%20greater%20voting%20alignment.\nhttps://www.energyforgrowth.org/memo/what-could-the-mambilla-dam-do-for-nigeria/\nhttps://www.fpri.org/article/2022/01/chinese-economic-engagement-in-africa/#:~:text=Between%202001%20and%202018%2C%20China,in%2078%25%20greater%20voting%20alignment.\nhttps://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2021/04/02/why-substantial-chinese-fdi-is-flowing-into-africa-foreign-direct-investment/\nhttps://qz.com/africa/2123474/china-africa-trade-reached-an-all-time-high-in-2021/\nhttps://www.fpri.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chinese-investment-in-africa-final.pdf\nhttps://yiqinfu.github.io/posts/united-nations-general-assembly/\nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/article/5-things-u-s-policymakers-must-understand-china-africa-relations/\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6433\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/12/fact-sheet-president-biden-and-g7-leaders-launch-build-back-better-world-b3w-partnership/\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-12/china-surpasses-us-in-the-eyes-of-young-africans-survey-shows\nhttps://www.voanews.com/a/charting-the-future-of-china-s-infrastructure-projects-in-africa-after-a-decade-of-lending-/6355784.html\nhttps://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-in-kenya/\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2020/01/the-hambantota-port-deal-myths-and-realities/\nhttp://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2015-06/04/content_35739149.htm\nhttps://www.ide.go.jp/English/Data/Africa_file/Manualreport/cia_10.html\n\nAudio\nStoryblocks\nYouTube Audio Library\n\nGraphics\nGoogle Earth\nStoryblocks\n\nVideo Chapters\n0:00-1:28 Introduction\n1:28-3:27 Chinese Loans in Africa\n3:27-5:52 Chinese Economic Interest\n5:52-7:23 Political Results\n7:23-9:36 Controversies\n9:36-10:55 Western Response",
