  "description": "<p>Impact craters are formed due to continuous impacts on the surface of\nplanetary bodies. Most recent deep learning-based crater detection methods\ntreat craters as circular shapes, and less attention is paid to extracting the\nexact shapes of craters. Extracting precise shapes of the craters can be\nhelpful for many advanced analyses, such as crater formation. This paper\nproposes a combination of unsupervised non-deep learning and semi-supervised\ndeep learning approach to accurately extract shapes of the craters and detect\nmissing craters from the existing catalog. In unsupervised non-deep learning,\nwe have proposed an adaptive rim extraction algorithm to extract craters'\nshapes. In this adaptive rim extraction algorithm, we utilized the elevation\nprofiles of DEMs and applied morphological operation on DEM-derived slopes to\nextract craters' shapes. The extracted shapes of the craters are used in\nsemi-supervised deep learning to get the locations, size, and refined shapes.\nFurther, the extracted shapes of the craters are utilized to improve the\nestimate of the craters' diameter, depth, and other morphological factors. The\ncraters' shape, estimated diameter, and depth with other morphological factors\nwill be publicly available.\n</p>",
