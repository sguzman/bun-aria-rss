  "description": "<p>About four years ago, I bought a one-way ticket to Bali with no idea what to expect but knowing I needed a massive change in my life. I wasn't happy with the direction my life was going and knew there was something more to this human experience, but had no idea what that is (listen all about that part of my life in episode 41.) While studying African dance in Ubud, I met a woman named Malaika. I was enamored by her fierce warrior goddess-like energy and her ability to connect the spiritual with the Earth's wisdom. When I found out she had a 5 Elements Shamanic Dance Activation Facilitator Training Certification, I had to sign up. I ended up working for her to pay for some of it because I had no money to my name but I knew I needed to learn from her.</p> <p>Flash forward four years and everything I had set out for myself has come true, from writing books to being a spiritual teacher. All of this comes back to the foundation work I set in those years, connecting to my body's wisdom and the elements. I am so honored to introduce my teacher, Shaman Malaika Darville, to the Highest Self Podcast. Malaika brings a wealth of earth wisdom having walked the shamanic path for a lifetime.</p> <p>Across the globe, she is known for her ability to re-connect individuals with their inner body spirituality, helping all who practice with her to access to higher realms of consciousness and authenticity. Committed to personal and planetary awakening, Malaika works with the cardinal directions and elements EARTH, WATER, FIRE and AIR. Malaika founded the 5Elements Dance Activaton™ after receiving the gift of the 5th Element ETHER or SPACE during her yoga teacher training and Ayurvedic studies.
