  "description": "The $369 billion climate and tax bill from Sen. Joe Manchin III and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer caught everyone by surprise. Democrats had abandoned their climate legislation last month after Manchin, a must-have vote for Democrats, signaled his opposition to it.\nBut late last week Manchin and Schumer announced they had revived the deal under a new name – The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. If passed, it would be the most ambitious climate action in U.S. history.\nAnd now with support from another key swing vote, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, the bill is an important step closer to passage.\nSo what would the bill do?\nIn this episode, Shayle talks to Princeton professor Jesse Jenkins. Jesse leads the REPEAT Project, which analyzed the effects of the bill in a report released today. Overall, the bill would make clean energy cheaper and build up the capacity of climatetech industries in the U.S. and its allies across multiple sectors of the economy, including power, transportation, heavy industry and buildings. \nShayle and Jesse walk through the key provisions in the proposed legislation and their predicted impacts, including:\n\nHundreds of new gigawatts of solar and wind capacity, plus new technology-neutral tax credits to support other technologies such as advanced nuclear\n\nBuilding up a North American supply chain for electric vehicles (EVs)\n\nReducing the costs of EVs, sustainable aviation fuels, energy storage, hydrogen and more\n\nIncreased energy security for medium- and low-income households, such as installing heat pumps and insulation\n\n\nCatalyst is supported by Antenna Group.
