  "description": "The president lies.  He lies all the time.  He can't help but lie.  That's why his lawyers consider any move by Robert Mueller to be a perjury trap for Trump.  Because any question Mueller and his team will ask is certain to produce over-heated prevarication, deception, and deception presented on a bed of utter bullshit.  What does this mean for America?  For our democracy?  For our standing in the world?  Kori Schake, Rosa Brooks, Ed Luce and host David Rothkopf try to answer that question.  Through their tears.
