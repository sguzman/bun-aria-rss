  "description": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who studied economics in college and writes economic policy in Congress, can’t name the most prominent economist of the 20th century. MSNBC’s Katy Tur doesn’t know how senators get elected. And Joe Biden wants to ban guns that don’t exist. The problem isn’t that our alleged elites are ignorant; it’s that they know so much that isn’t so. We examine the root of their confusion. Then, Joe Biden collapses in the polls, Bloomberg surges, and Snoop Doggy Dogg gets the media to expose themselves.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Michael Knowles Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: KNOWLES and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Knowles\nLearn more about your ad choices.
