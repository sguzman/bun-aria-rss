We don&rsquo;t have control over everything that happens to us in life, but we do have control over what it means and how it affects us.</li>\n<li><strong>Why does resilience matter?</strong> The more resilient you are, the greater your chances of overcoming adversity and succeeding. The less resilient you are, the more likely you are to hit a wall, give up, or drop off when things get tough.</li>\n<li><strong>How do we cultivate resilience?</strong> Because it's not a skill like learning a language By making meaning out of adversity, developing and nurturing strong relationships, and seeking out new experiences.</li>\n<li><strong>Resilience is a process.</strong> It&rsquo;s not a skill you acquire once and then never have to work on again. And no matter how resilient you become, you can always become more resilient, you can always build up more grit -- and you should, because you can never have enough!</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://stereo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Download the Stereo app here</a></strong> and participate with us live on Friday, November 20th and 27th, at 2 p.m. PST!</li>\n<li><strong>Connect with Jordan</strong> on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@JordanHarbinger</a> and Instagram at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jordanharbinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@jordanharbinger</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Connect with Gabriel</strong> on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GabeMizrahi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@GabeMizrahi</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sign up for Six-Minute Networking -- our free networking and relationship development mini course -- at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jordanharbinger.com/course\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jordanharbinger.com/course</a>!</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id1344999619?mt=2&ls=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Like this show?
