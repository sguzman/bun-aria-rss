  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the January 6th committee is loaded up with Democrats and RINO’s who led an impeachment against Donald Trump. Why didn’t the Capitol police officers who let the rioters into the Capitol building testify? Nancy Pelosi is cherry-picking which officers testify or which do not. At no time did she hold a single hearing on the insurrection that happened occurred on federal courts in cities across the country. Instead, she called law enforcement officers \"storm-troopers.\" Then, the media makes the case that it's solely Trump supporters that aren't getting vaccinated, but recent immigrants to the US are also very hesitant to the vaccine. Was it because they listened to President Biden and VP Harris bashing the vaccine in 2020? How many illegal border crossers were vaccinated? How many were tested upon entry? Democrats don't care about minorities, they just care about getting more political power. People from all over the world are coming through the southern border, not just Hispanics, and Democrats turn a blind eye to all of them. Later, school equity programs and critical theory are founded in the Marxist notion of egalitarianism. Curiously, the name Marx or the word Marxism isn't found anywhere in its definition. Yet this corrupt ideology is slipping into every facet of American culture and it's up to American citizens to change that. Afterward, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis joins the show to explain that the CDC doesn’t care about people coming over the southern border with COVID but US citizens have endless restrictions.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
