  "description": "<p>Johnny Gosch was 12-years-old when he disappeared while on his paper route on September 5, 1982. There were FIVE witnesses, but the local police (and eventually FBI) declared there was no crime. Over the years, Johnny's parents never gave up hope that they would find him.Â \n This documentary tells the tale of the world's most ferocious mother, Noreen Gosch (who gives GREAT documentary), a horrendously managed investigation, a weirdo who might know where Johnny is, a possible sex ring (and we cannot even with that), and maybe (MAYBE!) a return by Johnny himself. This one's a doozy, you guys!</p>\n",
