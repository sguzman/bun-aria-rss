  "description": "<p>Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett is at the forefront of understanding human emotions: what they are, why humans evolved to have them, how they’re different from feelings, and what science says about how to manage them. She is a University Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University, with appointments at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. She’s written several books, including <a href=\"https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/how-emotions-are-made/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain</em></a> and <a href=\"https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain</em></a>. This episode explores how we can “deconstruct” our own emotions, and the overlap between her research findings and Buddhism.</p><p>Just a note: This episode is a rerun from earlier this year, and the interview was recorded in March 2021. There are some references to COVID that might seem a little out of date, but the content remains relevant.&nbsp;</p><p>Subscribe by December 1 to get 40% off a Ten Percent Happier subscription!
