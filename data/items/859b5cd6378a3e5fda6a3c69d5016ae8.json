  "description": "The guys are still in Houston after the Stay Ready conference and their experiences are the subject of this week’s podcast episode. After meeting gazelle’s on two occasions the guys dive deep into the difference of an owner’s mentality and a worker’s mentality. Essentially when you’re operating like a gazelle in the workplace it’s because of this mentality. After discussing the difference CJ asks the guys what do you do when you’re doing something you’re not passionate about for a living and it’s hard to give 120.\n There are many people who fall into that category and ET gives some practical tangible advice on how to overcome this mentality. The key principle to it all is, “Whatever your hand find to do, do it with ALL your might.”\n Time Stamped Topics:\n  [03:49] - Am I Tripping Or ?\n [06:21] - Stay Ready Houston Recap\n [12:32] - Lion of The Week\n [18:35] - Owner Mentality/Worker Mentality\n [31:00] - Do it with ALL your might\n [50:00] - What does it feel like being ET ?\n [58:39] - Ask ET\n [1:14:20] - Nugget of The Day (You have enough)\n   \n Things to Think About:\n “Your next BIG opportunity relies on what you’re doing now.”\n “Whatever your hand find to do, do with ALL your might.”\n “Act like your normal doing something you don’t want to do and you’ll be doing it the rest of your life.”\n “You can’t compartmentalize greatness.”\n “You can not, not afford to invest in yourself.”\n “You’re already in pain get a reward for it.”\n  \n Thank you so much for listening to this episode of the Secret 2 Success podcast.
