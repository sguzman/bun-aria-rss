  "description": "Stephen Deusner's Where the Devil Don't Stay: Traveling the South with the Drive-By Truckers (U Texas Press, 2021) is the book-length study Drive-By Truckers fans have been waiting for. A group biography in the form of a road trip saga, Deusner's book takes you to the Athens scene that has supported the band, the sweltering hot Birmingham studio where they recorded their breakthrough album Southern Rock Opera, and the Muscle Shoals in which a majority of the band was raised. Deusner's trip takes wide detours into Southern history and culture, as any proper treatment of the Truckers must. It is as much about what the band's music is about (family, tradition, violence, despair, transcendence) as it is about the music itself. This book is as complex, moving, thrilling, and funny as one of DBT's marathon sets. Pass the bourbon.\nAndy Boyd is a playwright based in Brooklyn, New York. He is a graduate of the playwriting MFA at Columbia University, Harvard University, and the Arizona School for the Arts.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
