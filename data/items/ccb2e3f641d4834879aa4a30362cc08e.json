  "description": "<p>In today’s episode, you’ll get to see the third major reason why&nbsp;<strong>Alpha Geek Capital</strong>, Tony’s fast-scaling real estate company, is so successful.<strong>&nbsp;Omid Tehranirad</strong>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<strong>third partner&nbsp;</strong>in the group, acting as the first layer of protection, or as he puts it, the “chastity belt”, of the partnership. Omid is the<strong>&nbsp;head of investor relations and splits operational duties with Sara</strong>, Tony’s wife<strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>He discovered real estate after being&nbsp;<strong>unfulfilled by the typical “American Dream'' job.</strong>&nbsp;His parents encouraged him to pursue the tried and true traditional path that leads to retirement at sixty-five, but after&nbsp;<strong>sixteen years at a corporate job</strong>, he&nbsp;<strong>needed something to change</strong>.

Omid has been able to<strong>&nbsp;leave his corporate nine to five of eighteen years&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;increase his wealth overall—his financial wealth, social wealth, time wealth, and physical wealth.&nbsp;</strong>For the first time in years, he’s able to drop his kids off at school, prioritize his physical health, and travel while still making money.
