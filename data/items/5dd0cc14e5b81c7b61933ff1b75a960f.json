  "description": "\n<img src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.png?id=27151193&width=980\"/><br/><br/><p>Achieving the next level in vehicle autonomy demands robust algorithms trained to interpret radar reflections from automotive radar sensors. Overcome the gaps between software simulation and roadway testing to train the ADAS / AV algorithms with real-world conditions. Sharpen your ADAS' radar vision with full-scene emulation that allows you to lab test complex real-world scenario, while emulating up to 512 objects at distances as close as 1.5 meters.</p><p><a href=\"https://connectlp.keysight.com/ADE_RSE_WP?elqCampaignId=21125&cmpid=ASC-2104561&utm_source=ADSC&utm_medium=ASC&utm_campaign=302\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get this free whitepaper now!</a></p>",
