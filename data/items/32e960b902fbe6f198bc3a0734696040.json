If you’re totally frustrated and feeling like it's too late or too hard to redefine your life and reinvent yourself, whether because of your age or past circumstances, this is for you. So many people dream, want and covet an extraordinary life, but the same people run a self defeating, self sabotaging and suffocating narrative that prevents them from taking action or even believing they can. Is this where you are right now? Can you relate and more importantly are you fed up with the shame, the negativity and self doubt? Tom is breaking down exactly how you can start getting the most out of your life and begin to make extraordinary changes no matter what your age or circumstances. Part of the solution is exploring to find out what you would enjoy doing even if it failed and took you nowhere. The other part of the solution is refining your skills, getting off your ass and valuing yourself for the pursuit of the journey and how you feel about yourself when you are by yourself.<br /> <br />SHOW NOTES:<br /> <br />0:00 | Introduction<br />0:29 | Break Old Patterns<br />8:58 | Building An Escape Plan<br />12:35 | Reinvent Yourself<br />17:05 | Brain in a Vat Experiment<br />21:09 | Pour Energy into the System<br />25:26 | Excited to See Others Win<br /> <br />QUOTES:<br /> <br />“There's a difference between ambition, being a dreamer.
