But some of his more impressive accomplishments have been via the work he spearheads in Atlanta and the surrounding communities, including his partnerships with Habitat for Humanity, and his annual Clark’s Christmas Kids broadcasts which have helped ensure that over 150,000 kids received presents on Christmas morning that otherwise wouldn’t have.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Self Unaware by Newgrass Brewing Co.
