  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, The Philadelphia Eagles disrespect the country by attempting to sabotage the White House's celebratory visit with massive no-shows to insult President Trump. Trump in turn canceled their visit. The Eagles handling of the team’s White House visit a complete setup by their management. The National Anthem is symbolic of loving our country and failing to observe it is an attack on \"We The People\". This is not about social injustice, it’s about people who love this country and have put their life on the line for it. The problem with these players is that they’ve gone Hollywood and are protected by a union so now they sound like elitists. If they want to keep protesting during the National Anthem then they can take their union, their football and shove it where the sun don’t shine! Then, some in media catch up to Professor Calabresi's analysis on our program that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's appointment is unconstitutional, not all special counsels, just Mueller's because of his broad scope and position as a principal officer under Article II of the Constitution. Many have missed this point or ignored it. Special prosecutor is determined by the mandate of the appointment, in Trump's case the mandate mentions no violations of law or individuals, and lacks oversight so its not fact-determinative. Trump is not above the law, it's Mr. Mueller that is above the law.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
