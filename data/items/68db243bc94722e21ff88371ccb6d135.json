  "description": "Welcome to New Books in African American Studies, a podcast channel on the New Books Network. I am your host, Adam Xavier McNeil. Today’s podcast is special, not because this is the 99th episode of my New Books career, but because I get the chance to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Peter H. Wood completing the dissertation version of Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 Through the Stono Rebellion. In this wide-ranging interview, I discuss the origin story of Peter’s work, what happened at Duke University in the 80s and 90s that opened opportunities for the likes of Jennifer L. Morgan, Vincent Brown, and the late great Julius Scott to come through the Durham doors, and where he sees the field of slavery studies going? Enjoy the conversation, family. \nAdam McNeil is a Ph.D. Candidate in History at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
