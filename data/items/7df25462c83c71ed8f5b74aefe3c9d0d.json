  "description": "<p>Meditation: Blessings of Love (2016-02-24) - A blessing is whatever reminds us of the sacred loving presence that shines through all of us. This meditation is a transformational practice in receiving and offering blessings. First we connect with the vulnerable tender place within us that longs to feel loved, and call on loving presence to bless us. By imagining and allowing ourselves to receive love, our hearts become open and filled with light. We then bring that inner loving presence fully alive as we offer blessings to other beings. The image of receiving a kiss on the brow, and offering one, is suggested as a powerful channel for the blessings that awaken our heart. </p>\n<p>\"...being loved into being more who we are is a moment of blessing. What is a blessing? A blessing is a reminder or homecoming into more realness - more love. We're blessed when we remember.\"</p>\n<p>\"Part of what keeps us from realness - in that small self identity - is the avoiding of what's here.\"</p>\n<p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><a style=\"color: #000080; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http://www.tarabrach.com/donate.html\" target=\"_blank\">www.tarabrach.com/donation/</a></span></span>.</p>\n<p>With thanks and love, Tara</p>",
