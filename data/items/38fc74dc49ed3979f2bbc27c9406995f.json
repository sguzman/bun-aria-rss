Through five case studies, it highlights the largely unrecognized ability of inscriptions to shed light on early Christian history, practice, and the leadership structure of early Christian churches, as well as to solve certain New Testament exegetical impasses.\nJonathan Wright is a PhD student in New Testament at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.
