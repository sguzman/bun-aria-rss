  "summary": "<p>Last week, I had the privilege of attending and speaking at the\nPyCon and PyData conferences in Santa Clara, CA.  As usual, there were some\namazing and inspiring talks throughout: I would highly recommend browsing\nthrough the videos as they are put up on\n<a href=\"http://pyvideo.org/category/33/pycon-us-2013\">pyvideo</a>.</p>\n<p>One thing I spent a lot of time thinking, talking, and learning about\nduring these two conferences was the topic of data visualization in Python.\nData visualization seemed to be everywhere: PyData had\n<a href=\"http://sv2013.pydata.org/abstracts/#11\">two</a>\n<a href=\"http://sv2013.pydata.org/abstracts/#15\">tutorials</a>\non matplotlib (the second given by yours truly), as well as a talk about\n<a href=\"http://sv2013.pydata.org/abstracts/#41\">NodeBox OpenGL</a> and a\n<a href=\"http://sv2013.pydata.org/keynotes/#abstract_33\">keynote</a> by\nFernando Perez about IPython, including the notebook and the\nnice interactive data-visualization it allows. Pycon had a tutorial on\n<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/29/\">network visualization</a>,\na talk on <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/58/\">generating art</a>\nin Python, and a talk on\n<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/108/\">visualizing Github</a>. </p>",
