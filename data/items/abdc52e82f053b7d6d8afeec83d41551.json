  "description": "<p>Today's show is packed to the gills. Pat and the guys discuss the Kentucky Derby and it's unprecedented ending, as well as who they had money on, and the Gorms giving out \"winners,\" to the whole office. Pat remembers the few times he's been to the Kentucky Derby and what the atmosphere is like in the infield, and imagines what that weekend is like being a guest of either Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers. The guys also chat about the 1st annual Pat McAfee Foundation golf outing and remember some of their favorite foursomes that helped make the day an incredible success. The guys also cover the NHL playoffs, the NBA playoffs, and chat a little bit about movies after the release of Zac Efron's Ted Bundy movie on Netflix, as well as Adam Sandler making a return to SNL to host, and of course recap the latest episode of Game of Thrones as we are nearing the home stretch for the series. Also joining the show, is a man who recently went viral for hilariously berating the players for his Little League team, Coach Scott Bergin. He chats about his initial idea to make the videos, whether he has received any blowback from any players' parents, or parents from other teams, what he has in store in the future, and he also tells the harrowing story about he and his wife being caught in the middle of the tragic shooting in Las Vegas from a couple years back in an incredible interview (1:25:14-1:46:46). It's a fun one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.&nbsp;</p>\n",
