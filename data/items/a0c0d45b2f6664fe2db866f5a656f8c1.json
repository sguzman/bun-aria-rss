  "description": "<p>This week, we take our special guest, the hilarious comedian, and host of the amazing \"Timesuck\" podcast, Dan Cummins with us, as we head down a long path of unravelling, that negatively impacts the lives of everyone this man came in contact with. Especially the women he attacked, the other women, he held at gunpoint, the men he held at knifepoint, and of course, his large brood of children, and former wives. Not to mention, his country, his family, and even Muhammad Ali. This is a tale of human tragedy, that would be extremely sad, if it wasn't so excessively hilarious!
