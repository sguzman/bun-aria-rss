  "description": "I’m excited to welcome Andrew Bustamante, former CIA agent and founder of Everyday Spy, to the show. We discuss how media outlets feed you what you want to hear… and how to sift through the noise and find the truth.  Turning to macroeconomics, Andrew gives us his perspective on the Russia/Ukraine war—why this event wasn’t spontaneous or a surprise… whether it would have happened under the Trump Administration… who feels the most pain from Russian sanctions (it’s not Russia)... and one country reaping the rewards. Plus, Andrew makes a bold prediction about a Chinese invasion in 2024… and shares how to invest based on current geopolitics.
