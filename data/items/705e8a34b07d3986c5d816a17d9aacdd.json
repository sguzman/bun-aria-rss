His name is Rich Diviney, and he’s a retired Navy SEAL commander and the author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3he7OMV\"><i>The Attributes: 25 Hidden Drivers of Optimal Performance</i></a>. Today on the show, Rich discusses the difference between skills and attributes and how the latter can’t be taught, but can be developed. We then talk about the difference between peak and optimal performance, before turning to the attributes which drive the latter. We get into a discussion of the components of grit, the difference between discipline and self-discipline, why you should become something of a humble narcissist, and much more. We end our conversation with how to figure out the attributes you are and aren’t strong in, and which you need for getting where you want to go.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/6-types-of-grit/\" target=\"_blank\">AoM Article: The 6 Types of Grit (And How to Develop Them)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/wwiis-filthy-thirteen-podcast/\" target=\"_blank\">AoM Podcast: The Hell-Raising Leader of WWII’s Filthy Thirteen</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/humility-narcissism-leadership/\" target=\"_blank\">AoM Podcast #675: The Humble, Narcissistic Leader</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-develop-the-situational-awareness-of-jason-bourne/\" target=\"_blank\">AoM Article: How to Develop Situational Awareness</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-decide-quickly/\" target=\"_blank\">AoM Article: Being Decisive</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-self-control-for-what/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunday Firesides: Self-Discipline for What?</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Rich Diviney</strong></h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://theattributes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Attributes Website</a></li></ul><img src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2021/09/71OllmLcQxL.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" />\n",
