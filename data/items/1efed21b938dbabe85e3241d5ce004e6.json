  "title": "A Conversation With Ada Limón, in Six Poems",
  "description": "<p>​​“One of the biggest things about poetry is that it holds all of humanity,” the poet Ada Limón tells me. “It holds the huge and enormous and tumbling sphere of human emotions.”</p><p>When the news feels sodden with violence and division, it can be hard to know where to put the difficult emotions it provokes. Poetry may seem an unlikely destination for those emotions, especially to those who don’t read it regularly. But Limón’s poems are unique for the deep attention they pay to both the world’s wounds and its redemptive beauty. In otherwise dark times, they have the power to open us up to the wonder and awe that the world still inspires.</p><p>Limón’s books of poetry — like her 2018 collection, “<a href=\"https://milkweed.org/book/the-carrying\" target=\"_blank\">The Carrying</a>,” which won the National Book Critics Circle Award, and her 2015 collection, “<a href=\"https://milkweed.org/book/bright-dead-things\" target=\"_blank\">Bright Dead Things</a>” — are filled with meditations on grief and infertility, as well as striking moments of insight about friendship, lust and our fellowship with animals. Her most recent book, “<a href=\"https://milkweed.org/book/the-hurting-kind\" target=\"_blank\">The Hurting Kind</a>,” explores what it means to share the planet with nonhuman beings like birds and trees. Limón describes the marvels of Kentucky’s rural landscape and the dusky beauty of a New York City bar with equal care. Her writing is highly acclaimed by fellow poets and also delightfully accessible to those who have never before picked up a book of poetry.</p><p>Limón is a lively reader of her own poetry, so to structure this conversation, I asked her to read a varied selection of her work. We use those readings to discuss what poetry gives us that the news doesn’t, the importance of slowing down in a world that demands speed, how the grief of infertility differs from that of losing a loved one, how to be “in community” with ancestors and animals in lonely times, why Limón loves “chatty” and humorous poems as much as serious ones, why we often have our best thoughts in cars and on planes, how Instagram and Twitter affect our relationship to the world, why Limón meditates every day, how our relationship to excitement changes as we age and more.</p><p>Book Recommendations:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/553766/stones-by-kevin-young/\" target=\"_blank\">Stones</a> by Kevin Young</p><p><a href=\"https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/frank-sonnets\" target=\"_blank\">Frank: Sonnets</a> by Diane Seuss</p><p><a href=\"https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/postcolonial-love-poem\" target=\"_blank\">Postcolonial Love Poem</a> by Natalie Diaz</p><p>Thoughts?
