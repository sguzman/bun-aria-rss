  "description": "Two weeks ago we finished the 25-part series on the 10 most important battles in the Civil War. Some of you had follow-up questions. We ran a poll to so which ones were the most popular. In a recording of a live-streaming Q&A session, James and Scott answer the following questions:<br />How many civilians died due to battles getting close to population centers (e.g., the Gettysburg battle site is close to the town)?<br /><br />What was going on with John Wilkes Booth during the Civil War? <br /><br />Were people at the time aware of events like Harriett Tubman's involvement in the raid on Combahee Ferry? Did that effect public perception? <br /><br />For various generals (both sides), was there any correlation between how well they did in West Point and how well they did as leaders in war?<br /><br />Please describe POW camps in more detail.<br /><br />What do you think about the removal of the statues and the renaming of places that have been named after Confederate soldiers?",
