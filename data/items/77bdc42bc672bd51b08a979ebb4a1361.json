  "description": "<p>As the saying goes, the time has come and the time is now! And THIS time? The bitch is back. Three-time Las Culturistas Icon Award Winner Pat Regan joins Matt and Bow in his long-awaited return to podcasting, and the three talk one thing and one thing only: the entertainment industry. Follow along as they discuss being suspicious about various people in both scripted and unscripted spaces, namely in \"The Undoing,\" \"The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City\" and \"The Real Housewives of Potomac.\" There's also a large portion of the episode in which Pat and Bowen stumble upon a sitcom premise and proceed to blue-sky it before Matt chimes in with some questionable pitching. And don't miss the vulnerable convo about late arrivals to certain fandoms. Top off your serotonin with this lovely virtual reunion before you sign up for Pat's MasterClass. And stay tuned for his upcoming projects from which you already know him.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
