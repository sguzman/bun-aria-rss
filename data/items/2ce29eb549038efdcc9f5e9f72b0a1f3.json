  "title": "Uber offers to gobble up GrubHub, Elon Musk is “Re-open America guy”, and a prediction on mergers in digital media",
  "description": "Kara and Scott talk about Uber's offer to buy GrubHub, which would give the company a majority of food delivery market share. They talk about whether this merger would be good for Uber (yes) and whether it would be bad for the commonwealth (also, yes). Meanwhile, Elon Musk is reopening the Tesla factory in California, and his mother is texting Kara about how harsh she's being on her son. In Listener Mail we get a question about companies taking back their upfront ad deals with the major television networks and how that will shake things up in the industry. Scott's prediction is that we are about to see mergers in smaller digital media companies.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
