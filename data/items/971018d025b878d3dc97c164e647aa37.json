  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Have you ever considered how what you eat impacts your mood? We’ve all heard jokes about how hunger can leave you irritable, or <em>hangry</em>. But like most cliches, there’s some truth behind the idea that your diet affects the way you operate and react to the world around you. You might already know how blood sugar dips and spikes impact your mood, but emerging science shows a connection between mental health and the way that we eat that is far more intricate than you might think. <span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">Our guest today, Dr. Uma Naidoo, packs a powerful resume. She is a Harvard-trained psychiatrist, a professional chef, a trained nutritional specialist, and a best-selling author. Dr. Naidoo’s niche is Nutritional Psychiatry—a specialty that combines all her expertise and training. In her book, <em>This Is Your Brain on Food</em>, she elaborates on the complex, intertwined relationship between what we eat and our psychological and cognitive outcomes.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">In this interview, we’re diving into the fascinating science of what happens in your brain when you eat sugar, what to eat for improved sleep and mental health, and how diet-related inflammation is contributing to our poor COVID-19 outcomes. Most importantly, Dr. Naidoo is going to be sharing real-life, actionable steps you can take to improve your health and your future.
