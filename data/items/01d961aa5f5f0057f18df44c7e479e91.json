  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat reacts to ESPN’s like of five most attractive expecting coaching vacancies at the end of the season and he has a few questions about which ones are seen as much better than the others and if he thinks that is accurate or not. Pat and the guys also dive into some World News with Nick as they discuss Clinton Portis and a few other players accused of defrauding the NFL’s league health program with false claims amounting to around $4 million, and OBJ telling everyone that he can that he wants out of Cleveland and for certain teams to come get him. Later, 2x Pro Bowler, 2002 Heisman Trophy finalist, and former Running Back for the Bills, Ravens, and Broncos, Willis McGahee, joins the show. He gives his opinion on players sitting out bowl games in college in hopes of avoiding an injury that will derail their NFL draft stock, as no one is more intimate with that situation that anyone else. Willis also gives his thoughts on Lamar Jackson, why he is so dangerous, and what makes him such a threat. Willis and Pat also chat about his time in Buffalo and the story behind why he had an ugly exit from Buffalo, and who he thinks is going to win the Super Bowl (36:13-46:33). Pat also reacts to Roger Goodell’s comments about no changes coming to the playoff structure in the near future, and what Pat was trying to do to help get retired NFL players benefits, gives his thoughts on Jacoby Brissett and why he has started to slow down a little bit in the back half of this season, and what he thinks Chris Ballard will do for the Colts’ roster in the offseason. Lastly, the guys chat about the hottest issue in the office right now.. there is a snack kleptomaniac in the building, and Pat gets to the bottom of it. Today’s show is a fun one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
