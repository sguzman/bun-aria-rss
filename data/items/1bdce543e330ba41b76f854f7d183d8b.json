While there is a time and a place for drugs, they can have significant side effects and may not be as effective at correcting an underlying imbalance in the body. Functional Medicine practitioners look at gut health, genes, diet, hormones, and so much more to create a thorough healing plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Dr. Uma Naidoo, Dr. George Papanicolaou, and Dr. Drew Ramsey about how diet and lifestyle can be both a cause of and treatment for depression and other mental health issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Uma Naidoo is a Harvard-trained psychiatrist, professional chef, and nutrition specialist.
