Criminals high up in the organization hierarchy do not occupy the most central positions in the criminal network, and oftentimes do not appear in the reconstructed criminal network at all. However, we also suggest possible strategies of intervention. We show that, although criminal networks (i.e., the network encoding mobsters and crime relationships) are extremely resilient to different kinds of attacks, contact networks (i.e., the network reporting suspects and reciprocated phone calls) are much more vulnerable, and their analysis can yield extremely valuable insights.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/inf_sci_2016_f2.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2083\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2083\" src=\"http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/inf_sci_2016_f2-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"inf_sci_2016_f2\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" srcset=\"http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/inf_sci_2016_f2-300x166.jpg 300w, http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/inf_sci_2016_f2.jpg 658w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Cite as:</h3>\n<p>Santa Agreste, Salvatore Catanese, Pasquale De Meo, Emilio Ferrara, Giacomo Fiumara, Network structure and resilience of Mafia syndicates, Information Sciences, Volume 351, Pages 30-47, 2016.</p>\n"
