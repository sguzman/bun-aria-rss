    "media:description": "\"None of the Fed's rate hikes have affected the consumer yet,\" and it's because of the excessive printing of U.S. dollars, exclaims Kevin O'Leary, widely known as \"Mr. Wonderful.\" If we see a slowdown in earnings, \"it'll probably be in Q1 or Q2 next year,\" he tells our Daniela Cambone. O'Leary breaks down for investors why, \"there is no question that it does matter what happens in the midterm elections.\" European banks are zombie banks, \"and never went through the cleansing the U.S banks went through,\" he continues.
