  "description": "<p>Peter Block said, \"Why do anything if it is not going to be great?\" Each and every day, many of us wake up, going through the motions, and have unknowingly selected a life of mediocrity.</p> <p>Getting to (and through) the things we want in our life is a product of knowing how to manage ourselves. It's not about managing time. Time is just going to happen... You can't do anything about time. You can't \"manage\" it. But, what you can do is manage yourself, and by doing so you'll get more done than you ever thought possible.</p> <p>That's what this episode is all about.</p> <p>If you want a great life, you're going to need to accomplish more than you are right now. It's the nature of the world we live in. Getting things done, being productive, it's the language of success in the environment we are a part of.</p> <p>Though we are living in new times, it's actually the past where you'll find the greatest tools to utilize your mind, body, and energy to achieve more than you ever have.</p> <p>Your paleolithic ancestors had a few things mastered that we have appeared to lose sight of. Your brain, even though it can operate a smart phone at the speed of light, is not much different (if at all) than your paleo relatives. Some of the most powerful things you're about to learn are how to leverage the way your brain is actually wired up, how to put successful activities on automatic, and how to eliminate the distractions that trip so many of us up.</p> <p>After listening, remember that you can get access to the video and slides from this episode, plus my productivity checklist <a href= \"https://theshawnstevensonmodel.leadpages.net/leadbox/1424973b3f72a2%3A14e0bc9d6b46dc/5703593692758016/\">right here</a>.
