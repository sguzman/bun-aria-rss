  "description": "<p>Have you ever heard the saying, \"First impressions last a lifetime\"? Whether it's true or not, we make snap judgements about people upon meeting them for the first time. It's built into us as an evolutionary advantage to be critical, recognize patterns, and to observe the health and safety of those around us.</p> <p>Whether consciously or unconsciously, we are judging and being judged with each and every person that we meet. And the very first thing that people see when in close contact with us is the health (or lack thereof) of our skin.</p> <p>Our skin is a symbol of vitality. It is the outermost representation of what's going on with our overall health. On the surface level we want clear, radiant skin to be more attractive to the world around us. On a deeper level our skin can be an indicator of potential (or even chronic) health problems. Our skin isn't just something superficial to look at, it's one of of best resources for monitoring our internal health and well-being.</p> <p>Today you're going to learn about your skin in an intimate and fun way. You're going to learn things about your skin that you've never heard before, and you're going to appreciate and care for your skin in a whole new way because of it.
