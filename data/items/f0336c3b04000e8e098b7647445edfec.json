All that changed on June 10 1991, when 11-year-old Jaycee Lee Dugard was abducted in broad daylight while walking to her school bus stop.</strong></div>\n<div>\n<br>\nAlmost two decades later, convicted sex offender Phillip Garrido visited the University of Californiaâ€™s Berkeley campus, where a staff member noticed something suspicious about the way he was behaving. What was Garrido trying to hide, and who were the two children he had with him?</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Research for this episode by Victoria Dieffenbacher.
