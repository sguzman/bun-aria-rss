Quite frankly, it scares the crap out of me. It's hard to go from \"execution-mode\" to then becoming a manager of a team. These are two very different things that can cause some issues if not handled properly. </span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17px;\">When you're a leader, you have to be the bigger man/woman in any given situation. You can't simply impose your will because you're now the \"boss.\" A leader listens. They swallow their pride and work to make sure the team is executing as needed. A leader needs to empower those around them to do their jobs but they also need to be able to take the hit, and eat crap, because things won't always be easy, and at the end of the day, they're the ones leading the charge.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17px;\">I firmly believe that the transition from doer to leader is the same as the transition from leveraging your EQ rather than your IQ. Leaders need to listen and empower their team to become leaders themselves and take ownership of the work they're given. Leaders need to understand who they are as a person and relay that emotional understanding to those around them. As I've said many times before, it all boils down to self-esteem and self-awareness. If you can understand who you truly are as a person, and as a leader, then you'll be able to instill the same understanding in the team around you. </span></p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/578201.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
