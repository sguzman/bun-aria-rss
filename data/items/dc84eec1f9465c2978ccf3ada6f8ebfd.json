    "media:description": "Had a sitting US congresswoman on my stream to discuss Donkey Kong strategy recently. Here's the clip!\n\nI want to thank everyone who worked behind the scenes to make this stream happen, Pio, Dogstrong, Shaun, Foldable Human, Shannon Strucci, Rhods, Casey, everyone I didn't even know about, and in particular Chelsea Manning for everything that led up to this - this wouldn't have happened without all of your work and I love you for it\n\nIf you would like to support someone who needs it, please check out the transcrowdfund hashtag. Even a small amount of money can help a real person get out of a bad situation and vastly improve their life.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/hashtag/TransCrowdFund?src=hash",
