Also Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to another Florida Man who pulled a gun on two delivery men, because his furniture was late and tells them 'he's shot for less'. Also, we had black entrepreneur and designer Devlin Carter stop by, where he spoke about his shoe designs, companies stealing his designs and more. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
