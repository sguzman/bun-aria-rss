  "description": "<p>I’m joined by Eli Clifton, Senior Advisor at the Quincy Institute and Investigative Journalist at Large at its <em>Responsible Statecraft</em> outlet. He and Ben Freeman, Director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative at the Center for International Policy, have produced a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://quincyinst.org/report/restoring-trust-in-the-think-tank-sector/\">new report</a>, <em>Restoring Trust in the Think Tank Sector</em>, that makes three major recommendations for Washington think tanks to improve transparency in their operations. We’ll discuss the DC think tank community, the nature of the justifiably criticized “Revolving Door” between government and the private sector (you can read Eli’s most recent foray into that issue at <em>Responsible Statecraft</em>), and the recommendations Eli and Ben are making.</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
