  "description": "<p>When recognizing emotions from speech, we encounter two common problems: how\nto optimally capture emotion-relevant information from the speech signal and\nhow to best quantify or categorize the noisy subjective emotion labels.\nSelf-supervised pre-trained representations can robustly capture information\nfrom speech enabling state-of-the-art results in many downstream tasks\nincluding emotion recognition. However, better ways of aggregating the\ninformation across time need to be considered as the relevant emotion\ninformation is likely to appear piecewise and not uniformly across the signal.\nFor the labels, we need to take into account that there is a substantial degree\nof noise that comes from the subjective human annotations. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach to attentive pooling based on correlations between the\nrepresentations' coefficients combined with label smoothing, a method aiming to\nreduce the confidence of the classifier on the training labels. We evaluate our\nproposed approach on the benchmark dataset IEMOCAP, and demonstrate high\nperformance surpassing that in the literature. The code to reproduce the\nresults is available at github.com/skakouros/s3prl_attentive_correlation.\n</p>",
