We’ve been led to believe that getting enough calcium is the key to healthy bones. In truth, your bone health is determined by your diet, gut health and nutrient absorption, physical activity levels, muscle mass, and more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I talk with Dr. Todd LePine, Dr. David Ludwig, and Dhru Purohit about the myths surrounding bone health and why it’s important to take steps to strengthen your bones at every age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Todd LePine graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and is board certified in Internal Medicine, specializing in Integrative Functional Medicine. He is an Institute for Functional Medicine certified practitioner. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years. Dr. LePine’s focus at The UltraWellness Center is to help his patients achieve optimal health and vitality by restoring the natural balance to both the mind and the body. His areas of interest include optimal aging, bio-detoxification, functional gastrointestinal health, systemic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and the neurobiology of mood and cognitive disorders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>David S. Ludwig, MD, PhD, is an endocrinologist and researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital. He holds the rank of Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and Professor of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Ludwig is codirector of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center and founder of the Optimal Weight for Life program, one of the country’s oldest and largest clinics for the care of overweight children. For more than 25 years, Dr. Ludwig has studied the effects of dietary composition on metabolism, body weight, and risk for chronic disease. Described as an “obesity warrior” by <em>Time Magazine</em>, Dr. Ludwig has fought for fundamental policy changes to improve the food environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dhru Purohit is a podcast host, serial entrepreneur, and investor in the health and wellness industry. His podcast, <em>The Dhru Purohit Podcast</em>, is a top 50 global health podcast with over 30 million unique downloads.
