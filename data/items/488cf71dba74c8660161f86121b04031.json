When we feel like we’ve made it, we tend to get comfortable, complacent, and we take our foot off the gas. A quick remedy for this is to get yourself around people that are all in on their dreams. Find a mentor, and never stop learning and leveling up.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven’t signed up for the Underdog Empowerment newsletter yet, head over to...</span> <a href=\"http://www.underdogempowerment.com/subscribe\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">UnderdogEmpowerment.com/Subscribe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
