  "description": "I believe a lot of us first noticed Sheri Cifaldi-Morrill’s work with her ‘Buzzz’ quilt that won the 2015 Quilt Alliance animal quilt contest. I want to learn how Sheri has taken her graphics design background, love of math, and symmetry to her unique quilts. With this combo Sheri’s quilts pull a lot of design punch. We’ll hear today how she works through creating a new design\nhttp://wholecirclestudio.com/\n====================\nAs quiltmakers we usually do a few other things beside quilt. Maybe crochet, garden, bake… or read. Yep… quilters LOVE a story and put a quilter IN that story and we can really relate! We are so lucky that many novelist are also quilters and choose to make the star of the novel a quilt maker. I’m excited to have author Frances Dowell with me today to tell me about her book Birds in the Air. I want to learn how she spins our quilting into the book!\nhttp://quiltfiction.com/  \n==================\nVicki Ruebel is an extraordinary award longarm quilter. I was drawn to her work because she has a way of adding another whole layer to the quilt top that brings out the very best. She is going to share with me some tips for thinking about the quilting design and how to prepare to hire a longarm quilter to work on your quilt.\nwww.OrchidOwlQuilts.com\n================\nI've been a huge fan of Joanna Figueroa of Fig Tree for years. She is a regular contributor to American Patchwork & quilt magazine, and have been on the show several times. Joanna told me the other day she is redoing her studio.. which is a personal obsession of mine! So we are talking studio redos, her new Coney Island fabric line for Moda, and if we have time... a little about her block of the month quilts inspired by antique quilts. \nhttp://www.figtreequilts.typepad.com/\n================\nvisit American Patchwork & Quilting at http://allpeoplequilt.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/apqmagazine\nVisit host Pat Sloan at http://www.patsloan.com\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
