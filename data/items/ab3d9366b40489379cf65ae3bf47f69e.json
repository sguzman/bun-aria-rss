  "description": "<p>In part 1 we discussed the brutal murder of Connie Dadkhah on June 14 2022. In the second part of our conversation, Laura shares with us another horrific case, the murder of professional photographer Sania Khan on July 18 2022. Sania had posted on TikTok about her struggles of a painful&nbsp;divorce and its stigma in her South Asian community.</p><p>Sania's vengeful ex-husband stalked her and flew from Georgia to Chicago and shot her dead.</p><p><br></p><p>And we discuss the murder of Tirany Savage, her son Dayton and her mother Kim by he ex Bo Eugene Savage on July 10 2022. During the time that Tirany&nbsp;was trying to leave her husband Bo, she saw his behavior escalate and she was fearful. Tirany called 911 on at least two occasions, had him removed from the home and begged a judge for a protection order to protect herself and her teenaged son and filed for divorce. Her husband had been threatening suicide, procured a gun and threatened to kill her. So why did Judge Troy Daniel deny the order? What happened next to Tirany, Dayton and Kim will shock you but it didn't surprise Laura who has been tracking lethal male violence for many years and set up the first Homicide Prevention Unit at New Scotland Yard.</p><p><br></p><p>This is an important discussion. It may be triggering and it will be angry-making.
