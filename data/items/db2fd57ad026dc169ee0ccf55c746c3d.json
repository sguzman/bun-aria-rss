  "description": "The Nerdwriter aka Evan Puschak takes deep thinking to a whole new level. In this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Evan talks about the importance of critical thinking and why a clear worldview is vital for having a full life. In his smash hit YouTube show The Nerdwriter, Evan crawls inside important ideas like an intellectual archaeologist and roots around, grubby fists and all, until he finds the narrative thread that makes those ideas accessible. In an era where people will tell you the only thing that matters is entertaining people, he's built a wildly successful YouTube channel with roughly one million subscribers. That proves there's still a huge market for depth. His powerful essays on an absurdly wide range of topics from Batman and Rihanna to politics and moral issues provide viewers with the kinds of insights that can truly shape one's worldview. Recognizing his unique gifts, MSNBC snatched him up to produce for them when he was still in his early 20s and the Discovery Channel tapped him to write and host a show on their digital network, Seeker Daily, where he produced a hoard of breakout content. Evan is proving that creators from anywhere, armed with a simple camera and a willingness to work hard, can not only make a living as content producers, but can alter the very direction and flow of cultural discourse. Evan’s entirely self-made treasure trove of content has been viewed more than 48 million times by people all over the world.",
