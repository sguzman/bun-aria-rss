Unbeknownst to them, this is a fatal mistake that exposes them to dangers such as nuclear warheads and supersonic interceptor aircraft including Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-31 Foxhound supersonic interceptor aircraft carrying Kh-47 air-launched ballistic missiles. Declining the Queen’s Gambit offers black a broad array of counterattacks, and the Albin Countergambit and this modern variation of the Lasker Trap is an effective continuation to easily gain a developmental and material advantage in chess. The Albin Countergambit is a sharp opening that can be played in response to the Queens Gambit, and its relative obscurity coerces the opponent to walk right into your sophisticated trap, allowing you to easily counter-attack using common chess tactics such as nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/BosnianApeSociety",
