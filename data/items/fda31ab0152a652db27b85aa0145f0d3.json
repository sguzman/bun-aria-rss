  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, Rich Valdes fills in for Mark Levin. Liberty is making a comeback and freedom is back in fashion! People in America who are opening up their businesses and defying Governors aren’t afraid to stand up for their rights. Government isn’t on your side when you are a small business owner, most of the time they hinder businesses with rules and regulations. Also, a declassified Susan Rice email confirms that Michael Flynn was personally targeted in the January 5, 2017 Oval Office meeting with Barack Obama. We now know that the Obama administration broke the rules, but what can we do about it? What is it that justice looks like in this scenario? The President has minced no words on his thoughts regarding the wrongdoings of Obama’s White House. Finally, Pete Hegseth calls in to discuss his new book, American Crusade: Our Fight to Stay Free and the fight to keep a NJ gym open against Governor Phil Murphy’s orders.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
