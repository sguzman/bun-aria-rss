  "description": "<p>Just recently, Catholics were devastated to learn of another case of sexual abuse, this time involving Jean Vanier, the esteemed founder of L’Arche and a man once considered to be a living saint. Vanier, who passed away last year, was accused of sexually assaulting six women in France, using his religious position to abuse and manipulate them. How do we make sense of all this? How can a man who produced enormous good fruit fail so abysmally? And how should Catholics respond to this sort of abuse, and prevent it from happening again? Bishop Barron offers advice on all these questions and more.</p> <p>A listener asks how energetic young people, passionate about apologetics and evangelization, can take their study to the next level.</p> <h2><strong>Links</strong></h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://wordonfire.institute/\">Word on Fire Institute</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://wordonfireshow.com/centered\"><em>Centered: The Spirituality of Word on Fire</em></a></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em> Do you like this podcast? <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bishopbarron\">Become a patron</a> and get some great perks for helping, like free books, bonus content, and more.
