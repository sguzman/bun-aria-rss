  "description": "Democrats are going all out for impeachment in a game that makes the Clinton impeachment seem RATIONAL! The American people have become goldfish! We’ve forgotten that just LAST WEEK the media was discredited for their Brett Kavanaugh hit job. Glenn and comedian Nick Di Paolo go over the newly released “transcript” of the Ukrainian call. Shockingly, the Ukrainian president actually ASKED FOR Trump’s help with the Biden scandal! Glenn watched cable news for the first time in a year and could hardly believe how far it has fallen. Viewers call in to discuss how the media and Congress have become a clown show that condemn Trump no matter what he does.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
