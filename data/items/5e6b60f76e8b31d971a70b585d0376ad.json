  "description": "Contributor(s): April Rinne | Rinne shows that when everything is in flux, everything benefits from a flux mindset: the ability to consistently see all change as an opportunity, not a threat. She harnesses her very personal experiences with flux, including the death of both of her parents in a car accident when she was 20, as well as her history as a futurist, advisor, global development executive, microfinance lawyer, investor, mental health advocate, certified yoga teacher, globetrotter (100+ countries) and insatiable hand stander, to bring global perspective and cross-cultural understanding to how we see, think about, struggle with and ultimately forge positive relationships with change.",
