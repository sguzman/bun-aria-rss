Why does Posty tend to sound like a certain ruminant mammal? And, what happens when you plug Tchaikovsky into a Wu Tang name generator?\nSongs Discussed:\n\nPost Malone - Circles, Rockstar, Stay, Congratulations, Candy Paint,\n\nFleetwood Mac - Landslide\n\nTchaikovsky - Symphony No 6, Finale\n\n\nAnd don't forget to enter the Wu Tang Name Generator\nLearn more about your ad choices.
