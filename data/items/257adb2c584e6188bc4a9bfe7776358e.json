  "description": "Robin Abrams. October 4th, 1990. Will County, Illinois. A 28 year-old woman passes her father as she drives her '89 Dodge Daytona down Goodenow Road. They wave at each other. This is the last time he will ever see his daughter. Her disappearance is suspected to be tied to her boyfriend. They had worked together at the Will County Sheriff's Office and dated for less than six months before she learned that he was married and then she wanted to break things off. They would both claim harassment by the other which would culminate in her filing lawsuits, being fired and his having her arrested many times. While her family wanted the boyfriend, Tony Marquez, investigated, they were met with resistance. Both by law enforcement and by the court. A witness who saw two men using a tow truck to drop off the woman's car seemed to hold the key to her disappearance, but without charges being brought against the boyfriend and his stepbrother, the case could not move forward. Some said that perhaps she disappeared to get away from the situation and to spite her ex-boyfriend. But friends and family contend that Robin Abrams was murdered and that the Will County Sheriff's Office was looking out for their own.
