  "description": "<p>LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he and his guest go deep into the subject of mortality via cinema, and this week you can expect a truly epic one - this one’s as sad, exciting and nail-biting as Titanic - the guest is the wonderful comedian JAYDE ADAMS!</p><br><p>As funny as it is very moving, this episode has everything you would want in an episode, from the hilarious to the genuinely tear-jerking. Brett and Jayde go in deep on here and don’t take any mercy, as they go through this whole mortality and cinema roller coaster with expert precision and confidence, and come out the other end with a tale to tell and a knowing look that tells it all. From Jayde’s awkwardness as a kid and finding solace in film, to having film in common with her brother who has an entirely different profession, the 11 o’ clock number and exactly what that is, a very moving moment regarding her sister which is heavy but in a very therapeutic way, being a fan of love, controversy over Labyrinth (did I mention it was a roller coaster?), her love of dance and OH so much more besides. You know what it is. Films To Be Buried With goddammit.
