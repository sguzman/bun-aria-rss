  "description": "<p>We’re living in a more divisive time than ever before. I’m not just talking about politics—we’re at aggressive odds over everything from diet (vegan versus Paleo) to sports and we’re even seeing an escalation in road rage. There’s actually a reason this is happening. We’re disconnected. Social media is actually isolating us; we ignore the importance of sleep and nature; stress is at epidemic proportions. These lifestyle disconnects cause structural and functional disconnects in the brain that lead to more divisive and angry behavior. Our ability to make good decisions pretty much goes out the window. But it’s not too late to reverse these negative effects. I was so excited to sit down with my good friends Drs. David and Austin Perlmutter on The Doctor’s Farmacy to talk about these modern challenges and how we can detox the brain to restore better decision making and overall health.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. David Perlmutter is a Board-Certified Neurologist. His books have been published in 34 languages and include the #1 New York Times bestseller Grain Brain, The Surprising Truth About Wheat, Carbs and Sugar, with over 1 million copies in print. Dr. Perlmutter’s new book Brain Wash, co-written with his son Austin Perlmutter, MD, was just released on January 14, 2020. Dr. Austin Perlmutter is a board-certified internal medicine physician. His academic focus is on understanding the decision-making process, how it is influenced by internal and external factors, and how it changes our health and illness outcomes.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by ButcherBox and Brodo.</p><br><p>I’m always being asked how to source high-quality meat and seafood, so I want to share one of my favorite resources with you that I use to get quality protein in my own diet, ButcherBox.&nbsp;ButcherBox is currently offering listeners 2lbs of wild-caught Alaskan sockeye salmon PLUS $20 off your first box.
