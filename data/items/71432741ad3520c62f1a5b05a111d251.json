  "title": "How Nick Martell & Jack Kramer built Snacks Daily and then, The Best One Yet",
  "description": "Nick Martell and Jack Kramer met in college in Middlebury, Vermont -- they became fast friends and eventually business partners -- launching a business newsletter called Market Snacks that eventually went on to become a daily podcast acquired by stock trading app Robinhood. Both Colin and I have been huge fans of the show for years. We're very inspired not only by how these two tell stories via audio but how good they are at building a true community and including their audience in the show. They make complex stories from the business world accessible and relatable, which is something Colin and I try and do as well. Recently Nick and Jack left Robinhood but kept their podcast under a new name \"The Best One Yet\". You'll find out why that's the name later on in the episode. After Nick and Jack went independent they reached out to Colin and I to help them build a video version of their show on YouTube. This is part one of a two-part series with Nick and Jack...in this first episode you'll hear how they'll built their wildly successful newsletter and podcast, and in part two you'll get to hear us troubleshoot the problems their facing in a special edition of Creator Support. That episode will come out on Thursday. Alright, hope you enjoy this episode of The Colin and Samir show with Nick and Jack.",
