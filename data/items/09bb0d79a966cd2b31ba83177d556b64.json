  "description": "<p>This week, we head down the lunatic trail, and end up in a crazy place, with a man who could never get enough of two things... fighting, and prison. He destroyed his career with drugs & alcohol, but destroyed his life by doing everything a person could do to get back to jail. Drug trafficking, violent intimidation, and bank robbery, to name a few of his tactics. He is truly a mountain of wasted potential, and personal disaster. What a fun ride! Load up your trunk with drugs, punch an older guy in the face, and beg for more prison time with Patrick Cote!! Check us out, every Tuesday.
