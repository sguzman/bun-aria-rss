  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Codependency is a big topic, but I want to clue you in on something about the topic that people tend not to talk about. That’s what this episode centers around, and once you gain this understanding, there’s no going back! </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a lot to unpack when it comes to codependency, and it completely takes away your ability to make decisions for yourself. The reason I’m ready to uncover this topic and break down the codependency barriers is because I’ve been there! So please know that I feel your pain if you’re currently working through your own struggles with codependency. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s exactly what I discuss in this episode:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What is Codependency?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Is It a Self-Love Issue?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Your Intuition is Always Guiding You</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope that this episode allows you to think about codependency in a new light.
