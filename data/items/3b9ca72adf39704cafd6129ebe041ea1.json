  "description": "<p>You feel rich! The stock market is up and you might be wondering if now is the time to sell. Even if you don’t keep up with any financial news, you’ve likely heard how we’re in the longest running, bull market in US history. Your investment portfolio is looking pretty fat because you’ve purchased low and now it’s time to sell high- that’s how the old adage goes right? Or at the very least maybe you shouldn’t continue to invest because we’re at the peak, the top of the market, right? But then there is this thing called dollar cost averaging that you know deep down, is probably what you should be doing. Listen as we break it all down and discuss whether or not you should time the stock market.</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we enjoyed an Über Quench'l by Heist Brewery which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
