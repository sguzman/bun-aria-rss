The way Cameron grew up using humor as self-defense and to become socially “valuable”–and the moment she wondered if comedy was no longer working for her. \n3. Why Cameron says she’s able to cry for the first time in 35 years. \n4. How as a gender-nonconforming queer kid, Cameron felt “overnoticed”–and how being a comedian allows her to “hide in plain sight.\"\n5. The rule Cameron and Glennon made to help them become better at friendship.\n\nCW: eating disorders\n\nAbout Cameron:\nCameron Esposito is a queer, gender non-conforming standup comic, actor, writer and host.\nAs a standup, Cameron has headlined tours and festivals nationwide and internationally.
