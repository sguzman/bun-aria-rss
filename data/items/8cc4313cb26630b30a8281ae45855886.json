  "description": "<p>In the words of today’s guest, treat the natural world as if your life depends on it—because it truly does.</p><p>Meet absolute living legend <strong>Sylvia Earle, Ph.D</strong>.</p><p>A marine botanist, oceanographer, writer, lecturer, and one of the world’s top experts on ocean science and conservation, Sylvia is affectionately called&nbsp;“<em>Her Deepness</em>” by The New Yorker and the New York Times, and the “<em>First Hero for the Planet</em>” by Time magazine.</p><p>Over the course of her 85 years, Sylvia has logged over 7,000 hours underwater, and not to mention, set a record in 1979 that still stands for the deepest untethered dive by a woman—1,250 feet. She was one of the very first National Geographic explorers-in-residence, served as the first female Chief Scientist at NOAA (The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), has authored more than 20 books, is a pioneer of submersible engineering, and established Mission Blue, an organization dedicated to protecting marine areas identified as critical to the health of the ocean, or as she calls them, “Hope Spots.”</p><p>You may very well have seen her appearance in Seaspiracy or have caught word of her fascinating new book entitled&nbsp;Ocean: A Global Odyssey, the subject of today’s exchange.</p><p>This conversation focuses on the majesty of our oceans, the tragedy of their decline at the hands of humankind, and the urgency that we must marshal for their preservation. But it’s also a conversation about hope. The power we all possess to create the change we need and desire.</p><p>While I love all my guests, I have to admit I’ve never met anyone quite like Sylvia. What can be said other than to recognize the honor, the gift of spending an afternoon with her, soaking in her wisdom and experience.</p><p>I have such tremendous respect and admiration for her work. Her example sets the tone for us all. And my hope is that this one inspires you into your own form of action and activism—because it really does all come down to us.</p><p>To read more,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/sylvia-earle-660/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.
