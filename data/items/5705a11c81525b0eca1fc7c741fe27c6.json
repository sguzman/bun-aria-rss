  "title": "Episode 311: Matthew Hoffman AKA The Leaf Killer",
  "description": "Matthew John Hoffman was a strange guy. He was in a constant flux of being a quiet, yet unassuming guy to then having bouts of strange and off-putting behavior. It was his love of trees that gave him comfort and seemed to keep him settled at times, but on November 9, 2010 he broke into a quiet home in Apple Valley, Ohio, brutally taking the lives of Tina Hermann, her 11 year old son Kody and her best friend Stephanie Sprang, before leaving with 13 year old Sarah Maynard in his clutches. <br>\n<br>\nSoon, Hoffman's obsession with trees would become the defining piece of this killer's pathology. In Part 1, we discuss his puzzling history, the lives of Tina, Kody and Stephanie, and the house of horrors he brought Sarah back to. <br>\n<br>\n\nCheck out this amazing book about the case!<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A31UCE0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1\" target=\"_blank\">The Girl in the Leaves by Robert Scott</a> <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/thebutcherandthewren\" target=\"_blank\">***US WEIRDOS Pre-Order The Butcher and the Wren: Here *****</a> <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-butcher-and-the-wren/alaina-urquhart/2928377090913\" target=\"_blank\">***UK WEIRDOS Pre-Order a SIGNED copy of The Butcher and the Wren from Waterstones!!***</a><br>\n<br>\n\nHelloFresh: Get sixteen free meals, plus three gifts, with code morbid16 at <a href=\"http://HELLOFRESH.com/morbid16\" target=\"_blank\">HELLOFRESH.com/morbid16</a><br>\n<br>\nWarby Parker: Try 5 pairs of glasses at home for free at <a href=\"http://warbyparker.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">warbyparker.com/morbid</a><br>\n<br>\nProse: Take your FREE in-depth hair consultation and get 15% off your first<br>\norder today by going to <a href=\"http://Prose.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">Prose.com/morbid</a><br>\n<br>\nSolo Stove: Just go to <a href=\"http://solostove.com\" target=\"_blank\">solostove.com</a> and remember, you get $20 off when you use promo code MORBID!<br>\n<br>\nCareOf: For 50% off your first Care/of order of $40 or more, go to TakeCareOf .comand enter code morbid50<br>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
