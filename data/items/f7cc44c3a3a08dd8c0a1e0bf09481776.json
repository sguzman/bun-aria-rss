Because I’ve made virtually every mistake possible in building my own businesses, you can learn without the pain and time it costs me. One of the biggest things standing in the way of your success is knowing what questions to ask yourself to make progress and move forward. You know where you are at this moment and you see where you want to go. <br /><br />In this Q&A I’m taking you through all the steps and more importantly, the questions you need to be asking yourself to start gaining momentum and start seeing results of a rapidly growing business. I’ve built the foundation of my business model on community and bringing that community value. As you begin your journey as an entrepreneur, two things are important: 1) that you start thinking from first principles and 2) that you know the problem you are solving and the value you are bringing to people.<br /> <br />3 Starter Points:<br />1.
