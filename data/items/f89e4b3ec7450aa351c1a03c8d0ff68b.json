  "description": "Art After Liberalism (Columbia UP, 2022) is an account of creative practice at a moment of converging political and social rifts – a moment that could be described as a crisis of liberalism. The apparent failures of liberal thinking are a starting point for an inquiry into emergent ways of living, acting, and making art in the company of others.\nWhat happens when the framework of the nation-state, the figure of the enterprising individual, and the premise of limitless development can no longer be counted on to produce a world worth living in? It is increasingly clear that these commonplace liberal conceptions have failed to improve life in any lasting way. In fact, they conceal fundamental connections to enslavement, colonization, moral debt, and ecological devastation.\nNicholas Gamso speaks to Pierre d’Alancaisez about the ills of liberalism and art’s role in deciding on what may come after the impasse.\nNicholas Gamso is a writer and academic who works across theory, visual culture, performance, and space/place. He’s an editor at Places.\n\nKara Walker, A Subtlety, 2014\n\nManaf Halbouni, Monument, 2017\n\nWarren Kanders controversy at the Whitney\n\n\nTriple Chaser by Forensic Architecture\n\nMy conversations with and on Forensic Architecture\n\n\nWolfgang Tillmans and his anti-Brexit campaign\n\n\nRen Hang\n\n\nPierre d’Alancaisez is a contemporary art curator, cultural strategist, researcher.
