  "description": "The Legendary podcaster and composer (but not US Senator) Lindsay Graham is a dear friend of HTDS and an integral part of the podcast's sound. Today, he gets behind the mic with the Prof. to interrogate the oft-repeated adage \"those who don't study history are doomed to repeat it.\"\nSo ... is it true? Centering the conversation around our current HTDS period (Gilded Age and into the Progressive Era) while pulling from various philosophers and thinkers (Hegel, Twain, Churchill, Santayana, and more), Lindsay and Greg dig in.\nBy the way, we're big fans of Lindsay's many podcasts, and Greg has contributed to a few of them as a guest or historical consultant!
