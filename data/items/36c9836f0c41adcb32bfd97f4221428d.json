  "description": "On today's show, Pat is joined by the GM of the Indianapolis Colts, Chris Ballard, for an incredible conversation. They discuss his thoughts on the Colts' season thus far, whether or not he will be going after certain free agents and when that process starts, his thoughts on Josh McDaniels leaving the Colts hanging at the last second and why he couldn't be happier with Frank Reich, and his thoughts on Quenton Nelson's viral pancake block. (10:57-30:08). Digs also joins the show to give a couple of thoughts about the NFL as we get ready for week 11, he gives out his Thursday night pick, and laughs at the Bengals for bringing in Hue Jackson. Todd pops in to do a deep dive into El Chapo's upcoming trial in New York and gives some background on how law enforcement agencies approach that entire situation. Lastly, Zito and Connor stop in to give an update on The Pub to discuss their recent renovations, and talk about Pat's trip to LA. It's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers. \n",
