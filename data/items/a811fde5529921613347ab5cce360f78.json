  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys break down Mookie Betts and David Price being traded from the Boston Red Sox to the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Pat officially declares his allegiance as a Dodgers fan, chat about Zion Williamson vs. Giannis Antetokoumpo and why having a somewhat off night might be good for him in the long run. Pat and the guys also discuss the report that the Cowboys plan on placing the franchise tag on Dak Prescott, and decide whether or not holding out would be a good option for him, and if he deserves a massive contract. Also included is an incredible interview with 2014 Defensive Rookie of the Year, 2x NFL Defensive Player of the Year, 6x Pro Bowler, and 5x All-Pro, current Defensive Tackle for the Los Angeles Rams, Aaron Donald from Radio Row in Miami. They chat about whether or not his knife training in the offseason was with real knives, what it's like getting double and triple teamed on almost every single play, what he did to become such a massive human being, and which offensive lineman, if any, he has beef with (16:39-28:22). Also joining the show is former Head Coach of the Oakland Raiders and Cleveland Browns, Hue Jackson. Hue and Pat chat about the Super Bowl and where each team will go from here, Hue gives his thoughts on what the Bengals should do with the first pick in the NFL draft, whether or not it is beneficial for rookie Quarterback's to sit behind veterans in order to learn the ropes of the NFL, &nbsp;what he thinks Baker needs to do to be more successful next season, and looks at the Rooney Rule in the NFL and whether or not it is actually doing what it is intended to do (30:48-47:26). Pat also looks at which team drafting in the top 10 is most likely to have a 49ers type turnaround next season, and gives his thoughts on the newest members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, including his old nemesis, Troy Polamalu.
