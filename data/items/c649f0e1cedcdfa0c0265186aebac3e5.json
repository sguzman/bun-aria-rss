The virus, now known as COVID-19, has spread to well over 100,000 people from Asia to the Middle East, Europe and the United States. On this episode of <em>Next Question with Katie Couric</em>, Katie asks experts like Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, Head of the Outbreak Investigation Task Force of the World Health Organization, to break down everything you need to know about this alarming outbreak — where it came from, how it spreads, and what you can do to protect yourself against it. Katie also speaks to Yulin Yin, a Minnesota man who shares his extraordinary journey out of the center of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, to a 14-day quarantine in San Diego and finally, home to his family. Katie also calls on Dr. Bill Schaffner, Medical Director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, to answer some of your burning questions.
