He's cynical about brands and the changing consumer, but that doesn't stop him from talking about every TTB label approval. Steve has also found a new home in brandy and we discuss how long it will take before Instagramers and podcasters ruin that too.\n\nShow Partners:\n\nCatoctin Creek has been honoring that tradition of small craft rye whisky since 2009.
