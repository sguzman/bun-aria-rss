  "itunes:summary": "In this episode, Kimberlé is joined by Bob the Drag Queen for a conversation full of critique and celebration of all things drag. Having once existed at the margins of legality and social acceptability, drag has now moved into the mainstream with the popular success of shows like RuPaul’s Drag Race, Dragula and We’re Here. Even with this moment in the limelight, drag’s inherent subversiveness, fearlessness and resilience shine through, posing fundamental questions like: What is gender and how it is performed? How does race interact with the performance of gender? What are the transformative possibilities and the limitations of this as an art form? And ultimately, what can drag do to contend with and push back against social injustice?\n\nThrough laughter and honest reflection, Kimberlé and Bob answer these questions and more as they explore drag's ability to be a tool for intersectional activism, their favorite figures in Black and queer history, what it was like being a child of the South, and the vital need to protect Black stories.\n\nWith:\nBOB THE DRAG QUEEN - Winner of Rupaul's Drag Race Season 8; Star of HBO's Were Here; Drag Queen, Actor, and Comedian \n\nHosted by Kimberlé Crenshaw (@sandylocks)\nProduced and edited by Julia Sharpe-Levine\nCo-produced by Ashley Julien\nSupported provided by Destiny Spruill, Rebecca Scheckman, and the African American Policy Forum\nMusic by Blue Dot Sessions\nFollow us at @intersectionalitymatters, @IMKC_podcast",
