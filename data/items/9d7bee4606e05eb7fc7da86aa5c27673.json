  "description": "<p>There are five founding estates of the Priorat region of Spain. Mas Martinet was the first and in this show, brilliant, philosophical owner Sara Peréz discusses its history, philosophy, and how she sees the land and wines of this magical, mystical region.</p> <p>This woman is a role model for us all -- she has found true happiness in her part of the world, her work, and her life!</p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/mas-martinet-viticultors-final.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"458\" height=\"337\" /></p> <p>Here are the show notes:</p> <ul> <li>Mas Martinet, originally owned and run by Josep Lluis Peréz, Sara's father, was one of 'los Closos', the group of five people and families that settled in Priorat and worked together from 1981 to change and revive the Priorat wine region and make it the legendary wine it has become (they are: Clos Mogador, Palacios, Clos Erasmus, Clos de l'Obac, Mas Martinet). Sara runs the winery and has brought Mas Martinet down new and exciting paths that have only made the wines more interesting, modern, and terroir driven. <br /> <br /> <br /></li> <li>Sara tells us about her dad and mom,  who moved from teaching into setting up an enology school and then starting Mas Martinet after much study of the terroir by the pupils (as Sara calls them!) to help examine the best soils, slopes, and sun exposures for each grape type.<br /> <br /> <br /></li> <li>We learn about things used to be in Priorat -- abandoned vineyards, Carignan growing on the flats, Garnacha on the slopes, and lots of empty land with few people staying to farm it. We discuss schist and the famed black slate licorella soil (pic here from Mas Martinet):<br /> <br /></li> <li>Sara and I address tradition versus market appeal and why some French grapes were introduced into Priorat. We discuss the high alcohol levels (she discusses a 2001 trip to visit Didier Dageneau in the Loire and her shock at how high he was allowing his alcohol levels to become. This made her want to make a different kind of wine). </li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Sara's commitment to organic viticulture and holistic farming rather than using anything that will harm the land is powerful. She uses herbs as cover crop to stop erosion on steep slopes, she doesn't spray -- even in the worst of years (she lost 86% of her crop this year), and she believes that small changes collectively can stop climate change. </li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>We discuss the top grapes of Priorat -- Carignan and Garnacha. Sara tells us how she creates Mas Martinet's three  flagship wines to pay homage to all styles of Priorat:</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://www.weygandtwines.com/products/mas-martinet-clos-martinet-2015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Clos Martinet</a> is the original wine made my Mas<br /> Martinet.

This wine is their most expensive, aromatic, and is 100% Grenache, and is elegant and light, as only Sara can make it in Priorat.<br /> <br /> <br /></li> <li><a href= \"https://www.wine-searcher.com/find/mas+martinet+cami+pesseroles+doca+priorat+catalonia+spain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cami Pesseroles</a> is Sara's homage to the wines madeby the farmers who stayed in Priorat after the wealthy gentry moved to cities.
