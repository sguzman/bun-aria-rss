  "description": "<p>Welcome to episode 267 aka the Christine Schiefer Show! Where Em can't hear the mixer sound effects so it's all up to Christine. We also dive into quite a bit of tub talk, we apologize in advance. This week Em continues with their break from ghost stories to tell us the tale of Anansi's Goatman from Huntsville, Alabama (also where we discovered Eva's love of all things outer space). Then Christine shares the tragic and gruesome story of Ramsay Scrivo. We recommend making yourself a spiked Emothy Sunrise after this episode... and that's why we drink!</p>\n",
