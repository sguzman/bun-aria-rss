  "description": "In Land, Liberty, and Water: Morelos After Zapata, 1920-1940 (University of Arizona Press, 2018), Salvador Salinas fills an important gap in the history of the Zapatista Revolution in Morelos - namely, what happened after 1920. In this meticulously researched account of everyday life between 1920 and 1940, Salinas shows that many of the democratic and economic gains Zapatistas made only came after the death of their famous general. Using ejidos, municipal authorities and water administration, Mexicans were able to win access to the land and water of the state.\nEthan Fredrick is a graduate student in history at the University of Minnesota.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
