This lens was a big investment for us and one we wish we could have made sooner.  Started using this lens at the end of 2013 - http://amzn.to/2tbtmOq\n\nAUDIO \n\nRode VideoMic Pro  - The Rode mic helps us capture our backup audio.  It also helps us sync up our audio in post http://amzn.to/2t1n2hx\n\nAudio Recorder - If we had to do it all over again, this is probably the first item we would have bought - http://amzn.to/2tbFlM9\n\nLIGHTS - Although we like to use as much natural light as we can, we often enhance the lighting with this small portable light.  We have two of them and they have saved us a number of times - http://amzn.to/2u5UnHv\n\nCOMPUTER - Our favorite computer, we each have one and have used various models since 2010 - http://amzn.to/2t1M67Z\n\nEDITING - We upgraded our editing suite this year and we’re glad we did!  This has improved our workflow and the quality of our work.  Having new software also helps when we have a problem, it’s easy to search and find a solution - https://goo.gl/56LnpM\n\n*These are affiliate links, by using them you can help support this channel.\n\n#film #filmmaking #producer",
