  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat conducts a State of the Podcast from a conference room inside of the hotel in Atlanta and opens up the floor for some questions. The guys discuss the many challenges they're facing for their Super Bowl week content, Pat recaps his experience on Radio Row at Media day including the radio hits he did with Clay Travis (54:53-1:13:01) and Toucher & Rich from 98.5 in Boston (1:20:23-1:32:38). Pat and the guys also recap their different travel stories en route to Atlanta, get a surprise phone call from AQ Shipley for a quick conversation, check in on the weight loss challenge as it has become a two-horse race, plus Pat puts Gorman's brain into a pretzel with one of his many illusions. Pat and the guys also discuss the Super Bowl a little bit and what they're looking forward to, what some of the more interesting prop bets they're looking at are, and ultimately who they think is going to win the game, and give a quick preview of where to find all of the different ways you can watch what they're doing in Atlanta. It's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
