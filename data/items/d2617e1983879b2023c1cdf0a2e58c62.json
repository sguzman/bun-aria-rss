  "title": "Bengals-Steelers MNF Recap: Ryan Finley leads Cincy to improbable win and Ryan Wilson to get his first tattoo ever (Football 12/22)",
  "description": "It happened. Led by Ryan Finley, the Bengals beat the Steelers and also Ryan Wilson's plans of never getting a tattoo. Last week, Ryan agreed that if this very scenario happened he would get a Ryan Finley tattoo somewhere on his body and here we are. Immediate reactions and tattoo details are sorted out on this emotional podcast as the Pick Six Superfriends also focus on the spiraling Steelers. Unbeaten a few weeks ago, Pittsburgh now seems destined to be one-and-done in the postseason and a lot of that falls on the arm of Ben Roethlisberger. On the other side, it seems like Zac Taylor likely saved his job and despite the win, Cincy still hangs on to the #3 draft spot. The guys speculate what could happen there and revisit the tattoo one more time!\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @johnbreech, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
