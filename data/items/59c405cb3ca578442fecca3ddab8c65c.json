  "description": "In today's podcast, it's bots, sockpuppets, and trolls, oh my. Mr. Zuckerberg goes to Washington. Equifax sources suggest China hacked it. Credit bureau phishbait chums the Internet. Pyongyang gets a new Internet connection, and observers bet it's not for checking Mr. Kim's fantasy sports leagues (anyway he could get all that from Mr. Rodman). ISIS posts more inspiration, and warnings. NSA prepares to wind down Section 702 operations. Johannes Ullrich from SANS Technology Institute and the ISC Stormcast podcast on malware using malicious DLL files. US and Russia seem to agree on one thing at least: Bitcoin fraud is bad.",
