  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, when looking at Nancy Pelosi and members of Congress, Americans are witnesses to a padded room. Among President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Speaker Pelosi each one is crazier than the other. Whether it's the allegations of Rep Ilhan Omar anti-Semitism or Eric Swalwell sleeping with the enemy the Democrats are grossly misguided. Then, so many American corporations have become so wildly unpatriotic as many hedge funds invest in communist China as do so many sports teams and news networks. Incidentally, communist China is also subsidized in the Build Back Better bill and offers a sweetheart deal for labor unions but not for employees in the private sector. Later, the United States is on a path to war with China. They are working diligently to disable our communications and beat us in space. They've infiltrated our classrooms, newsrooms, and major institutions. Afterward, journalist and author Alex Berenson joins the show to discuss his new book, \"Pandemia: How Coronavirus Hysteria Took Over Our Government, Rights, and Lives.\" Berenson also explains the validity of natural immunity and how to move past the hysteria of the pandemic. Finally, actor Adam Baldwin calls in to explain the film industry standard for handling firearms. Baldwin added that Alec Baldwin may have confessed to a crime in his recent TV interview.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
