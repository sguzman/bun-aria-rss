  "description": "<p><em>Axiochus</em> (ΑΞΙΟΧΟΣ) may not have been written by Plato. Socrates presents various arguments to the gravely ill Axiochus for why he should not fear death. The first is that the dead experience nothing because they do not exist and so by definition can not suffer from death. When this argument fails Socrates discusses the immortality of the soul, predestination, the final judgement, the joys of the afterlife for the good and the sufferings of the damned.
