  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the impact of Grant's presidency on Americans in the years after the Civil War in which he, with Lincoln, had led the Union Army to victory. His predecessor, Andrew Johnson, was prepared to let the Southern States decide for themselves which rights to allow freed slaves; Grant supported equal rights,  and he used troops and Enforcement Acts to defeat the Ku klux Klan which was violently suppressing African Americans.  In later years Grant was remembered mainly for the corruption scandals under his terms of office, and for his failure to support or protect Native Americans, but in more recent decades his support for reconstruction has prompted a reassessement.\n\nWith\n\nErik Mathisen\nLecturer in US History at the University of Kent\n\nSusan-Mary Grant\nProfessor of American History at Newcastle University\n\nand\n\nRobert Cook\nProfessor of American History at the University of Sussex\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
