  "description": "<p>So, what had happened was...Tayla Swiff released a surprise album. Or, was it TaylOR SwifT who released an album? Either way, an album was released. It's called <em>folklore</em>, and on this installment of Las Culturistas, Matt and Bowen deep absolutely DIVE into it, going track by track and relishing in all the lyrical and melodic greatness. The boys discuss the difference between \"Tayla\" and \"Taylor\", fight over whether the track \"Betty\" is queer baiting or not, and rank all of T.S.'s studio albums. They also (finally) deep dive on Lady Gaga's <em>Chromatica </em>and get into The Chicks' <em>Gaslighter</em> and Haim's <em>Women In Music Part III. </em>And also more! This is the episode of LC all about what we're listening TO that readers have been waiting FOR, hawney. So listen in before the episode, like august, slips away into a moment in time and is sipped away like a bottle of wine.
