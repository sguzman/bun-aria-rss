  "description": "Today’s show is highlighted by 3 incredible interviews. First, 2x Super Bowl Champion, current linebacker for the New England Patriots, and friend of the show, Kyle Van Noy stops by. He and Pat chat about New England’s most recent win over the Cowboys, why he thinks Lamar Jackson is so difficult to stop, the wizardry of Bill Belichick, and his Youtube cooking show on his channel, Vibin’ with the Van Noy’s (3:34-22:00). Next, Hall of Famer, 2x Super Bowl Champion, member of the Indianapolis Colts and Tampa Bay Buccaneers Ring of Honor, and current studio analyst for Football Night in America, Tony Dungy, joins the show. They chat about his role in selecting the NFL all-time time in celebration of the league’s 100th season and how difficult that process was and what it was like sharing a round table with Bill Belichick. Pat and Tony also discuss the league as a whole as we get closer and closer to the playoffs, and why he thinks Lamar Jackson has been so dominant and why he has been very impressed with the 49ers defense, and if this Patriots offense will get it figured out, or if the current formula is their new identity (23:36-35:36). Lastly, Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, former safety for the Saints and Panthers, Roman Harper stops by while on vacation in Paris. He discusses what exactly double coverage looks like in the NFL, and why trying to stop a guy like Michael Thomas is so difficult. He also chats about why rivalry games can be much tougher on players if one of the teams has a bad record, and he chats about his alma mater Alabama, and why he thinks they should get into the College Football Playoff, and what he thinks the best formula for success is in order to be one of the final 4 teams selected (40:05-54:55). Also included is Pat’s story of his fake punt pass on Thanksgiving against the Steelers, and his instant reaction of this week’s CFP rankings as we get ready for rivalry weekend. Don’t forget, everything at store.patmcafeeshow.com is still 20% off! Don’t wait as most of the items will sell out. Hope your Thanksgiving was incredible. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
