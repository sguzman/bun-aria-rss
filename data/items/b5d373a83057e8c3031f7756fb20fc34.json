Homo erectus, or Upright Man, spread from Africa to Asia and it was on the Island of Java that fossilised remains were found in 1891 in an expedition led by Dutch scientist Eugène Dubois. Homo erectus people adapted to different habitats, ate varied food, lived in groups, had stamina to outrun their prey; and discoveries have prompted many theories on the relationship between their diet and the size of their brains, on their ability as seafarers, on their creativity and on their ability to speak and otherwise communicate.\n\nThe image above is from a diorama at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark, depicting the Turkana Boy referred to in the programme. \n\nWith \n\nPeter Kjærgaard\nDirector of the Natural History Museum of Denmark and Professor of Evolutionary History at the University of Copenhagen\n\nJosé Joordens\nSenior Researcher in Human Evolution at Naturalis Biodiversity Centre and Professor of Human Evolution at Maastricht University\n\nAnd\n\nMark Maslin\nProfessor of Earth System Science at University College London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
