    "media:description": "This is Part 3 of 6 of a series of videos all about Star Wars: The Force Awakens. \n\nWe continue where we essentially left off, Han Solo meeting Rey and Finn, leading to the Rathtar's scene. A scene filled with confusing and contradictory writing along with monster meatballs. \n\nSoon after, we progress into the very chunky middle portion of the plot line while taking tangents into The Lord of the Rings, Captain America: Civil War, The Shining, Ready Player One, The Simpsons and more in this 4 hour selection of Star Wars analysis. \n\nThe cameos that were present in the older parts have now been removed from current and future instalments because they are drastically out of date - My fault for the production time taking so long. Otherwise, the video is essentially very similar to the two previous parts in form. \n\nThe Thumbnail art is courtesy of Oliver Pocock\n\nThe artists involved with the merchandise store - \n\nStradomyreArt - https://twitter.com/StradomyreArt\n\nTadas Sidlauskas - https://tadasart.portfoliobox.net/\n\nCatastropika - https://twitter.com/catastropikas\n\nLesyaBlackBird - https://twitter.com/LesyaBlackBird\n\nEeaargpht - https://www.instagram.com/eeaargpht/\n\nSid Nicholson - https://twitter.com/SpiderSid\n\nHaltab - https://www.instagram.com/haltabart/\n\nOmega Ridley - https://twitter.com/TheOmegaRidley\n\nCovarrean - https://twitter.com/covarrean\n\nWassNonnam - https://twitter.com/WassNonnam\n\nMauler merchandise store - https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/maulers-store\n\nThe EFAP debate on TLJ with Major Lee - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gX8AtXv8d0\n\nYMS' Kimba The White Lion - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5B1mIfQuo4\n\nThe EFAP episode on Cosmonaut Variety Hour - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tyhzogYxm4\n\nThe debate between myself, Wolf and Just Write - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58faj-2w140\n\nEFAP Gaming - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_ZMwDHR1V4\n\nEFAP Batwoman playlist - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGMB-2w0rBc&list=PL6A9eYEQJWquUUeUeVR6960xIra7KV4Fu\n\nThe previous part - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95mL3us0HSQ\n\nHere is a link to my second channel, where my Podcast \"EFAP\" is hosted. - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHH-ybUwH1CfJrXxnqw6Ljw\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/MauLer93\n\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/user?u=4817956\n\nSubscribeStar - https://www.subscribestar.com/mauler\n\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/aNX8J2v\n\n0:00:00 - Introduction.\n\n0:00:51 - Han Solo's reputation.\n\n0:02:08 - The executions of nostalgia in storytelling.\n\n0:09:29 - The miserable tale of Han Solo and his dice. \n\n0:13:28 - Opening up Rey and Han's relationship and what it costs.\n\n0:17:00 - The many mistakes in writing during the Rathtar scene.\n\n0:23:40 - The execution of throwaway lines in storytelling. \n\n0:36:58 - You should go and Watch YMS' video on Kimba: The White Lion.\n\n0:39:18 - Rey solves problems  by accident and without requiring appreciation for it. \n\n0:43:22 - Han Solo has been irreparably damaged.\n\n0:46:09 - Who is to blame for the fugitives escaping?\n\n0:47:27 - Addressing (Character X was always incompetent)\n\n0:57:55 - How The First Order's targets are backwards and why. \n\n1:04:04 - The characterisation that was intended and the result.\n\n1:09:59 - Wish fulfilment characters don't have definition. - What are her choices? \n\n1:26:19 - Explaining Luke's disappearance and the map.\n\n1:30:05 - Developing Rey and Han's relationship - What could have been.\n\n1:38:56 - What is ADR and what can we infer about TFA in relation to it?\n\n1:44:33 - The difference in cantina execution between ANH and TFA.\n\n1:45:36 - Maz Kanata is confusing. \n\n1:49:44 - What is Kylo's goal?
