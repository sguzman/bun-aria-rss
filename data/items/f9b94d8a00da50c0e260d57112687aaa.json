Eric is Head of Macro Research at Pervalle Global, a discretionary hedge fund specializing in global macro driven trades across all major asset classes. He first began contributing to Seeking Alpha in 2017, building up a following of more than 12,000 investors and becoming Seeking Alpha’s top contributor in the Economy vertical through his unparalleled analysis of key macro-economic trends - and his ability to turn this analysis into actionable, top-down portfolio advice.\nIn addition to his role at Pervalle, Eric runs his own Seeking Alpha Marketplace service, EPB Macro Research. In addition to the steady stream of macro analysis subscribers to EPB Macro Research get, they also gain access to EPB’s Model Tactical Asset Allocation and Long-Only Asset Allocation portfolios - 2 low cost, all-ETF portfolios overseen directly by Eric. By combining an asset class mix that includes stocks, bonds, gold and commodities - tilting based on underlying macroeconomic conditions - Eric has created an all-weather portfolio which tamps down risk and volatility while attaining impressive longer term appreciation of capital.
