  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as mask mandates return and talk of lockdowns picks up, it is clear that no amount of COVID risk is acceptable. With that in mind, I have come up with a three phase plan to eliminate the COVID risk and ensure that all of us can live safely and happily forever. I will share that with you today. Also we have our Five Headlines, including the journalist who had her own proposal: porn for kids. Yes, really. Plus, Facebook gets ready to unveil glasses that will record everything we do. And a restaurant owner calls Chris Cuomo to task live on air. We’ll play the heartwarming clip. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with Chris Hayes from MSNBC, who made an argument for masking while vaccinated that is truly breathtaking in its stupidity.\n\nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
