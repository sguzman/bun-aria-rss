  "title": "Stairway To Hell: Greta Van Fleetâ€™s Scorching Album Review That Went Viral",
  "description": "Classic rock climaxed a half century ago, yet it still survives in two places: FM radio & Greta Van Fleet. The later are an upstart of four boys from Michigan who have found stardom by dusting off the mantle of guitar driven rock. Their latest album, Anthem Of The Peaceful Army, bares an uncanny sonic resemblance to Led Zeppelin. Jeremy D. Larson, senior editor of Pitchfork, gave the album a 1.6 out of 10 calling it \"stiff, hackneyed, overly precious retro-fetishism.\" His vicious and hilarious takedown went viral and caused a rift amongst music fans on the internet. We ask Jeremy to join us to reveal what it means to earn such a bad review. After, we do something we've never done before: a track-by-track album breakdown. In a game of musical Pictionary, Charlie challenges Nate to find every Led Zeppelin reference on the album to answer the question: is it a copy or an homage? We have a feeling this will be a divisive episode...\nSongs Discussed:\nGreta Van Fleet - Age of Man\nLed Zeppelin - Rain Song\nLed Zeppelin - In The Light\nLed Zeppelin - What Is And What Should Never Be\nLed Zeppelin - Your Time Is Gonna Come\nLed Zeppelin - Immigrant Song\nLed Zeppelin - Kashmir\nGreta Van Fleet - The Cold Wind\nLed Zeppelin - Custard Pie\nGreta Van Fleet - When the Curtain Falls\nLed Zeppelin - Wanton Song\nGreta Van Fleet - Watching Over\nLed Zeppelin - Since I've Been Loving You\nGreta Van Fleet - Lover, Leaver\nLed Zeppelin - Whole Lotta Love\nSpirit - Taurus\nMuddy Waters - You Need Love\nSmall Faces - You Need Love\nWillie Dixon - I Can't Quit You Babe\nGreta Van Fleet - You're the One\nLed Zeppelin - What Is And What Should Never Be\nGreta Van Fleet - The New Day\nLed Zeppelin - Over The Hills And Far Away\nGreta Van Fleet - Mountain of the Sun\nLed Zeppelin - Celebration Day\nGreta Van Fleet - Brave New World\nLed Zeppelin - Achilles Last Stand\nGreta Van Fleet - Anthem\nLed Zeppelin - Tangerine\nLover Leaver (Taker, Believer)\nRead the Pitchfork review of Greta Van Fleet's Anthem Of A Peaceful Army\nLearn more about your ad choices.
