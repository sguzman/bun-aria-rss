  "description": "Having roles on Reading Rainbow, Star Trek, and Roots might be enough for many to coast off of but LeVar Burton refuses to get comfortable. Year after year he’s kept his passion in the industry alive by approaching every new opportunity with the conviction of a pro and the curiosity of a beginner.

[3:00] LeVar shares the keys to longevity and staying curiosity. [7:36] LeVar gives advice for people having trouble finding their passion. [17:30] LeVar describes what good leadership looks like. [23:03] LeVar touches on the sci-fi’s ability to manifest dreams. [27:20] LeVar reveals the impact he wants to have on the world. [34:05]   QUOTES: “And that's the thing about when you achieve success, it may not match your picture. It may not match your vision of what you thought, but you have to be flexible if you want to flow with the universe because the universe takes its cue from your intention and your actions but it's always going to interpret your dream the way it sees fit, not always the way you envisioned it. ” [4:02]   “You have to be willing to be open, to be humble and to be willing to acknowledge that you're in a process, you're on a journey.” [7:10]   “I think self-love is all about pushing yourself, demanding of yourself that you stretch and reach your boundaries.” [13:11]   “I think I've learned as much from my failures as I have from my successes perhaps more.” [15:25]   “Passion is the antidote to self-doubt because when you're in your passion space, you don't have time to have all that negative talk invade your thought process. When you're in your passion, you're leaning forward in the world. When you're in your passion space, you're actually looking for a way to be effective. You see yourself as more of a tool, more of an advocate for whatever it is that your play. Passion is the antidote for everything, for laziness, for self-doubt. It's passion that gets me through the day.” [16:48]   FOLLOW LEVAR BURTON: TWITTER - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2MCU29z\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2MCU29z</a> FACEBOOK - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2wxmLCt\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2wxmLCt</a> INSTAGRAM - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2wtbtPS\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2wtbtPS</a>   PEOPLE MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: Ben Vereen - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2C5LPG5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2C5LPG5</a> [19:13]   PODCASTS MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: LeVar Burton Reads - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2uSniMV\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2uSniMV</a> [2:30]   COMPANIES MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: LeVar Burton Kids - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2PS2gbH\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2PS2gbH</a> [32:53]",
