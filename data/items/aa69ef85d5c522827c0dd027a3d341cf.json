  "description": "Ed Orgeron did a cuss, but BYU won in Madison despite specifically not doing cusses, so it remains to be seen whether or not cusses are the way to win football games. Arkansas and Northwestern and USC all probably did some cusses, though you can't really blame them for that. Also there's way too much sexual discussion in this episode related to the Mario universe. Sorry.\nP.S. Kansas scored 55 points in a football game in 2018 and Rutgers is now a cuss.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
