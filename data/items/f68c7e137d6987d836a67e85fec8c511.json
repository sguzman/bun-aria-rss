  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat is joined by the GOAT. 4x Super Bowl Champion, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x First Team All-Pro, and one of Pat's best friends, Adam Vinatieri joins the show. They discuss whether or not he ever actually considered retirement after hitting a rough patch earlier this year, why he was so excited to come back and play for this Colts team, what he thinks his problems were earlier this season and what he did to fix them, and Pat tries to figure out what luxury vehicle Vinny is calling from in an honest, open interview that you don't want to miss (1:55-20:46). Pat and the guys also record some quick hits about tonight's Packers/Eagles game and look ahead to this weekend in the NFL as they record the show into a cell phone inside Foxy's XL Suite, as the truck won't be operational until this morning before the radio show. Pat also dives into the fiasco of not having a hotel room when arriving in Memphis, and all the other hijinks that took place once he and the boys landed. Pat's running on very few hours of sleep and another late night recording results in he and the boys being a little slap happy. It's a fun one that you'll enjoy. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
