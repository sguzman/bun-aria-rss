  "description": "<p>USE YOUR PAIN AS AN ARROW. None of us like to feel unpleasant emotions. Whether it’s pain, anxiety, or stress, we numb them with food, alcohol, and overscheduling. But there’s a lot we can learn from discomfort. Instead of drowning your feelings, get curious about them. Your envy can lead you to your passion. Your anxiety can show you your authentic self. And your pain might be asking you to comfort something in your past that is keeping you from your future. Unless we embrace where we’re from, we’ll never get where we’re going. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk with some of the most inspirational women on the planet: Elizabeth Gilbert, Rachel Hollis, Sarah Blakely, Glennon Doyle, Mel Robbins, and Lisa Nichols. Elizabeth Gilbert is the author of Eat, Pray, Love. Rachel Hollis is the bestselling author of Girl, Wash Your Face. Sarah Blakely is the founder and CEO of the massively popular women’s apparel brand SPANX. Mel Robbins is the author of the 5-Second Rule. Glennon Doyle is the creator of the online community Momastery. Lisa Nichols is a bestselling author and motivational speaker. These women share their experiences in overcoming limitations from their past to become the powerhouses they are today. Like Elizabeth Gilbert says in this episode, if your only goal is to be at the very top, you’re going to be disappointed.
