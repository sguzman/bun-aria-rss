Beyond <a href=\"https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2020/03/coronavirus-update-on-creator-support.html\" target=\"_blank\">helping</a> people find authoritative sources of news and information, we also want to be a helpful learning resource to families across the globe. <br /><br />We’re fortunate to have an incredible community of learning creators on YouTube. From <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse\" target=\"_blank\">CrashCourse</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7DdEm33SyaTDtWYGO2CwdA\" target=\"_blank\">Physics Girl</a>, the EduTuber community has been helping people around the world learn and keep up with their studies. We wanted to take a moment to provide an update around how we’re supporting their efforts. <br /><br /><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Learn@Home  </h3><br />Starting today, we’re launching <a href=\"https://learnathome.withyoutube.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Learn@Home</a>, a website with learning resources and content for families. From <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy\" target=\"_blank\">Khan Academy</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/sesamestreet\" target=\"_blank\">Sesame Street</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/CodeOrg\" target=\"_blank\">code.org</a>, Learn@Home will spotlight content across math, science, history and arts from popular learning channels. We’ll also have a dedicated section for families with kids under 13, where parents and kids can watch videos together that encourage kids' creativity, curiosity, playfulness and offline activities, such as how to build a model volcano. The website is launching today in English and will continue to evolve. We’re working to expand to more languages in the coming days, such as Italian, French, Korean, Spanish, Japanese and more. <br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--pN_xbbaRFA/XnTnTsbssJI/AAAAAAAAAx8/Iz720YD5HKQ_xZAWeXuKc5phWcGgTQWYwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/introSection.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"883\" data-original-width=\"1465\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--pN_xbbaRFA/XnTnTsbssJI/AAAAAAAAAx8/Iz720YD5HKQ_xZAWeXuKc5phWcGgTQWYwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/introSection.png\" /></a></div><br /></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">YouTube Learning Destination </h3><br />The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/learning\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Learning destination</a> is designed to inspire and help students with high-quality learning content on YouTube. The destination regularly features <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN0ge7yDk_UA0ldZJdhwkoV\" target=\"_blank\">supplemental learning content</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoFRvPlmME6HXgKoig0Uz9unPWSFtspRz\" target=\"_blank\">celebrates learning moments</a>, and shares <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoFRvPlmME6Edr7MGcV8c8TaabMwWOgAP\" target=\"_blank\">tips for learners</a>. The destination is available in English today and will expand to Italian, French, Korean, Spanish, Japanese and more in the coming days. You can find the Learning destination at <a href=\"http://youtube.com/learning\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com/learning</a> or in the brand new <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/33277848?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Explore tab</a> on the YouTube app. <br /><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LQuerH0yDdk/XnTtSTppccI/AAAAAAAAAyI/HZxD1LQ6TI8MhX-_meFqgzpOev8pD-AfgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/learningChannel.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1077\" data-original-width=\"1465\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LQuerH0yDdk/XnTtSTppccI/AAAAAAAAAyI/HZxD1LQ6TI8MhX-_meFqgzpOev8pD-AfgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/learningChannel.png\" /></a></div><br /><br /><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">#StudyWithMe </h3><br />As people <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/stayhome\" target=\"_blank\">#StayHome</a> to work and study, it can feel like an isolating time. We’ve been inspired by the #StudyWithMe movement, where students share their study experiences with each other online. Whether reading or listening to music, it helps to feel less alone when you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbpi6ZahtOH5fWoEOOV_hGarI4FxKHULy\" target=\"_blank\">study together</a>.  <br /><br /><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">YouTube Kids </h3><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/kids/\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Kids</a> provides kids under 13 with a safer environment where they can explore their interests and curiosity on their own while giving parents the tools to customize the experience. The app features a range of timely content, such as healthy habits, indoor fun and learning. <br /><br />We understand this is an unprecedented situation facing families across the globe. We’re humbled by the incredible EduTuber community that’s sharing knowledge with the world, and we hope you find these resources helpful in these challenging times.    <br /><br /><i>Malik Ducard, VP of Content Partnerships, Learning, Social Impact, Family, Film &amp; TV  </i></div>",
