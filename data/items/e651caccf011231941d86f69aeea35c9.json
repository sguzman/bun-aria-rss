  "description": "<p>In Episode 12 of the Being Human is Good For Business Podcast we talk to the President of International Brake Industries (IBI) <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/4pauljohnson/\">Paul Johnson. </a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ibilima.com/\">IBI</a> is a global provider of brake hardware and has been an automotive aftermarket leader for 50 years. It’s based in Lima, Ohio with a global footprint that includes South America and the Asia Pacific region. </p><p>“Being a leader in the automotive industry is no different than any other,” says Paul. “People are people. Business is business. Successful companies, regardless of their industry, are going to succeed by how well they motivate and activate their people.” </p><p>That said, the automotive industry is going through dramatic changes and it’s becoming a lot more complicated than ever. Innovation is the key to continued success and Paul agrees that leaders play an important role in creating the right environment. </p><p>“IBI has been in place over 50 years now,” Paul explains. “And we're the leader in our segment, but frankly, IBI created the segment. And when you're the big fish in a small pond, you can only grow so much organically. It takes innovation to maintain a growth trajectory.”</p><p>Paul credits his team’s use of the Enneagram framework as an important factor in supporting new product development and innovation by creating connections beyond the “org chart.”He explains, “By going through the Enneagram process and learning more about ourselves as well as others, we vastly improved our working relationships. It doesn't fix everything but overall, your organization will run better, be more efficient and more effective. I think it will make everyone a little bit happier too.”</p><p>In this podcast Paul shares how increasing his self-awareness, and gaining a deeper understanding of his team members’ core motivations, has changed the way he leads. And, how his new knowledge of the Enneagram has boosted his personal growth, which has changed the way he lives. </p><p>Links to helpful resources and information about some of the tools and concepts mentioned in the show:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/what-is-a-leadership-coach\">What is a Leadership Coach</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/use-enneagram-better-leader\">How to use the Enneagram better to become a leader</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/InsideOut-Enneagram-Game-Changing-Guide-Leaders/dp/0984884203/ref=pd_sbs_14_1/136-3490425-6103021?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0984884203&pd_rd_r=9c87530d-e993-4cd0-981a-4aaa3b5852f9&pd_rd_w=DJ93e&pd_rd_wg=rz6RO&pf_rd_p=de2765fe-65e5-4a88-aaad-a915dea49c67&pf_rd_r=00C3PQV1W88YVKNKWAG5&psc=1&refRID=00C3PQV1W88YVKNKWAG5\">InsideOut Enneagram: The Game Changing Guide for Leaders</a></li></ul><p>Please subscribe to the <i>Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast </i>on iTunes, Amazon, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio and Spotify (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
