  "description": "<p>Let’s talk about MLMs. We’ve all heard about multi-level marketing companies but are they <em>all</em> scams? Some of them are legit right? MLM ‘opportunities’ are on the rise and we’re seeing more and more products that are pitched by friends and in particular by folks we know on social media. Americans are more susceptible than ever these days and we might be more likely to get tangled up in a pyramid scheme due to financial insecurity brought on by covid. So in this episode we cover what an MLM is and how it’s different from a pyramid scheme, a brief history of some MLM companies, and then some different avenues to take instead of joining up with a multi-level marketing company.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Double Up by Monday Night Brewing!
