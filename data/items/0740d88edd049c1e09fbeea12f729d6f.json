  "title": "\"The Bear\" Culinary Producer Courtney Storer Talks Chefs And Kitchen Culture",
  "description": "<p>If Courtney Storer’s life sounds like an episode of <i>The Bear</i>, it’s no surprise. She’s the culinary producer of the hit show, which was created by her brother, Christopher Storer. The restaurant world has reacted strongly to <i>The Bear</i> and its portrayal of kitchen culture. Courtney, for her part, was drawn to the restaurant industry as a teenager but had to lie about her age to snag her first job. She later wound up working in HR, but was encouraged to attend culinary school because of her passion for cooking. That led to a stint in Paris and senior roles at Animal and Jon & Vinny’s, the critically acclaimed Los Angeles restaurants.</p><p>Courtney joins host Kerry Diamond to talk about her culinary journey and what it was like working with the cast and crew of <i>The Bear</i> to accurately portray back-of-house life. She also talks about Raising Foodies, a program developed by the Alliance of Moms to teach individuals in L.A.’s foster care system how to make affordable meals for themselves and their families. </p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to catch <a href=\"https://cherrybombe.com/radio-cherry-bombe/jeremy-allen-white-the-bear\">Jeremy Allen White</a>, the star of <i>The Bear</i>, on Radio Cherry Bombe. </p><p>This episode is supported by Wild Planet, leaders in sustainable seafood.
