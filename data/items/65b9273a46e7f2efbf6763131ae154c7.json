  "description": "Growing up is never easy. But pop songs about adolescence too often gloss over the complicated moments. The “teenage dream” archetype is just a pop culture fantasy. And no one really wants to be 17 forever. \nOn her new album “Home Video,” Lucy Dacus talks about youthful growing pains. She remembers the uncomfortable moments. Dacus says that “a lot of childhood is crisis mode… you get pushed around by the world and the rules that are set for you.” Her songs examine unequal power relationships between parents and friends and lovers. \nOn the lighter side, the album opens up with “Hot And Heavy,” which takes us back to the scene of an early romantic encounter on a basement sofa, red faced and awkward. But by the next song, “Christine,” the amorous feelings fade: “He can be nice, sometimes / Other nights, you admit he's not what you had in mind.” Bad dads, bible camp indoctrination, and perpetual peer pressure all take the stage in Dacus’ coming of age album. \nDacus says that writing about those years is “a process of extorting control over things that I didn’t have control over at the time.” With untethered teenage dreams safely behind her, Dacus now gets to reclaim the meaning of youth: “I am the narrator of my own life so I get to say what this meant.”\n\nSongs Discussed\nLucy Dacus - Night Shift\nFrank Zappa - Sharleena\nboygenius - Souvenir\nLukas Graham - 7 Years\nKendrick Lamar - Beyonce\nJustin Bieber - Baby\nMandy Moore - Fifteen\nHilary Duff - Sweet Sixteen\nThe Beatles - When I'm Sixty Four\nABBA - Dancing Queen\nSound of Music - Sixteen Going On Seventeen\nAvril Lavigne - 17\nKings Of Leon - 17\nLake Street Dive - Seventeen\nSharon Van Etten - Seventeen\nAlessia Cara - Seventeen\nStevie Nicks - Edge of Seventeen\nJanis Ian - At Seventeen\n\nMore\nPlaylist of coming of age songs \nStudy on songs that references age\nLearn more about your ad choices.
