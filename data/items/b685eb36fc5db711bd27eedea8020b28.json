  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Florida braces for hurricane Ian and after ignoring him, President Biden finally spoke with Gov Ron DeSantis to discuss steps to prepare.

Smiley says her opponent is a rubber stamp for Biden, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
