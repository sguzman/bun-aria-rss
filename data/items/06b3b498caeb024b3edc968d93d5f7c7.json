  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, President Trump yesterday compared the coronavirus to car accidents. He’s been mocked and derided for this comparison, but I think people are missing the very important ethical point that Trump was trying to make. We’ll take a deep dive into it today. Also, Five Headlines, including Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden both babbling nonsensically during TV interviews about the virus. And today we’ll cancel a feminist lawmaker who thinks the coronavirus is a weapon of the patriarchy.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
