    "media:description": "Who exactly is an immigrant? Immigration is a hot topic of discussion in many countries, although it's interesting to think that when you go back far enough, literally every single person on Earth is descended from immigrants at one point in time.\n\nIn today's video, we're going to be setting parameters for just who constitutes an \"immigrant\" in the modern age and looking at countries and territories around the world that have large immigrant-descended populations, many of which you would not have expected.
