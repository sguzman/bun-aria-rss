  "description": "<p>If you are an artist, this is the time of year when you start to hear about CVP, the online 12-week course taught by Nicholas Wilton. (Full name: The Creative Visionary Program). We have both taken this course in the past and Alice now works as a CVP coach. In this extra episode, we discuss our own personal experiences with the program and answer some of the questions that we are most frequently asked. Our discussion covers financial considerations, the logistics of online learning, how much individual guidance you can expect, how much time is needed, and which kinds of artists can most benefit. Does this work for you if you are a beginner? How about a skilled professional? Should you take it if you paint realistically? Or is it just for abstract artists. We cover all this and more in a frank and wide-ranging conversation.</p>\n<p>We also invite you to a special Facebook group that we will be hosting for anybody who signs up through our link (bit.ly/cvp2020). Please note we have to check each name with Nick’s team, so please be patient as we admit you into the group.
