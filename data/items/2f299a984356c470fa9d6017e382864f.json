  "title": "Implementing a Weighted Majority Rule Ensemble Classifier",
  "description": "Here, I want to present a simple and conservative approach of implementing a weighted majority rule ensemble classifier in scikit-learn that yielded remarkably good results when I tried it in a kaggle competition. For me personally, kaggle competitions are just a nice way to try out and compare different approaches and ideas -- basically an opportunity to learn in a controlled environment with nice datasets.",
