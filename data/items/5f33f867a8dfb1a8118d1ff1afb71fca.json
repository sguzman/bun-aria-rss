  "description": "Water is elemental, sustaining all manner of human and sea life. The ocean, rivers, and lakes we gaze upon are also home to so many other creatures. Some are friendly, most are indifferent to us, but others..others are quite deadly when we encounter them. Like the aquatic monsters of lore drawn out by a need to feed. Fearsome beasts dragging our souls down into their depths of despair...leaving our bodies to float lifelessly on top of the water. First, do you hear the deadly siren song? Next, an ancestors' promise becomes a modern day peril. After that, Classic haunted poetry by the sea from Edgar Allan Poe. And finally, never float down the river alone.\nSunBasket.com/SCARY, enter promo SCARY for $35 off your order\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
