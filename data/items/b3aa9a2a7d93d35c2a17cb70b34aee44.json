Regardless, the high-level concepts of how <a href=\"https://www.omnisci.com\">OmniSci</a> works and the concepts behind GPU dataframes (then: pygdf, now: <a href=\"https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf\">cudf</a>) remain the same, so watching this talk still has value if you are interested in an end-to-end GPU workflow.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.omnisci.com/blog/pymapd_0.7_updated_RAPIDS_support_pyarrow_python_more/\">With the release of pymapd 0.7 a few days ago</a>, getting started with GPU data science is just a matter of having an NVIDIA GPU and <a href=\"https://github.com/omnisci/mapd-core\">OmniSci Core (OSS)</a> and a quick conda command to set up your environment:</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">conda install -c conda-forge -c nvidia -c rapidsai -c numba -c defaults pymapd cudf python=3.6</code></p>\n\n<p>So check out the video, grab the Jupyter Notebook from the <a href=\"https://github.com/omnisci/pydatanyc2018\">pydatanyc2018 GitHub repo</a> and get started with GPU-accelerated data science!</p>"
