  "description": "After four years of policy by Tweet that sometimes felt as if it were driven more by the indigestion of the Tweeter than by any connection to US interests, the Biden Administration has ushered in a striking change. Last week's US-China meetings in Anchorage, were acrimonious at times but appropriately so for a complex relationship and there seemed to be a clear method to the US approach. That was born out early this week when the US imposed meaningful sanctions on China for its abuses of the Uyghurs...in conjunction with our closest allies. We discuss where this and other recent developments lead with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and David Sanger of the New York Times. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
