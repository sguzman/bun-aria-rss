  "description": "<p>Nelson Mandela once said, “I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.” We all live with fear—it’s a basic human mechanism hardwired into our systems to protect us from danger.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>In today’s society, we have far less things to be legitimately fearful of than our ancestors did. But on the other hand, we have so many more inputs and decisions today that can easily become paralyzed by non-threatening fears. We might fear judgment, failure, rejection, inadequacy, and a number of other things. While it’s perfectly normal to experience this emotion, it’s important that we don’t let it sabotage our careers, relationships, or from tapping into our potential.</p> <p>In her new book, <em>Let Your Fears Make You Fierce</em>, Koya Webb outlines the four major fears that we all experience, and how to overcome them in order to live out your dreams. Koya is a transformational specialist, an internationally recognized yoga teacher, and a holistic health and wellness coach.
