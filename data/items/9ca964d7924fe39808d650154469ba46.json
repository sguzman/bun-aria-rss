  "title": "More Fire: Your Sister Slid in My DMs (featuring Kyle Van Noy, Alex Bregman, White Sox Dave, Big Cat, Dave Portnoy and Tommy Smokes)",
  "description": "<p><p>Kayce prohibited Jared from having any contact with her sister. Bowls of wine, getting out of speeding tickets, and chewing charcoal. Kyle Van Noy (19:21) stops by to rub his 2nd Super Bowl KFC's face. Alex Bregman (47:15) tells Jared that no one thinks he has any clue what it's like in the MLB. White Sox Dave threw 72 mph  and El Pres (1::16:10) declared him Weird Haircut Dave. We patched calls from White Sox Dave and Pres together and let them go at it. Big Cat suggests an auction style pitch competition. What's a sexual experience with Tommy Smokes (1:34:59)? And Kayce's stalker (1:47:15) sends her a weird note and then calls in to offer to take her on a date.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
