  "dc:content": " <p>Jon Bernthal's Punisher is reportedly set to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), if a recent and surprising Instagram leak is to be believed.</p><p>The apparent confirmation comes by way of Kasey O'Keefe, a relatively unknown Los Angeles-based actor, who recently uploaded an image of himself and Bernthal on the Meta-owned social media platform.</p><p>Ordinarily, such photographs wouldn't draw too much attention. However, in the image caption, O'Keef seemingly drops a huge hint that Bernthal's Punisher has joined <a href=\"https://techradar.com/tag/marvel\">Marvel</a>'s cinematic juggernaut. In it, O'Keefe lavishes praise on Bernthal, calling him a \"tremendous actor\", before going on to write \"Looking forward to working with you during <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/marvel-phase-5-every-mcu-movie-and-tv-show-release-date-for-2023-and-beyond\">Marvel Phase 5</a>!\"</p><p>Take a look at O'Keefe's Instagram post below:</p>\n<div class=\"instagram-embed\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"6\" style=\"width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CkgYRmwJjMW/\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Mr. Kasey Oâ€™Keefe ðŸŽ­âœ¨ (k.o.)

That report came after Rosario Dawson, who played Claire Temple/Night Nurse in multiple Netflix Marvel TV series, including Daredevil and The Punisher, had incorrectly suggested Bernthal's Punisher was getting a standalone MCU TV series.</p><p>While Marvel hasn't officially commented on the matter, numerous MCU insiders have claimed that Bernthal will join Charlie Cox â€“ who played Matt Murdock/Daredevil in Netflix's Defenders-Verse â€“ in making the jump to the MCU via <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/disney-plus-movies-shows-free-trial-hamilton-and-more-explained\">Disney Plus</a>.

He's also expected to cameo in Echo's standalone series before getting his own show on Disney Plus â€“ Daredevil: Born Again â€“ in 2024.</p><p>As for those insiders talking up Bernthal's return,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tom_Smith717/status/1571992728191508481?s=20&t=HIOfY3QDDjnvBFsiyQ6qhw\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/canwegettoast/status/1559235715485007880?s=21&t=ND5a8P83zu4Em-OVsBHpIQ\" target=\"_blank\">CanWeGetSomeToast</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mytimetoshineh/status/1554025126836015105\" target=\"_blank\">MyTimeToShineHello</a>, who all have decent track records when it comes to insider knowledge on Marvel productions, have all suggested Bernthal has already signed on to reprise his iconic role in future MCU projects.</p><p>Naturally, O'Keefe's post should be taken with a huge pinch of salt, so don't take this as confirmation that Bernthal <em>is</em> actually coming to the MCU.
