    "media:description": "A relaxing full colour 4-hour journey into the deep depths of the Mandelbrot.  This is now the deepest zoom on this channel, going to a magnifiction of 3e3284.  That is 3 with 3284 zeros after it! (Try zooming in that far on your phone).\n\nThis zoom uses a very classic colouring method and the pallette covers the full spectrum.  This video seems to look best at the 4k setting (even though there is higher resolutions available, it was uploaded at 6k). \n\nIt is possible to present this video with NO mid-roll ads thanks to Patreons supporters, and NFT buyers. So releax and enjoy.\n\nDue to YouTube's 100gb file size restriction, this video is uploaded in two parts.  Part 2: https://youtu.be/FsQUE4rZ9hE\n\nThank-you to my supporters on Patreon.\n\nThis video will be available for Patreons to download in the coming days, which will have a higher bitrate.  You can also use these visuals on your own channel if you are a member of my Patreon page. https://www.patreon.com/mathstown\n\n/********************************************************************************\nOpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/maths-town\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/mathstown (Support, Downloads & Usage Rights)\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MathsTown\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/YphYVt787v (Drop by and say hello)\nGrab a T-Shirt: https://amzn.to/3eIfqmX\nWebsite: https://www.maths.town\n********************************************************************************/\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/ekoiev/\n\n#Mandelbrot #fractal #mathstown #fractals",
