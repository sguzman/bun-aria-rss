She founded and leads the On Being Project (www.onbeing.org)— a groundbreaking media and public life initiative pursuing “deep thinking and moral imagination, social courage and joy to renew inner life, outer life, and life together.” As the creator and host of the Peabody Award-winning On Being radio show, heard on over 400 public radio stations across the US, Tippett takes up the great animating questions of human life: What does it mean to be human, how we do want to live, and who will we be to each other?\n\nIn 2014, President Obama awarded Krista the National Humanities Medal at the White House for “thoughtfully delving into the mysteries of human existence. On the air and in print, Ms. Tippett avoids easy answers, embracing complexity and inviting people of every background to join her conversation about faith, ethics, and moral wisdom.”\n\nKrista is also the author of three books at the intersection of spiritual inquiry, social healing, science, and the arts: Becoming Wise: An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living; Einstein’s God: Conversations about Science and the Human Spirit and Speaking of Faith, a memoir of religion in our time.\n\nKrista is in conversation with The Poetry Exchange hosts Fiona Bennett and Michael Shaeffer.\n\n‘Good Lord The Light’ can be found in poet Christian Wiman’s latest collection – ‘Survival is a Style’, from Farrar, Straus and Geroux: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374272050\n\nYou can listen to Krista’s extraordinary range of life-expanding conversations through the On Being podcast – which can be found wherever you get your podcasts and at www.onbeing.com. \n\nThe gift reading of 'Good Lord The Light' is by Michael Shaeffer.\n\n*********\n\nGOOD LORD THE LIGHT\nby Christian Wiman\n\nGood morning misery,\ngoodbye belief,\ngood Lord the light\ncutting across the lake\nso long gone\nto ice —\n\nThere is an under, always,\nthrough which things still move, breathe,\nand have their being,\nquick coals and crimsons\nno one need see\nto see.\n\nGood night knowledge,\ngoodbye beyond,\ngood God the winter\none must wander\none’s own soul\nto be.\n\nFrom 'Survival is a Style' - Farrar, Straus and Giroux (February 2020)",
