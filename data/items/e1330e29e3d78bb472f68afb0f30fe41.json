  "description": "<p>On this week’s episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael are talking about police use of chokeholds. In 1983, the Supreme Court held in City of Los Angeles v. Lyons that a man who had been injured by a brutal police chokehold did not have standing to sue for an injunction—in other words, he could not ask the Court to order the police to stop using chokeholds. The Court’s decision allowed the practice to continue, and chokeholds have been a focus of police reform efforts and protests since then, particularly after the 2014 death of Eric Garner.</p><p> </p><p>Follow Peter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/The_Law_Boy?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@The_Law_Boy</a>), Rhiannon (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AywaRhiannon?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@AywaRhiannon</a>), and Michael (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/_fleerultra?lang=en\">@_FleerUltra</a>) on Twitter. </p><p> </p><p>Please support our sponsors: </p><p> </p><p><a href=\"keeps.com/fivefour\">keeps.com/fivefour</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
