  "title": "PMS 2.0 215 - This Show Might Change Your Thoughts On EVERYTHING.. Former Marlins President David Samson, Shams Charania, Pierre McGuire, Jett Passan, & Legend, AJ Hawk Stop By. Let's Go.",
  "description": "Today’s show is absolutely LOADED. First, NBA Insider for The Athletic and friend of the show, Shams Charania joins the program to discuss the memo sent to NBA teams about returning to play. Pat and Shams discuss what it all means, what the quarantining will look like, who has issues with it, and what repercussions (if any) there will be if some players decide they don’t want to go play in the bubble (:38-17:50). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk as Pat and AJ welcome former President of the Florida/Miami Marlins and current podcaster for CBS Sports, David Samson. They discuss everything going on in the MLB currently, and David lets Pat and AJ know how teams used the media to get whatever narrative they wanted into the public and that most of the time it was a complete misdirection in a conversation that you do not want to miss (19:36-35:43). Pat and AJ also discuss everything going on in the sports world currently, and how hopefully things are starting to move along in the process of bringing sports back (19:36-1:28:05). Next, ESPN MLB Insider and friend of the program, Jeff Passan joins the show. Jeff gets Pat caught up on everything going on with the MLB negotiations and why he thinks we are getting closer to having a baseball season, despite it not really being what either side wants. They also discuss how MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred seemingly needs to put his foot in his mouth every time he speaks (1:30:00-1:47:57). Lastly, NBC Sports hockey analyst and former coach and scout in the NHL, Pierre McGuire joins the show. Pat and Pierre chat about the NHL going full steam ahead with their original plan to restart, what roadblocks still stand in the way, and how the NHL seems to be leading the charge for getting back to sports as the league and players association have been on the same page to get the game back (1:47:59-2:02:11). Don’t forget to send in a picture of where you’re listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free march. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
