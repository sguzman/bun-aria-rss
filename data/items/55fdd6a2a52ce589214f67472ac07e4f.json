  "itunes:summary": "Since our last episode the world has fundamentally changed.\nCOVID-19 – born from the alleged consumption of a bat purchased in an illegal market in Wuhan, China – has spread across the globe and in a sense put humanity on hold.\nMillions have caught it, hundreds of thousands have died, and in its wake a new reality of social distancing has emerged, where the best hope in combating the disease lies in people’s capacity to no longer interact in person.\nAcross the world states have struggled to face the disease and save lives, enacting a myriad of policies and approaches to mitigate the human and economic damage of COVID 19. And as would be expected the results have been mixed, ranging from East Asian success stories to the abject failure of the Trump administration in the United States to adequately deal with the disease.\nIn the first of a series of podcasts on COVID-19 this episode will focus on the Canadian response to coronavirus. At the present time nearly fifty thousand Canadian citizens have contracted it, with deaths inching towards three thousand nation-wide. While hope lies in the fact that contraction rates have begun to slow, anxiety has continued to rise as politicians and policy-makers have begun to discuss the re-opening local economies after nearly two months in stasis.\nJoining us to talk about the Canadian response to COVID-19 is Paul Thomas, a senior research associate with the Samara Center for Democracy and an adjunct professor with the Department of Political Science here at Carleton University.\nYou can find more about the work Paul and the Samara Center are doing at https://www.samaracanada.com/, and can follow Paul on Twitter @pejthomas and the Samara Center @SamaraCDA.",
