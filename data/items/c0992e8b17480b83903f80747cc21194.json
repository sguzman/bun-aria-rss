  "description": "Sometimes in life, we have to wait. We have to be careful to not allow the waiting to open the door to doubt and discouragement. We have to trust that God will get us to the right place at the right time.Today, I want to encourage you, no matter what you are waiting for, learn to wait well. Instead of worrying, turn your focus to the Father. Let patience have it’s perfect work. Trust that He is ordering your steps.Think about a butterfly coming out its cocoon. It takes time, it takes effort, it takes difficulty to get out of that cocoon but once it breaks out, it comes forth in such beauty. It’s ready, it’s poised to be able to fly. That’s what happens to us when we wait well. We become strong and beautiful, ready to embrace all God has for us.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
