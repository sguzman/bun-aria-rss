  "description": "<p>WHERE MY MOMS AT!? It's the show by the Moms for the Moms. Hosted by everybody's favorite \"cool mom\" Christina P! Not only the most REAL show for moms, but the most interactive. An open place to admit no one really knows what they're doing.</p><p>Christina comes in today all fired up about her Starbucks barista wearing a Star Trek pin on their apron. Are Star Trek nerds different from punk nerds? We get into follow ups about ho bags, boyfriends liking stuff on Instagram, and an update from Jack the Texan!  Christina gives some insight on how she teaches her kids what's bad to do and we talk about tiers of groups in high school. We also do our best to answer some WWCPD's about bringing ladies back to your parents house, dealing with a cheating partner, and a cool pie kink.</p><p>Christina P. wants to hear from you since she is seriously lacking in cool mom friends. If you want to share a \"Pazsitzky Effect\" or \"Mom Hack\" please call into our voicemail (213)375-5184 and let Christina know! We want to talk to as many moms across America as we can.</p>\n",
