  "description": "This week, the gals get beamed up to probe some extraterrestrial encounters. Topics include bogus autopsies, a coal miner's inexplicable death, and some terrif-EYE-ing hypontic recollections. Pop open some Au Del√† Tocai Friulano from Winc (or the Groom Lake Red from the Little A'Le'Inn), rebutton your jacket, and tune in for Alien Abductions.",
