  "description": "What the hell is Web3, why did everyone start talking about it all at once, and are we going to still be talking about it in a few months? Jarrod Dicker, an investor at the Chernin Group, may know the answers to some of those questions, so he sat down to talk with Recode’s Peter Kafka. For years, Dicker has been in and around crypto — Web3 is really a rebranding of crypto — but he also knows the media business: Prior to Chernin, he was an executive at the Washington Post. He’s bullish on Web3 because that’s his job, but he’s also got a nuanced perspective on what this stuff does and doesn’t mean for lots of different businesses.\n\nFeaturing: Jarrod Dicker (@jarroddicker), Partner at the Chernin Group\nHost: Peter Kafka (@pkafka), Senior Editor at Recode\nMore to explore: Subscribe for free to Recode Media, Peter Kafka, one of the media industry's most acclaimed reporters, talks to business titans, journalists, comedians, and more to get their take on today's media landscape.\nAbout Recode by Vox: Recode by Vox helps you understand how tech is changing the world — and changing us.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
