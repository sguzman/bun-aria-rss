  "title": "144 - The Texas Killing Fields",
  "description": "<p>Since 1971, well over thirty women have disappeared along a fifty mile-long patch of I-45 between Houston and Galveston. Some refer to this stretch of the Gulf Freeway as a highway to Hell, and to the marshy land around it as \"The Texas Fields.\" Initially, the press only referred to one twenty-five acre patch of land in League City, an abandoned oil field, as the Texas Killing Field after the remains of two women were found in early 1986 on the same day. And both bodies were found near where a third body had been uncovered in 1984. And then more bodies turned up on and around this old oil field. Who killed these women? And what does today's tale have to do with Matthew McConaughey?
