  "description": "Show me that smile, again… Because it's time for another Poddy Break! This week, we've got the amazing Kirk Cameron! Tim is concerned for Kirk's disheveled appearance. Kirk suggests that Tim should take a turn on Dancing with the Stars, and Tim blames Kirk for his haircuts in the 80s. Friend of the show, Gary King, asks a serious question, and Tim gives a terrible answer. Then Kirk asks a serious question, and Tim gives another terrible answer. Kirk buffs up and beards up for a movie roll.\n Also in this episode: The gang discusses the secret areas of Disneyland. Caleb orders Panda Express in the middle of the show. Tim has a movie idea, and gives Kirk the right of first refusal. Two new characters call into the show after Kirk decides to give away tickets to Tim's shows in exchange for answering a trivial question. And Kirk's marriage seminars prove, as long as we've got each other, we can take anything that comes our way.\n Tweet your little fingers off @poddybreak\n Get more of Kirk at http://kirkcameron.com Tweet Kirk! @KirkCameron\nLearn more about your ad choices.
