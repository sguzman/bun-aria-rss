  "description": "<p>Some in the bigfoot community feel that Sasquatch are the Nephilim. I decided to do a show on the Nephilim. Once we have a clear picture of what the Nephilim were we can look at the facts and decide if it fits into the Sasquatch topic.</p> <p>My guest tonight is Gary Wayne, author of \"The Genesis 6 Conspiracy: How Secret Societies and the Descendants of Giants Plan to Enslave Humankind.\" There are giants among us, passing largely unnoticed, intent on carrying out a secret plan to enslave all humanity. They may not look like giants today, but their bloodlines extend all the way back to the Nephilim—the offspring of angels who mated with human women—described in Genesis 6 when giants roamed the land. Gary Wayne, author of The Genesis 6 Conspiracy: How Secret Societies and the Descendants of Giants Plan to Enslave Humankind, details the role of modern-day Nephilim in Satan’s plan to install the Antichrist at the End of Days.</p> <p>When God cast the angel Lucifer and his followers out of heaven, Lucifer set into motion a scheme to ensure the Nephilim survived. Why? Because from the bloodlines of these Nephilim the Antichrist will come. To keep his plan alive, Satan has enlisted the loyalty of secret societies such as the Freemasons, the Templars, and the Rosicrucians to conspire in teaching a theology and a history of the world that is contrary to the biblical one.</p> <p>The Bible, along with many other ancient sources, clearly records the existence of giants. Wayne provides copious citations from many society insiders, along with extensive Bible references, other religious references, and historical material to bolster his contention. What he uncovers will astonish you.</p> <p>Click <a href= \"http://www.amazon.com/The-Genesis-Conspiracy-Societies-Descendants/dp/1632692902\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a> to check out Gary's book \"The Genesis 6 Conspiracy: How Secret Societies and the Descendants of Giants Plan to Enslave Humankind\"</p>",
