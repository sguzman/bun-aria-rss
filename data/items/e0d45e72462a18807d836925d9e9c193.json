  "description": "<p>For every prime number $p$ it is possible to define a $p$-adic version of the\nVeneziano amplitude and its higher-point generalizations. Multiplying together\nthe real amplitude with all its $p$-adic counterparts yields the adelic\namplitude. At four points it has been argued that the adelic amplitude, after\nregulating the product that defines it, equals one. For the adelic 5-point\namplitude, there exist kinematic regimes where no regularization is needed.\nThis paper demonstrates that in special cases within this regime, the adelic\nproduct can be explicitly evaluated in terms of ratios of the Riemann zeta\nfunction, and observes that the 5-point adelic amplitude is not given by a\nsingle analytic function. Motivated by this fact to study new regularization\nprocedures for the 4-point amplitude, an alternative formalism is presented,\nresulting in non-constant amplitudes that are piecewise analytic in the three\nscattering channels, including one non-constant adelic amplitude previously\nsuggested in the literature. Decomposing the residues of these amplitudes into\nweighted sums of Gegenbauer polynomials, numerical evidence indicates that in\nspecial ranges of spacetime dimensions all the coefficients are positive, as\nrequired by unitarity.\n</p>",
