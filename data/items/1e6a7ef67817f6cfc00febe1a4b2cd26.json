  "description": "Welcome to Episode #2 of 'Knowledge Bites', where I discuss some of the concepts, theories and models I come across when reading books for my One Minute Book Review channel. In this episode, I will give a brief introduction of 'The Fogg Behaviour Method' and how we can all apply it positively to our lives, which is the aim of 'Knowledge Bites'. I will try and keep this episode as concise as I can, I have read a lot surrounding this topic and will try my best to simplify it as best I can.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
