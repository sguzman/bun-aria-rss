The book sulked in the shadows of Christianity until the 19th century, incomprehensible and unwanted. British Protestants re-interpreted the book as the veriest key to the whole Bible. That obsession took root in North America.<br /> I also peruse the amusing Acts of John, and the intriguing three letters attributed to John.</p> <p>Theme music \"Inspiring Teaser\" by Rafael Krux, https://filmmusic.io/song/5672-inspiring-teaser, license https://filmmusic.io/standard-license.</p>",
