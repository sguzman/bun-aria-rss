  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease Podcast, we’re heading to the American West to meet a Rancher midway through his ninth decade on planet earth -- and he still rides his mule everyday. He’s known as one of the nation’s best dry-ground mountain lion hunters. The southern border of his property is Mexico, he plays a little fiddle, and he did a some unconventional roping in an Academy award winning movie. But that’s just the flashy stuff, we’ll hear a wild story that involves a helicopter rescue, but mainly we’ll glimpse into the life of a true American cowboy named, Warner Glenn. We had expectations of who this man would be, but they were scattered in the desert when I met the real Mr. Warner. This is part one in our series on the life of the living legend, Warner Glenn. </p><p><br></p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p><p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p><p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p><p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/products/bear-grease-hat\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
