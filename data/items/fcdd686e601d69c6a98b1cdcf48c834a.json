  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, what is the purpose of government? To protect you. Yet, nobody wants to live in a major democrat city anymore because they don’t feel protected. CNN spent the weekend trashing President Trump as if it were actual news. Meanwhile, murders have increased by double digits in cities across America; the same cities that are slashing police budgets. Americans must vote the Democrats out of office and rollback all anti-gun laws. Then, what a twisted world we live in where young pro-life activists are arrested for writing in chalk on a public sidewalk, Black Pre-Born Lives Matter. The politicians don't care and the Democrats are united in being legislative storm troopers to advance the loss of liberty that we are witnessing. Later, Sean Hannity joins the show to discuss his new book \"Live Free or Die: America (and the World) on the Brink.\" Hannity focuses on the rise of radical socialism and how it is hurting America. The left has ratcheted up their assault on religious liberty and Hannity reiterated the strength of the commitment that Trump has on religious freedom from standing up for churches in America to allies in Israel.  Afterward, Democrats Jerry Nadler and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz have both gone on the record years ago to say that paper ballots are highly susceptible to fraud. Yet, the democrats are pushing for voting by mail with paper ballots, not with voting machines that leave a paper trail. Will Joe Biden accept the outcome of the election? If so, then why did he hire 600 lawyers for his campaign?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
