  "description": "17 year old Alissa Turney officially went missing May 17, 2001. Initially, she was labeled a runaway, but as evidence piled in to the contrary, the investigation seemed to point to foul play. Did her overbearing stepfather Michael Turney have something to do with Alissa's sudden disappearance? As the last person to see Alissa that day, he holds more answers than he is willing to give. Almost two decades later, the case remains unsolved and Alissa has never been found. <br>\n<br>\nThanks to our sponsors!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Daily Harvest<br>\n</strong>Go to <a href=\"http://Dailyharvest.com\" target=\"_blank\">Dailyharvest.com</a> and enter promo code MORBID to get $25 off your first box! \n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
