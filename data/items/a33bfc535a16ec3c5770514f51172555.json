  "description": "<p>\"I DIDN’T HAVE THE COURAGE TO EXPRESS WHAT I WANTED - WHAT I NEEDED.”<br />\nLately I’ve been traveling around doing a book tour for The Mask of Masculinity. I always like to do a Q&A with my audiences to learn more about them and help answer any questions that may not be in the book.<br />\nI recently recorded my talk in Los Angeles with an amazing group. They really dug deep and asked a lot of great questions, including a lot about my past.<br />\nMy book can only fit so much information and was written to help others more than be a biography.<br />\nSo I wanted to share with you this special talk. I really open up and practice what I preach. I talk about my father and open up about how he affected my life. I also share how I’m still learning, how I keep myself on track to keep my aggression in check, and much more, on Episode 569.</p>\n",
