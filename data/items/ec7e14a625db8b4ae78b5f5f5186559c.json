  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 2/5/21",
  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the Manchurian candidate, Joe Biden, and the Democrats spent another quarter of a trillion dollars to appease the teachers' unions, not the American people hurting from coronavirus. The majority of the money is to help democrats close budget gaps that existed before the coronavirus. Biden has destroyed thousands of key jobs by shutting down one pipeline and are considering shutting down all pipelines. This relief bill isn't about helping small businesses, or anything else, it's about massively transferring wealth. Also, Raheem Kassam from the National Pulse calls to react to the Time Magazine article that admits that a cabal of corporatists, activists, and politicians changed election laws and more to \"secure\" a victory for Biden. Hundreds of millions of dollars were invested by foundations and other organizations to influence the election for Biden through uprisings for racial justice. Even details like putting election drop boxes on streets that are frequented by Democrats more than republicans were part of the overall plan to beat Trump. Later, Sen Ben Sasse says Trump lied and is responsible for inciting the riot at the Capitol. Similarly, Rep. Dean Phillips whines about his white privilege. Afterward, Dr. Marc Seigel joins the program to elaborate on the latest coronavirus stats. Seigel says lockdowns spread the virus even more because people are huddled in their homes more than usual.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
