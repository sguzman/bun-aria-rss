  "description": "<p>Having a glass of wine most days can be a healthy activity that we incorporate into our lives. Many studies have concluded that the moderate consumption of wine doesn't have negative long-term effects while simultaneously it could be beneficial in providing antioxidants as well as protecting against heart disease and inflammation. But, if that habit goes unchecked it could take on a tyrannical component in our lives if we’re not careful, and it could lead to severe consequences. The same is true with our money. And so on the show today we are de-emphasizing something that is at the very core of our show! We believe that money is a helpful and necessary tool, but we also believe that beyond a certain point, more money isn’t going to solve all of our problems. And in fact, money is only one component of our overall health and happiness levels. So during this episode we cover the struggle between achieving financial health and many of the other different facets of overall health like our physical, mental, social, and spiritual aspects as well. And then we end with a litmus test to help you determine if you have placed money in its proper place in your life.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Hay-Z by Temblor Brewing - a big thanks to Ryan and our friends there at the brewery for donating this delicious craft beer to the podcast!
