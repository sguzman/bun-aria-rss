  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, rather than get rid of the filibuster, we should get rid of the democrat party. It’s the democrat party that fought for slavery and abused the filibuster in the name of slavery and Jim Crow, and yet the Democrat party stands despite its support of racism. If HR-1 had been in the original Constitution, we wouldn’t have had a Constitution. Limits were intentionally placed out of grave concern that the federal government would take over the election process because the centralization of the voting process would lead to tyranny. The Bill of Rights, the thing meant to protect us from government, is constantly under attack from democrats and the media. Also, parents across the country are speaking out against Critical Race Theory. We are going to have to lead the movement against racism being taught in our schools. School districts are spending our tax dollars to train professionals to spread CRT. The American Marxists don’t understand that we won’t bow down to them because we are proud of our history, which is something most countries can’t say. Later, President Biden and the democrats don’t have the answers for gun violence in inner cities, because they’ve been running them for decades. They are too busy attacking police and law-abiding citizens, and will never talk about black-on-black crime despite it being a horrific fact. The evil is in the person using the gun, but democrats will always attack the gun and the manufacturer.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
