  "description": "For the first time in 18 years, a new drug for Alzheimer’s disease has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. This is big news because rather than just treating the symptoms, the drug targets the amyloid plaques that are thought to cause the disease. But the team explains why there are still many reasons to remain cautious. They also discuss an exciting breakthrough in our understanding of the brain, as Google researchers have, for the first time, <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2279937-google-has-mapped-a-piece-of-human-brain-in-the-most-detail-ever/'>mapped all the connections in one cubic millimeter of human brain tissue</a>, containing a whopping 50 thousand brain cells and 130 million connections. Then there’s the little story about how time can appear to violate the second law of thermodynamics, <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25033380-900-when-time-runs-backwards-what-thermodynamics-can-tell-us-about-life/'>by running backwards instead of forwards</a>. The team also celebrates the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2279992-tiny-animal-revived-after-24000-years-entombed-in-siberian-permafrost/'>revival of an animal frozen in permafrost for 24,000 years</a>, and they travel to the very edges of the galaxy where, for the first time, <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2280222-the-building-blocks-for-life-might-exist-at-the-edge-of-the-galaxy/'>organic molecules have been detected</a>.
