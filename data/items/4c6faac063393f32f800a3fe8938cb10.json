  "description": "<p>This week, “The Daily” is revisiting some of our favorite episodes of the year and checking in on what has happened since the stories first ran. In October, we sat down with a group of teenage girls in Brooklyn to talk about their reaction to the accusations against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. After that conversation aired, we received dozens of emails from listeners who wanted to hear the same questions posed to a group of boys. Guests: Ann Powers, a listener in Oregon, interviewed her two sons and one of their friends.
