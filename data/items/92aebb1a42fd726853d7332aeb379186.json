  "title": "Introducing Story of the Week with Joel Stein: Billionaires Prepping for the Apocalypse",
  "description": "Here’s a preview of a new podcast, Story of the Week.\n\nEach week, journalist Joel Stein chooses an article that fascinates him, convinces the writer to tell him about it, and then interrupts a good conversation by talking about himself. Sometimes the story will be the one everyone is talking about, like the New Yorker article on smoking hallucinogenic toads. Other times we’ll find a story you might have missed, like the one in the Verge about the rock groupie turned hacker who had huge corporations at her mercy. Stories that stick with you long after you forget whatever headline you just doom-scrolled through. In this preview, Joel is joined by Douglas Rushkoff to talk about his experience speaking to a group of tech billionaires in the middle of the desert. He thought he’d be chatting about the latest in tech advancements, but all these guys wanted to talk about was building doomsday bunkers.
