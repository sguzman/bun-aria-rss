  "description": "Glenn reads through the declassified whistleblower complaint – and it’s NOT about Joe Biden. The Media is OMITTING over 500 words of the transcript to claim that Trump just wanted dirt.

With all that’s at stake, impeachment is a last stand for the Democrats because it’s either the DNC or Trump. Rep. Chris Stewart calls in – fresh out of Thursday’s hearings – to give his take on all the chaos. But one thing’s for sure: the American people are tired of jumping to conclusions.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
