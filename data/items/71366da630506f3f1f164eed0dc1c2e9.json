  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Attorney General Bill Barr said the he believes Robert Mueller could have reached a decision on obstruction. If Mueller found a crime he could have said that there was probable cause for the crime of obstruction of justice but he did not because there was no probable cause for any crime. Moreover, the Constitutionality of Mueller's appointment was ignored by the media even though he wielded more power than any other U.S Attorney suggesting that he was a \"principal officer\" and was never nominated by the President nor confirmed by the Senate. Hence it’s the position of this program that Mueller exceeded his authority as an inferior and was in effect a principal officer serving in violation of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. Then, Assistant Professor Kevin Lerner from Marist College penned an opinion column in the Washington Post pushing back on Mark's \"Unfreedom Of The Press.\" Challenging that the New York Times and Washington Post are not liberal versions of Fox News and that objectivity is not the goal of the press. Afterward, Elizabeth Warren calls for slavery reparation and radical abortion laws.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
