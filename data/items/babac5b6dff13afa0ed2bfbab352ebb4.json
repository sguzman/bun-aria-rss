  "description": "<p>So many of us grew up without any sort of formal or informal education about personal finance. Few states offer a personal finance course in their public schools and even fewer participate in any sort of standardized testing for the courses they do offer. That’s why we’re really excited to have Dan LaSalle join us for this episode. Dan saw a need for this type of education in the high school where he was teaching and four years ago he took it upon himself to create a personal finance program that not only teaches students the importance of budgeting, saving, and investing, but also gives them the opportunity to earn up to $5,000 a year, and put that money into a bank account of their own. We truly believe that this kind of approach could be the future of financial education!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Happy Trees by ANXO which you can find on Untappd. A big thanks to good buddy Andrew for donating another tasty beer cider to the show!
