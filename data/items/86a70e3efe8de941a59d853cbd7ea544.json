They chat about a wild altercation they encountered over the weekend between two ex-lovers, Connor potentially getting sold a ficus instead of a bonsai tree by some snake oil salesman, they fact check some things from the last episode, talk about Tony's distaste for werewolves and vampires, and bounce around to a few other topics that pop up along the way. Stay safe out there, and enjoy.</p>\n",
