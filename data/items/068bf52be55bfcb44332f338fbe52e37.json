  "description": "Donovan Chau is the author of Exploiting Africa: The Influence of Maoist China in Algeria, Ghana, and Tanzania (Naval Institute Press, 2014). Chau is an associate professor of political science at California State University.\n\nChau examines China’s role in Algeria, Ghana, and Tanzania from the 1950s to the 1970s.

Rather than merely looking forward, he argues that we must look backward to comprehend the true nature of China in Africa.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
