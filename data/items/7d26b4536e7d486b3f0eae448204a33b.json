Today, we’re excited to share his thoughts about ‘Listen, Liberal’ by Thomas Frank in his first book review for the podcast! According to Paul, ‘Listen, Liberal’ just might have the power to make Democrats relevant again. So cozy up, press play, and let Paul tell you about a book. Pair with a cup of tea. \nListen, Liberal: http://listenliberal.com/ \nTwitter: @paulconstant\nPaul’s website, The Seattle Review of Books: https://seattlereviewofbooks.com/",
