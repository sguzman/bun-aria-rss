    "media:description": "There aren’t enough researchers to survey the entirety of our planet on foot—not to mention that many areas are treacherous to reach. Satellites and drones are crucial to showing off these places and provide new perspectives on areas we can access. When NASA launched Landsat1 in 1973, it was the first satellite to provide regular snapshots of the entire world. Now, the frequency and resolution of satellite imagery has greatly improved. Watch to learn how scientists are harnessing these data to better understand the health and biodiversity of ecosystems. \n\nRead the story: https://www.science.org/content/article/satellites-offer-new-ways-study-ecosystems-maybe-even-save-them",
