This type of persistent inflammation not only affects the body, it also affects the brain. In fact, neuroinflammation may be linked to everything from Alzheimer’s and dementia to ADD, ALS, depression, and even schizophrenia.</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks to Drs. Daniel Amen and Todd LePine about how the foods we eat, the toxins we’re exposed to, our stress levels, and our genetics are just some of the many aspects that can promote brain inflammation. They also discuss how they work with patients to reduce inflammation in the brain and in the body.</p><br><p>Dr. Daniel Amen, has been paving the way for a new type of psychiatry, looking at the actual brain and using an integrative approach to prevent disease and successfully treat it. <em>The Washington Post</em> called Dr. Daniel Amen the most popular psychiatrist in America and <em>Discover Magazine</em> listed his brain imaging research as the top neuroscience story for 2015.

He is an Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years.
