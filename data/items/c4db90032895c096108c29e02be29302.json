  "description": "<p>Good morning and welcome to the ride!  The entire show is present and accounted for and they are on fiya!  The Chief Love Officer helps a married woman deal with her trash talking husband.  Is the return of Magic Shave right for The Jackpot Joint of Jerusalem or nah?  The world mourns the passing of Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman.  Congratulations to our very own J. Anthony Brown who will be in 'Tyler Perry's Assisted Living' that premieres on September 2.  We go back a few years when Steve interviewed Chadwick Boseman on his show as they discussed his iconic movie roles.  Lebron James honored Chadwick Boseman by taking a knee and gesturing Wakanda Forever before the National Anthem.  There will be another battle between Monica Verzuz Brandy tonight at Tyler Perry Studios.  The ballistics report from the Breonna Taylor case is in.  Today in Closing Remarks, Steve is happy with The Black Lives Matter Movement and more specifically the reaction to the \"why\" and he explains it right here.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
