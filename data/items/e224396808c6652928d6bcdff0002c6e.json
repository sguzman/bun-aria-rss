Instead of releasing the songs as they existed in the show, Landgraf and Weida worked with producer Vincent Cacchione to create fully-realized versions of the songs, to be released as a proper album. Their finished work, titled The Attic Tape, will be available via Bandcamp and iTunes later this January. The album also features the voices of cast members Annie Golden (Hair, Orange Is the New Black) and Melissa Mahoney (Solarplexus, The Pirate La Dee Da).The album was entirely funded through listener donations. <br>\n<br>\nThe It Makes A Sound album Patreon page currently has 110 supporters. Many supporters will receive the digital album, and the most dedicated fans will receive a copy of the album on cassette.<br>\n<br>\nWelcome our sponsor Green Chef!!Green Chef is a USDA certified organic company that includes everything you need to easily cook delicious meals that you can feel good about.Meals plans include: Paleo, Vegan, Vegetarian, Pescatarian, Mediterranean, Heart Smart, Lean & Clean, Keto, Gluten-Free and Omnivore.For $50 off your first box of Green Chef, go to <a href=\"http://www.GreenChef.us/sleep\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.GreenChef.us/sleep<br>\n</a><br>\nTonight’s episode is sponsored by Brooklinen, luxury bedding, at amazing prices.
