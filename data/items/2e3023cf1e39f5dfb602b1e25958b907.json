  "title": "Ep 96 | Jewish Space Lasers & Deplatforming 'MAGA Media' | Ben Shapiro | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Behold Ben Shapiro, the Great Wrecker of Libs himself. From the growing contempt for free speech to the fatal excesses of cancel culture and the forcefulness of so-called racial equity, Ben smashes claims that conservatives don't battle censorship. All of it is fueled by the Left’s need for constant revolution and their habitual gaslighting. Seriously, the gaslighting is nonstop: At this very moment, makeshift fencing (aka a wall) surrounds the Capitol. Democrats used to hate walls and borders, but thousands of National Guardsmen occupy Washington, D.C., for unclear reasons, for an indefinite amount of time, and the Democrats are happy about it? Ben also addresses some of the more \"creative\" conspiracy theories of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, like Jewish space lasers. And what about the obsession to rid this \"cancer\" from Congress? Ben says it's all politics: \"We're all old enough to remember [before] Marjorie Taylor Greene, it was Steve King, and when it was not Steve King and it was Christine O'Donnell, and when it was not Christine O'Donnell, it was Todd Akin. Meanwhile, I got Nancy Pelosi on the cover of a magazine with Ilhan Omar, and it's like, well, 'that's just the way things go' five minutes after she was about to censure her for her anti-Semitism.\" Ben ends the show on a strategy to help Democrats and tearful journalists at Politico stop treating conservatives as domestic enemies. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
