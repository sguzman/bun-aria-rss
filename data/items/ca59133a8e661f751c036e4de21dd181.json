  "description": "<p>The book of Mark was written to make sure we always had access to what the real Jesus actually said and did. In this sermon, we see three different parties react to Jesus. What is Mark doing in these verses? 1) Through the paralyzed man, he’s trying to challenge us; 2) Through our own confusion about how this fits in with the rest of the Bible, he’s trying to comfort us; 3) And through the leaders’ shock and anger, he’s trying to empower us.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 12, 2006. Series: King's Cross: The Gospel of Mark, Part 1: The Coming of the King. Scripture: Mark 2:1-12.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
