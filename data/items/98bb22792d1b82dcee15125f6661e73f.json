  "title": "Ep 219 | Jase's Spiritual Stocks, the Bible on Investing and Tattoos, and Lying to the Holy Spirit",
  "description": "Jase says more power to the retail investors who went up against hedge funds shorting GameStop, but he's sticking with long-term investments. Phil, Jase, and Al look at what the Bible says about investing and acquiring wealth, and Jase finds a parable in Luke that makes for a good stock market analogy. The guys also discuss what the Bible tells Christians about tattoos, why you don't want to mess around with the Holy Spirit, hypocrisy in those who represent heaven, the stock market in your heart, and whether you can make the argument that scaring the hell out of people is biblical.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
