  "description": "<p>Krein-Hermitian Hamiltonians, i.e., Hamiltonians Hermitian with respect to an\nindefinite inner product, have emerged as an important class of non-Hermitian\nHamiltonians in physics, encompassing both single-particle bosonic\nBogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians and so-called \"$PT$-symmetric\"\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians. In particular, they have attracted considerable\nscrutiny owing to the recent surge in interest for boson topology. Motivated by\nthese developments, we formulate a perturbative Krein-unitary Schrieffer-Wolff\ntransformation for finite-size dynamically stable Krein-Hermitian Hamiltonians,\nyielding an effective Hamiltonian for a subspace of interest. The effective\nHamiltonian is Krein Hermitian and, for sufficiently small perturbations, also\ndynamically stable. As an application, we use this transformation to justify\ncodimension-based analyses of band touchings in bosonic BdG Hamiltonians, which\ncomplement topological characterization. We use this simple approach based on\nsymmetry and codimension to revisit known topological magnon band touchings in\nseveral materials of recent interest.\n</p>",
