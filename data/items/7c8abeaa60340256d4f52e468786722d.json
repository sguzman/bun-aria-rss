  "description": "<p>Tony Konecny, better known as Tonx, has been sourcing and roasting beans for a numbers of years, and recently founded Tonx Coffee, a subscription service that delivers whole beans from small batch roasting every two weeks. It's not a bean of the month club. It's a way to bypass the overchoice that one can face in specialty coffee shops, and get the assurance that the beans are fresh and good every time. In this episode, listen to Tonx and his ecommerce guru Nik Bauman talk about the joys of coffee and the joys of starting a business in which you can talk directly to your customers without anyone else getting in the way. There's a brief interlude in which the host and a friend have a little Tonx tasting, too.</p>\n<p>(Note: Although Tonx Coffee has sponsored other Mule Radio shows, this show is editorially independent and Tonx Coffee didn't sponsor this episode.)</p>\n\n\n\n",
