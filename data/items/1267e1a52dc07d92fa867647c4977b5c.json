  "description": "Missy is NOT happy about one story Jase told on the podcast. Jase risks his life to catch his largest bass ever, but conveniently, he doesn't have his phone with him to take a picture. Al spots a punny church marquee with a message about masks, but Jase isn't a fan. Phil and Al debate the age of the Earth and the different ways God could have created it. Jase describes the “Jesus party” Matthew threw to show his coworkers — other tax collectors — the glory of God. And Phil talks about why Miss Kay had to pay for their wedding.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
