ARA started in 1987 with a multiracial group of teenage skinheads who fought the rising white power movement. It grew into a network of groups in at least 120 towns and cities across the US and Canada. ARA’s first principle was: “We go where they go. Never let the Nazis have the streets.” They eventually applied that not only to white power organising, but to homophobic and anti-abortion organizing, and to police violence, which they saw as all connected. Producer and host Anna Stitt tells the story of the group in Minneapolis through vivid first-person accounts, archival audio, and music from the era. It starts under the railroad tracks in Uptown, Minneapolis and traces a movement that continues to shape the US to this day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Learn about the group across the US in the forthcoming book, <em>We Go Where They Go</em>, which you can preorder from <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wrkclasshistory/we-go-where-they-go-the-story-of-anti-racist-action\" target=\"_blank\">our Kickstarter here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wrkclasshistory/we-go-where-they-go-the-story-of-anti-racist-action</a></p>\n<p>More information about this episode, photos, full acknowledgements and a transcript here on our website: <a href=\"https://workingclasshistory.com/2021/01/11/e49-anti-racist-action-in-minneapolis/\" target=\"_blank\">https://workingclasshistory.com/2021/01/11/e49-anti-racist-action-in-minneapolis/&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Listen to our exclusive bonus episode, where we discussed the topic further with Anna, and listen to more tape from participants about their early lives, political backgrounds and more on patreon here: <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/e49-1-anti-bonus-46081746\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.patreon.com/posts/e49-1-anti-bonus-46081746</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
