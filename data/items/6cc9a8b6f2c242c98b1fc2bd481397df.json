  "title": "John Fea, “The Bible Cause: A History of the American Bible Society” (Oxford UP, 2017)",
  "description": "I own many Bibles, but curiously, I didn’t purchase any of them. They were all given to me, almost all by Protestant Christians. And, considering the history of Protestant Christianity, that impulse to freely offer “God’s word” makes a lot of sense. John Fea takes up the institutionalized giving of Bibles in a primarily American context in his new book, The Bible Cause: A History of the American Bible Society (Oxford University Press, 2016). Through a meticulously researched and carefully constructed chronological narrative of the American Bible Society, Fea expertly touches upon themes of foreign relations, gender, race, technology, and the changing American religious landscape from just after the Revolution to today. This fascinating work would therefore be of interest to general readers and to experts in the field, and is particularly noteworthy as it explores Christianity outside of traditional denominational lines.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
