My friend Alison Hallett recommended Dylan's work and the <a href=\"http://www.boneville.com/\">Bone series</a> by Jeff Smith. Dylan mentioned the artist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Bilibin\">Ivan Bilibin</a> as an inspiration for <em>Outfoxed</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Portland has a ton of creative people of all sorts, and cartoonists and comic-book artists rank high among them. Both <a href=\"http://www.darkhorse.com/\">Dark Horse Comics</a> and <a href=\"http://www.onipress.com/\">Oni Press</a> are based there. Erika Moen, a Periscope Studio participant, was <a href=\"http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/7/31/episode-34-do-toy-with-my-affections-with-erika-moen\">on this show</a> in August 2013. Bill Amend (<a href=\"http://www.foxtrot.com/\"><em>Foxtrot</em></a>) became internet famous. </p>\n\n<p>Dylan's <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dmeconis/the-dylan-meconis-library-2012\">Kickstarter campaign</a> was successful, but she hit a bunch of snags we discuss. Her wife, Katie Lane, is a lawyer <a href=\"http://www.workmadeforhire.net/blog/\">who advises freelancers at Work Made for Hire</a> on making good decisions about their work and rights! Katie performs legal work for cartoonist Matt Bors, <a href=\"http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/6/26/matt-bors-the-pen-is-mightier-episode-29\">a previous guest</a> on this podcast.</p>\n\n<p>I and Dylan listed off an oodle of conferences, which include <a href=\"http://www.gallifreyone.com/\">Gallifrey One</a>, <a href=\"http://rosecitycomiccon.com/\">Rose City Comic Con</a>, <a href=\"http://www.emeraldcitycomicon.com/\">Emerald City Comicon</a>, <a href=\"http://prime.paxsite.com/\">PAX</a>, the <a href=\"http://2014.xoxofest.com/\">XOXO conference</a>, <a href=\"http://www.maxfuncon.com/\">MaxFunCon</a>, and <a href=\"https://jococruisecrazy.com/\">JoCo Cruise Crazy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Erika Moen is using Patreon to <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/erikamoen\">fund each cartoon</a> she creates.</p>\n",
