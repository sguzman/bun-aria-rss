  "description": "<p>Nearly 80% of Americans wouldn’t be able to pay their bills if they missed a paycheck. When you’re used to living paycheck to paycheck, the idea of setting aside some extra money is almost laughable. How do you even consider setting financial goals when every dollar you make is already going somewhere necessary? In this episode we talk through how to choose to set goals regardless of your financial situation. The goal of an emergency fund for some breathing room and financial cushion is the very thing that will allow you to still pay your bills if you miss a paycheck! Even saving $1,000 can be enough to end the cycle and allow you to escape that paycheck to paycheck lifestyle.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed a Roast Beast by Modern Methods which you can find on Untappd.
