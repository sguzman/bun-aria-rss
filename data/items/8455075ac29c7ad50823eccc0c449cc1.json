  "description": "In today’s podcast we follow the latest fallout from the DNC hacks (Russia’s still the prime suspect). Fears of election hacking rise in the US. Government electronic surveillance rises worldwide, driven in part by increasing fear of jihadist terrorism. ISIS unit “Emni” is said to have broad responsibility for recruiting and organizing terror cells. Android security upgrades from Johns Hopkins University expert Joe Carrigan. TripWire's Dwayne Melancon explains spearphishing. A quick look over at Black Hat USA. And some observers think Pokemon-GO is a mind control tool. (We don’t, except insofar as any popular mania amounts to mind-control.)",
