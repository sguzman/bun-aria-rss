  "description": "Minneapolis voters have rejected a referendum to dissolve and replace their police department by a dramatic 12-point margin. The election result reflects a different mood from what the city saw a year ago, when protesters booed the mayor for resisting the movement to defund the police.\n\nWhy were the planned police reforms so unpopular in the city where George Floyd’s murder sparked an international movement for justice? And what lessons should activists for and against the measure take from this moment? \n\nGuest: Jon Collins, senior reporter for MPR News. \n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
