  "description": "Who cares about Jan. 6? Buck says, \"The Democrats want us to spend the whole day on defense... How much did you watch? How much could you stomach?\" Clay thought it a boring rehash of old info and started reading a book instead after 20 minutes. Buck felt the same but watched the whole thing this morning. Inflation hits 41-year high, recession looms. Clay says, \"Putting it in context. You just turned 40, right? This past year. In your entire life, inflation has never been this high before.\" The Democrats' Trump insurrection reboot falls flat, Democrats only know how to do one thing: attack Trump. Clay says, \"People are more likely to like Trump when he's getting attacked like this.\" Biden has unified 70% of the country against him. C&B predicted a recession and shortages, why didn't the \"experts\" see this coming? Biden regime drops covid test requirement to enter U.S.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
