  "title": "Ep. 855 - Jussie Smollett Should Be Charged With A Hate Crime",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Jussie Smollett has been found guilty of committing a hate crime hoax. But I think a hate crime hoax is a hate crime in itself, and should be charged as such. We’ll talk about that today. Speaking of hate crimes, my bestselling LGBT children’s book Johnny the Walrus has been removed from Amazon’s LGBT list. I will have something to say about that today, and a fair warning: I might get a little emotional about it. Also, a male college swimmer is dominating female swimming. Outkick has an interview with one of his teammates and she is not happy. Plus, Simone Biles is named Athlete of the Year, for quitting. \nSign the petition to stop Biden’s vaccine mandate.
