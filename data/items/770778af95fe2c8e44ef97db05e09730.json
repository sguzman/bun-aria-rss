    "media:description": "It might be cold, but it's nothing a cozy Christmas can't fix!\n\nAme has told Gura about some sort of... christmas surprise? What could it be?\n\nAfter 2 months of serious work, my first fully 3D animated short is finally completed! This has been quite the learning experience, and you can bet there's gonna be a whole lot more in the future. \n\nHUGE, and I mean HUGE (Huge!!) ups to Woo for composing the score!! I don't know how you do it, but you're basically a musical god and I'm very happy to be able to work with you. Hell yeah. Check him out! Now!\nhttps://twitter.com/Kuri_Woo\n\nThanks to all my viewers who helped me out and gave me company while I created this short! Without yall, we wouldn't have nearly as many easter eggs and stuff. \n\nWebsite, for all of my artworks and content: https://myxoch.com\n\nTwitter, to keep up to date: https://twitter.com/CrashLandStudio\n\nDiscord, to get more involved: https://discord.gg/FkWtKHc3V2\n\nThanks for stopping by!",
