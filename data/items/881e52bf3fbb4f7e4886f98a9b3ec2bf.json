  "description": "<p>Christianity teaches that Jesus took our sins upon himself and endured the punishment of death we deserve. Some critics of that view, however, claim a God who pours out his wrath upon his innocent Son is a moral monster. Friend of the show, Mike Erre, is back to set the record straight and explains what the “divine child abuse” critique of the cross gets wrong. Also this week, Christian and Skye try to explain anti-semitism to Phil, new research says evangelicals don’t have diverse friends but teenagers do, and witchcraft is on the rise among millennials. Thanks, Harry Potter. </p>",
