  "description": "<p>This week, we explore a story filled with wall to wall crime, and crazy. He played with reckless abandon, and lived with even less care. A kid from the back woods makes it big in the NHL, and somehow ends up living in a dingy trailer, on a swamp, with a prostitute, a nasty crack habit, and facing the electric chair for kidnapping, and murder. If you think that's wild, wait until you hear about his father. It's a tale of insanity, from start to finish! Fire up a big crack rock, build a truck out of an airplane, and kidnap a small time gangster with Brian \"Spinner\" Spencer!! Check us out, every Tuesday.
