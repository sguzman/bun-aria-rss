  "description": "<p>Jesus Camp follows a group of children as they attend an evangelical Christian summer camp, where they are taught that they have \"prophetic gifts\" and can \"take back America for Christ.  The film claims that it \"documents and does not judge.\" But Gillian and Patrick sure do!\n Get ready for some good old fashioned speaking in tongues, Jesus hip-hop, climate change denial, and a complete dismissal of science, some SUPER intense kiddos, and even a dance number or two! But leave your \"Harry Potter\" books at home, because...well...you'll see. </p>\n",
