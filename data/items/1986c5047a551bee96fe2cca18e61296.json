Jay is on Twitter at @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JayCostTWS/\">JayCostTWS</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Jay’s Music Pick: The Black Crowes</strong></p>\n<p>They’ve been called the “The Most Rock ‘n’ Roll Rock ‘n’ Roll Band in the World,” and The Black Crowes did their best to live up to the title. Success, label fights, lineup changes, warring brothers, drugs, break-ups, hiatuses, triumphant returns, epic live shows, and unreleased albums. Heck, these guys had their “Behind the Music” on VH1 before some band members had turned 30. Through it all, The Black Crowes turned out some of the best music of the 1990s. We cover it all on this episode, from the initial platinum-selling albums to the unreleased gem, THE BAND, and two extremely well-received albums reunion albums in the 00s. Both Scot and Jay count the Crowes as their favorite band of all-time and bring the passion and knowledge to this episode. They weren’t just Rolling Stones rip-offs; The Black Crowes paved their own road in their career and didn’t care who stood in the way.</p>\n",
