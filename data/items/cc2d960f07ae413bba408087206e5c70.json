  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden is not only stupid, but he is dangerous. The U.S is considering a deal that will allow Iran to sell Russia any leftover enriched uranium after they build a nuclear weapon. Then, Ukraine is still holding its own and holding back the Russians. Despite being wrong on all foreign policy decisions in some form or another, Joe Biden will claim victory for what is occurring in Ukraine just as he claimed victory over the Wuhan virus. Later, Americans need to be prepared for the unprovoked escalations that will inevitably occur as a result of the genocidal psych that is Putin. This is not Afghanistan, Iraq, or Libya; we can plainly see what Putin is doing and he's spelled it out in his 5,000-word essay. Russia's alliances with China and Iran are real and their enmity with the U.S is just as real. Afterward, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk calls in to discuss his disappointment in Gen. Milley's and Sec. Austin's ability to adequately respond to Putin's aggression. Kirk also mentioned his recent suspension from Twitter for a post mentioning Asst Sec of Health Rachel Levine's birth name.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
