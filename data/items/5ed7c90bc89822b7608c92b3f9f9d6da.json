  "description": "IN THIS EPISODE:\nThe Blended Family: How to Create Strong and Lasting Step-Family Relationships\nShow Notes\nThis episode breaks it down by debunking the most popular myths and giving specific do’s and don’ts to help you create secure long-lasting families no matter their origin.\nBlended Family Myths\nWicked stepmothers and red-headed step children – our psyche with the help of Disney often portrays step-families through a suspicious lens. However, only 23% of families are made up of two heterosexual biological parents in their first marriage. So called “weird” families such as blended, same-sex parents, adoption and foster, grandparents parenting, polyamorous and so on are the new normal. Adults living with biologically unrelated children have unique challenges, and in this episode we focus specifically on blended families. Dr. Ann Kelley and Sue Marriott discuss common myths as well as tips toward achieving a healthy blended family bond. We unpack the tensions that often emerge as two cultures come together and deliver practical solutions for how to avoid pitfalls and build a foundation that helps the process of reconstituting a new gaggle go smoother. Also, gender and developmental differences are discussed –\n\nyou may be surprised that sons and daughters respond differently. Finally same-sex headed families are also discussed, the unique strethgs and challenges within these families. Hey glbtq – headed parents out there – don’t worry we totally have your back. We\n\nare all about it and are working on an entire episode on the beautiful and unique gifts of glbtq families coming to your podcast player soon.\nTimeline\n0:50 – Intro\n\n2:27–Blended family\n\n3:52–Myth 1 of Blended Families: Stepfamilies are not as healthy as “real” families.\n\n5:50–Why children struggle more than those in first-marriage, intact families andhow to prevent it\n\n7:26–Effect of divorce on children–socio-economic drop and severe change of\n\nroutine should be prevented\n\n8:34–Whatever you do, don’t mess with the mind of the child in how they see theother parent (ie.alter the child’s internalized image of the other parent).\n\n9:50–Myth 2 of Blended Families: Stepfamilies break up more often and that is a bad thing\n\n13:36–Myth 3 of Blended Families: Children who come from divorced and thenblended families will likely struggle in life.
