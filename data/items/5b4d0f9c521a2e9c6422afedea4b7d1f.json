    "media:description": "Van Halen’s David Lee Roth once said: “Rock critics love Elvis Costello because rock critics look like Elvis Costello.” When he first appeared on Top of the Pops in September 1977, beyond Buddy Holly and Hank Marvin, there had been few rock stars with the nerd aesthetics of Elvis Costello. Though much too musically competent to be truly punk, he possessed a tongue bathed in acid and a remarkable ability to turn a phrase. But while this Angry Young Man persona made him a star, it would also destroy him. This is New British Canon and this is the story of “Radio Radio.”\n\n#ElvisCostello #SNL #MusicDocumentary\n\nFact-checking by Serenity Autumn.\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Citrine (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nJesse Gallagher - The Golden Present\nLuar - Anchor (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:47 \"They Say I Got No Respect:\" Elvis Steals From the King\n06:16 ...And The Attractions: Elvis Gets Arrested\n10:20 \"Radio is a Sound Salvation:\" Elvis Bites that Hand\n15:33 \"Better Do As You Are Told:\" Elvis Punks SNL\n19:41 \"Get Happy:\" The End of Bitterness\n\nYou can also follow me here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrashTheory\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TrashTheoryYT\n\nOr support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TrashTheory",
