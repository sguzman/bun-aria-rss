  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Mr. Call Screener and ‘This Is America’ podcast host, Rich Valdes fills in for Mark Levin. Democrats are driven by power and hate, and if you dare question their agenda you are the enemy. If you don't like the idea of your kids being bombarded with race, gender, sex, and other indoctrinations, you are the enemy. People need to know what's right and wrong, instead of coddling and allowing for the same mistakes to be made. They are motivated by hate, and whatever it is they hate they want to destroy and rebuild in their image. If you want to save America by destroying it and our capitalist system, you want to destroy America as we know it. It's time for all of us to be tough and tackle this evil agenda and stop it now before we lose the future. Also, children in leftward lurching cities are subjected to teachers with wild ideas like being a gender-fluid pagan witch. Ideological subversion is how to divide us and get us to turn on each other and on America. The push to sexualize children is not acceptable, and we have the right to protect our kids. Forcing sex-ed on 5-year-olds without parental consent is abuse. Later, why do we ignore gangs and organized crime like MS-13 and biker gangs? \nLearn more about your ad choices.
