  "description": "<p>From August 23, 2014: News broke yesterday that the Russian military has moved artillery units inside of Ukraine and that Russian troops&nbsp;are&nbsp;actively using them against Ukranian forces---a move with dramatic escalatory&nbsp;potential. At the same time, Ukraine appears to be closing in on the last Russian-backed rebel strongholds. As the crisis unfolds and the United States seeks to isolate Russia using a network of sanctions, important questions have arisen&nbsp;about Russia's future role in the region and its relationship with the West. What is Russian President Vladimir Putin's&nbsp;ultimate goal? Why, after so much effort to integrate into the global economy, is Putin choosing another path? Is Russia actually attempting to free itself of the Western dominated world order?</p><p>Earlier this week, the Brookings Institution hosted a panel discussion on the future of&nbsp;Russia’s place in the international order in the light of recent more aggressive turns in its foreign policy.&nbsp;Thomas Wright, fellow with the Project on International Order and Strategy (IOS), moderated the conversation with Brookings President Strobe Talbott, Senior Fellow Clifford Gaddy of Brookings’s Center on the United States and Europe (CUSE) and Susan Glasser, editor at Politico Magazine. They describe&nbsp;Putin's worldview and subsequent strategy, and lay out the potential consequences of continued tensions&nbsp;for&nbsp;the global economy, coordinated counter-terrorism efforts, and the increasingly stressed non-proliferation regime.</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
