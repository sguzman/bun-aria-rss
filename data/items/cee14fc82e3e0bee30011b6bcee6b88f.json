Yeats.\n\n‘It’s just stuck with me, in a good friend way…it’s got this negative vision but this beautiful frame that can’t seem to support that, which is I guess is why I go back to it.’\n\nDominic visited The Poetry Exchange at St Chad’s College Chapel, as part of Durham Book Festival in October 2015.

B. Yeats\n\nTurning and turning in the widening gyre   \nThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;\nThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\nMere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\nThe blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   \nThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;\nThe best lack all conviction, while the worst   \nAre full of passionate intensity.\n\nSurely some revelation is at hand;\nSurely the Second Coming is at hand.   \nThe Second Coming! Hardly are those words out   \nWhen a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi\nTroubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert   \nA shape with lion body and the head of a man,   \nA gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   \nIs moving its slow thighs, while all about it   \nReel shadows of the indignant desert birds.   \nThe darkness drops again; but now I know   \nThat twenty centuries of stony sleep\nWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   \nAnd what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   \nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\n\nSource: The Collected Poems of W. B. Yeats (1989)",
