  "description": "Another day, another podcast as we celebrate the return of that gold colour to Australia and the return of the bronze colour to Canada! Jarrod talks down Mo Farah falling and winning while Colin jumps in for a brief appearance and talks it up (go figure). We talk more about pulling a Campbell and decide to declare the opposite as 'pulling an Anna'. While we also get too excited for the prospect of the start of synchronized swimming and discover how amazing Finland is at weightlifting.",
