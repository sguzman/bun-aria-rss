  "description": "<p>If you have a family that is overflowing with talent then you need to have a vision for the journey so the spirits can come together and be a business. That's a quote. Sort of. Listen to how the Will and Jada Smith's run their household. Be sure to have a bucket nearby - you might get sick. Some actors are also too talented for their own good, like Jared Leto or a pile of horse sh*t. Egos of this magnitude are fascinating. Ladies, if it's that time of the month, don't be selfish. Offer your \"other\" entry so that a man doesn't suffer just because you're \"bleeding.\" Theo talks smack to Tina and a whole lot more! Jeans Forever!</p>\n",
