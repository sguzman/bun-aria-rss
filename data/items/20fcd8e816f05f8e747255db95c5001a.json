  "description": "<p>\"If you don’t try hard enough at something, people could knock you down for it.”<br />\nI recently had a friend tell me I needed to do an interview with someone special. I’m always hesitant on suggestions, but my friend has done thousands of interviews and he said in his top five was Danica Patrick.<br />\nI felt I had to give her a shot and I’m so glad I did. She and I are on the same wavelength. We’re both into sports, consider ourselves to be spiritual people, and believe so much in the power of the mind.<br />\nDanica has a strong presence you can feel the moment she walks into the room and yet she is still one of the sweetest and most thought-provoking people I’ve met. She’s had so many insightful things to say.<br />\nFor those of you who don’t know her, Danica Patrick dropped out of high school to pursue a career as a race car driver. In 2005, Patrick became the first woman to hold the lead during the Indianapolis 500.<br />\nOnly three years later, she was the first woman to record a win on the IndyCar circuit. After switching to stock cars, Patrick won the time trials at the 2013 Daytona 500 - becoming the first woman to win the pole position at NASCAR.<br />\nPatrick has become one of the most recognizable athletes in the to world, having graced the cover of ESPN: The Magazine and TV Guide. She was also featured in the 2008 and 2009 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. She has appeared in 14 Super Bowl commercials (more than any other celebrity).<br />\nShe’s not only an amazing figure in the world of sports, but she’s also a great author and mentor. She’s just released her newest book, Pretty Intense, that brings light to living health from mind, to body, to diet.<br />\nDiscover all of that and much more, on Episode 592.<br />\nSome Questions I ask:<br />\nHow she feels on the paleo diet (11:49)<br />\nYou’ve become more about spirituality lately, right? (15:26)<br />\nWhat’s the biggest take away since you started going down that rabbit hole? (22:22)<br />\nHow did you arm yourself against criticism throughout your career? (25:22)<br />\nWhat is the biggest challenge you’ve had to overcome? (26:44)<br />\nDo you feel like people attack you in the races? (29:11)<br />\nHow do you handle your ego? (31:15)<br />\nWhat’s the question you’ve never been able to answer for yourself? (38:37)<br />\nHow do you condition yourself before practice or a big competition?<br />\nWhat’s the greatest moment for you in the last 20 years [in terms of racing] (47:25)<br />\nHow do you condition yourself to believe in yourself? (48:27)<br />\nWhat’s the greatest lesson your father taught you? (50:48)<br />\nIf you could give yourself advice when you started, what would it be? (52:38)<br />\nWhat are 3  things you want to manifest this year? (55:00)<br />\nOn this episode you will learn:<br />\nThe things Danica and I have in common (9:10)<br />\nWhen she started lifting heavier (13:48)<br />\nWhy she started getting into spirituality and healing with the mind (20:39)<br />\nHow she conditions her mind against the intense pressure of competing (23:34)<br />\nHow she gets people to believe in her (27:25)<br />\nBattles she’s had with her ego throughout the last 20 years (30:05)?<br />\nWhat she would do if she could do anything in the world (36:34)<br />\nWhat she’s revealed about herself last year she hadn’t revealed before (41:51)<br />\nHow long races are (46:23)<br />\nThe message she gives to women who aren’t as confident in themselves (47:56)<br />\nWho inspired her the most growing up (50:18)<br />\nThe greatest lesson her mom taught her (51:08)<br />\nWhat she has to open up about during the year of open (54:16)<br />\nPlus much more...</p>\n",
