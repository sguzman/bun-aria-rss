If you're still reading this and didn't immediately throw your computer/mobile devise out the window of a moving car, boy do we have a special episode in store for you. Connor is away this week having lots of fun, so Dan hunkers down for a in-depth episode all about the moral concept of duty. We're talking Kant, we're talking Nietzsche, and we're talking the Flintstones of course. The episode is a bit shorter and a bit lighter on the laughs, but that content is good baby. Enjoy</strong>!</p>",
