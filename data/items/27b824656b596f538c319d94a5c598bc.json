  "description": "<p>Pretty much everyone we know would love to have more hours in their day- more time to spend with friends and family, more time to read or exercise (or any time), or even some extra hours to work on that side hustle you’ve been thinking about. We are really excited to have time management expert Laura Vanderkam on the podcast as she helps people spend more time on what matters, and less on what doesn’t. We discuss her latest book, Juliet’s School of Possibilities where she says that “Expectations are infinite, time is finite, you are always choosing, choose well.” In this conversation we dive into ways to be more efficient at work, how we should be thinking about our time at home while we’re ‘off the clock’, and some tips on how we can better manage distractions.</p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed an Infinity Bloom by Newgrass Brewing Co. which you can find on Untappd. A big thanks to Mano and Pop (Matt’s in-laws) for donating this beer to the show!
