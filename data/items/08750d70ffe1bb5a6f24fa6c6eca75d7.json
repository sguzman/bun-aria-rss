  "description": "<p>Chris Ailman, CIO of CalSTRS, says we'll see a split in market research and when it's valuable, people should be willing to pay for it. OPEC's power is diminishing but it still has the power to jawbone the price of oil, Bloomberg Intelligence's Mike McGlone says. Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, says his party needs to refocus on what the Democratic party has always stood for: the chance for everybody to have a good job and decent future. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius says more competition is the best rate restrictor in health care. Finally, Joel L. Fleishman, a professor at Duke University, talks about his book \"Putting Wealth to Work: Philanthropy for Today or Investing for Tomorrow?\" and says the most interesting things in life are the ones that can't be measured. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
