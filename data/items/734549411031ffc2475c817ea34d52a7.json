Humans now, in general, live twice as long as our ancestors, thanks to environmental changes and advances in medicine. But most of us spend the last years of our lives without the quality of life we really want. We’ve come to identify a slew of symptoms and chronic diseases as a natural part of aging, but do they really have to be?</p><br><p>Today I’m excited to talk to Dr. George Church all about the latest science on reprogramming our genes to extend our healthspan and lifespan. Dr. George Church is a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, a founding member of the Wyss Institute, and director of PersonalGenomes.org, the world’s only open-access information on human genomic, environmental, and trait data. Dr. Church is known for pioneering the fields of personal genomics and synthetic biology. He developed the first methods for the first genome sequence and his team invented CRISPR for human stem cell genome editing and other synthetic biology technologies and applications—including new ways to create organs for transplantation, gene therapies for aging reversal, and gene drives to eliminate Lyme disease and malaria.
