  "description": "<p>Psycho fever overtakes America, and Alfred Hitchcock is suddenly a very rich man. And with this stunning success comes one haunting fear: What will I do for an encore? That question plagues Hitchcock for the rest of his career, through only six more films, a humiliating defeat at the Academy Awards, the specter of young directors vaulting past the old master, and a final appearance to accept a life achievement award that’s too little and too late. Meanwhile, critical admiration for Psycho grows, and the film’s legacy spawns sequels and remakes and a web of pop culture signposts, even today.
