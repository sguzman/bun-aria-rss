They recap some golf/spy/olympics/inexplicable-it-couple/second chance romance that has really hilarious ideas about brand sponsorships involving communist dictatorships. Plus, a truly douchecanoe hero. Come have fun with them! \n Bonus Content: Cole is here!, that time Alisha Rai said she knows who he is, eating messy sandwiches in a bathtub and then boning in that greasy bathwater and then coming like a freight train (and other misinformation that maligns Melody's character), and so much more!\n Lady Loves: \n Cole: Don't call your romantic partner \"Pud,\" see NOBODY (the movie with Bob Odenkirk), and wow Butcher Box is good! Get you some Butcher Box! \n Erin: Stop thinking you have to do things the hard way out of a sense of identity or pride, just get the gadget! Whether it's a snow blower or instant pot, it will make your life instantly better.
