  "description": "Retail Pricing Wars! Does MSRP really mean anything? How do stores price their products relative to their size, customer base, and geographic location? We’re joined by Ed Bley of  Cork N Bottle and Angelo Ingrati of Peppino's Liquors & Wine to discuss both sides of the story. Read Show Notes Below.\nShow Notes:\n\nWhat’s your reason on why your stores can sell above MSRP?\n\nWhy would any store NOT sell at secondary pricing?\n\nHow does geography play a role into this with Kentucky vs NYC?\n\nIs Buffalo Trace or the distillery the real culprits of the problem?\n\nDon’t most liquor stores make their money on volume rather than limited releases? So how do you keep your customers happy after this bubble bursts?\n\nSmall mom & pop shops are losing allocation and reps are favoring big box stores, do you see this as a problem on the distributer side?\n\nDo store owners get tired of hearing “Do you have any X?”\n\nWhat do you think is the effect of square footage of your retail space? What are their advantages?\n\nHow do you buy enough fireball to get any limited release bourbon?\n\nAre everyday items priced higher in NYC like Maker’s Mark?\n\nBy raising the retail price, then do you feel like you are cutting out the distributor and the distillery of their fair share?",
