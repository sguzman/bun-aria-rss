  "description": "<p>Mormonism. BIG topic today! Oh my HECK! We talk today about the history of Mormonism - a religion born in America. We'll go over the life of its founder Joseph Smith and investigate his claims of revelations. We'll look into the beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. We go over the church's polygamist past and also examine how polygamy continues in fundamentalist derivatives of Mormonism, such as the FLDS, lead by imprisoned pedophile, Warren Jeffs.
