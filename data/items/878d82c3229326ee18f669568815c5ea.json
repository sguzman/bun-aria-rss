  "description": "Andrew Horowitz, founder of Horowitz & Company and The Disciplined Investor, talks about the negative implications of bailing out Greece, why taxing offshore assets will never happen, and why it's time to buy select oil stocks.  Andrew also shares his favorite stocks to buy and one popular company he's looking to short. \n \nFrank then shows you how to buy stocks like Netflix, Apple and Celgene early in their growth phase.  These stocks traded at expensive valuations 10-years ago. That's why most value investors ignored them.  Today, these companies are industry leaders.  They also provided early investors with life-changing returns. \n \nIn this classic educational segment, Frank will show you how identify the next industry leaders.  These methods include ignoring classic valuation metrics like price-to-sales, book value and price-to-earnings. ",
