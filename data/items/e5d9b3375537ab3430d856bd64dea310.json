  "description": "<p>Artificial spin ices (ASIs) are designable arrays of interacting nanomagnets\nthat span a wide range of magnetic phases associated with a number of spin\nlattice models. Here, we demonstrate that the phase of an artificial kagome\nspin ice can be determined from its initial magnetization curve. As a proof of\nconcept, micromagnetic simulations of these curves were performed starting from\nrepresentative microstates of different phases of the system. We show that the\ncurves are characterized by phase-specific features in such a way that a\npattern recognition algorithm predicts the phase of the initial microstate with\ngood reliability. This achievement represents a new strategy to identify phases\nin ASIs, easier and more accessible than magnetic imaging techniques normally\nused for this task.\n</p>",
