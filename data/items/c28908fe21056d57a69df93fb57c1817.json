  "description": "<p>We speak with a local on an Indian reservation who talks about several encounters her and her family have had while growing up on the reservation. The witness also talks about some possible cover-ups going on with the people's encounters. The witnesses' brother is a police officer on the reservation and she tells us that he was called out to a home that a Sasquatch was attacking and as he pulled up he was able to get the creature on his patrol car's dashcam.....what happen next is very strange.</p> <p>We welcome the Rocky Mountain Sasquatch Organization who gives us an update on Sasquatch encounters from an old ghost town, Deadwood.</p> <p>We will also be discussing government cover-up stories that are directly related to Sasquatch encounters.</p>",
