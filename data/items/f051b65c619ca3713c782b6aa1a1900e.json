  "title": "What Matters Most? A Conversation About Time, Priorities & Organisation [142]",
  "description": "<p>This week, we're talking time, priorities and organisation. But this isn't a \"10 quick tips to organise your life\" - this is a deep dive into the real truths behind the ways we spend our time. We discuss the importance of knowing your 'why' when you make decisions about your time. We debate the role of identity in those decisions, and we discuss some of the challenges we face in our own art lives. Each of us only have limited bandwidth which means we simply have to make decisions. So, above all, we urge honest self-reflection ... it's so important to understand what we want out of art art lives and where we are straying from that path. If you struggle with time management, you are not alone and we hope this discussion helps you find some clarity about your own priorities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Kelly Wynne Conrad <a href=\"\">https://www.kelleewynnestudios.com/</a></p>\n<p>The Dresser with Julian Clary and Matthew Kelly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/sep/16/the-dresser-review-bath-matthew-kelly-julian-clary\">https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/sep/16/the-dresser-review-bath-matthew-kelly-julian-clary</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
