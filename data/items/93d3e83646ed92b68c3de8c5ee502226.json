  "title": "Ep 142 | This SCOTUS Case Will Decide if America Is Still a Free Country | Coach Joe Kennedy | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Coach Joe Kennedy has had a heck of a life. From the start, all the odds were against him. His adopted parents abandoned him when he was a boy, and he had to fend for himself. After high school, he joined the military, and for his 20-year career in the Marine Corps he was practically an atheist. Then he returned home and became a high school football coach, and everything changed. He became a believer. One night, he put on a movie, \"Facing the Giants,\" which includes a coach who prays on the 50-yard line. He made a covenant with God to pray after every game. It cost him his job. Now, he’s facing the Supreme Court to defend his right to quietly pray in public after football games. He just wants his job back and his faith protected. But the outcome of the case will affect the First Amendment rights of teachers and coaches all across America, and it will answer an important question: Is America still a free country?\n \nThis Week’s Sponsors:\n\n﻿Cooking and grilling at home used to be the way to save money, but with prices up nearly 20%, even that seems like a thing of the past.
