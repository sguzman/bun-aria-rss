  "description": "Oklahoma lost to an Iowa State with several time travelers from before the age of television on the roster. Miami beat FSU team but it means nothing because, according to Seminole fans, Florida State isn't actually any good. Bret Bielema's still adjusting to his first fifth season at Arkansas but surely things will improve. And, oh, right, we're all freaking out about Jim Harbaugh and Michigan. Though at least they don't have to play at 1:45 AM Eastern, unlike Washington.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
