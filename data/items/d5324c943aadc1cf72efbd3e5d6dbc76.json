  "description": "Bill loves to break chops, but as you will see, he is actually one of the nicest guys Pete knows and was someone who was incredibly helpful to Pete in the early stages of his standup career. So, like most episodes, Pete does his best to recreate helpful, funny and wonderful conversations they've had to share with weirdos everywhere. Oh, and the funniest anti-marriage rant that's ever been recorded. So... look forward to that!",
