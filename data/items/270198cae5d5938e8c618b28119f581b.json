  "description": "We talk about private barrel selections being the new unicorns on this show all the time. But it begs the question, are we seeing so many private picks that the market is oversaturated? It seems like every week there is a new barrel in our city for sale, FOMO about some sweet sticker, or the secondary market has a crazy valuation on a normal single barrel selection. We examine all the components that go into getting single barrels such as the amount of influence from distributor reps, the amount of available barrels at the distilleries, and if you would buy from a big chain vs a small independent store. Will there ever be enough bourbon to go around and not over bloat the market? We’ll find out.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about Portugal.\n\nWhat got you into to buying private barrel picks?\n\nWhat's the landscape of private picks in DC?\n\nWith the increase in stores wanting private picks, are some stores going to get shut out of the program?\n\nDo you think distilleries should be taking care of the bigger accounts over the smaller stores that started doing picks earlier?\n\nIs there a bias towards certain states?\n\nWould you want to buy a private barrel pick from a big box liquor store?\n\nDoes the local sales rep make a difference?\n\nWhat about restaurant picks?\n\nDo you think distilleries are running out of barrels for their private barrel programs?\n\nIs the market flooded with private selections?\n\nWhat could distilleries do to give one store an advantage over another?\n\nLet's discuss stickers. Do they influence your purchase?\n\nShould stores slow down barrel picks?\n\nWhy are some people spending so much for private picks on the secondary market?",
