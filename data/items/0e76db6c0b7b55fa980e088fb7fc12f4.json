Pat gives Goose the opportunity to defend himself after this attack on The Brand, gathers all the facts and information presented, and makes a final ruling, and catches up with his former teammate in a hilarious conversation (13:05-26:58). Later, the guys join Pat to cover everything that happened this week in the NFL including Connor's trip to Miami to watch the Miami Miracle live in person, Digs and Nick potentially throwing in the towel on the Steelers' season after their heartbreaking loss at Oakland, Baker Mayfield continuing to shine, they chat about the Bears vs. Rams Sunday Night Football game, Patrick Mahomes throwing no look passes, Pat breaks down how a fake punt would work when he played for the Colts, and Pat also covers his weekend going back and forth between Pittsburgh and New York. It's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
