  "title": "PMS 2.0 065 - \"Deflategate Was The Worst, D'Qwell Jackson, Live From A Batcave\"",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys record the show live from his backyard in what feels like an Indiana summer night. They discuss the NFL schedule release and highlight a couple of different games that they are looking forward to, including Packers vs. Bears to open the season on Thursday night, Steelers vs. Patriots on the first Sunday night, and a couple of the Thursday night and Monday night games that look to be good matchups. They squeeze in a little hockey talk as Pat has to respond to the city of Pittsburgh after the Pens got swept by the Islanders. They also discuss Russell Wilson's new contract, and whether or not any of his teammates in the locker room actually like him. They also discuss movie biopics, and how Pat see's the movie about his life unfolding. Also joining the show is 11 year NFL veteran, Pro Bowler, and the man who started the entire Deflategate situation by intercepting a Tom Brady pass, D'Qwell Jackson. He and Pat talk about their relationship as teammates, his video for The Uninterrupted about how all he wants is his playoff interception from the Deflategate game to be returned to him, and what he's been doing to enjoy his retirement thus far. (4:15-18:44) To close out the show, Zito makes a triumphant return trying to read and ad, and the guys each give their favorite summer banger to give you something to chew on heading into the weekend. It's a fun show, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
