  "description": "In today's podcast, North Korea still seems to be leaving American IoT networks more-or-less alone, for now, however actively they're hacking elsewhere. Everything old is new again, at least with Russian EW. Cryptocurrency crime is a worry everywhere. A look at law firm hacks shows the counselors could use the help of some street-savvy hotel detectives more than a tech-savvy perimeter security solution, although that wouldn't be bad, either. Beware of letting World Cup Wi-FI be an own-goal. Apple's latest updates seem privacy friendly. Thoughts on AI, and the polygraphing of a time traveler that sounds totally legit. David Dufour from Webroot on new roles for security, and how that impacts hiring and education. Guest is John Dickson from Denim Group on securing voting infrastructure.",
