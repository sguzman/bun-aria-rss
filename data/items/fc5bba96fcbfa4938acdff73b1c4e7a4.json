  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">The Holy Post crew discusses the new Netflix documentary, “The Social Dilemma,” about the way social media is contributing to the breakdown of society and how Facebook’s algorithms make reasonable people into extremists. Also this week, Skye and Josh Lindsay—his co-host on The Movie Proposal podcast—interview actor and screenwriter, Luke Barnett, about his new comedy “Faith Based.” Barnett explains how his long experience in the church informed the project, why Christian movies follow such a predictable formula, and how tribal identity rather than quality is what makes movies successful today.
