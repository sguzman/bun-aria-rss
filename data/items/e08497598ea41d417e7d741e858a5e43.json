On the enterprise side of matters, one of the longest-awaited updates was the shipment status of NVIDIA&rsquo;s H100 &ldquo;Hopper&rdquo; accelerator, which at introduction was slated to land in Q3 of this year. As it turns out, with Q3 already nearly over H100 is not going to make its Q3 availability date. But, according to NVIDIA the accelerator is in full production, and the first systems will be shipping from OEMs in October.</p>\n</p>",
