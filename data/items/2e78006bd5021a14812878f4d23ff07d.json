  "description": "<p>Episode 275 - Special Episode alert! I wanted to throw some different types of shows in the feed and I love me some Buried Treasure discussions with trusted friends. This week I bring on one of my best friends, Joey Cahill from 6131 Records to discuss early 2000’s hardcore. We focused on bands that could be loosely defined as “traditional” hardcore and not specifically metal core that was so pervasive at that time. Listen in and hopefully you will find a gem or two that you haven’t listened to for awhile or even know about in the first place!
