He told me the remarkable story of Henrietta Wood.&nbsp;Born into slavery in Kentucky, she was freed as an adult and worked as domestic worker.

At the end of the Civil War, Wood was freed for the second time, where she sued her kidnapper for $20,000. Although she only received $2,500 (more than $60,000 today) it allowed her son, Arthur H.
