  "description": "<p>The European Union has some of the same problems we do: damaging climate change, a flood of immigrants, and a population frequently in disagreement.  But while America argues vaccines and pounces on Hamilton’s uber-inclusive Lin-Manuel Miranda for not being inclusive enough, the EU President Ursula von der Leyden created the New European Bauhaus High-Level Round Table.  Nice.  These valiant design knights of the design realm include Bjarke Ingels, Shiguru Ban, Francesca Bria, and today’s guest Michela Magas, a designer and innovation specialist based in Sweden. Later on, delightful jazz with musical guest Monika Ryan.</p>",
