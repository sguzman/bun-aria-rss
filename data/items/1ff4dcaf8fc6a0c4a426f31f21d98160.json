It's a car show that celebrates the best and worst of the 80s and 90s; the cars, the fashion, the music. People show up in GT-Rs or Lebaron's, wearing mullet wigs, Addidas, neon, and more. It's a car show with a sense of humor. Rick, Art, and Lane are (some of) the creators of this wonderful madness. </p><p>Check out Radwood's site for event info and redgistration: https://www.radwood.co/</p><p>This show is availableon YouTube: https://youtu.be/JOLpicfHqwQ</p><p>Follow us!</p><p>T: @thesmokingtire @zackklapman </p><p>IG: @thesmokingtire @fakezackklapman </p><p> </p><p>Check out our merch!</p><p>https://teespring.com/stores/thesmokingtire?page=1</p>\n",
