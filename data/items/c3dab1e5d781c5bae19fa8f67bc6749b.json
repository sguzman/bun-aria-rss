Created with Russian friend and food writer Alissa Timoshkina, #CookForUkraine encourages people to post and share Ukrainian recipes and celebrate the comfort of food during this difficult time. On the podcast, Olia tells Olivia Potts about the personal cost of the war on her and her family, how she grappled with guilt when cooking at the start of the war, and the ways we can offer support to the besieged cities in Ukraine.<br>\n<br>\nFor more information about Olia, visit her Patreon account <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/OliaHercules\">here</a>.</div>\n",
