Today on the show, Daniel first offers an overview of the nature, function, and study of the unconscious. From there we discuss Carl Jung's perspective on the unconscious, and his ideas around its archetypes and shadows. We then get into the way that things which are connected to magic and the supernatural, like fairy tales and tarot cards, can be seen as manifestations of the energy of the unconscious and as age-old attempts to confront and understand it. We end our discussion by talking about the quest for individuation, which requires bringing together the conscious and unconscious minds, and how to go about tapping into the power of the unconscious to become a kind of magician yourself.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Episode</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/podcast-429-taking-control-of-the-brain-chemical-that-drives-excitement-motivation-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel's previous appearance on the show: Episode #429 — Taking Control of the Brain Chemical That Drives Excitement, Motivation, and More</a></li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3TSQ7Dz\" target=\"_blank\"><i>King, Warrior, Magician, Lover: Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine</i> by Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/the-four-archetypes-of-the-mature-masculine-the-king/\" target=\"_blank\">AoM's series on the king, warrior, magician, and lover archetypes </a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-598-journeying-from-the-first-to-the-second-half-of-life/\" target=\"_blank\">AoM Podcast #598: Journeying From the First to the Second Half of Life</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/podcast-335-using-power-myths-live-flourishing-life/\" target=\"_blank\">AoM Podcast #335: Exploring Archetypes With Jordan B.
