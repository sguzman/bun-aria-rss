  "description": "Recessions often have detrimental effects on both employment and equity returns, forcing\nindividuals to make decisions about how to balance risks to their labor and capital income.\nIn this paper, we study how individuals allocate their limited attention between capital income and labor income risks in a two-period consumption-saving model with recursive utility.\nSpecifically, we examine how the optimal attention and consumption-saving decisions are influenced by individuals’ attention capacity, wealth endowments, income risks, and preferences\nfor risk and time. We show that our model can generate results that are consistent with several novel facts regarding how differences in individuals’ wealth levels and beliefs about their\nunemployment risks influenced their consumption during the Great Recession. Furthermore,\nwe find that the welfare loss due to limited attention is significantly larger for households with\nlower wealth; allowing these households to flexibly allocate their attention can significantly\nreduce this welfare loss.",
