  "title": "Ep 94 | How the Left Handed Black People 'Smallpox in a Blanket' | Jason Whitlock | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Over the last three decades, veteran sports journalist Jason Whitlock has worked his way up from local newsrooms to major networks at Fox Sports and ESPN. He’s become one of the most respected — and one of the most hated — sports journalists in the country, especially for his opinions on race. In this episode, Jason and Glenn discuss how the Left uses sports to divide America, Big Tech, China, Nike’s hypocrisy, how LBJ's policies ruined black America, and why President Obama disappointed him. He tells Glenn how a new generation of woke activists have tried to undo his accomplishments and reacts to Deadspin calling him “the racist right’s unwitting attack dog.” While his habit of \"wrongspeak\" has landed him in trouble throughout his career, Jason says he just loves Jesus, America, and football — in that order.\n\nToday's Sponsor\n\nBuilt Bar is better tasting than your favorite candy bar.
