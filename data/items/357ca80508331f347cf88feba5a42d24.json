  "description": "<p>I love my parents. I grew up with a world-class education. And yet, nobody actually ever taught me how to be an adult.</p><p>As a result, I made a ton of avoidable mistakes. I suffered far more than necessary. And I fumbled in the dark for years until eventually, I figured a few things out. Unfortunately, my experience is all too common.</p><p>Today’s guest—a woman who spent years mentoring and advising some of the brightest young people in the entire world—would agree, so she decided to do something about it.</p><p><strong>Julie Lythcott-Haims</strong>&nbsp;is the former dean of freshmen and undergraduate advising at Stanford University, where she earned her B.A. (as my classmate) before obtaining a law degree from Harvard and a master’s in fine arts and writing from California College of the Arts.</p><p>Today Julie is an author and authority on what we now call—in Millenial parlance—<em>adulting</em>. Her TED Talk&nbsp;'How to raise successful kids without over-parenting' has over 5 million views, and her books include the New York Times bestseller,&nbsp;How To Raise An Adult&nbsp;and&nbsp;Real American—a memoir centered on coming to terms with her racial identity.</p><p>Julie’s latest work and the focus of today’s conversation is&nbsp;Your Turn: How To Be An Adult. For those just emerging into the grown-up world, it’s a must-read life handbook. For parents, it’s a must-gift for your young ones entering their adult phase of life. All in all, it’s a guide I very much wish existed during my formative years.</p><p>This conversation is packed with practical insights for both parents and young people alike. We cover the downfalls of being a helicopter parent, the importance of learning conversation skills, and why paying attention to what you like and don’t like is more important than finding a purpose.</p><p>But more than anything, this conversation is about why diversity and inclusivity are vital in parenting, educating, and adulting.</p><p>To read more <a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/julie-lythcott-haims-635/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.
