  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, why should President Trump be impeached? Can anyone actually state what the President deserves to be impeached for, is it treason? is it bribery? And whose testimony or what evidence are these opinions based upon? None! Later, the whistleblowers legal team has been searching for a so called whistleblower and vowing to get Trump out of office since January 2017. The legal team of Mark Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, founder and partner of the Compass Rose Legal Group, have even gone as far as offering discounted lawyers for anyone willing to be a whistleblower. Then, election night surprises in Kentucky that the media is quiet about, the first African American elected statewide is not only a republican but a Trump supporter. Nothing surprising in the elections for Mississippi or Virginia. Virginia is now a blue state due to redrawn election lines, not surprising as it has been unraveling over the last 8 years.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
