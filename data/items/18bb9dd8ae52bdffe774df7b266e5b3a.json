  "link": "https://hubermanlab.com/using-cortisol-and-adrenaline-to-boost-our-energy-and-immune-system/",
  "description": "This episode I describe the biology of two essential hormones we all make: cortisol and adrenaline (also called epinephrine). Cortisol and adrenaline powerfully regulate our levels of energy, focus and immune system function. I describe various science-supported tools and practices to increase or decrease cortisol and/or adrenaline, depending on one's specific needs and goals. I also describe the biology of nootropics, and how cortisol and adrenaline can improve or degrade learning. Finally, I review the scientific data and tools for timing the release of these hormones to improve memory, energy and immune system function.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:05:41) Energy & Your Immune System, & Learning Faster\n(00:08:34) Why & How Intermittent Fasting Increases Growth Hormone\n(00:11:56) Why Your Stomach Growls\n(00:13:09) Hot Baths & Hormones\n(00:14:35) Energy, Adrenaline (Epinephrine), & Cortisol\n(00:15:48) Cortisol & Cholesterol, Competition With Testosterone & Estrogen\n(00:17:54) Adrenaline (Epinephrine) Is Your (Immune Systems) Best Friend\n(00:18:48) Cortisol Basics In Two (Actually 1) Minute/s\n(00:19:48) Adrenaline Basics In Two Minutes\n(00:21:32) Tool: Time Your Cortisol Peak To Waking Using Specific Light Intensities\n(00:27:20) Brief Increases In Cortisol & Adrenaline Boost Energy, Focus & Immunity\n(00:30:04) Ways To Increase Adrenaline, Epinephrine & Cortisol & Why That Is Good\n(00:35:00) Does Mindset During Stress Matter?\n(00:36:15) Protocols: Adrenaline Breathing Described\n(00:39:00) Practices To Increase Energy Without Increasing Stress\n(00:45:00) Using Stressors to ENHANCE Our Immune System: Science & Tools\n(00:55:11) Timing Thyroid Release For Energy\n(00:57:02) Adrenaline/Stress Increase Performance & Memory.
