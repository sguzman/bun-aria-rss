  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease Podcast, we’ll be crossing the streams of sports, rural life, and hunting as we learn about the 1960’s championship Bradleyville Eagles basketball dynasty in Missouri. We’ll talk with author, Leon Combs who wrote the book on them and we’ll meet one of the players – Leon Boyd – the teams ball handling point guard and coonhunter extraordinaire who still hunts and loves basketball to this day. In a world of increasing specialization, we’ll explore if the idea of having diversity can make us better at everything we do – like being a coonhunting basketball player… but it’s a toss up. The drama of this sports story will have you on the edge of the bleacher as you hear the actual broadcast of their 1968 state championship game and we’ll go on a hunt with Leon Boyd. I doubt you’re going to want to miss this one…</p>\n<p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p>\n<p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p>\n<p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
