  "description": "You can now pay for your burritos and tacos with Bitcoin and other digital currencies, which could open up an array of innovations around loyalty and decentralized payment. Flexa has announced that the Mexican fast-casual chain can now accept digital payments through its platform. The option is available at all Chipotle locations in the US, and you can use the option on the Flexa-enabled wallet app, such as Gemini and SPEDN. Just launch up your app, choose Chipotle and show your phone to the cashier.<br /><br />The big question will be the direction of digital payments in the future could we see a leapfrog over the existing platforms like Venmo, Zelle, and others with a new feature for merchant services, data, and more? Its possible that an innovation wave could be brewing in the retail sector and likely that Chipotle has some very secretive plans for the future of blockchain payments.<br /><br />In my book the Chipotle Effect - the concept was the birth of the digital consumer and what that could lead to with brands like Chipotle, I think we have an answer now - and the digital pioneer for the industry, once again appears to be Chipotle. Others will follow fast, and there will be a mass adoption period just like social media in 2007-2010 - but the killer app is still early to identify, rest assured it's coming very fast!",
