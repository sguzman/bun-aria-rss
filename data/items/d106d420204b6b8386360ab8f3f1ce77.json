  "description": "You've played the popular NCAA video game series - but did you know there's an obscure, little-played NFL version of the same game? Madden is arguably more of a fantasy RPG, since it allows you to explore impossibilities like \"Florida produces a viable pro quarterback\" or \"the Chiefs win a Super Bowl.\" The History of Fun, made by our friends at Polygon, explores the weird and wild origins of the video game series. We hope you like it, if only because it's not another round of Fullcast horseshit!\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
