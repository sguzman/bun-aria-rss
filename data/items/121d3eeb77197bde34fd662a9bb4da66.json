  "description": "<p>EPISODE 71 - DEDE GARDNER - Co-President Plan B Entertainment</p> <p>Teams Deakins speaks with Plan B co-president, Dede Gardner (IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK, 12 YEARS A SLAVE, MOONLIGHT). We talk about the careful selection by Plan B of the projects they choose and how the company’s goal is to protect the original intention of a film throughout the process. Dede tells us her process in choosing projects to back and that she chose to become a producer because it allowed her to spend the longest time on a project. We talk about the strange world we create when we shoot a movie and how each movie is a situation that doesn’t repeat. She speaks at length on her working relationship with Jeremy Kleiner, Plan B’s other co-president. We also covered the importance of recognizing when you are working on the wrong incarnation of a movie and the need to step back and start again. We also covered the movie Selma, working in television, balancing work and family, how important conviction and passion are and much more! So much information in one episode!!</p>",
