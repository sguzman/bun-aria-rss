  "description": "<p>This week, I'm speaking with Griff Davenport, FAIA, who is the DLR Group's Chief Executive Officer.</p> <p>Griff leads the firm's executive leadership team and collaborates with the senior leadership to craft the firm's business strategy and to progress the evolution of DLR Group design.</p> <p>He's been instrumental in developing and driving the growth of the group's vertical markets and expanding their geographic footprint both nationally and internationally.</p> <p>It was a really fascinating conversation to speak with Griff as his entire career, since 1980, has been solely with the DLR Group. He talks about how his career has evolved, his role in business development, in establishing new offices, such as the one in Minneapolis, and how they have grown, and developed, and specialized in various sectors such as education. Of course, we go deep into the importance of culture, mission, vision, and values in a practice and leadership.</p> <p> </p> <p>► Access your free training at <a href= \"http://SmartPracticeMethod.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">http://SmartPracticeMethod.com/</a></p> <p>► If you want to speak directly to our advisors, book a call at <a style= \"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\" href=\"https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/call\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/call</a></p> <p>► Subscribe to my YouTube Channel for updates:</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture\">https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture</a></p> <p>*******</p> <p>For more free tools and resources for running a profitable, impactful, and fulfilling practice, connect with me on:<br /> Facebook: <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture</a><br />  Instagram: <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/\">https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/</a><br />  Website: <a href= \"https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/\">https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/</a><br />  Twitter: <a href= \"https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch\">https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch</a><br />  Podcast: <a href= \"http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/\">http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/</a><br />  iTunes: <a href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926\"> https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926</a><br />  Android Podcast Feed: <a href= \"http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast\">http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast</a></p> <p>*******</p> <p>Access the FREE Architecture Firm Profit Map video here: <a href=\"http://freearchitectgift.com\">http://freearchitectgift.com</a></p> <p>Download the FREE Architecture Firm Marketing Process Flowchart video here: <a href= \"http://freearchitectgift.com\">http://freearchitectgift.com</a></p> <p>Come to my next live, in-person event: <a href= \"https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live\">https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live</a></p> <p>Carpe Diem!</p>",
