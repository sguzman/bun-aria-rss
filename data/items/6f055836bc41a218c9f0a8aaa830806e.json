  "description": "In a special encore presentation, a look back at the WSJ Future of Everything Festival, the three-day event filled with speakers, panels and demos showing us where the world is going-for better or worse. Lots of Hyperloop, self-driving vehicles, AR and VR, good AI, bad AI... all the AI, really. So now Joanna and David present a few of their favorite moments from the festival: a chat with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, a performance from Imogen Heap and a rousing debate about whether the tools that make us \"more productive\" are actually good for us.",
