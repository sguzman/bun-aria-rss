  "description": "What would you do if you were in the room negotiating a stimulus deal with D.C.’s top brass? Do you know what you’d say? And what you’d lobby for? Mark Cuban does.\nThis week on Morning Brew’s Business Casual podcast, Cuban—owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Shark Tank investor, and media exec—does just that...and explains why perfection is the enemy of progress.\nAs Cuban sees it, the longer lawmakers hem, haw, and split hairs over the appropriate response to COVID-19, the more they hurt American taxpayers. Right now, aching businesses big and small need leadership, but the government can only do so much. Cuban explains…\n\nWhy we have no choice but to make decisions with imperfect information\n\nHow bailouts should be structured to benefit more than just the corporate elite\n\nWhen perspective matters more than profit\n\nAnd because he’s Mark Cuban...he gives plenty of entrepreneurial advice.
