  "description": "<div id=\"block-5ffe3351236e8ab41dbb\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <p>From the rude friend in the neighborhood to the scary show at Grandma’s house, our children will face negative influences. Even more so, their own hearts will lead them to worship the wrong things. So what do we do as moms to train our children in godliness? In this episode, Laura and Emily talk about building a gospel culture within our homes by offering grace, not guilt, to our children. By creating an environment of conversation, repentance, and joy, we can extend the welcoming attitude of Christ towards our children as they learn to live like Jesus. Our children are not the things they see or do, and we have the privilege of teaching them to look towards Jesus, again and again.  </p> </div> </div> <div class=\"row sqs-row\"> <div class=\"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> </div> <div class=\"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1510071562600_24524\" class= \"sqs-block button-block sqs-block-button\" data-block-type=\"53\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_30_1510073179977_460\" class= \"sqs-block-content\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_30_1510073179977_459\" class= \"sqs-block-button-container--center\" style=\"text-align: center;\" data-alignment=\"center\" data-button-size=\"small\"><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"https://risenmotherhood.squarespace.com/show-archive/ep80-help-how-do-i-deal-with-bad-influences#rm-apply\" data-initialized=\"true\">RM APPLY QUESTIONS</a></div> <div class=\"sqs-block-button-container--center\" style= \"text-align: center;\" data-alignment=\"center\" data-button-size= \"small\"> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1510071562600_25954\" class= \"sqs-block button-block sqs-block-button\" data-block-type=\"53\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_30_1510073179977_467\" class= \"sqs-block-content\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_30_1510073179977_466\" class= \"sqs-block-button-container--center\" style=\"text-align: center;\" data-alignment=\"center\" data-button-size=\"small\"><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/transcriptions/ep-80-help-how-do-i-deal-with-bad-influences-transcript\" data-initialized=\"true\">VIEW TRANSCRIPT</a></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1510071562600_31620\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <p><strong>Articles, Resources and Related Content:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/blog/2nrjm7kdqb093i4nd7u7yt26em3r8f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">M</a><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/blog/2nrjm7kdqb093i4nd7u7yt26em3r8f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">othering a Rebellious Heart</a> -
