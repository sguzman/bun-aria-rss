  "description": "<p>Beta decays of mirror nuclei differ in Q-value, but will otherwise proceed\nwith transitions of similar strength. The current status is reviewed: Fermi\ntransitions are all very similar, whereas Gamow-Teller transitions can differ\nin strength by more than a factor two. The main cause of the asymmetries\nappears to be binding energy differences between the mirror systems.\n</p>",
