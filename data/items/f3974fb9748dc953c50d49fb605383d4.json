  "title": "535 - Elia Edward Mollel (Tanzanian Guide)",
  "description": "<p>The folks at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gladiolaadventure.com/\">Gladioloa Adventure</a> in Arusha thought Elia would be a good guide to show us around northern Tanzania for 9 days. They were right. Raised by his Maasai grandfather, Elia has a deep understanding of animal behavior, not only spotting lions, leopards, and cheetahs at a distance, but anticipating where they would move so we could position ourselves and wait for them to wander by. His knowledge of the animals and how best to interact/photograph them, combined with his insights into the geology, cultures, and history of the region enriched our experience more than I can say. Plus, he’s an easy guy to be around.</p><p>Intro music “Brightside of the Sun,” by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\">Basin and Range</a>. “Wassiye,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://habibkoite.com/\">Habib Koité</a>; Outro: “Smoke Alarm,” by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.carsieblanton.com/\">Carsie Blanton</a>.</p><p>Some extra goodies, just for Substack subscribers:</p><p><p>Tangentially Speaking with Chris Ryan is a reader-supported publication.
