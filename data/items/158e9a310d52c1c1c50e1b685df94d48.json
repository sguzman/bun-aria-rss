  "title": "37: What Is Anger Doing For You?",
  "description": "Let me tell you what anger does for me. All these so-called negative emotions - anger, hurt, anxiety, fear - they can conquer you and your dreams, or you can use them TO conquer your dreams. The truth is, so much of what I've built today came from a place of hurt and fear: there would be no Straight Up without the pain of those emotions. I'm not telling you to ignore or downplay these feelings, but part of feeling them is building your emotional intelligence, and channeling those feelings in a way that serves YOU. Let's get into it here on the podcast.\nWhy aren't we texting buddies yet? Hit me up at (817) 242-2719 to get some motivation straight to your phone, as well as cool perks like advanced copies of my new book, the ability to suggest podcast topics, and who knows, maybe meeting up for a hike ;)\nIt's Rehab Time.
