  "description": "Hunting for rare bourbon is hard these days so many people have gravitated to single barrel selections as a way to combat it in the hopes of getting a stellar bourbon that is less expensive and more appealing. On this episode, we blind taste our way through a series of five comparisons where we try to see if a single barrel store pick can compete with past limited editions. We see if Weller CYPB, Booker’s Rye, 2016 Four Roses Single Barrel, and Elijah Craig 18 are worth the price. We also talk about flavors we prefer over others and how to create your own small batch limited edition bourbon as well. If you’ve done something like this before, drop us a comment with your results.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about the return of bourbon.\n\nIs it worth waiting in line or camping out for bourbon?\n\nTasting store picks vs. limited releases.\n\nWeller CYPB vs Weller 107 pick by Cork N Bottle\n\nBooker’s Rye vs Knob Creek Rye by Westport Whiskey and Wine\n\n2016 Four Roses Limited Edition Single Barrel OESK vs North Atlanta Bourbon Society OESK\n\nElijah Craig 18yr vs Elijah Craig Loch n Key\n\nWild Turkey 17yr Decades vs Russell's Reserve by Cork N Bottle\n\nHow many barrel picks have you been on?\n\nIs there something on the flavor wheel that you don't like to get out of a bourbon?\n\nHave you tried to create your own small batch before?",
