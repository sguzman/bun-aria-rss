  "description": "Today we talk about the master or primary bathroom and the tricks we have learned over the years designing this space for respite and comfort.  Are you a baither or do you prefer a shower?  A lesson we have learned the hard was is to be sure you take the time to sit in your tub before you install it to make sure it is a good match for your body and lifestyle.  If you are the kind of person who likes a shower, be sure you are measuring for your shower heads and body sprayers so they hit in all the right spots.  Something we are doing a lot of work on is shower rooms that contain both a shower and a bathtub for those who like to enjoy both. We discuss the vanity and emphasize storage space for your various beauty products and toiletries.  We are also fans of getting a mirror that fills the whole space from the countertop to the ceiling will make your space feel twice as big.   <br /><br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a> \"<br /><br />What type of bathtub material should you get? 5:41<br />The one thing we recommend you keep 9:12<br />Showers 9:53<br />Shower rooms 17:09<br />Vanity 23:35<br />Lighting 33:34<br />Toilets 37:37<br /><br />“If you’re building today, or even if you want to do this as a remodel or an add-on today in your home, toilet’s have come such a far way and I know that it seems extra, but once you’ve had a great toilet that completely washes all the undercarriage and has all the bells and whistles, you could never possibly go back to having a normal toilet again.” 37:43<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
