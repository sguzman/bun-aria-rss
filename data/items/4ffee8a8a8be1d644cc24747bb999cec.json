  "title": "Uncle Si Has a Love-Hate Relationship with Phil Robertson's Dogs",
  "description": "Phil and Miss Kay are known for the pets they keep, be it the revolving door of Bobos and Bebes or their hunting dogs. Martin and Jay reminisce about Phil's great retriever, Blue, and his odd personality, and Si remembers being Blue's pee target whenever he tried to take a nap. Si has the boys howling about Jase's suggestion that Blue live in the house with Phil and Miss Kay for a few weeks. Jay talks about how protective the late Bobo was and even shows some videos in his honor. Martin shares the piece of advice he's plain TIRED of hearing and gives an update on how Brittany is doing in the final days of her pregnancy. John-David can't believe he's never heard Si tell the story of the time a squirrel bit him — and the subsequent lesson that squirrel quickly learned. And we're all praying for a friend of the show, Zac Stephens, who just went through a leg amputation after a terrible accident. \n\nhttps://www.rumpl.com/ — Get 15% off with code DUCK15 for a limited time!\n--\nLearn more about your ad choices.
