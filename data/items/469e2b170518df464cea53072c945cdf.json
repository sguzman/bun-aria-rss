  "description": "We don't raise an eyebrow when Trump lies. Most of his early lies were of little consequence, about his wealth or sexual prowess or intellect. But in recent weeks, in the midst of the first major International crisis the president has faced (that he did not himself create), we have seen those lies turned into potential weapons of mass destruction. By minimizing the consequences of a global pandemic, many can die, markets can lose faith in public officials, economies can falter. We discuss this disturbing, dangerous phenomenon with Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law and \"Just Security.\" We also discuss how it is all a part of an effort by Trump to transform the entire US government into an engine of disinformation that is a grave threat to our national security. Don't miss this important episode.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
