  "description": "<p>How do you achieve FIRE? Last week we discussed the pros and cons of the Financial Independence Retire Early movement, and this week we’re covering the practical steps that will allow you to achieve FIRE. There are some basic principles that we all need to follow, even when our individual  journeys towards FIRE all look different. So in this episode we’ll be encouraging you to envision what you would want your ‘post-work’ life to look like- do you picture a more lean or luxurious retirement? And then beyond that we’ll get practical with the financial moves you need to be making now- things like where to invest your retirement, how you’ll know you’ve saved enough, and then how to draw on that money without penalty.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Speedway Stout by AleSmith Brewing Co! And as we’ve ramped up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!
