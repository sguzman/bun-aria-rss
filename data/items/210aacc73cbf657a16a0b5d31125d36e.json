  "description": "<p>Vanessa and Jonah welcome their friends, Hollywood Power Couple Patton Oswalt and Meredith Salenger, to HDWGW. They talk about their time on Will & Grace, the shelf life of pastries (especially if they are given to you for free), and attending high school and college reunions. They go on to discuss a variety of school field trips, like going into a giant tooth, Meredith's nostalgia-filled visits to Olvera Street, and Patton's trips to very cool historical landmarks near Washington D.C. The discussion eventually takes them to snack talks, including the interesting yet disgusting treat known as astronaut food. Eventually the conversation leads to being mesmerized by gift shops and relieved that kids don't have access to credit cards. A quick podcast public service announcement: DO. NOT. SHOPLIFT. AT. DISNEY. Lastly, another fun round of Change.dork takes all four to thinking about Arby's, declaring the need for a holiday for wines, and the Bono/Jon Bon Jovi Vegan Challenge.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
