  "description": "<p>There’s a lot of great content in this episode, and you do not want to miss it!</p> <p>John Maxwell talks about the temptations that successful organizations face, and he offers business maxims to counteract them. The first key idea he shares is that you and your business never arrive. He ties that into our need to be growth-oriented rather than goal-oriented. Goals have a finish line, but growth does not. Mark Cole is quick to point out that goals are not bad, but they do need to be a part of an ongoing growth process.</p> <p>In a successful organization, leaders can be tempted to stop thinking big. John compares this challenge in business organizations to sports teams that switch from playing to win to playing to protect what they have. He points towards organizations that do something well and then want to stick to that same process for every venture moving forward. Richard Chancy reminds us that leaders make things happen! Our motivation may be a desire to win or a strong fear of losing, but either way we must be willing to work on ourselves, keep growing, and think BIG if we want to be successful over the long haul.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is The Six Temptations of Successful Organizations Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Temptation and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”   </p> <p>References: </p> <p><a href=\"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">The John Maxwell Online Store</a> </p> <p><em><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/15-Invaluable-Laws-of-Growth--Hardcover_p_2871.html\"> The 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth by John C.
