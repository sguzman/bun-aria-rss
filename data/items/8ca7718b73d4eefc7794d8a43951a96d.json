  "description": "In today's podcast we hear about some catphishing in the IDF's pond. Charming Kitten uses itself as bait. Facebook and Google face scrutiny over sharing users' information with third-parties. The Pirate Bay is back after its hiatus, and it's back to cryptojacking. The European Parliament voted today to reopen debate on its controversial copyright legislation. ZTE receives some perhaps temporary, perhaps more enduring, relief from US sanctions.  And confusion to the Muggalos' facial recognition software. Justin Harvey from Accenture with thoughts on quantum computing. Guest is Gadi Naveh from Check Point Software with a look at open source security tools.",
