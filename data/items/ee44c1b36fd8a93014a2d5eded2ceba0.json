  "description": "<p>Around April 19, 2016, 44-year-old Kelly \"Allison\" Whiddon disappeared from Panama City Beach, Florida. Allison was in the middle of breaking up with the man she had been dating. This man had a history of violence and threats he promised to make good on. The two got into an altercation in a restaurant, and her boyfriend claimed he never saw her again, changed his story later, and subsequently refused to cooperate with police after they started investigating her disappearance. No one reported Allison missing until the end of May. Why did it take six weeks for anyone else to realize she was missing? What has occurred since then is truly extraordinary.
