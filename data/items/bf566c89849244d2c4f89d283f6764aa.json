  "description": "Why do we have sex-segregated restrooms? Are they necessary? What about your drivers license? Have you thought of why your designated sex category is listed, despite your picture and all other relevant information present? Heath Fogg Davis, in his new book Beyond Trans: Does Gender Matter? (New York University Press, 2017) , argues that these policies are not only unnecessary but harmful to achieving gender equity. Not only do these policies effect the everyday lives of trans people, but Davis argues that these policies also limit the sexual and gender expressions for all Americans. Using four case studies, Davis examines various parts of American society that are impacted by sex-segregation policies, challenges the reader to critically re-examine sex-segregated and gendered policies, and provides a way for organizations, companies, and schools to become more gender equitable.\n\nHeath Fogg Davis is an activist and Associate Professor of Political Science at Temple University.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
