  "description": "<p>Episode 311 - Film and music. The two have been passions of mine and the guest this week for quite some time and I was excited to talk about it with the director, Michael Grodner. He most recently finished his first feature length film called The Icarus Line Must Die which is an incredible piece of work combining the LA punk scene and a film noir look at life in a band. He also directed many music videos that you have probably seen from bands like Planes Mistaken For Stars, Brazil and more. It’s a fascinating discussion of creating art in 2018 and beyond.
