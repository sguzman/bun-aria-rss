  "description": "<p>Eric Peters is the Founder and CEO of One River Digital Asset Management. In this episode, he joins the Bankless Podcast to bring the perspective of a traditional hedge fund manager into a crypto context. Spending his career in the markets, his insights to the macro environment are vast and inform his investing decisions, and he sees crypto as a pathway to a renaissance – but also to a dystopia.</p> <p>Seeing a 'quantum' level change underway, Eric explores the bumpy road ahead with thoughtful views on generation gaps, income inequality, and the power of digital assets. Eric's approach is a pragmatic one, addressing the crypto revolution in realistic terms that makes these paradigm shifts feel simultaneously instant and drawn out.</p> <p>✨ EPISODE DEBRIEF ✨<br /> <a href= \"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/exclusive-debrief-institutions-are\"> https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/exclusive-debrief-institutions-are</a> </p> <p>*****<br /> 📣 POOLTOGETHER | DEFI LOTTERY<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/PoolTogether\">https://bankless.cc/PoolTogether</a> <br />  *****</p> <p>🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  ------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>🍵 MATCHA | DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE AGGREGATOR<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Matcha\">https://bankless.cc/Matcha</a> </p> <p>🔐 LEDGER | SECURE YOUR ASSETS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Ledger\">https://bankless.cc/Ledger</a> </p> <p>🧙‍♀️ ALCHEMIX | SELF-PAYING LOANS<br /> <a href= \"http://bankless.cc/Alchemix\">http://bankless.cc/Alchemix</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 6:00 Eric Peters of Greenwich, CT<br /> 12:45 Buying $600M of Crypto<br /> 16:25 Building a Team<br /> 23:55 A Macro History Lesson<br /> 32:19 A Quantum Change<br /> 40:20 Dystopia or Renaissance<br /> 49:16 Bumpy Road Ahead<br /> 55:12 Generational Stresses<br /> 1:03:25 Faith In Currency<br /> 1:10:52 Regulatory Wrestling Match<br /> 1:15:42 Young, Dumb, and Broke<br /> 1:24:48 DeFi Boomers<br /> 1:29:00 Money is an Illusion<br /> 1:37:49 One Grave at a Time<br /> 1:42:20 Predictions<br /> 1:46:39 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Weekend Notes:<br /> <a href= \"https://www.oneriveram.com/wknd-notes\">https://www.oneriveram.com/wknd-notes</a> </p> <p>The Case for Digital Assets:<br /> <a href= \"https://www.oneriveram.com/s/The-Case-for-Digital-Assets-One-River.pdf\"> https://www.oneriveram.com/s/The-Case-for-Digital-Assets-One-River.pdf</a> </p> <p>The Crypto Renaissance:<br /> <a href= \"https://youtu.be/karddOiv4ZA\">https://youtu.be/karddOiv4ZA</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
