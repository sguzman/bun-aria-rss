  "description": "Rory Palmer was, until very recently, the Labour MEP for the East Midlands. He became one of the defining images of the last day of the UK's EU membership as the scarves he had to make the occasion were worn in the chamber. Rory gives a brilliant insight into the UK's departure from the EU from the inside - giving us the political and personal reality of the job and how the final days felt. He also gives his assessment on Labour's last few years and the leadership's attitude to Europe. Oh and we get the full lowdown on the scarves - how they were designed and how many exist...
