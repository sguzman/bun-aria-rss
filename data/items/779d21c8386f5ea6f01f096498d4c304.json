He’s matured into a regenerative farmer, environmentalist, and founder of the&nbsp;Lonely Whale Foundation.&nbsp;He’s also an impact investor, leading&nbsp;DuContra Ventures&nbsp;as co-founder and Chief Experience Officer.</p><p>A heart-centered community builder who cares deeply about our symbiosis with self, each other, and the natural habitat we share, today Adrian shares his worthy story.</p><p>It’s about the hidden, ugly truths that lay beneath the modern American dream. It’s about the work required, and beauty to behold, in wrestling with the soul. It’s about endeavoring to connect with and express that which is more fundamental and meaningful.
