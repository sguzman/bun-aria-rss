  "description": "<p>In part two of our series on Emotional Intelligence, John Maxwell teaches the importance of motivation, empathy, and social skills in an emotionally intelligent leader. John reminds us that, like leadership, emotional intelligence is not something that some people are born with and others aren’t. Emotional intelligence can be learned and developed.</p> <p>Mark Cole and Chris Goede point out the shift throughout John’s lesson from me-focused to others-focused, and they discuss how empathy and social skills ultimately help us serve others well. Mark quotes John by reminding us: “We do not see things as they are; we see things as we are.” Emotional intelligence allows us to be empathetic to others as we see how our personal biases get in the way of healthy developing relationships.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is The Emotional Intelligence Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Emotion and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Intelligence-Matter-More-Than/dp/055338371X\"> <em>Emotional Intelligence</em> by Daniel Goleman</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://johnmaxwell.com/greatestreturn\"><em>The Leader’s Greatest Return</em> by John C.
