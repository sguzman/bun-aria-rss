  "title": "Ep 182 | Phil Rips Thanksgiving Lockdowns, Biden's 'Unity' & Morrissey vs. the Duckmen",
  "description": "Jase finds the authoritarian Thanksgiving restrictions in California and Oregon absurd, and Phil has a pretty good idea where the rules are coming from and where they're headed. Al is sick of the mask hypocrisy from the \"orange man bad\" crowd. The guys are fed up with coronavirus restrictions being used to go after believers, and they're not expecting Joe Biden to keep any of his \"kumbaya\" promises. But first, Phil, Jase, and Al are unashamed to hunt and eat game despite Morrissey's refusal to do a TV appearance with them. The guys drool over Phil's hamburger recipe, but Jase has one good reason he likes vegetarians. And with duck season about to start, Phil and Jase have never seen this many ducks.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
