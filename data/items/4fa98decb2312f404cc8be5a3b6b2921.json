  "description": "Yes, we were live for nearly 10 hours on Super Bowl Sunday, but even amidst all that streaming, there were things we didn't get the chance to discuss regarding the Bucs dominant performance over the Chiefs. That's what the Pick Six Superfriends are here to do on this day-after edition of Pick Six. Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech offer a deeper dive on Super Bowl LV. They focus on the defining moments of the game with a focus on the sequence of events before halftime. The game plans of Eric Beinemy and Todd Bowles are also examined as there was a clear-cut winner in that matchup of minds. Is Rob Gronkowski vs. Travis Kelce now settled? Gronk's performance may prevent Kelce from ever claiming \"best tight end of all time\" status. Breech sneaks in some punting talk before the guys make an effort to figure out where Tampa Bay vs. Kansas City will rank in Super Bowl history. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
