  "description": "<p>Standup comedian Keith Robinson joins standup comedian Ari Shaffir this week to tell me about his stroke. I had a lot of questions. And Keith was forthcoming and hilarious. My favorite kind of guest.</p> <p>Keith is one of the most giving comedians on the planet. You can trace tons of great comics who point to him as one of the biggest influences on their careers and their lives. He looks out for young comedians, especially the ones from Philadelphia. It really makes me want to work harder to help younger comics. And I already do plenty. But Keith Robinson makes me want to do even more.</p> <p>✦ Follow Keith on Twitter: <a href= \"https://twitter.com/1keithrobinson\">https://twitter.com/1keithrobinson</a></p> <p>✦ For all of Ari's projects and accounts: <a href= \"https://linktr.ee/RIPAriShaffir\">https://linktr.ee/RIPAriShaffir</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toni Braxton - Unbreak My Heart</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Strokes - Is This It?</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billie Joel - Movin’ Out</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marvin Gaye - Don’t Do it</span></p> <p>Thanks to our Artists:</p> <p>Patrick Holbert - @theholbertreport - Editing</p> <p>Marisa Pellegrino - @marisa_pellegrino - Editing</p> <p>Becky Rodriguez - @humanplac3s - Production</p> <p>Raelyn Nelson - @raelynnelsonband covering \"Ari Shaffir Owns This Song\" By Pepper Goins - The Rushmore Podcast</p>",
