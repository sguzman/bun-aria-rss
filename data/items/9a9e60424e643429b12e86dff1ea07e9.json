  "description": "<p>Political regimes have been changing throughout human history. After the\napparent triumph of liberal democracies at the end of the twentieth century,\nFrancis Fukuyama and others have been arguing that humankind is approaching an\n`end of history' (EoH) in the form of a universality of liberal democracies.\nThis view has been challenged by recent developments that seem to indicate the\nrise of defective democracies across the globe. There has been no attempt to\nquantify the expected EoH with a statistical approach. In this study, we model\nthe transition between political regimes as a Markov process and -- using a\nBayesian inference approach -- we estimate the transition probabilities between\npolitical regimes from time-series data describing the evolution of political\nregimes from 1800--2018. We then compute the steady state for this Markov\nprocess which represents a mathematical abstraction of the EoH and predicts\nthat approximately 46 % of countries will be full democracies. Furthermore, we\nfind that, under our model, the fraction of autocracies in the world is\nexpected to increase for the next half-century before it declines. Using\nrandom-walk theory, we then estimate survival curves of different types of\nregimes and estimate characteristic lifetimes of democracies and autocracies of\n244 years and 69 years, respectively. Quantifying the expected EoH allows us to\nchallenge common beliefs about the nature of political equilibria.\nSpecifically, we find no statistical evidence that the EoH constitutes a fixed,\ncomplete omnipresence of democratic regimes.\n</p>",
