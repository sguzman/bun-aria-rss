  "description": "One test we all have to pass is being faithful in the ordinary days. Like clay spinning on the wheel, sometimes our lives can feel like we are spinning and not getting anywhere, like we’re just doing the same thing every day. It’s easy to feel like giving up and lose momentum when nothing is happening. But like that clay on a potter’s wheel, when it feels like you’re going in circles, something is happening that you can’t see. You’re growing. Behind the scenes, God is making and molding you, preparing you for where He wants to take you. But, you have to stay on His Potter’s Wheel and stay faithful! Even the great Bible heroes faced ordinary days and routine. Joel will show you that when you’re faithful in average days, then you will see exceptional days. You will learn to enjoy where God has you right now so you’ll never miss out on the new things God has in store!<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
