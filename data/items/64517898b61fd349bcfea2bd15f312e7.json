  "description": "<p>As the Grateful Dead’s star continued to rise, Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan felt he would rather be a dark star, invisible to the world. But he couldn’t hide. Not from the throngs of fans. And not from the San Francisco Police Department. Maybe they saw Pig’s leather vest and cowboy hat and figured he was an outlaw. Or maybe they just wanted to outlaw his type and the whole freaky scene along with him. And they tried to do just that in the fall of 1967, as the sun set on the Summer of Love and the Dead waited like sitting ducks at their house at 710 Ashbury Street.</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Long-Strange-Trip-History-Grateful/dp/0767911865/\"><em>A Long Strange Trip: The Inside Story of the Grateful Dead</em>, by Dennis McNally</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Living-Dead-Twenty-Garcia-Grateful/dp/0815411634/\"><em>Living with The Dead: Twenty Years on the Bus with Garcia and the Grateful Dead</em>, by Rock Scully with David Dalton</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Searching-Sound-Life-Grateful-Dead/dp/0316154490/\"><em>Searching for the Sound</em>, by Phil Lesh</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Grateful-Dead-FAQ-Greatest-History/dp/1617130869/\"><em>The Grateful Dead FAQ: All That’s Left to Know About the Greatest Jam Band in History</em>, by Tony Sclafani</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/This-All-Dream-We-Dreamed/dp/1250058562/\"><em>This Is All a Dream We Dreamed: An Oral History of the Grateful Dead</em>, by Blair Jackson and David Gans</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ultimateclassicrock.com/grateful-dead-debut-album/\">Why the Grateful Dead's Debut Was So Hastily Recorded</a> (Ultimate Classic Rock)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/joe-smith/about-this-collection/?loclr=blognsh\">Joe Smith Digital Collection</a> (Library of Congress)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jerrygarciasbrokendownpalaces.blogspot.com/2012/11/rcas-studio-b-6363-sunset-boulevard.html\">RCA's Studio B, 6363 Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood, CA</a> (Jerry’s Brokedown Palaces)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-smith-ran-record-labels-and-signed-the-grateful-dead-11575501669\">Joe Smith Ran Record Labels and Signed the Grateful Dead</a> (Wall Street Journal)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.julienslive.com/lot-details/index/catalog/313/lot/124316\">Grateful Dead first record contract</a> (Julien’s)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22733-the-grateful-dead-50th-anniversary-deluxe-edition/\">The Grateful Dead: 50th Anniversary Deluxe Edition Album Review</a> (Pitchfork)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/joe-smith-grateful-dead-921230/\">That Time Joe Smith Sent the Grateful Dead a Letter Complaining About Their Work Ethic</a> (Rolling Stone)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://deadessays.blogspot.com/2010/11/very-short-tale-of-golden-road.html\">Grateful Dead Guide: The Very Short Tale of Golden Road</a> (Dead Essays)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/13/joe-smith-obituary\">Joe Smith obituary</a> (The Guardian)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBXujU7Gzg8\">Brian Jones at Monterey Pop</a> (YouTube)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnV34yEby44\">Monterey Pop Festival – 40 Years Ago</a> (YouTube)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/opinion/the-greatest-music-festival-in-history.html\">Opinion | The Greatest Music Festival in History</a> (NY Times)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/238-anatomy-of-a-love-festival-part-two\">Anatomy of a Love Festival -
