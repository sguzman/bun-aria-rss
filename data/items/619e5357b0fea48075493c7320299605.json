Hasselblad has finally announced the new X2D as well as three “V series” lenses - a 38mm f/2.5, 55mm f/2.5 and a 90mm f/2.5 - all are considerably lighter and much quieter than the first generation lenses.\n\nThe X2D features a new 100MP, BSI sensor with phase detection autofocus. There is a new top level screen, high resolution EVF, tiltable rear touch screen, in-body image stabilization, a built in 1TB SSD drive and other new features discussed in this video.",
