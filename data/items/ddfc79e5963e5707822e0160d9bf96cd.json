    "media:description": "This video looks at the Great Bible of Henry VIII published in 1539, and it shows how the Tyndale translations were copied into the Coverdale and Matthew Bibles to end up making a uniquely Protestant Bible for a king who didn't want it. \n\nFor more, check out my new book \"How We Got Our Bible\" (Zondervan, 2018) with the Amazon affiliate link here:  https://amzn.to/2MtmSYY",
