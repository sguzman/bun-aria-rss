  "itunes:summary": "Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages? Across two nights, Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week present a program of electronic music genealogies, featuring artists whose works span the 1970s to today and represent multiple generations of Melbourne’s experimental scene.\n\nTangerine is the project from musician Clementine Girard-Foley. Stepping away from the rigidity of her training as a classical pianist, Tangerine produces textural, bouncing compositions with precise clarity.\nAhead of her performance, Clementine discusses what to expect from her live set, the communities that formed her approaches to music making, and the duality of the piano and synthesiser.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/liquid-architecture-x-melbourne-music-week\n\nRitual Community Music \n10 - 11 December 2021\nMiscellania, Melbourne CBD\nPresented by Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week",
