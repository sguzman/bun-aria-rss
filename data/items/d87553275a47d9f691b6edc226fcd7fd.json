  "description": "<p>Just a few years before he died, author David Foster Wallace gave a now-famous commencement speech at Kenyon College. Here’s a small snippet of what he said. “There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says ‘Morning, boys. How's the water?’ And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes ‘What the hell is water?’” Wallace then went on to argue that we tend to live our lives according to values and rules that are hard to see. Similarly, we live in a culture that pushes us to go into debt for everything! It’s the message we are constantly bombarded with - it’s the water we swim in. So on today’s episode we’re going to push back on that line of thought and give the real reasons we should all be striving to avoid debt.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a EMO-J by Heist Brewery in Charlotte NC.
