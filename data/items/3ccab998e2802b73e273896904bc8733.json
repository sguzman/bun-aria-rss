  "title": "ZBT #334: Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Grinston + Military MacGyvering",
  "description": "<p>ROUND 1: A pilot out for joyride landed on a Royal Air Force base bc he ‘wanted to see the beach!” Now he owes them $5,000\n\nROUND 2: Have you or your fellow troops ever MacGyvered equipment to complete a mission? We asked, & you answered with things that are more “MacGroober level”, but impressive nonetheless. \n\nROUND 3: One of the best feelings in the world? Cancelled plans. And 1,000 Marines in the freezing land of Norway are soaking up that feeling as we speak. \n\nROUND 4: We sat down with the Sergeant Major of the Army, Michael Grinston, and he didn’t call Cons, “Sir” once. Suck on it Cons. We talked about the new Army regs on grooming and the overall culture in the Army today. Get your hair ties ready. \n\nROUND 5: With new Presidents come new positions, so last week we gave you a rundown on the new head of Veteran’s Affairs, and this week we introduce you to ‘the flying 69’. (Kate - oh, GREAT position). Just kidding, but we’ll intro your new Secretary of Defense, retired 4-star Lloyd Austin!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
