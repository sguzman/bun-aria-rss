  "description": "Cody Posey. July 5, 2004. Hondo, New Mexico. 14 year-old Cody Posey, armed with a .32 caliber handgun, shoots his stepmother as she is reading a book. Then he shoots his father and stepsister as they enter the home at Chavez Canyon Ranch. The owner of the ranch, newsman Sam Donaldson, will drop by and see blood on the floor. Law enforcement will find evidence of a violent attack and discover the bodies of Paul Posey (34), Tryone Posey (44), and Marilea Schmid (13). Their concern for the safety of Cody Posey dissipates once he is located. After an hour of questioning, Cody gives a confession as well as a motive. Support for the young man swelled as people learned about his father's physical and verbal abuse toward him. What would the jury think of Cody's stories?\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
