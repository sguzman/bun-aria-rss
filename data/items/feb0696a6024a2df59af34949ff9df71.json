  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that NSA says it warned its French counterparts about Russian cyber ops targeting France's elections. Next up for Fancy Bear? Probably German elections, but in the meantime there's also some phishing with zero-days. The NSA Director also advocates calling out Russia for bad behavior in cyberspace, and says that US Cyber Command is ready and able to hold targets at risk, so deterrence and retaliation are available options. Microsoft, Adobe, and Cisco issued significant patches yesterday. Accenture Labs' Malek Ben Salem shares results from their security survey. Rohit Sethi from Security Compass outlines managing application security. And President Trump has told the FBI Director, \"you're fired.\"",
