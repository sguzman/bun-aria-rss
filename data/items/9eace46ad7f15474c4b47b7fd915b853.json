Glen is an economics professor at California State University and, unlike most academic economists, he moonlights as a TV writer. He first wrote for the TV show Fringe and now writes for the soccer spy drama, Matador.</p>\n<p>The book’s <a href=\"http://econundead.com/\">website</a> provides the following description:</p>\n<p>“Whether preparing us for economic recovery after the zombie apocalypse, analyzing vampire investment strategies, or illuminating the market forces that affect vampire-human romances, <em>Economics of the Undead: Zombies, Vampires, and the Dismal Science</em> gives both seasoned economists and layman readers something to sink their teeth into.</p>\n<p>Undead creatures have terrified villagers and popular audiences for centuries, but when analyzed closely, their behaviors and stories—however farfetched—mirror our own in surprising ways. The essays collected in this book are as humorous as they are thoughtful, as culturally relevant as they are economically sound, and provide an accessible link between a popular culture phenomenon and the key concepts necessary to building one’s understanding of economic systems large and small. It is the first book to combine economics with our society’s fascination with the undead, and is an invaluable resource for those looking to learn economic fundamentals in a fun and innovative way.”</p>\n<p>Among the topics covered in the discussion are helpful hints such as how to meet the vampire man of your dreams, to choose what to bring on your trek across the zombie-infested wastelands you once called home, and to rebuild civilization after the undead apocalypse.</p>\n<p>Human capital will be particularly helpful in the zombie apocalypse; it has immense value and goes wherever you go. Doctors are often depicted among the survivors of the zombie apocalypse, possibly because survivor groups would rather recruit a doctor than kill him. There’s an analogy to pirates, who would press valuable seamen like surgeons or carpenters into service rather than killing them (for more pirate economics, check out <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691150095/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0691150095&linkCode=as2&tag=economdetect-20&linkId=JG62WTJSH4R5F6QL\">Peter Leeson’s The Invisible Hook</a>).</p>\n<p>Among the more unexpected chapters of the book is “Killing Time: Dracula and Social Discoordination,” by Hollis Robbins.
