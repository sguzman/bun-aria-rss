  "description": "We are determined to make a trade on today's show, so let's see if we can pull it off! First, check out this very creative and perhaps genius trade strategy (2:30) suggested by a listener. Then we'll talk about the first and second round picks we are actually worried about (6:45). CEH headlines the list but this might be the time to buy low. What do we expect from Ezekiel Elliott (13:40)? And we also cover Jonathan Taylor, Saquon Barkley and the Round 2 WRs. And Adam makes a possibly ridiculous case to value Tom Brady ahead of Barkley ... Buy low (26:15) targets like Justin Herbert and Myles Gaskin. Do Mark Andrews and George Kittle qualify as buy low guys? Sell high (35:40) guys like Rob Gronkowski, although there is some debate on Gronk. And which RBs can come out of the dead zone (42:15)? Chase Edmonds? Ty'Son Williams? ... Previewing Panthers-Texans (47:30), hearing from the Fantasy Cops (53:00) and answering your Apple Podcast questions (55:50) ...
