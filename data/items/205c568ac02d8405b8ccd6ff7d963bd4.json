  "description": "Hello and welcome to One Minute Book review, the show that brings books to life, I am your host Aun Abdi. \n\nToday I will be reviewing 'Can't Hurt Me' by David Goggins. An honest, insightful and at times shocking self-assessment of his own life. David Goggins gives a brief account of how he became a Navy Seal, Army Ranger and Ultra-Athlete. In the book, David provides a full explanation of the obstacles he had to overcome and mental fortitude he needed to reach his goals at every step of the way. The author details his early life explaining the harsh realities of Seal training while not holding back in defining what it takes to be the best version of yourself. The honesty and openness are what I enjoyed about this book the most.  It would have been easy for the author to list all of his achievements without detailing the hardships, but in showing his vulnerability, it makes the book more captivating and makes the reader more engaged. I would encourage all to listen to the audiobook as it provides a different perspective that the written book cannot — a great read. \n\nThis has been One Minute Book Review, thanks for listening.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
