  "description": "Today, journalists are expected to fall in line with the media narrative. But if they dare to do real journalism, they’d better watch their backs. South African-born investigative journalist Lara Logan has built her career on the front lines of history, and she’s paid a heavier price for truth than most can imagine — targeted and smeared by the media, not to mention the brutal atrocities she’s lived through in the field. It takes a special breed to stand back up even once! Lara recounts her unbelievable career reporting from active war zones and everything she’s learned about the Left’s disinformation, the world’s radicals, and the true American dream. And she doesn’t hold anything back, because without the truth, what else is left?\nThis Week’s Sponsors:\nCars today are like computers on wheels.
