  "description": "<p>People with disabilities have long faced some of the greatest barriers to voting in our elections. From inaccessible polling places and a lack of working accessible voting machines to onerous restrictions on absentee voting, our right to the ballot has often been ignored or forgotten.</p>\n<p>In 2020, over <a href=\"https://smlr.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/Centers/Program_Disability_Research/FactSheet_Disability_Voter_Turnout_2020.pdf\">11 percent</a> of voters with disabilities reported that they faced some type of difficulty casting a ballot — more than any other group and despite expanded access to mail-in voting due to the pandemic. But instead of embracing the more accessible forms of voting that sparked record turnout, including among voters with disabilities, states have <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/04/12/voters-with-disabilities-face-new-ballot-restrictions-ahead-of-midterms\">doubled down</a> on new and more restrictive voter suppression laws.</p>\n<p>In 2021 alone, more than <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-december-2021\">400 anti-voter measures</a> were introduced by states across the country, many of which are most burdensome to people of color and voters with disabilities. These measures run the gamut from restricting access to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/arizona-legislature-passes-law-purge-infrequent-mail-voters-n1267025\">absentee voting</a>, eliminating <a href=\"https://www.ktvh.com/news/montana-politics/gianforte-signs-bills-eliminating-election-day-registration-tightening-voter-id\">Election Day registration</a>, and making it more difficult to <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/08/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-shortening-early-voting-closing-polls-earlier-election-day/6869317002/\">vote early in person</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2021/12/28/texas-new-election-law-challenged-over-provision-making-it-a-crime-to-encourage-voting-by-mail/\">criminalizing </a>the act of assisting voters with disabilities to vote. We’re challenging some of the measures that have become law in court in <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/sixth-district-african-methodist-episcopal-church-v-kemp\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/groups-file-lawsuit-against-state-texas-over-voter-suppression-bill-sb1\">Texas</a>, where egregious restrictions illegally burden the right to vote for people with disabilities.</p>\n<p>Whether you choose to vote in person early or on Election Day, or vote absentee, you’ll have to navigate a complex web of state and local election rules and deadlines regarding voter registration, absentee ballots, and fixing or “curing” a ballot that was rejected, often due to missing or incorrect information.</p>\n<p>This election season, we’re fighting back against voter suppression and <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/vote-your-values\">urging all Americans</a> to vote for their values and fight for their rights.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-donate mb-md wp-link\">  <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/vote-your-values\" class=\"wp-link mb-md\">\n          <div class=\"mb-md\">\n        <img width=\"2400\" height=\"1256\" src=\"https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/11c219d9d6534b8ec5c0a32fbec5a8e8.png\" class=\"attachment-original size-original\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/11c219d9d6534b8ec5c0a32fbec5a8e8.png 2400w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/11c219d9d6534b8ec5c0a32fbec5a8e8-768x402.png 768w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/11c219d9d6534b8ec5c0a32fbec5a8e8-1536x804.png 1536w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/11c219d9d6534b8ec5c0a32fbec5a8e8-2048x1072.png 2048w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/11c219d9d6534b8ec5c0a32fbec5a8e8-400x209.png 400w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/11c219d9d6534b8ec5c0a32fbec5a8e8-600x314.png 600w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/11c219d9d6534b8ec5c0a32fbec5a8e8-800x419.png 800w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/11c219d9d6534b8ec5c0a32fbec5a8e8-1000x523.png 1000w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/11c219d9d6534b8ec5c0a32fbec5a8e8-1200x628.png 1200w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/11c219d9d6534b8ec5c0a32fbec5a8e8-1400x733.png 1400w, https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/11c219d9d6534b8ec5c0a32fbec5a8e8-1600x837.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px\" />      </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"wp-link__site-name\">\n              American Civil Liberties Union        \n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"wp-link__title\">\n              Vote Your Values | American Civil Liberties Union          </div>\n      </a>\n</div><p>For voters with disabilities, we’re making sure you <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights\">know your rights</a> and can find resources about how to vote, including voting absentee and curing a ballot if it’s rejected.</p>\n\t<div class=\"wp-heading mb-md\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<hr class=\"mark\" />\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 id=\"\" class=\"wp-heading-h2 with-mark\">Register to Vote or Check Your Registration</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://vote.gov/\">Vote.gov</a> helps you quickly register to vote if you haven’t already. <b>Register early</b>, as some states require you to register to vote 30 days or more before an election.</p>\n<p>If you’re already registered, double check that your registration, including current address, is <a href=\"https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote/voter-registration-status\">up to date</a>.</p>\n\t<div class=\"wp-heading mb-md\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<hr class=\"mark\" />\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 id=\"\" class=\"wp-heading-h2 with-mark\">Request an Absentee Ballot</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n<p>All U.S. states and Washington, D.C. permit <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-2-excuses-to-vote-absentee.aspx\">people with an illness or disability</a> to vote absentee, allowing you to mail in your ballot or drop it off at a drop box or polling location.</p>\n<p>Similar to voter registration, each state has its own set of deadlines and rules for voting absentee.
