  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat records bits and pieces 38,000 feet in the air on the plane on the way back from Raleigh, North Carolina. The guys each pick some of their favorite moments from the past week including Pat’s story about having to take a bunch of edibles in the Heathrow Airport after playing the Jaguars in London and what that experience was like, his take on Dave Petersen, the moron who sent a disparaging letter to a Penn State football player for not “representing the school the way he should.” Also included are interviews with Green Bay Packers Running Back and newly minted NFC Offensive Player of the Week, Aaron Jones (2:25-12:48), and an incredibly insightful conversation with 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, Super Bowl Champion, and former Green Bay Pack, Chicago Bear, and Miami Dolphins Guard, Josh Sitton (24:47-36:18). It was a long week, but a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
