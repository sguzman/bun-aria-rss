  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease [Render], we’ve got a slew of new guests. Terrell Spencer from Across the Creek Farm joins the crew to talk about soil. The discussion goes from Navy pilots sunglasses, to parachutes not opening, to solving the world’s problems with dirt. It’s a fun episode and full of laughs, but takes a serious turn. How do we change the system when the current system is likely to fail in the long run? Human life is short but the life of the soil spans across inconceivable time. Civilizations have risen and fallen based upon soil health. At the end of the episode Forest Teeter sings “Paradise” by John Prine.</p><p><br></p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p><p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p><p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p><p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/products/bear-grease-hat\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
