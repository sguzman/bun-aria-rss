  "title": "PMS 2.0 227 - Washington Post Reaction.. Also, Conversations With Lorenzo Alexander, Michael Lombardi, & Legend, AJ Hawk. BIG Friday.",
  "description": "On today’s show, Pat reacts to the Washington Post article detailing the sexual harassment and misogynistic behavior exhibited by the Washington Football Team Name TBD. Pat is also joined by former General Manager of the Cleveland Browns, former NFL Scout, assistant to Bill Belichick while with the New England Patriots, 3x Super Bowl Champion and friend of the program, Michael Lombardi. Pat and Michael chat about the relationship between Cam Newton and Bill Belichick and why Michael thinks it’s going to be successful. He also drops the bomb that Deshaun Watson is likely to get a massive extension here within the coming days, and gives his thoughts on why the deal with Dak didn’t get done in Dallas. Pat and Michael also cover the AFL, and who he likes gambling wise for the Memorial Golf Tournament (3:23-20:38). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ speculate on what could potentially happen in Washington (before the Washington Post article came out) if they think Dan Snyder is going to lose the team, Zion having to leave the NBA bubble for a family emergency, Tiger surging at the Memorial Tournament in AJ’s backyard, and everything else going on in the sports world (22:24-1:32:35). To close out the show, 2x Pro Bowl, 2017 Defensive MVP of the Pro Bowl, All-Pro, former Linebacker for the Buffalo Bills, and current NFLPA Vice President, Lorenzo Alexander joins the program. Pat and Lorenzo chat about the upcoming discussions between the NFL and NFLPA and where he thinks they stand with return to play protocol, if he thinks teams will report by the July 28th date, what kind of things he expects the NFL and NFLPA to negotiate about, why he thinks the Bills are still the team to beat in the AFC East this year even with the Patriots addition of Cam Newton, and why he wants the Bills front office to know that he’ll be ready to sign if they’re going to make a deep run into the playoffs (1:34:40-1:46:01). Don’t forget to send in a picture of where you’re listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch and be on the lookout for the winners of the end of pod squad which will be announced shortly. We appreciate you all for rocking with us, have a fantastic weekend. Come and laugh with us, cheers\n",
