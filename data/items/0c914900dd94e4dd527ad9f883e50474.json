  "description": "Emily's back in sex school getting her doctorate, learning about gigantic sex machines and how the penis evolved. After school gets out, Emily goes on the Jeff Probst show to give sex advice and answer some hard questions from the audience. One lady wants to know what do you do when your guy won't go down on you. Several husbands want to know how to get their wives to have sex with them. If your not getting any with your significant other, it might be time to play Emily's Sex Drive, her new iPhone application for couples. Emily will send you an envelope everyday with a sexual assignment (she's not the only one getting schooled in sex). Emily and Menace take the Sex Drive pledge and pretend to fulfill their sexual tasks, from going to a sex shop to dirty talk. Emily gives advice for how to mixup your sex life whether you like good ol' fashion vanilla sex or something a bit spicier.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
