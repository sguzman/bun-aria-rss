What does sustainability entail, though? What informs it? In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay walks through Herbert Marcuse's New Leftism of the 1960s and 1970s and explains how sustainability has become Marcuse's \"New Sensibility.\" In other words, sustainability is the new way of thinking about the world so that we can have liberation, which is to say Communism.
