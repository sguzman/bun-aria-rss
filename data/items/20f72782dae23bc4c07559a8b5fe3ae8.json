We chose Holiday by Candlelight by Laurel Greer because it was lauded as a Hanukkah triumph. But... while it has a Menorah on the cover, it's more of a Skiing Times book that happens in December? REGARDLESS, it's got Garnet, a holistic health specialist and avid skiier, Caleb, a half Jewish, half Japanese hero who is suffering from PTSD after getting caught in an avalanche. Boy are they hot, though!\n Bonus Content: V's moose obsession, E's epic fart, Rooster's several businesses, and SO MUCH MORE.\n Lady Loves: \n Melody: Over the Moon on Disney+.
