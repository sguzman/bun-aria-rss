  "description": "<p><p>NFL Week 9. Fastest 2 Minutes. Recapping every game from Sunday. Lamar was on fire, Minshew Mania might be over, the Redskins can't score, Adam Gase's impost syndrome, the Bears gained a single passing yard in the first half. Jameis is a HoFer, the Packers can't deal with Daylight Savings, and we debate the merits of Matt Patricia's football guy status. Who's back of the week. Football Guy of the Week and the revelation that Dan Mullen is a self cucker. Hurt or Injured Nate Diaz and a recap of UFC 244 + Washington Nationals Parade Math. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
