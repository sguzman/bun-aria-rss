  "description": "<p>It's time to bring you a taste of shooting on the show for the first time in over 5 years as we speak with Tokyo Olympian Sergei Evglevski about his recent Olympic experiences and his amazing career. We learn from Sergei how getting into shooting was almost part of the 'family business' and whether or not that was a help of hindrance along his early shooting career. We also learn about his experiences in front of a home crowd at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and what it was like sharing that with his mother. Added to this we find out just what his Olympic experience was like in Tokyo and why we can expect to see him at many more future Olympics over the years. It's an interview that you will want to not miss the target on so get to listening and fire away!</p>",
