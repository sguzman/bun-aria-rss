But here’s the thing: it’s an actual physical addiction and the food industry strives to get us hooked on sugar. So, it’s not about willpower, it’s about biochemistry. The great news is that we can reset our biochemistry and those sugar cravings and take back our health. The more you avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates (which just turn into sugar in your body) the more your body recognizes the natural sweetness in healthy foods like blueberries or even a red bell pepper.&nbsp;</p><br><p>My guests on this episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy, </em>Keegan Allen and Tom Hopper,<em> </em>have both been through the sugar struggle, and they’re here to share their inspiring stories of overcoming the addiction to discover their most vibrant health.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Keegan is an American actor, musician, photographer, and author. He’s known for his main role as Toby Cavanaugh on the Freeform series <em>Pretty Little Liars</em>. Allen's passion in his younger years tended towards photography, cinematography, and other roles behind the camera. Tom is an English actor. He has appeared as Sir Percival in <em>Merlin</em>, Billy Bones in <em>Black Sails</em>, Dickon Tarly in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and Luther Hargreeves in Netflix’s new show <em>The Umbrella Academy</em>.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by ButcherBox and chili.</p><br><p>ButcherBox makes it super easy to get humanely raised meat that you can trust by delivering it right to your doorstep.
