  "description": "In his new book, In Search of the Lost Chord: 1967 and the Hippie Idea (Akashic Books, 2017), Danny Goldberg explores the political, social, and cultural influences of 1967–a pivotal year in American history. Goldberg, who graduated from high school in 1967 and was influenced by the cultural of the1960s, presents a subjective history on what he sees as the legacy of 1967 fifty years later. In In Search of the Lost Chord, Goldberg examines not only the music scene of 1967, but the role of psychedelics, hippies, protest culture, Eastern religions and spirituality, politics, the Black Power movement, and activists such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Muhammad Ali, Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary, Cora Weiss, and Tom Hayden. Goldberg’s book is well researched and informed by interviews of some of the most influential participants during 1967, giving readers a greater understanding of the complexities of this influential time in American culture.\n\n\n\nRebekah Buchanan is an Assistant Professor of English at Western Illinois University.
