It's a bad Star Wars movie, it's terribly written, mostly terribly acted (and I am not saying anything against actors, all of them are at least descent, but in this movie...YIKES), terribly edited, it has no direction, almost nonexistent plot etc etc.\n\nYou can tell that everyone involved in the making of this movie was just sick of SW and wanted to get it over with and it's simply sad.\n\nBut if you don't agree, okay but please don't take this too seriously.",
