  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane has told his children they will no longer be attending Hogwarts now that Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling has revealed herself to be a crude bigot. The KMS crew reacts to last nights boring Democratic Party debate (17:20). Minihane's old partner dropped another episode in the \"slow rollout\" of his podcast, and this time he decided to take a few shots at KMS; Kirk ain't happy (25:00). Adult film star and MILF extraordinaire Brandi Love joins the show to respond to conservative anti-porn blogger Matt Walsh and spread a little Christmas cheer (53:00). Kirk, Mike, and Steve play sound from the past year, make predictions for the coming year, and reflect on the magical journey they've shared together.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
