  "description": "<p>It’s time to hear from our wives, Emily and Kate! We finally bring the ladies back on for an episode that we recorded while we were together at the beach. We wrestled the kids down to bed, rigged up a recording table in an echo-y beach house dining room, cracked open some beers and got to talking about personal finance. We fielded some questions from the Facebook group and addressed some topics like what it’s like to be married to a hardcore money nerd, frugal date night ideas, transitioning to a single income household, kids and money, teaching kids about money, and plenty more!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Road Full of Promise by Monday Night Brewing! And as we’ve ramped up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!
