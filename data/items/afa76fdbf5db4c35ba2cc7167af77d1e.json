  "description": "When Steve Sweeney was growing up in Boston, the last thing he expected to become was an entertainer. He rubbed elbows with career criminals in Charlestown but somehow wound up doing summertime productions of Shakespeare plays and seeing actors like Lawrence Olivier and Christopher Plummer. Acting then led to exposure to comedy, which later led to cocaine-induced psychosis, and eventually to working in jails and with at-risk youth. Steve talks with Marc about the journey to build his act and why he enjoys producing his own projects now, including his new movie Sweeney Killing Sweeney. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://turo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turo</a>, <a href=\"http://squarespace.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Squarespace</a>, and Starbucks Tripleshot Energy. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
