Then to understand math, finance and economics. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This podcast is to help you bridge the learning gaps. A subscriber (shout out to Magnus) mentioned that a general ELI5 episode would be good &nbsp;to run through the few common terms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Here, I've picked up 15 terms that are commonly used. Instead of giving &nbsp;you the \"just google what it means\" term, this is an ELI5 explanation &nbsp;with human explanation. That's the best way to learn, in my experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>15 terms we run through and explain: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*General Classification* &nbsp;1) Layer 1 2) Layer 2 3) Dapp &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*DeFi General Terms* &nbsp;&nbsp;4) DeFi 5) Money Lego 6) Compostability &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*Scalability Problem + Solution* &nbsp;7) Scalability 8) Sidechain &nbsp;9) Roll-ups &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*More Technical Elaboration* &nbsp;&nbsp;10) ZK roll-up &nbsp;11) Optimistic roll-up 12) ZK-SNARKS &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*Other Terms* &nbsp;13) Quadratic Funding 14) Flash loans 15) Front Running</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>My textbook for economics and math of defi and token engineering it now out for preorder!
