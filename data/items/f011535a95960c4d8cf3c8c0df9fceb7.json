  "description": "<p>Nikki Glaser (<i>The Nikki Glaser Podcast</i>, <i>FBoy Island, Nikki Glaser: Bangin'</i>) stops by to discuss the importance of being present and feeling your feelings. She opens up about being raised by an anxious parent, her relationship with her parents before, during, and after therapy, and the sensory issues she struggled with as a child. Nikki reveals the origins of her previous suicidal thoughts, how she went from being scared of boys to being known for her overtly sexual humor, and why she is considering a transition away from stand-up comedy. She discusses her disordered eating and body images issues, losing a friend to suicide, and her decision to stop drinking. Mayim and Nikki consider the benefits of weighted blankets, explore sex drives and feelings of attachment, and explain why they’re grateful social media didn’t exist when they were young. Mayim explains the neuroscience behind picky eating in another installment of Ask Mayim Anything. </p><p>The Nikki Glaser Podcast: <a href=\"https://www.nikkiglaser.com/page/podcast\">https://www.nikkiglaser.com/page/podcast</a></p><p>See Nikki Glaser on Tour: <a href=\"https://www.nikkiglaser.com/page/tour\">https://www.nikkiglaser.com/page/tour</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
