Also notable is how the mega-round share dropped to 34 per cent from the 66 per cent average recorded in 2021.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such grim trends, exacerbated by restrictive macroeconomic conditions in Europe and globally, have led to a sharp reduction in the number of new fintech startups being created: </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/report-fintech-market-set-cooling-110000498.html#:~:text=Finch%20Capital%27s%20research%20reveals%20that,%2C%20has%20declined%20by%2080%25.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an 80 per cent drop</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from last year’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are investors losing faith in fintech? Should you?</span></p>\n<h1>The state of fintech investment in 2022</h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decline in fintech investments speaks to the larger stock market downturn; it has particularly impacted growth stocks, which feature many fintech heroes. In 2022 H1, amidst the 20 per cent crash of the S&P 500 index, growth stocks in particular saw </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/growth-stocks/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their stock values halved</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or even more significantly affected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fintech appeal lies in its long-term potential, with experts projecting a market value as high as </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/fintech-technologies-market\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US$700 billion by 2030</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. One closely related sector that recognises this is banking, as large banks are not slowing down in attempts to have a leg in fintech. Following in the footsteps of JP Morgan and the Bank of America, HSBC is one of the latest big banks to invest in fintech, </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://thefintechtimes.com/banks-ramp-up-fintech-investments-allured-by-falling-prices-tech-potential/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">staking US$35 million in Monese</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://e27.co/how-is-fintech-different-in-asia-20220927/\">How is fintech different in Asia</a></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The laggy growth rate in the fintech industry in 2022 has prompted these banks, which have </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://devm.io/blockchain/banks-reluctant-fintech-133313\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demonstrated reluctance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the past, to identify opportunities for long-term strategic partnerships. Despite this trend, fintech are more willing to seek funding from VC firms than traditional banks due to the independence that the former might provide.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the one hand, the unexpected growth in 2021, coming from a significant pandemic-motivated deterioration in 2020, has made a market consolidation inevitable as the market evens out. On the other hand, COVID-19 is not dead and buried yet, and even though the world seems to have returned to normalcy after the 2020 peaks, markets and economies continue to suffer from the short-term and long-term effects of the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, one item of good news is that fintech companies are now more resilient, cybersecurity-wise, even though there is still a lot to be done. According to a WEF survey, it appeared that many firms took advantage of the pandemic downtime to enhance their cybersecurity infrastructures, which has been a major change.</span></p>\n<h2>Opportunities for fintech startups and investors</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Presently, there is little doubt that 2023 VC investment in fintech will match 2021’s figures. But this particularly applies to late-stage deals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may seem like overall investing activity is slowing, many early-stage startups are snapping up funding, which, even if lower than late-stage rounds, speak to the promising potential of the industry. Notably, digital lending has been going strong in this regard, with BNPL startups drawing massive interest from VCs and entrepreneurs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In particular, there are fewer regulatory obstacles in business lending compared with consumer financing. This creates a rich ground for innovative avenues toward profit-making while the debate on whether to </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/02/02/regulators-scrutinize-buy-now-pay-later-plans\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">categorise BNPL schemes as loans or otherwise</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> continues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More broadly, consumers (individuals and businesses) converge on </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2022/09/27/fintech-venture-capital-market-growth-projections-for-2023/?sh=662a290e23b2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">certain major drivers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, namely faster transactions, information security, and flexible cash flow management options. This also explains the rise of services like </span><a rel=\"follow\" rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2022/01/top-fintech-trends-in-h2-2021.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">embedded finance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also notable that the rise of fintech startups in recent years has been the response to perennial calls for more financial inclusion. Since 2011, the </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/fintech-and-financial-inclusion\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">global unbanked population has reduced by 35 per cent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as 1.2 billion unbanked adults have gained access to financial services. To achieve 100 per cent financial inclusion, it is pertinent to reach the over 1.7 billion adults still unbanked globally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a major value proposition for emerging fintech startups; clearly, there is immense potential for growth in the sector. The liberating impact of fintech on underdeveloped and developing markets presents massive opportunities for disruptions in the coming years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another important consideration for investors looking into fintech involves rising regulations for the industry. While the lack of stringent regulation for fintech startups (including neobanks) compared with traditional banks has enabled the former to innovate in ways that banks cannot, it contributes to the volatility of the industry.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://e27.co/how-payment-networks-are-crucial-to-the-rising-fintech-movement-20220810/\">How payment networks are crucial to the rising fintech movement</a></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, with the clamour for fintech regulation becoming even more pressing, it remains to be seen if the industry’s startups might eventually lose some of their appeals. It is critical to watch how fintech startups respond to the growing need for more regulation as well as how regulators would attempt to balance risk containment with innovation-friendliness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, one vital channel that is opening for fintech startups is data analytics. Studies by </span><a rel=\"follow\" rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2022/01/top-fintech-trends-in-h2-2021.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KPMG</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://thefintechtimes.com/mastercard-finds-data-analytics-and-ai-will-drive-the-growth-of-fintech/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mastercard</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> emphasise the significance of data analytics to fintech growth in the coming years, to the extent that many fintech will seek to differentiate themselves by rebranding as data organisations providing financial services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Empowering consumers with digital finance services requires acknowledging the need for hyper-personalised experiences, and data analytics and artificial intelligence are major keys to aligning with this demand.</span></p>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No sector received as much venture investment as fintech did in 2021, but we are in the final months of 2022, and it seems the glory days are well over. The goal for most established and new fintech is to help guide consumers through the struggling global economy toward personal financial stability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More so, opportunities keep expanding for collaboration in other sectors, such as the creator economy, whose rise has coincided with the fintech boost to support a new class of content-making entrepreneurs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fintech might be experiencing drought now, but that is not the end of the chapter, as there is still a lot of innovation yet to be captured, particularly via market expansions and the development of more financial technology infrastructure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of reasons to be bullish on fintech startups in the coming months, but a conservative approach focused on long-term gains is the best way forward, given the present challenges of the sector and international economies in general.</span></p>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>Editor’s note: <b >e27</b> aims to foster thought leadership by publishing views from the community.
