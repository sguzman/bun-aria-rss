  "description": "<p>Cemeteries are the final resting place for many people. However that final spot is decorated is a matter of money and preference. All burial plots are important whether that patch is adorned with a simple flat plaque or an audacious mausoleum. We have found that many of these \"cities of the dead\" are haunted. In this episode, we cover cemeteries located in Pennsylvania, Maine, Australia, Indiana, Tennessee and Michigan. And then there is that little detail of how one arrives to that final resting place. A hearse usually gets the job done. Cheers to that final ride! The Moment in Oddity features Eliza Huger's Grave and This Month in History features activist Wobbly Joe Hill convicted and sentenced to death.</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br /> <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2022/07/hgb-ep-443-haunted-cemeteries-23-and.html<br />  <br /> Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>Music used in this episode:</p> <p>Main Theme: Lurking in the Dark by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>(Moment in Oddity) Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4578-vanishing<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>(This Month in History) In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3906-in-your-arms<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>Outro Music: Happy Fun Punk by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>The following music was used for this media project:<br /> Music: Serpentine by WinnieTheMoog<br /> Free download: https://filmmusic.io/song/7947-serpentine<br /> License (CC BY 4.0): https://filmmusic.io/standard-license<br /> Artist website: https://linktr.ee/taigasoundprod</p> <p>Music: Clapping Hands by Frank Schröter<br /> Free download: https://filmmusic.io/song/6522-clapping-hands<br /> License (CC BY 4.0): https://filmmusic.io/standard-license<br /> Artist on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/frank.schroeter.52</p> <p>And https://www.purple-planet.com/</p>",
