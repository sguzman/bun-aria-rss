  "description": "Dave Hollis has always been somewhat skeptical about self-help, but in the long run that skepticism has served him very well. He always questions the hypotheses being put forward, both by self-appointed gurus and his own subconscious. As a result, he combines incredible vulnerability and self-awareness with a rigorously logical and brutally honest mindset. On this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Dave Hollis goes into incredible depth on the connections between failure, growth and fulfillment. While describing those connections he talks about his experiences with therapy, explains how he uses journaling so effectively, and even shares a few tips on marriage.   This episode is brought to you by: Podcorn: Visit <a href=\"https://podcorn.com/brands/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://podcorn.com/brands/</a> and use coupon code IMPACTTHEORY Women of Impact Podcast hosted by Lisa Bilyeu:  <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/women-of-impact/id1435217865\" rel=\"noopener\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/women-of-impact/id1435217865</a> Better Help: Get 10% off your first month at <a href=\"https://betterhelp.com/impacttheory\" rel=\"noopener\">https://betterhelp.com/impacttheory</a> Blinkist: Go to <a href=\"https://blinkist.com/impact\" rel=\"noopener\">https://blinkist.com/impact</a> Try it FREE for 7 days and save 25% off your new subscription.   SHOW NOTES:   Dave explains why he still calls himself a skeptic [3:20] Dave admits that he had to get super-stuck in order to embrace self-help [4:58] Tom and Dave discuss the power of negative visualization [8:32] Motivation is built through consistent habits and constantly pushing yourself [12:15] Dave talks about how he finished a challenge he thought might be impossible [15:53] You must test the truth of the stories you’ve been told [19:54] None of us are broken, but we all have seasons of brokenness [20:53] Dave explains how he uses journaling to get down to the subconscious [23:38] Dave describes the reasons why therapy was so helpful for him [25:38] Are other people’s opinions real?
