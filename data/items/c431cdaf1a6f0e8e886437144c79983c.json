  "title": "#58: A Vaccine Like No Other (Bret Weinstein & Heather Heying DarkHorse Livestream)",
  "description": "<p>In this 58th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. In this episode, we discuss the COVID-19 vaccines, and what questions you would want to answer in order to understand them: Are they safe? Are they effective? If you survive COVID-19, what are the long-term health effects? We discuss what an mRNA vaccine is and does, and how the immune system functions (and fails to function). We also talk about what makes flies sexy. The answer may surprise you: big long wings, and a diet of tomatoes. <br/><br/>DarkHorse merchandise now available at: store.darkhorsepodcast.org <br/><br/>Find more from us on Bret’s website (https://bretweinstein.net) or Heather’s website (http://heatherheying.com). <br/><br/>Become a member of the DarkHorse LiveStreams, and get access to an additional Q&A livestream every month.
