  "description": "Lilian, Kirsty and Lynda get together to open the bottle that they found in the woods. They tease out the paper inside it. There’s writing on it. It’s an affecting letter from a child to Father Christmas, asking for a guitar, and for their parents to stop arguing all the time. It’s signed, but they can’t make it out. Lynda is inspired. She’ll get out all the old Christmas cards and try and match the handwriting. They set about it, and Lynda exclaims the author is Tony Archer. Lilian is quiet. If it was him, then he was talking about her mum and dad too.\nNatasha bumps into Chelsea on the Green. Chelsea’s having some time away from Tracy, who’s hugging her every five minutes. Natasha finds out that Chelsea has had a termination, and she can see that she’s vulnerable. She has an idea. Thinking they need to cheer each other up, she invites Chelsea to April Cottage. She’ll do Chelsea’s makeup, and Chelsea can do her hair.\nChelsea wonders how it could have taken her so long to decide what to do. Natasha tells her she was juggling two different futures. Chelsea describes how she’s been, saying she woke up very relieved, but felt bad about that. Natasha tells her firmly that she didn’t plan to get pregnant, and she didn’t want to have a baby. Which means she made the right choice. Then she’s amazed by what Chelsea has done with her hair. Chelsea has a real talent – she’s going to be okay.",
