  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Ben Ferguson of Blaze Media TV fills in. Do we keep the government open or do we keep the border open? In today's Oval Office sparring match with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, President Trump pushed to secure the border even if it takes a government shutdown to get it done. We need to send the message that border security is important! The Democrats are likely trying to give Trump the money for the wall, but will ask for a lot in return for that compromise. Trump needs to go all-in on this one. Then, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise sits with Mark on Life, Liberty and Levin to discuss the reality that terrorists use the vulnerability of our southern border to hurt our country.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
