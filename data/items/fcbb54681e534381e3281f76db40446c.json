  "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>How do you give and receive pleasure while detaching from gender expectations? Storyteller and writer Matthew Beld has spent the Pandemic isolating and reflecting on who they really are, so a first time road trip celebration with new sluts feels daunting. Should they join the ass buffet? Can they be part of the orgy in the hot tub? As this proud slut embraces a more expansive non-binary identity, Matthew learns that the right people can help you find joy and connection - and that you don’t really have to know yet. It’s a bold choice, but you have to respect the confidence! #Nonbinary #ThatDressTho #Trans #TheMeatHasToGoSomewhere</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>Song: ‘I’m Good’ (The Mowgli’s)</strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>About the Storyteller:</em></strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p4\"><strong>Matthew Beld is a Non-Binary storyteller and writer in San Francisco.
