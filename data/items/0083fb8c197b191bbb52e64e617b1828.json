  "description": "<p>Great news WorkLifers! You told us you wanted more episodes of Taken for Granted, and we listened. We’ve renamed the show Re:Thinking with Adam Grant, and we’ll be back with more episodes, all year round. In every episode Adam will host lively discussions and debates with the world’s most fascinating thinkers, creators, achievers, and leaders to figure out what makes them tick. Adam will bring curiosity and science to conversations with people like entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban, death-defying rock climber Alex Honnold, novelist Celeste Ng, Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon, Nobel Prize-winning Saul Perlmutter, the physicist who discovered the expansion of the universe, and many more. How do they think–and what do they challenge us all to rethink? Find out on ReThinking with Adam Grant on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen.</p>",
