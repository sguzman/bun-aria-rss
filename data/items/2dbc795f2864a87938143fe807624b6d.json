It seems virtually everything Woke these days is justified on the back of some obviously nonsense appeal to \"trauma\" or \"harm.\" Schools are arranged as being \"safe and welcoming\" and \"places where everyone feels like they belong\" in response to the pervasive \"trauma\" and \"harm\" of everything else in society. What's going on? In Woke Marxism, like everything else, trauma and harm are understood systemically. They're the result of oppression, which is the result of systemic power, which is the result of the structural stratification of society, which is how Marxists read everything in the world. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay breaks down how \"systemic trauma and harm\" are nothing more than the same old Marxist religious impulse (to undo the Marxist Fall of Man) and latest excuse for seizing power over everything.\n\nSupport New Discourses: https://newdiscourses.com/support\n\nSubscribe to New Discourses on other platforms: https://newdiscourses.com/subscribe\n\nFollow James Lindsay: https://linktr.ee/conceptualjames\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
