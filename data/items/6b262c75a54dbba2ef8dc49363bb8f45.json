Many have eulogised and memorialised the designer’s unique ability to make women feel empowered in the clothes designed.

His close relationship to his mother facilitated his understanding of women as multifaceted. “What he wanted to do was that his clothes would enhance the personality, where you see the face… it was about the woman who would wear it,” said Verthime. “He wanted assertive women [and] he wanted women to love themselves.”</p> </li> </ul> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/luxury/lessons-for-the-fashion-industry-from-alber-elbazs-talk-at-voices-2018'> Lessons for the Fashion Industry From Alber Elbaz’s Talk at VOICES 2018</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/podcasts/luxury/alber-elbaz-on-making-his-return-to-fashion'> Alber Elbaz on Making His Return to Fashion</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/opinions/fashion-week/inside-alber-elbazs-return-to-fashion'> Inside Alber Elbaz’s Return to Fashion</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>T</em><em>o subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
