  "description": "Ever wonder what Kabbalah is really about? Or how you might have a close relationship with God? Is cleaving to God an expectation that might have been medieval but no longer is sought? Rabbi Dr. Daniel M. Horwitz ‘s new book A Kabbalah and Jewish Mysticism Reader (The Jewish Publication Society, 2016) answers these questions and many more in an easily readable, even entertaining, highly authentic and scholarly manner.\n\nDivided into seven parts and twenty-eight concise chapters, with each chapter an ideal length to readily understand the topic, this book is perfect for the student of Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism as well as the casual reader eager to transform his/her spiritual options.\n\nPraised by critics as “a gateway into the world of Jewish spirituality . . . An important resource, very well done” and “carefully thought out and well researched, making a very complicated subject quite accessible,” Daniel Horwitz’s new book describes five major types of Jewish mysticism and includes a brief chronology of its development, with a timeline. Beginning with the Bible’s prophets, he moves through early mystical movements up through current expressions of Deveikut, or cleaving to God. Kabbalah and the ten sephirot are described and explained. The words and teachings about mysticism and exaltation of twentieth century giant Abraham Joshua Heschel are shared. Humor is part of the telling of stories by Horwitz, and clarity and understanding emerge. In fact, the book is like a private class or conversation with this compassionate, brilliant teacher: he sits across from you as you read a vital text and then he explains to you what it means and the context in which you want to understand it.\n\nThe book has received very favorable reviews. Among them, see here. A Kabbalah and Jewish Mysticism Reader is available via Amazon.com, Jewish Publication Society, and your independent bookseller\nLearn more about your ad choices.
