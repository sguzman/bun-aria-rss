  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat is joined by 2x World Series Champion, 3x All-Star, Gold Glove Winner, Hank Aaron Award Winner, member of the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame and friend of the show, Kevin Youkilis. Pat and Youk discuss baseball coming back, and how much different a 60 game season is going to be. Youk dives into some of the strategy of playing that many fewer games, which teams he thinks will benefit the most, if he’s heard anything about the health and safety measures, he gives an update on his beer and coffee companies, and gives a peek behind the curtain as to how a baseball player might be approaching this season (1:52-22:26). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk as Pat and AJ welcome Super Bowl Champion, All-Pro, 2x National Champion,. Member of the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame, recipient of every major college football trophy including the 2005 Heisman Trophy, USC legend, Reggie Bush. Pat, AJ, & Reggie discuss him coming back to USC after all these years and what that process has been like, how much money he thinks a top tier athlete can make at USC with the changes to the name and likeness rules, his time in the NFL and how he struggled mentally his first couple of seasons, his thoughts on the Heisman and a never before heard story of the Downtown Athletic Club trying to award his Heisman to Vince Young or Matt Leinart after his was vacated. He also talks about going into the Saints Hall of Fame, how the game was a sanctuary, and what the best way to beat AJ on defense was (24:52-1:22:36). Lastly, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 5x Pro Bowler, 4x All-Pro, Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor member, and friend of the program, Darren Woodson joins the show. Pat and Darren chat about Dak Prescott signing the franchise tag, and whether or not Darren thinks a deal will get done before the July 15th date, how the Cowboys are going to afford everyone including potentially bringing in Jamal Adams from the New York Jets, who actually controls the contracts and money: Jerry or Stephen Jones, and whether or not Darren thinks the NFL will go off without a hitch this year (1:25:06-1:40:42). Don’t forget to send in a picture of where you’re listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free march. We appreciate you rocking with us. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
