  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There's no better time to prepare for winter. In this podcast I’m sharing my best tips for how to prepare for winter, including every area of the homestead. We’re talking about the animals, their shelter and their feed. The gardens, berry bushes and fruit orchards. And we’re even covering some of the household fall chores (think spring cleaning but in the fall) as well as getting the pantry stocked for winter. For all of the show notes and links, visit <a href= \"https://melissaknorris.com/364\">https://melissaknorris.com/364</a>.</span></p>",
