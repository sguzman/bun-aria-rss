A limited edition cigar, available at <a href='http://2guyscigars.com/'>2guyscigars.com</a>. We will also discuss the trip of a lifetime as David Garofalo returns from Cuba and tells us what gifts he brought back for us to smoke and we will find out how much rum he drank but more importantly what some of the best cigars he smoked were. All this and the usual shenanigans that is The Cigar Authority. ﻿",
