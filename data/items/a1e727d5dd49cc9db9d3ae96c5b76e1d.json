  "description": "<p>So you are new to cigar smoking and walking into a humidor could be a daunting experience. So many cigars to choose from but where do you begin. Inspired by an upcoming article in Cigar Journal magazine we walk you through the process on how to pick a cigar. Choosing wisely could be the turning point to a life long passion or just a fad and we will offer our insights to help you make that decision.</p>\n<p>This show isn’t just for novices because we’ve all picked up a cigar that just didn’t do it for us. We have some suggestions that will help you spend your hard earned money, wisely.</p>\n<p>In the first hour we will smoke the United Churchill as we ask the questions, does gender matter? Size? Strength? Price? Brand? We will answer these questions and more.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we will smoke the Perdomo 20th Anniversary Maduro as we unveil who will be making the 2020 Firecracker. We’ve had a lot of people guessing, but it’s time to pull back the curtain and make the announcement.</p>\n<p>We will have this all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.2GuysCigars.com%2F&redir_token=__oxaDyDdFvL0tSDitXGL8P7Hqd8MTU2NTQ2OTY0NkAxNTY1MzgzMjQ2&event=video_description&v=5KB10PtanU4'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
