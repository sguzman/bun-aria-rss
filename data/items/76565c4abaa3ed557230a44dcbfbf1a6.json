  "title": "Spittin' Chiclets Episode 93: Featuring Nello Ferrara & A Senators Meltdown",
  "description": "<p><p>On Episode 93, the guys open up with the dual PR disasters coming out of Canada's capital. Ottawa Senators assistant GM Randy Lee was accused of giving an unsolicited shoulder rub to a 19-year-old hotel shuttle driver and allegedly made lewd comments regarding his (Lee's) wrench as well. Meanwhile, Melinda Karlsson filed for a peace bond (Canadian restraining order, roughly) against Mike Hoffman's longtime fiancée Monika Caryk because Caryk is alleged to have made some preposterously crazy comments online regarding the Karlsson's stillborn child. Several other WAGs backed Karlsson's account. And that's just the tip of the (alleged) lunatic iceberg and another indication of how quickly it's fallen apart for the Sens. The fellas also discuss the Islanders/John Tavares situation before Biz interviews Nello Ferrara about his wild ride through the minor leagues. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
