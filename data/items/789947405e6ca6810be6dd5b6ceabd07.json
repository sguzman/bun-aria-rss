You have anything and everything you could ever want. You've started companies, written books, gone on tours—you name it. But your body isn't in the best shape. You've put it second to your career goals. And now, it's starting to show.</p><br><p>Your health is a different kind of wealth. Taking care of your finances is important, but so is taking care of your body. If you neglect your body, your body will neglect you. As you age, this only gets harder. You won't be able to enjoy life because you'll feel tired, sick, or miserable.</p><br><p>Of course, exercise is vital to maintaining good health, but so are the foods that you eat. The food we eat has an impact on our brain chemistry, our physical health, our community, and even climate change!</p><br><p>It's easy to eat the processed food that's offered to us daily, but if we want to start investing in our health, it's time for a change.</p><br><p>If there's one person who knows how to help, it's Dr. Mark Hyman.</p><br><p>Dr. Mark Hyman is leading a health revolution—one revolved around using food as medicine to support longevity, energy, mental clarity, happiness, and so much more.</p><br><p>Dr. Hyman is a practicing family physician and an internationally recognized leader, speaker, educator, and advocate in the field of Functional Medicine. He's the founder and director of The UltraWellness Center, is the Head of Strategy and Innovation of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, AND is the Board President for Clinical Affairs for The Institute for Functional Medicine.&nbsp;</p><br><p>And somehow, in the midst of all this, he's a twelve-time New York Times bestselling author and hosts one of the leading health podcasts, The Doctor's Farmacy.&nbsp;He's also a regular medical contributor on several television shows and networks, including CBS This Morning, the Today Show, Good Morning America, The View, The Dr. Oz Show, and CNN.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Needless to say, he's an expert. Dr. Hyman is one of my favorite people to learn from about health because he is so honest about what’s going on. Instead of trying to push his own agenda, he’s got humanity’s best interest at heart.</p><br><p>If you're wanting to invest in your health, look no further!
