  "description": "<p>In the early morning hours of March 13, 1964, 28-year-old Kitty Genovese was murdered in front of her building in Kew Gardens, Queens. According to the New York Times story that followed, 38 people watched the murder happen and did nothing. 50 years later, her brother is on a mission to uncover the truth. Is it possible that nobody tried to help her? Did she really die scared and alone? Why was she attacked? Could she have been saved?Through his investigation her brother gets to know her in a way he never knew her in life.\n Also, you guys, this episode is VERY Queens-centric and Gillian, our resident Queen...s.... (former) resident is our guide. We learn about Diners and cigar clubs, and bars that open at 8 am. And get ready for the accents and to #BeAnEarWitness.</p>\n",
