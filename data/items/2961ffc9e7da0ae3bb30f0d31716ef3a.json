  "description": "<p>Maker spaces are popping up all over where people can go and work with tools of all sorts, from woodworking to advanced 3D printers, to make things for themselves or prototype designs to manufacture. Seattle has been bereft of a large-scale facility with everything under one roof — until now. Ellie and Mike Kemery have just opened <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elliekemery\">Makerhaus</a>, a 10,000-square-foot building chock full of everything makers need. But their secret sauce, they hope, is community and education among their members. We talk about what a maker space can mean to bring all the hardware, software, and people together in one place to make magic happen.</p>\n<p>This episode is the first in the series in which I talk to facilitators: firms set up to help artists and producers connect with an audience. I'll be talking more over the coming weeks to a mix of creators and these new kinds of intermediaries that help rather than hinder achieving one's goals and finding an audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsored by</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/newdisruptors\">Squarespace</a>: Everything you need to build exceptional websites!</p>\n\n\n",
