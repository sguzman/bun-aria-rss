  "description": "The co-hosts of New Books in Political Science, Dr. Lilly J. Goren (Carroll University) and Dr. Susan Liebell (Saint Joseph’s University) looked back at the year.\nWe want YOUR insights on the podcast -- so please Tweet or email us with your favorite podcasts of the year and the authors you want us to interview!\nsliebell@sju.edu|SusanLiebell lgoren@carrollu.edu | LillyGoren\nSusan’s favorite podcasts included Black Political Thought: From David Walker to the Present (Cambridge University Press 2020) edited by Sherrow O. Pinder (Professor of Political Science and Multicultural and Gender Studies, California State University, Chico). The podcast included Dr. Pinder as well as chapter authors Charisse Burden-Stelly (POL and Africana Studies at Carleton College and now U of Chicago as a fellow), Babacar M’Baye (Kent State University, English and Pan-African Studies), and Brenda E. Stevenson (Professor of History, UCLA). This is a great anthology that leans into interdisciplinarity and it is a terrific resource for teaching (Susan’s students really connected with the bold and insightful introductions to the chapters as well as the choices of primary texts.) Susan also loved her conversation with Dr. Peniel E. Joseph (Barbara Jordan Chair in Ethics and Political Values; Professor of Public Affairs and History, LBJ School of Public Affairs and College of Liberal Arts at The University of Texas at Austin) about The Sword and the Shield: The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. (Basic Books 2020). The common myth of opposition distorts our understanding of civil rights. Josephs argues that they shared a revolutionary path in search of black dignity, citizenship, and human rights. A terrific podcast that underlines the importance of history.\nLilly was hard pressed to choose her favorite podcasts, since so many were fascinating and engaging, but she quite enjoyed her two conversations (because of technical problems it needed to be recorded twice) with Dr. Adam H. Domby (Assistant Professor of History, University of Charleston) about his new book, The False Cause: Fraud, Fabrication, and White Supremacy in Confederate Memory (University of Virginia Press, 2020). The False Cause is particularly timely given the broader cultural and political conversations about confederate monuments, the renaming of domestic military bases, and the whole concept of historical memory, and how it is shaped and understood. Lilly found the book, Histories of Dirt: Media and Urban Life in Colonial and Postcolonial Lagos (Duke University Press, 2020), fascinating and captivating on multiple levels. Interviewing Dr. Stephanie Newell (Professor of English at Yale University and Professor Extraordinaire at the University of Stellenbosch) about the research and her experience only added to that fascination. Dr. Newell, along with a team of researchers across a variety of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences, explore this idea of “dirt” across the long 20th century and how this concept and terminology are understood on a variety of levels by different populations, especially in context of colonial and postcolonial experiences in West Africa and beyond.\nSusan Liebell is associate professor of political science at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia. \nLilly J. Goren is professor of political science at Carroll University in Waukesha, WI. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
