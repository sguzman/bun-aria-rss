  "description": "<p>Robots planning long-horizon behavior in complex environments must be able to\nquickly reason about the impact of the environment's geometry on what plans are\nfeasible, i.e., whether there exist action parameter values that satisfy all\nconstraints on a candidate plan. In tasks involving articulated and movable\nobstacles, typical Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) algorithms spend most of\ntheir runtime attempting to solve unsolvable constraint satisfaction problems\nimposed by infeasible plan skeletons. We developed a novel Transformer-based\narchitecture, PIGINet, that predicts plan feasibility based on the initial\nstate, goal, and candidate plans, fusing image and text embeddings with state\nfeatures. The model sorts the plan skeletons produced by a TAMP planner\naccording to the predicted satisfiability likelihoods. We evaluate the runtime\nof our learning-enabled TAMP algorithm on several distributions of kitchen\nrearrangement problems, comparing its performance to that of non-learning\nbaselines and algorithm ablations. Our experiments show that PIGINet\nsubstantially improves planning efficiency, cutting down runtime by 80% on\naverage on pick-and-place problems with articulated obstacles. It also achieves\nzero-shot generalization to problems with unseen object categories thanks to\nits visual encoding of objects.\n</p>",
