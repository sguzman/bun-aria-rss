The guys first get into the New York Giants personnel decision making as of late and if they could be a contender, since Kostos is a big Giants fan (4:36). Then, on the heels of Carson Wentz being talked about as a strong MVP candidate, they give their very early picks for 2019 NFL MVP (15:06). Next, the trio talks about the merits of Eli Manning's career including comparing him to his draft class-mates, Ben Roethlisberger and Phil Rivers (23:50). Finally, Shek, Brinson and Kostos round out the show with some 2019 QB either or's (55:45). </p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
