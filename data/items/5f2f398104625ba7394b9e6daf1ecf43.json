  "description": "<p>Scot and Jeff discuss Gram Parsons with Ben Jacobs.</p>\n<p><span><strong>Introducing the Band</strong></span>:</p>\n<p>Your hosts Scot Bertram (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScotBertram\">@ScotBertram</a>) and Jeff Blehar (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EsotericCD\">@EsotericCD</a>) with guest Ben Jacobs. Ben is senior political reporter for <em>Jewish Insider</em>. Ben is on Twitter at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/bencjacobs\">@BenCJacobs</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Ben’s Music Pick</span>: Gram Parsons</strong></p>\n<p>Considered to be one of the godfathers of country rock, Gram Parsons had his own name for what he was trying to achieve: “cosmic American music”. That meant country, blues, soul, rock, and folk all rolled into one. Parsons’ output during his short time on earth is staggering for its quality and quantity. Before his death at the age of 26, Parsons had formed the International Submarine Band before leaving to join The Byrds. After only a few short months in that band, he quit to create the Flying Burrito Brothers. Following his dismissal from the Burritos, he crafted two immaculate solo albums with the help of Emmylou Harris. None of the records sold very well at the time, but virtually all have become classics of the genre. It’s entirely possible, even as a music fan, you’re entirely unfamiliar with Parsons oeuvre. No worries! We’ll walk you through the catalog, explain what’s important and why, and celebrate the vision of an American original: Gram Parsons.<strong> </strong></p>\n",
