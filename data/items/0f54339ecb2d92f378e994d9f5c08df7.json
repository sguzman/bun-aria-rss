    "media:description": "Will quantum computing ever become a reality, making existing software developers obsolete? \n\nThis video is an excerpt from \"Exploring Quantum Computing Concepts Using Java Applications\" by Johan Vos. Visit http://mng.bz/698D to watch the full video.\n\nðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“š\nThis video references the book Quantum Computing for Developers by Johan Vos | http://mng.bz/49nB \nTo save 40% off this book use discount code: watchvos40\nðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“š\n\nAbout the book:\n\"Quantum Computing in Action\" will make sure youâ€™re prepared to start programming when quantum supercomputing becomes a practical reality for production systems.\n\nRather than a hardware manual or academic theory guide, this book is focused on practical implementations of quantum computing algorithms. Using Strange, a Java-based quantum computer simulator, youâ€™ll go hands-on with quantum computingâ€™s core components including qubits and quantum gates as you write your very first quantum code. By the end of the book youâ€™ll be ahead of the game with the skills to create quantum algorithms using standard Java and your favorite IDE and build tools.",
