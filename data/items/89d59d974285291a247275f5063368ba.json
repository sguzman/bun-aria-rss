  "description": "“One-off” protests don’t change the world; sustained direct action campaigns do. That’s one of the many insights from George Lakey in his new book, How We Win: A Guide to Nonviolent Direct Action Campaigning (Melville House, 2018). Lakey, a retired Swarthmore professor for Issues of Social Change, has been involved in progressive activism for seven decades. In How We Win, he has written practical handbook for budding organizers. Lakey explains how activists can build diverse coalitions, set achievable goals and develop effective tactics. He explores the practical benefit on nonviolent tactics and the importance of persuading “neutrals” to your side. And he draws from his own successes in hopes of passing down knowledge to future generations of changemakers.\nBill Scher is a Contributing Editor for POLITICO Magazine. He has provided political commentary on CNN, NPR and MSNBC. He has been published in The New York Times, The New Republic, and The New York Daily News among other publications. He is author of Wait!
