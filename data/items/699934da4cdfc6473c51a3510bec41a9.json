  "description": "<p>Do you ever have moments of terrible realization where you recognize that you're living on autopilot? Instead of feeling like you're in the driver's seat, you feel like life is happening to you. You're just going through the motions, you've lost your spark, and the months and years slide by in an indistinct blur. </p>\n<p>My guest today has been there himself, and has an action plan for how to find your way out. His name is <a href=\"https://theantonioneves.com/\">Antonio Neves</a>, and he's a writer, speaker, and success coach, as well as the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593136837/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0593136837&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Stop Living on Autopilot: Take Responsibility for Your Life and Rediscover a Bolder, Happier You</em></a>. At the start of our conversation, Antonio shares his own experience with outwardly having a life that seemed happy and successful, while inwardly feeling totally lost and stuck. We then turn to some really great, incisive questions to ask yourself to assess if you’re coasting in life and to become more accountable to the changes you need to make to start intentionally steering again. We talk about what you're really missing when you say you miss the good old days, how to ensure the best of your life is ahead of you instead of behind you, and why you need to make a list of all your current complaints. We then discuss the importance of who you surround yourself with, why you need allies instead of thieves in your circle, and the difference something called \"Man Mornings\" has made in Antonio's life. We end our conversation with concrete steps you can start taking today to shift out of autopilot, including Antonio's personal checklist of five things he does every day to ensure it's a good one.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes <a href=\"aom.is/autopilot\">aom.is/autopilot</a>.</p>\n",
