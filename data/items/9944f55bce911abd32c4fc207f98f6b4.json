  "description": "<p>In the first segment of episode 68 we covered the Coronavirus’s impact on last weeks stock market meltdown. We discussed how the virus has affected global business and dissected the state of the stock market. We looked at areas that could benefit, areas that will most likely fall even further and we also discussed strategies for confused investors during this time. In the second segment we covered Amazon’s latest innovation, Amazon Go, which is a cashier-less grocery store in Seattle. Amazon Go is fascinating on a few levels and has the potential to change the face of business in every area of retail shopping. In the last segment we covered the tragic, yet teachable story of the Famous Amos cookie company. The lessons in this story are vital for any entrepreneur or aspiring business person. #Investingtips #Retailbusiness EYL Website: https://www.earnyourleisure.com/ Brand Resumes: https://brandresumes.com/eyl/ --- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a> Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support\">https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
