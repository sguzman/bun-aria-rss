  "description": "Did your mum and dad teach you to save money rather than borrow? It was better to have cash than be in debt. Yet the whole approach to money has turned on its head. We don’t save as much as we used to. In fact, we borrow to invest. It’s a generational change. In this week’s podcast Phil Dobbie asks Steve Keen whether it’s something we should worry about.
