  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Ordinary Language Philosophy, a school of thought which emerged in Oxford in the years following World War II. With its roots in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Ordinary Language Philosophy is concerned with the meanings of words as used in everyday speech. Its adherents believed that many philosophical problems were created by the misuse of words, and that if such 'ordinary language' were correctly analysed, such problems would disappear. Philosophers associated with the school include some of the most distinguished British thinkers of the twentieth century, such as Gilbert Ryle and JL Austin.\n\nWith:\n\nStephen Mulhall\nProfessor of Philosophy at New College, Oxford\n\nRay Monk\nProfessor of Philosophy at the University of Southampton\n\nJulia Tanney\nReader in Philosophy of Mind at the University of Kent\n\nProducer: Thomas Morris.",
