Also Five Headlines including the latest Democrat politician to violate his own COVID restrictions, and the Daily Beast uncovers a massive scandal. Apparently a Christian politician tried to convert some people to Christianity. Shocking stuff. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel Canada. They’ve been begging for it for years.
