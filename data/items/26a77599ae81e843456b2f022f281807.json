I will play some of the audio Randy has and I hope it comes across on the podcast.</p> <p>Randy Harrington joins the show. Randy is one of my favorite investigators because he is always thinking outside of the box. Randy writes “have done a couple interviews with Wes, and I spoke with him yesterday about what has been going on with my adventures over the last few years since my last interview.</p> <p>I was out with some fellow researchers in Missouri, and we captured 2 fantastic thermal video’s of our target species…..will chat with Wes tonight about it and other happenings as of late, Think he will make another show out of it. my previous episodes were 109, and 225 if anyone wants to refresh their memories…”</p> <p>Randy will be sharing some of his audio recordings with us and some of the tricks he is using to get the creatures to come in.
