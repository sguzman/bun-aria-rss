  "description": "<p>How the European Union relates to the world of business has long been a matter of great contention. Scepticism towards the EU on the right of politics has for decades been fuelled by the perception that Brussels is a bureaucratic regulation generator, with little understanding of how business operates. On the Eurosceptic left, by contrast, the EU has been seen as a capitalist club, in hock to big business, incapable of seeing the interests of ordinary people.</p><p>How has the relationship between business and the EU evolved over time? How does it vary from sector to sector? And what does it all mean for policy outcomes? A new book sheds much fresh light. Called <i>Business Lobbying in the European Union</i>, the book is co-authored by UCL’s very own David Coen, along with Alexander Katsaitis from the London School of Economics and Matia Vannoni from King's College London. </p><p><strong>Host:</strong> Dr Alan Renwick</p><p>Professor David Coen</p><p><a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/business-lobbying-in-the-european-union-9780199589753?lang=en&cc=gb#\" target=\"_blank\"><i><strong>Business Lobbying in the European Union</strong></i></a></p>\n",
