  "description": "<p>Today on The Literary Life Podcast, our hosts continue their series on Charles Dickens’ <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/3cI6L92\">Hard Times</a>.</em> Angelina, Cindy and Thomas open the conversation with their commonplace quotes, which all lead into the discussion of <em>Hard Times.</em> They start out highlighting once again the fairytale and allegory aspects of this story, including the setting of Coketown. Together they talk about the two sides of Sissy Jupe’s education, along with the situations and portrayals of the other key characters in this section. A large part of the discussions centers around the ideas of input and output versus sowing and reaping.</p> <p>Purchase the recordings of our 2022 Back to School Conference at <a href= \"https://morningtimeformoms.com/events/1758-2/\">MorningTimeforMoms.com</a>.
