  "description": "Our guests today are a husband-and-wife team, Britt and Damian Zunino, of the Manhattan based architecture and interiors firm Studio DB. Their work has been featured in Luxe Magazine, Architectural Digest, The New York Times, ELLE Decor, and many others. We talk about their love of creative spaces, how New York has influenced their style, and how they aim to create a space that is beautiful but also livable, their collaboration process, and more. Their work exudes a swankiness that we really love, so be sure to check out their portfolio!\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nHow Britt would describe their style.\n\nDiscussing the curvilinear elements, features, materials, color palette and other customization they chose for The Symon project.\n\nMore about Britt and Damian’s unique country home outside of the city.\n\nBritt’s tips for making bold choices start with choosing a color palette.\n\nDesigning around the unique pipes in the TriBeCa Franklin Street Loft.\n\nHow to design when you have very high ceilings.\n\nWhy you should invest more in lighting, especially with kids at home.\n\nWhat is Britt and Damian’s collaboration process?\n\nWhere does the color palette in their projects come from?\n\nHow they design custom cabinetry with creative detailing.\n\nTips & Tricks for designing kid’s rooms and small spaces.\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma\nHi Malorie,\nWe love the idea of bringing in the pink, but with the color palette that you have we need to bring something to tie it in. The first option would be to incorporate a fun wallpaper on the ceiling that had some of these colors to bring it all together. Maybe something in pink with a micropattern. We thought maybe it would be nice to add two more swivel chairs that had a pretty back so you can see that right when you walk in but also be able to turn them around to watch television. We have even done something where we have upholstered the back of the chair in a different fabric that is a little more playful and the seat is more durable. Rather than having all of the furniture on the outside of the room, the swivel chairs will help pull it in and engage that space. Another option if you didn’t want to go the wallpaper route is to paint the ceiling a little bit of a softer green than what’s on the walls so it feels like a more uniform envelope of color. We love the idea of a stripe on the rug. Also, something in a pretty neutral, like a seagrass rug, would be nice. Then you could even layer on top of it with a more colorful or patterned rug to anchor the seating space. That one can be much smaller and cozier, and the bottom rug would stretch more towards the walls. To touch on the blue chair, the shape is really interesting but since you have so many lighter colors in the room you could reupholster this one to fit better with the room. It would be nice to even add a little footstool or side table.\nWe also want to say that you’ve done a really good job! We love the custom sofa, the sofa table, the lamps, the sconces, the bench seat. It’s a great space and you’re really onto something that you just need something to tie it together. Good luck and send us the after photos!\nMentioned in This Episode:\n\nStudio DB\n\nStudio DB on Instagram\n\nThe Symon",
