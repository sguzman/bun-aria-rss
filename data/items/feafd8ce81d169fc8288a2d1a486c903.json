The results were really interesting and actually helped me understand even more about fractals and chaos.\n\nSource Code:\nhttps://github.com/HackerPoet/FractalSoundExplorer\n\nIf you like the things I do and want to support the channel:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/codeparade\nhttps://ko-fi.com/codeparade\n\nIf you're a fractal fan, you'll be interested in my other fractal videos too.
