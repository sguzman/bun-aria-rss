  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, Mark acknowledges the passing of broadcaster Bob Beckel. Beckel was an old-school Scoop Jackson type of Democrat that believed in what was right whether you agreed with him or not and he will be missed. Then, the Putin apologists mock the president of Ukraine for arresting the opposition forces, but Zelensky had them locked up because these 'separatist' groups are funded by Putin. President Abraham Lincoln faced a similar issue during the American Civil War and took extraordinary actions to keep the Union together. Later, Marxist Justin Trudeau is Canada’s Putin. All Levinites should to forgo visiting or purchasing from the provinces of Ottawa and Ontario. Also, can we strengthen our own border and support Ukraine's border? It is possible to support the national sovereignty of the United States and the sovereignty of Ukraine. Finally, former Ambassador Carla Sands joins the show to discuss her candidacy for Pennsylvania's US Senate seat.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
