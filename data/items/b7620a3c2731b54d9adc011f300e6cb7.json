Over the course of his 13-year tenure as chief, he had built his police department into a paramilitary-style force that enforced the racial boundaries of the city. \nRodney King’s beating had exposed the brutality of Gates’ police force to the city. In the weeks after the video aired, L.A.’s most powerful institutions joined together to call for an end to Gates’ career and the style of policing that had resulted in King’s beating. \nBut even with much of the city’s political leadership unified against him, Gates was ready for a fight.\nSeason 6 of Slow Burn is produced by Joel Anderson, Jayson De Leon, Ethan Brooks, Sophie Summergrad, and Jasmine Ellis. \nMixing by Merritt Jacob.\nSlate Plus members get bonus episodes of Slow Burn and ad-free podcast feeds.
