Recruit Mayors to set the tone of your settlement, build housing, control crime and ensure your baby-booms don’t negatively impact your resources.\nSurvive Disasters. Heed the early warning signs, bunker down and secure your citizens away from danger or risk losing all that you’ve established.\nExplore Unique Maps. With each map randomly generated, right down to its resources and landmarks, every experience is unique and brings with it its own challenges.\nDiscover Rare Blueprints. Offering powerful effects, unique themes and styles, rare blueprints are an opportunity to customize your settlement even further when you’ve mastered trading.\nDevelop Currency and Trade. Whether exchanging artistic items of high value, unprocessed products or unlocking the mint to create a common currency, trade is key.\n\n#realcivilengineer #citybuilder #settlementsurvival",
