  "description": "Contributor(s): Dr Eduardo Cavallo, Marla Dukharan, Dr Andrew Powell, Professor Andrés Velasco | The year 2020 will be remembered as one of the most challenging in modern history. Latin America and the Caribbean lost 7.4% of GDP, the largest drop on record in a single year. The region is expected to recover in 2021 but faces a hazardous time ahead. Most countries will require some type of adjustment to maintain fiscal sustainability. While the way forward will be challenging, specific public policies should help countries realize a stronger recovery, not just to the low growth rates of the pre-pandemic period, but to higher rates of growth that will benefit all, with more efficient public policies, higher productivity in the private sector, and more sustainable economies.\nMeet our speakers and chair\nEduardo Cavallo is Principal Economist at the Research Department of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in Washington DC. Prior to joining the IDB, Eduardo was a Vice-President and Senior Latin American Economist for Goldman Sachs in New York. Eduardo had already worked at the IDB as a Research Economist between 2006 and 2010. Before that he served as a research fellow at the Center for International Development (CID), a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and a member of the faculty at the Kennedy School of Government's Summer Program. In Argentina he co-founded Fundación Grupo Innova.\nMarla Dukharan (@Marladukharan) is a Caribbean economist. She is a point of reference for monitoring regional developments and country-level economic performance, and is known for leading discussions and publishing reports on the Caribbean implications of global geopolitical developments. Marla has become a key influencer in public-private sector engagement and decision making. Because of her deep commitment to making a difference, Marla has become a leading voice in the call to reduce gender and income inequality, eliminate corruption, and to improve the resilience of our economies through the introduction of fiscal responsibility frameworks.\nAndrew Powell (@AndyPowell_IDB) is the Principal Advisor in the Research Department (RES) at the Inter-American Development Bank. He holds a Ba, MPhil. and DPhil. (PhD) from the University of Oxford, was Lecturer at Queen Mary’s College, London and at the University of Warwick.

Our approach creates professionals with the ability to analyse, understand and resolve the challenges of contemporary governance.\nThe Inter-American Development Bank (@the_IDB) is the largest source of development financing for Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThis event forms part of LSE’s Shaping the Post-COVID World initiative, a series imagining what the world could look like after the crisis, and how we get there.",
