  "description": "<p>Fairfield Hills State Hospital was a state run mental health facility in Connecticut that was opened to alleviate the overcrowding in other asylums. The facility was pleasing to the eyes from the outside, but within its walls unspeakable acts were taking place. This was not a place of rehabilitation, but more a place of experimentation. Just as we have found to be the case at other asylums during this time period, barbaric practices were followed and many \"mysterious\" deaths were the result. This has led to the typical result: hauntings. We also will share the curse of Charles Island, which is not far from Newtown, and it involves pirates! But is there only one curse on this island or could there be more? Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of these two Connecticut locations. The Moment in Oddity is by Bob Sherfield and features Mother Shipton and This Day in History is by Steven Pappas and features First American Space Walk. This location is suggested by listeners Paige Sherman and Michael Rogers and our Research Assistant is April Rogers-Krick.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/06/hgb-ep-128-fairfield-hills-state.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/06/hgb-ep-128-fairfield-hills-state.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
