  "title": "Ep. 192: Houston Week Jacob Medina",
  "description": "Houston Week continues with Day 4 featuring the awesome and talented Jacob Medina. Jacob started his design firm, Jacob Medina Interiors in 2016 and now people seek out this boutique interior design firm for their expertise on everything from clean and handsome to luxe and funky. Jacob talks with us about his interesting path to design, starting with a degree in biology and teaching himself many of the basics and important technological skills. He shares the inspiration behind his handsome style featuring clean lines and a little twist of style and funk and tells us why there is no such thing as too many chairs. Jacob also gives us his real thoughts on using gray, how to emulate his purple kitchen, and the importance of starting with a cabinet plan in the kitchen. Jacob makes us laugh (and agree) when he makes the analogy between a good designer and a good marriage counselor — trying their best to make everyone happy with the end results!\n\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nJacob is not your average designer — he started with a degree in biology and was pre-med! He taught himself many of the programs he knows today.\n\nJacob and his team focus on everything from residential projects including new construction, home renovation, and decorating.\n\nYes, he is chair obsessed! There is no such thing as too many chairs, especially once we start entertaining again!\n\nHow Jacob uses custom pieces and vintage to capture the essence of what the client is looking for in their soul.\n\nGray will be here to stay, but Jacob tells us how to use it responsibly without making it boring or drab.\n\nJacob talks about painting a kitchen a light mauve / purple color — and it works!\n\nThe importance of starting with a cabinet plan.\n\nIdeas for keeping your kitchen neutral but adding a bold colored backsplash.\n\nColors Jacob wants to see more inclusion of mustard yellow, rusty colors, and more patterns! We also talk about mixing plaids and florals and warm / cool tones.\n\nChanging the front door can make such a big difference!\n\nEveryone needs a little funky art in their life.\n\nHacks for testing paint on your wall, and finding your favorite whites!\n\nDecorating Dilemma\nEven though we talked a lot about finding your best white paint color in this episode, Jacob doesn’t think white would be best here. A pale greige would be a good place to start. Check out Sherwin Williams Agreeable Gray for a starter idea! We think moving the desk to where the table is facing the window could be a great idea and less boxed in. A square or rectangle table would be best, or maybe a banquette to go with the table you’ve already got, but not a round or oval table. A navy wall could feel neutral and not too much with some larger art on the long wall. As far as your coffee table, if it serves a function such as storage or a space to eat, then we can keep it. If not, you may want three different-sized tables for drinks instead!\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\n\nJacob Medina\nWhy is it so hard to choose a paint color?\n@jacobmedinainteriordesign",
