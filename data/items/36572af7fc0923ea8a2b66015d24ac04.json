  "description": "Biodiversity – that’s the subject of a major report from the UN this week – and it comes with an alarming warning: the variety and fabric of life on earth is in rapid decline all over the planet. Because of human behaviour, nearly a million species are facing extinction and many ecosystems are being irreversibly degraded. Using knowledge from both scientists and indigenous groups, the report highlights threats to clean water and air, and warns that soil damage could make it impossible to curb climate change. The solution? Sweeping and radical change, says the UN. We’ll look at the severity of this crisis that faces us all. And we’ll ask: how can people, businesses and governments be made to value nature? This week, Celia Hatton is joined by a group of experts to discuss what can be done to save life on earth.",
