  "description": "The end of the story of Jason, Medea, and the Argonauts. Things have been pretty easy for Jason. Medea solved all of his problems before he even knew he had them on the Argo, and her fairly violent murder-by-proxy of Pelias secured Iolcus for Jason's father. It would probably be a very bad idea to cheat on Medea, right? Hard times are about to catch up with Jason. The creature of the week is the selkie, and they will either give you a tragically beautiful story to tell your half-seal children, or curse your entire island...depending on how creepy you are.
