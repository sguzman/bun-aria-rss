  "description": "<p>We are joined on today's episode by freelance writer Bill Clayton. The term asylum brings about many images and most of them are not pleasant. Particularly the asylums of years ago. Today, we know more about mental illness and have better plans for caring for people, but in the past, mentally ill people were treated as cast offs and it was permissable to do horrid things to these people. One of the most notorious asylums in America was Eloise Asylum. Conditions were overcrowded and care was subpar at times. The asylum grew from the origins of a poorhouse to a schoolhouse and post office to a series of buildings built over the years to house the large amount of sick and mentally ill people brought here. Eloise is reputed to be one of the most haunted locations in the Detroit area for good reason. There is also a cemetery nearby named Butler Cemetery that has a reputation for being haunted. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Eloise Asylum. Moment in Oddity features a cleaning lady that thwarted a Nazi spy ring and This Day in History features the First Ball Drop on New Years Eve.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here with links to articles by Bill Clayton:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/12/hgb-podcast-ep-93-eloise-asylum.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/12/hgb-podcast-ep-93-eloise-asylum.html</a></p> <p>Become an integral part of the show as an Executive Producer:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
