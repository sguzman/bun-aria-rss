  "link": "https://bourbonpursuit.com/2018/05/17/149-art-gamble-bourbon-blending-ed-bley-old-baldy/",
  "description": "Picking a single barrel out of a line up seems relatively simple when compared to blending tens or hundreds of barrels together to hit a specific bourbon taste profile. Where does that process begin? Do you start with a few and keep taste testing? Is it a math formula of X spicy barrels to Y sweet barrels? This episode features  Ed Bley, blender behind the underground phenomenon known as Old Baldy. We ask Ed what it's like to go from picking single barrels to learning how to blend multiple barrels to hit a distinct flavor spot. It's an art form that Ed describes as trying to perfect the \"witch's hat\".\nShow Notes:\n\nWere you trying to make something truly unique?\n\nHow did you get access to the warehouse to start creating your own private label?\n\nDo most blenders have a lot of this down to a science where they know what warehouses are going to yield a specific flavor profile?\n\nDid you at one point think, well we may have just thrown away a bunch of barrels while waiting for it to marry in a tank?\n\nWere you experimenting with finished whiskies at home to perfect this?\n\nWas there a teacher that go you to this point?\n\nAre people mad because they don't have access?\n\nWhat's your advice to people on how they can experiment at home?\n\nWhat are the elements of the bourbon flavor wheel are you looking for?\n\nDo you think people get turned off from grain flavors?\n\nWhat problems do you run into when you scale from a few barrels to barrels in the teens or small 20s?\n\nDo you think people are a little crazy that they are paying hundreds of dollars for your blend?\n\nWhat's your plan for the next one?\n\nIs the best way to learn to do this is to learn how to break down single barrels?\n\nDo you think you are helping revive blended straight whiskey?\n\nHear all of Ed's Podcast's at http://bourbonpursuit.com/?s=bley",
