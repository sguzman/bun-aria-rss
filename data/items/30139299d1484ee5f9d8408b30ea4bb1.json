  "description": "Anna’s long-time friend Lance Bass joins her and Sim in this earnest and entertaining episode of “Unqualified.” Among other hilarious moments, Lance and Anna discuss Washington's thriving topless coffee-hut scene, assumptions made about Southerners, Lance’s early days as a boy-bander, and who he would cast to play him in the movie version of his life. The conversation also takes a more serious turn when Lance shares his struggles in coming out to his family and friends (including his band-mates in *NSYNC!). The gang gives plenty of unqualified advice too, this time to a woman who may or may not be in love with her platonic best friend, and a gay man whose straight college buddies are pressuring him to stay in the closet. <br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
