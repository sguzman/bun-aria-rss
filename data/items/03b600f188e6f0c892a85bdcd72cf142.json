  "description": "<p>This week we’re breaking down Dunder Mifflin Infinity. To kick off this two-part episode, Angela announces herself as 'Kinseypedia' for this episode and gets the inside scoop on the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website. Then, we discuss Toby outing Jim and Pam's relationship to the whole office, we learn how to make a cat look feral, and we get a major Old Tech Alert with Ryan's mandated Blackberry's. Finally, we discuss some very funny Kelly-Ryan drama, Jan's trendy outfit that is not too dissimilar to something Jenna may have worn, and Creed helps us answer fan questions about his hair dye job in this episode. We hope your hearts soar with the eagle’s nest after this episode!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Special thanks to Joya Balfour.
