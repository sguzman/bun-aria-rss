  "description": "<p>Barack Obama will release his presidential memoirs (two volumes) next week and the nauseating reviews are already rolling in. \"Discover Podcasts\" has released its 2020 award winners for best podcasts in several, perhaps even too many, categories. Only one Barstool podcast made the cut, so Kirk was excited to review the shows that this industry blog considers the best. The Barstool sales team has once again admonished Kirk for his handling of the ad reads, but he's taking it really well.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
