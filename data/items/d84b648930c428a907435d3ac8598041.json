  "description": "<p>Sunday Special: Jack Posobiec interviews Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene after she was dangerously swatted twice within two days in an attempt by a trans-activist to have her assassinated by manipulating the police. This was in response to Greene introducing the “Protect Innocence Act”, a bill that makes transgender surgeries for children illegal. Poso and Greene engage in an educational discussion about spiritual warfare and break down the difference between the local police and the FBI. Greene defends her argument that Congress and America need to support the local police; however, there needs to be a defunding of the FBI and other weaponized bureaucracies in order to eradicate political operatives from within the system and refocus the federal organizations on their original tasks. </p>",
