  "content:encoded": "\n<p>Over the last decade, I have worked with highly talented data science teams from several different industries, including marketing, advertising, automotive, financial services, and cybersecurity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have contributed to most of the lifecycle phases, worked with executives and stakeholders across many different functions, and seen recent advancements in the machine learning field reach an unthinkable level of maturity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, one thing I have not dealt with is lacking the required sponsorship and resources. Nonetheless, I have to acknowledge that many organizations still struggle with turning these advances into tangible profits. Unfortunately, the majority of ML projects get stuck in a proof-of-concept stage without ever reaching customers and generating revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the above reasons, I have been recently investing in figuring out what are the fundamentals that enable organizations to become successful machine learning enterprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The conference</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst in the process of discovering those key takeaways, I was invited to give a talk at the <a href=\"https://technologytransfer.it/machine-learning-for-the-enterprise/\">Machine Learning for the Enterprises international conference in Rome</a> and I decided to present an <a href=\"http://Manager's Guide to Effective Building of Machine Learning Products.https://www.slideshare.net/gmspacagna/managers-guide-to-effective-building-of-machine-learning-products\">overview of the lessons and pitfalls I have learned while managing machine learning products</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The articles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following up on that topic, I have developed with more details those concepts into a series of articles published on the Helixa&#8217;s market research blog. In particular, I have identified 4 major areas that deserve to be analyzed in more details:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a href=\"https://www.helixa.ai/blog/understand-machine-learning\">Getting started with understanding and implementing Machine Learning</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.helixa.ai/blog/designing-machine-learning-products\">Designing the Right Machine Learning Product: From Strategy to Requirements</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.helixa.ai/blog/machine-learning-planning\">Planning Under Uncertainty: Agility in Machine Learning</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.helixa.ai/blog/building-machine-learning-teams\">Building a Balanced Machine Learning Team</a></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>The whitepaper</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the greatest artifact only came recently in the form of a visually appealing whitepaper that explains and covers many non-technical aspects that I considered useful for managers who want to bring machine learning into their organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to thank <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanbaum/\">Ryan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/laiapescetto/\">Laia</a>, from the Helixa&#8217;s marketing team, for their amazing work in editing, styling, and planning of this whitepaper. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/datasciencevademecum.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1601542211271.jpeg?resize=325%2C421&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2488\" width=\"325\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/datasciencevademecum.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1601542211271.jpeg?resize=791%2C1024&ssl=1 791w, https://i0.wp.com/datasciencevademecum.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1601542211271.jpeg?resize=232%2C300&ssl=1 232w, https://i0.wp.com/datasciencevademecum.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1601542211271.jpeg?resize=768%2C994&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/datasciencevademecum.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1601542211271.jpeg?w=800&ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://www.helixa.ai/machine-learning-guide-2020\">Download the whitepaper</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Please help me share it within your network and add your thoughts<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4a1.png\" alt=\"ðŸ’¡\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> in the comments below.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://datasciencevademecum.com/2020/11/30/the-managers-non-technical-guide-to-machine-learning/\">The Manager&#8217;s Non-Technical Guide to Machine Learning</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://datasciencevademecum.com\">Vademecum of Practical Data Science</a>.</p>\n",
