  "description": "<p>We explore the properties of a recently proposed background independent exact\nrenormalization group approach to gauge theories and gravity. In the process we\nalso develop the machinery needed to study it rigorously. The proposal comes\nwith some advantages. It preserves gauge invariance manifestly, avoids\nintroducing unphysical fields, such as ghosts and Pauli-Villars fields, and\ndoes not require gauge-fixing. However, we show that in the simple case of\nSU(N) Yang-Mills it does not completely regularise the longitudinal part of\nvertex functions already at one loop, invalidating certain methods for\nextracting universal components. Moreover we demonstrate a kind of no-go\ntheorem: within the proposed structure, whatever choice is made for\ncovariantisation and cutoff profiles, the two-point vertex flow equation at one\nloop cannot be both transverse, as required by gauge invariance, and fully\nregularised.\n</p>",
