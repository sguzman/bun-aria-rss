  "description": "Tom Bilyeu and Cindy (@essenceofcin) answer questions from the Impact Theory community. A few questions that get answered are:  For a young entrepreneur would you worry more about learning from a mentor or getting out and doing on your own? How do balance learning concepts to help with growth mindset (i.e. watching IT, reading books that you recommend) versus actually going out and executing? If you are in the rebel alliance, what is the empire? What are the challenges and benefits of spending your time building your own app versus just building up a large following on existing platforms? What are your top pieces of advice for social media growth right now, especially for reaching and keeping an audience of Gen Z and Millennials?  In this episode the Official Facebook Group was announced. For more information contact Cindy on social media or through <a href=\"mailto:connect@impacttheory.com\">connect@impacttheory.com</a>.
