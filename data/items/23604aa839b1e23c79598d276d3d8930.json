He also discusses his recent work, Songs for Murdered Sisters, which he created with the help of writer Margaret Atwood and singer Joshua Hopkins. \nAfter the interview, June and co-host Rumaan Alam talk about Joshua’s refined artistic instincts. Then they help a listener who wants to start publishing fiction again after a long break. \nSend your questions about creativity and any other feedback to working@slate.com or give us a call at (304) 933-9675. \nPodcast production by Cameron Drews.\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
