    "media:description": "Something strange has been happening lately. Lots of people are under the impression that images from the James Webb Space Telescope have somehow proven big bang cosmology wrong. This is very stupid and objectively wrong, but it has caused a confusion among even pro-science people, who have been asking me if there is any legitimacy to such claims. I decided a brief debunk was in order, to shine a spotlight on the fraud behind this frenzy, briefly explain why such a claim is so ridiculous, and link to other resources for further information.
