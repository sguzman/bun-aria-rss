  "description": "<p>Chip Baker is a fourth generation educator who has been a teacher/coach for 20 years, is the creator of  ‘Chip Baker – The Success Chronicles’ and the ‘Chip Baker Character Development Program’, and is a best selling author. His motto is ‘Live. Learn. Serve. Inspire. Go get it.’, and he brings this motivating statement to life in his conversation with Laura today.</p>\n<p>Beginning with a look at his own background and the powerful model his family provided for him in terms of service to others, Chip then relates his experiences as he entered the coaching field and the level of mentorship which these positions offered him. He shares the changes he has witnessed as a teacher/coach over the years, explores the qualities that make up a good coach, and reviews his transition from coaching to producing ‘The Success Chronicles’. With great passion and humor he shares some of his formulas for helping people achieve success, his own definition of success, what it takes to become an effective leader, and how to handle times of doubt. Chip’s remarkable warmth, wisdom, and humility shine through in this informative, entertaining and inspiring conversation.</p>\n<p>Episode Highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chip’s background and the example of service that his family provided him</li>\n<li>Chip’s early years with coaching</li>\n<li>The mentorship side of coaching</li>\n<li>The changes and the constants he has seen over the years</li>\n<li>What makes a quality coach</li>\n<li>Transitioning from coaching to producing ‘The Success Chronicles’</li>\n<li>Chip’s formulas for helping people to be successful</li>\n<li>His definition of success</li>\n<li>Becoming an effective leader</li>\n<li>Handling times of doubt</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Quotes:</p>\n<p>“I have stories upon stories upon the…positive difference that my family members made in the lives of others.”</p>\n<p>“If you are open-minded and you work hard and you treat people right…I believe that great things will happen for you.”</p>\n<p>“Input equals output.”</p>\n<p>“In any situation that we’re placed in, every choice we make either, you know, pushes us forward, or holds us back.”</p>\n<p>“I love that it all started with you wanting to give back, wanting to give service.”</p>\n<p>“Formulas are the way to help us get through things.”</p>\n<p>“Show up…have a great attitude…give your all.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not about me.”</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<p>The Pursuit of Gold homepage:   <a href=\"http://thepursuitofgold.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thepursuitofgold.com/</a> </p>\n<p>Laura’s Social Media:\nInstagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lala_the_diver\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.instagram.com/lala_the_diver</a>\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheLauraWilkinson\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/TheLauraWilkinson</a></p>\n<p>Connect with Chip:\nYouTube Channel:   <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ChipBakerTheSuccessChronicles/featured\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/c/ChipBakerTheSuccessChronicles/featured</a>\nOnline Store:   https://chip-baker-the-success-chronicles.square.site/﻿\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chipbakertsc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/chipbakertsc</a>\nInstagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chipbakertsc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.instagram.com/chipbakertsc/</a>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chipbaker19\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/chipbaker19</a></p>",
