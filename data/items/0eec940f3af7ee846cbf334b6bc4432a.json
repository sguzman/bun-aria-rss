  "description": "Kerry Foster of Penny Dog Patchwork is a self professed serial crafter, I like that! She has been working in the crafting industry sharing her things and when she learned to quilt has done the same. Her newest book is Paint by Number Quilts. This is her signature applique method of creating amazing animal quilts.\n---\nI love Barbara ‘B’ Cain’s fresh style of quilt pattern, She is an author and pattern designer. I am super fond of her airplane & blimp!! Also the bee, I see a pattern of flight here! I really love her use of color too. \n-------\nOne of my favorite things about working in the quilting industry is making new friends through. I had meet Christopher. But it was when we were both at a Baby lock ambassador event that we really had to change to chat. We’ve been friends ever since. He is a fabric designer for Riley Blake and creates amazing projects with his lines.\n================\nVisit American Patchwork & Quilting at www.allpeoplequilt.com.\nVisit host Pat Sloan at www.patsloan.com.\n================\nBONUS for our podcast subscribers!
