If women's clothes have pockets at all, they are often and smaller and just fit less than men’s pockets do. And when we talk about pockets, we are talking about who has access to the tools they need. Who can walk through the world comfortably and securely.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/aoi/\" target=\"_blank\">Articles of Interest</a></em> is a show about what we wear; a six-part series within <em>99% Invisible</em>, looking at clothing. It is produced and hosted by Avery Trufelman.
