The critical functions within the system on a chip (SoC) involve hardware and software that perform automotive-related signal communication at high data rates to and from the components off-chip. Every SoC includes general purpose IOs (GPIOs) on its periphery.</p> <p>For automotive SoCs, GPIO IP is typically developed as Safety Element out of Context and delivered with a set of Assumptions of Use. It is important that the GPIO blocks are treated as a safety related logic. In this role, GPIOs need safety analysis to mitigate any faults occurring in them before the result of fault occurrence causes a system-wide failure.</p> <p>This white paper describes some of the commonly used safety mechanisms in an automotive-ready GPIO library suite. It will then describe how safety related deliverables are helpful to SoC integrators in their design of safe SoCs.</p>",
