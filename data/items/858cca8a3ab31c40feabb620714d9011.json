  "description": "<p>This week on 2 Bears 1 Cave, Tom Segura is still on his Euro-tour and couldn't attend this recording. However, Bert Kreischer brought Mama-Bear LeeAnn. If you thought Bert was safe from being checked for an hour straight just because Tom wasn't there, GUESS AGAIN. We first get into Bert's recent weight loss. He actually legit looks good, but everyone (including himself) knows it won't last too long. We get into the inner working of Bert and LeeAnn's marriage. What would Widow-Bert and Widow-LeeAnn's lives look like? Does Bert have a \"condition\" he's not telling us about? We then get into what exactly IS and IS NOT cheating on your spouse, we give Tom a call, we get into Louis CK's tour email, and more!</p>\n",
