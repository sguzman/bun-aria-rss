  "description": "This week, the gals chat employees who snap (an estimated 90% due to bad fluorescent lighting and open office floor plans). Cases include a stocky family man with entirely too many guns and objectionable driving, and a confused copycat killer/TV reporter with a grudge. Ep30 Workplace Murders has been paired with Cass Vineyards Mourvèdre, a delicious white wine from a listener's actual workplace! So punch your timecard, grab a glass, and tune in! \n\nSponsors: https://www.talkspace.com/gals",
