  "description": "<p>The explosion of artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms,\nconnected to the exponential growth of the exchanged data, is driving a search\nfor novel application-specific hardware accelerators. Among the many, the\nphotonics field appears to be in the perfect spotlight for this global data\nexplosion, thanks to its almost infinite bandwidth capacity associated with\nlimited energy consumption. In this review, we will overview the major\nadvantages that photonics has over electronics for hardware accelerators,\nfollowed by a comparison between the major architectures implemented on\nPhotonics Integrated Circuits (PIC) for both the linear and nonlinear parts of\nNeural Networks. By the end, we will highlight the main driving forces for the\nnext generation of photonic accelerators, as well as the main limits that must\nbe overcome.\n</p>",
