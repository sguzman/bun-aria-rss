  "description": "Smith Westerns' members are no strangers to NPR Music's coverage of the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas: Just last year, they were a bunch of skinny, no-name teenagers winning over the crowd at NPR Music's annual daytime party. That enjoyable and ingratiating set — all propulsive rock energy, timeless pop hooks and some of the shiniest hair in music — laid the groundwork nicely for last fall's well-received Dye It Blonde, an engaging blast of candy-coated swagger. Hear the band perform live at SXSW from Stubb's in Austin, Texas, on March 16, 2011.",
