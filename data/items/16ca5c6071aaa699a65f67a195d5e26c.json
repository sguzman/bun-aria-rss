  "description": "<p>Mike Lawrence worked at McDonalds. For, like, a long time. I mean years. I know, right? So this episode is all about that. He came over to my apartment on his way home from his new writing job on Inside Amy Schumer (out in April) and we talked about all things Mickey D's. I know it's the cliched restaurant for a terrible job, but after you hear this episode you'll realize that cliches are around for a reason. It sounds awful. </p>",
