  "description": "<p>September 25, 1987. Elkland, Missouri. Early one morning, seven members of the Buckner and Schnick families were murdered. The only survivors were James Schnick and his two children. James said his nephew, 14 year old Kirk Buckner, shot him in his home and he was forced to kill him in self defense. It seemed as though Kirk had killed his family, Steve, Jan, Dennis, Tim, and Michael, and drove to his aunt and uncle’s house and killed his aunt, Julie. However, as detectives looked over the evidence, they began to notice discrepancies. Would these lead them to a different theory of what happened?</p><p>Sponsored by:</p><p>Robinhood is giving listeners of Generation Why a free stock like Apple, Ford or Sprint to help you build your portfolio.
