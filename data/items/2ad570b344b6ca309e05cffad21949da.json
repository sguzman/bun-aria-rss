  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it’s not enough to tolerate, accept, or even celebrate. The LGBT Left demands that you participate, which is why some Major League Baseball players are getting backlash for not wearing an LGBT pride flag on their uniforms. We’ll discuss. Also, a lawmaker in California now says he wants drag to be a mandatory curriculum requirement for children in school. These groomer freaks are officially out of control. And a Hollywood actor gives a speech about guns during the White House press briefing for some reason. Plus, the leftist DA of San Francisco is recalled for turning his city into a crime plagued wasteland. But will liberal voters actually learn their lesson? I doubt it. We’ll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \n\nWatch my new Daily Wire original documentary “What Is A Woman?” at whatisawoman.com. \n\nI am a beloved LGBTQ+ and children’s author.
