  "description": "<p>Dr. Paul Conti is a graduate of Stanford University School of Medicine. He completed his training at Stanford and Harvard, where he served as Chief Resident. He then served on the medical faculty at Harvard before moving to Portland, Oregon, and founding the Pacific Premiere Group—a clinical practice helping people heal and grow from trauma and other life challenges.</p><br><p>Dr. Conti is also the author of&nbsp;Trauma, the Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It, which I feel strongly is required reading for everyone, particularly those of you looking to not only heal from your own trauma, and for anyone desiring to break cycles of generational trauma.</p><br><p>This conversation is truly a master class on all things trauma.</p><br><p>Dr. Conti begins by defining trauma, and explaining what trauma is and isn’t. We then look at the many ways in which unresolved trauma perniciously manifests in our lives, discuss the various ways in which the medical establishment fails us with respect to mental health, and explore a vision for how to improve it.
