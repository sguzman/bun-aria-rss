  "description": "<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>The topic of today's discussion on The Literary Life is George Orwell's essay \"Why I Write.\" Angelina and Cindy kick off the conversation about how much they each identify with Orwell's description of his childhood. In his story of learning to write, we see many aspects of a good education, even his inclination to imitate other authors. An important point Angelina brings up is Orwell's own struggle against the calling he felt to write, in contrast to having an ambition to do so. Angelina brings up a related story about musician <a href= \"https://amzn.to/31IKdd3\">Gregory Alan Isakov</a>, and Cindy reiterates the idea of why we need leisure in order to find our vocation.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Cindy and Angelina also bring out some of the qualities Orwell possessed that make a good writer. Maturity as a human being and as a master of a craft are crucial to certain forms of writing, as Orwell points out about his own work. Other topics of conversation include truth-telling in writing, the motives for writing according to Orwell, and the growing process of writers.</p> <p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:html /-->  <!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p> <h3><a href= \"https://www.theliterary.life/summer-of-the-short-story-links/\">Summer of the Short Story:</a></h3> <p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Ep 17: \"The Celestial Omnibus\" by E.
