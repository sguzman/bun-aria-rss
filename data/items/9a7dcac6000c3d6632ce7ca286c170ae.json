  "description": "Patriarch Leo Chao is murdered at his restaurant at the beginning of Lan Samantha Chang's new novel <em>The Family Chao</em>. Eventually family secrets and bitterness reveal themselves — much like a Dostoyevsky novel, from whom Chao took a lot of inspiration. But NPR's Scott Simon points out that even though this novel is about a murder, it's quite funny. Chang told Simon that she just enjoyed writing it so much that humor became a natural part of it. This is an encore episode from February 2022. ",
