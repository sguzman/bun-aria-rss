  "description": "Well it's been a while since the whole crew was together so we thought what better time than to get everyone on an episode to talk about everything that is happening around the world of Olympic sports and everything else in between? Join Ben, Colin & Jarrod as they discuss a wide variety of topics including the recent retirement of Usain Bolt, both the Swimming & Athletics World Championships and why both Canada & Australia shouldn't be happy with their results. There is also discussion about the Canada & Commonwealth Games (and which one Canada will do better at) as well as future Olympic Bids and paying tribute to some recently departed former Olympians. So much fun, so little time to listen. So do it now to make sure you're up to date!",
