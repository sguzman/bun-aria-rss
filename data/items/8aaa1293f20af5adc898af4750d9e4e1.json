  "description": "<p>Happy Holidays everyone! This week we have a two-part show. We have an \"insider\" who will be coming on to share his encounter and knowledge of some government emails he came across between the U.S. Department of the Interior and The Bureau of Land Management. I have asked him to change his story about how he acquired the emails because I want to keep him as a contact. He will share as much as he can without giving away his identity. No it's not Mr. Black, a lot of what he has to say is shocking. The first part of the show will focus on a property he lived on where this creature was killing everything it could, and the harassment towards his family that followed. This is part one of the interview!</p>",
