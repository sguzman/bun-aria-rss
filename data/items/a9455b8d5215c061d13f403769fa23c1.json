  "description": "This week in important Steven Tyler news, the Aerosmith front man demanded that Donald Trump stop playing his band's song \"Livin' on the Edge\" at their rallies.  And he makes a good point.  Trump is past that point and may want to consider more appropriate alternatives for upcoming rallies, like \"I Fought the Law (And the Law Won)\" or \"Jailhouse Rock.\"  Certainly, that seemed to be the message prosecutors and jurors were sending this week as the Trump re-elect effort lost the votes of both Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen who will now, as convicted felons, never be able to vote in a federal election again.  What does this mean?  Where will it lead?  Is this the beginning of the end?  The end of the beginning?  What can we expect?  Our experts David Sanger of the New York Times, Katie Phang, an attorney and a legal analyst for NBC and MSNBC and Sharon Weinberger, DC Bureau Chief for Yahoo News answer these questions and more in this special limited collector's edition of Deep State Radio in which we also ask: Is Australia the only country in the world whose politics are more screwed up than America's?
