Post-military career, Damien spent years as a&nbsp;private military contractor in Iraq, where his duties included training the local police force in Baghdad.</p><p>But after 12 tours,&nbsp;disillusionment rendered Damien's occupation no longer tenable. Burned out and cynical, an existential crisis precipitated a directionless walkabout. Seeking adventure, Damien ultimately found himself in Africa volunteering in the fight against big game poaching. Coming face-to-face with the horrors of this practice, an encounter with a pregnant wild buffalo viciously trapped and mortally injured by poachers basically changed Damien’s life – and sparked a new one altogether.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, Damien began liquidating his personal assets, founded the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.iapf.org\" target=\"_blank\">International Anti-Poaching Federation (IAPF)</a> and reinvented himself as an African wildlife crusader — a warrior leveraging his modern tactical warfare experience to advance the cause of animal welfare and environmental conservation to put an end to the barbaric practice that is big game poaching.</p><p>Damien and the IAPF have had much success. But over time, Damien began to identify limitations in his highly militarized approach to solving the poaching problem. In 2017, this realization lead to his formation of Africa’s first armed, all-women anti-poaching unit. Dubbed the Akashinga (The Brave Ones), these incredible women have been incredibly successful at changing the way that animals are protected — arresting poachers without&nbsp;firing a single shot — and permanently changing the conservation landscape for the better.</p><br><p>Damien's work has been featured in National Geographic, 60 Minutes, Animal Planet, Al Jazeera, Voice of America, Forbes & The Sunday Times.&nbsp;He is prominently featured in the upcoming James Cameron produced, vegan athlete documentary Game Changers.&nbsp;And I highly recommend everybody watch his incredible <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9FCsyK4aRXQ\" target=\"_blank\">TED Talk, Modern Warrior.</a></p><p>A riveting tale you won't want to miss, today Damien's relates his&nbsp;transformation from ‘man's man' meat-eating mercenary to hardcore animal conservationist to women's rights champion. His story is as extraordinary as it is inspiring. His work has completely changed the poaching and trophy hunting landscape. His heart is massive. And his example shifts the tectonic plates on how we think about masculinity and ecological responsibility in the modern age.</p><p>It was an honor to spend time with Damien. He is a role model to me personally. A man I respect deeply. And a paradigm breaker if there ever was one.</p><p>I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange as much as I enjoyed having it.
