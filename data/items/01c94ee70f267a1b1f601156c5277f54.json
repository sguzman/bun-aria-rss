    "media:description": "Dollar cost averaging is king for bitcoin trading right now, exclaims Eric Wade, editor of Crypto Capital. Eric says \"it's too early to say\" how many official blockchains will dictate the future of money transactions, but he likes all of the big leaders such as Ethereum, he tells Daniela Cambone. When regulation arrives for crypto, \"it's going to be a drumbeat for the asset class,\" he continues. \"I love gold, and if you don't own gold ask yourself why,\" Wade concludes. And he believes \"if you're wrong [on a trade], take your loss... except for bitcoin, ride that forever.\"\n\n#bitcoin #regulation #goldinvesting\n\n⭐️ Join Daniela Cambone's exclusive community ➡️  https://danielacambone.com\n\n➡️  Follow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/StansberryRe... \n➡️  Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/stansberry \n➡️  Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/stansberry_...\n➡️  Follow us on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stan...",
