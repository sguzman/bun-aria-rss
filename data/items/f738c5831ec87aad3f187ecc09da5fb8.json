  "title": "Andrew Smart: Giving the Language Industry a Bigger Voice",
  "description": "When Andrew Smart co-founded Slator, he banked on a major paradigm shift—and an industry-first—from the very beginning.\nHis hunch more than paid off. Slator is a business news, research, and advisory service for the language services and technology industry. Unlike most business segments, however, providers of translation, localization and globalization services had virtually no trade media to keep them informed at the time of Slator’s founding.\nAndrew Smart, and his Slator co-founder, Florian Faes, believed there was an opportunity, not only to provide the $multi-billion language services industry with a reliable source of industry news, but also to monitor and report language-industry trends to a much broader business audience.\nToday, Slator’s newsletter has thousands of subscribers as well as multiple platforms for promoting, researching, informing and advising language industry providers on ways to elevate their business.\nSlator’s story is a fascinating example of how two people formed a company to serve an unmet need and succeeded by offering a higher level of journalism than the industry had ever seen before.\nAbout our guest:\nAndrew Smart is co-founder and Commercial Director at Slator, which provides news and research on the people, companies and deals that impact the language services and technology industry.\nAndrew has years of experience as a senior executive with P&L responsibilities at both start-ups and multinational corporations across the media, internet, education and financial services industries. He lives in Bangkok and serves a broad range of clients globally. \nAbout NBN:\nThe NBN Entrepreneurship and Leadership podcast aims to educate, inform and entertain, sharing insights based on the personal stories of carefully selected guests—all in an informal atmosphere of unscripted conversations and open, personal accounts.\nFind links to past episodes here.\nAbout our Hosts:\nKimon Fountoukidis:\nKimon is the founder of both Argos Multilingual and PMR.\nHe founded both companies in the mid-90s with zero capital, and both have gone on to become market leaders in their respective sectors.\nKimon was born in New York and moved to Krakow, Poland in 1993.
