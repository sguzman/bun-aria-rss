[29:57] Dean reveals the impact he wants to have on the world. [37:32]   QUOTES: “if you're running away from pain and that's your driver, great, use it. Actually, feel the pain more. Don't ignore it and live a life of status quo or even a life of struggle because of that. In fact, let the pain sink in and let it be your driver and then once you get past those, then other things kick in that could be your motivator…” [3:23] “Every time I align my values, my soul, my purpose, whatever it is you want to call it, with my businesses or my profits, they always soar without having to obsess on the numbers.” [9:25] “What stands between us and where we want to go is never what we think it is. It's not the economy, it's not the president. It's not that somebody already dominated the health food industry or dominated Facebook advertising or dominated TV advertising or there's no room left. It's never that. It's always the story we tell ourselves and why we can't achieve that.” [11:03] “I don't think we should drive for money. I think we should drive to be a better version of ourselves.” [30:31]   FOLLOW DEAN GRAZIOSI: TWITTER - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2O3SX7v\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2O3SX7v</a> INSTAGRAM - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2NsYc3r\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2NsYc3r</a> YOUTUBE - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2oSqPJi\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2oSqPJi</a> FACEBOOK - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2ImU6YY\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2ImU6YY</a> WEBSITE - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2oTJaWg\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2oTJaWg</a>   PEOPLE MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: Richard Branson - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/1gtMjmU\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/1gtMjmU</a> [13:11] Tony Robbins - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/1XZ9F6L\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/1XZ9F6L</a> [13:13] John Paul DeJoria - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2pRlEfk\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2pRlEfk</a> [13:14] Arianna Huffington - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2hu55kf\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2hu55kf</a> [26:54] Brandon Burchard - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2zVqw5d\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2zVqw5d</a> [37:56]   BOOKS MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: Millionaire Success Habits - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2nlby0P\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/2nlby0P</a> [1:54] Deansfreebook - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2McZCKM\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2McZCKM</a> [37:01]",
