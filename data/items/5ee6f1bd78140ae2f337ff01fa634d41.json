  "description": "<p>Today’s guest is Rachel Rodgers. She’s the founder of Hello Seven, a multi-million dollar company that teaches you how to earn more money and build wealth. As a business coach, attorney, CEO, Black woman, working mother, and self-made millionaire, she’s known for her blunt, sensible advice and for calling out the elephant in the room—whether it’s racism, misogyny, or centuries of unfair legal practices that have stripped financial power away from women. She’s written a new book called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/We-Should-All-Be-Millionaires/dp/1400221625\" target=\"_blank\">We Should All Be Millionaires</a> where she teaches how to succeed financially in spite of the very real obstacles along the path.

If any of you have dreams you’re procrastinating on, I really think this section is going to speak to you.</p><p>For more go to: <a href=\"http://www.lewishowes.com/1184\" target=\"_blank\">www.lewishowes.com/1184</a></p><p>Check out her new foundation: <a href=\"http://helloseven.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://helloseven.org/</a></p><p>Check out her website: <a href=\"http://www.helloseven.co/\" target=\"_blank\">www.helloseven.co</a></p><p>The Wim Hof Experience: Mindset Training, Power Breathing, and Brotherhood: <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/910-pod\" target=\"_blank\">https://link.chtbl.com/910-pod</a></p><p>A Scientific Guide to Living Longer, Feeling Happier & Eating Healthier with Dr. Rhonda Patrick: <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/967-pod\" target=\"_blank\">https://link.chtbl.com/967-pod</a></p><p>The Science of Sleep for Ultimate Success with Shawn Stevenson: <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/896-pod\" target=\"_blank\">https://link.chtbl.com/896-pod</a></p><p><br /> </p><p> </p>\n",
