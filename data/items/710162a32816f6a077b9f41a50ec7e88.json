  "description": "This episode introduces neuroplasticity—which is how our brain and nervous system learn and acquire new capabilities. I describe the differences between childhood and adult neuroplasticity, the chemicals involved and how anyone can increase their rate and depth of learning by leveraging the science of focus. I describe specific tools for increasing focus and learning. The next two episodes will cover the ideal protocols for specific types of learning and how to make learning new information more reflexive.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:03:50) Plasticity: What Is it, & What Is It For?\n(00:06:30) Babies and Potato Bugs\n(00:08:00) Customizing Your Brain\n(00:08:50) Hard-Wired Versus Plastic Brains\n(00:10:25) Everything Changes At 25\n(00:12:29) Costello and Your Hearing\n(00:13:10) The New Neuron Myth\n(00:14:10) Anosmia: Losing Smell\n(00:15:13) Neuronal Birthdays Near Our Death Day\n(00:16:45) Circumstances for Brain Change\n(00:17:21) Brain Space\n(00:18:30) No Nose, Eyes, Or Ears\n(00:19:30) Enhanced Hearing and Touch In The Blind\n(00:20:20) Brain Maps of The Body Plan\n(00:21:00) The Kennard Principle (Margaret Kennard)\n(00:21:36) Maps of Meaning\n(00:23:00) Awareness Cues Brain Change\n(00:25:20) The Chemistry of Change\n(00:26:15) A Giant Lie In The Universe\n00:27:10) Fathers of Neuroplasticity/Critical Periods\n00:29:30) Competition Is The Route to Plasticity\n00:32:30) Correcting The Errors of History\n00:33:29) Adult Brain Change: Bumps and Beeps\n(00:36:25) What It Takes to Learn\n(00:38:15) Adrenalin and Alertness\n(00:40:18) The Acetylcholine Spotlight\n(00:42:26) The Chemical Trio For Massive Brain Change\n(00:44:10) Ways To Change Your Brain\n(00:46:16) Love, Hate, & Shame: all the same chemical\n(00:47:30) The Dopamine Trap\n(00:49:40) Nicotine for Focus\n(00:52:30) Sprinting\n(00:53:30) How to Focus\n(00:55:22) Adderall: Use & Abuse\n(00:56:40) Seeing Your Way To Mental Focus\n(01:02:59) Blinking\n(01:05:30) And Ear Toward Learning\n(01:06:14) The Best Listeners In The World\n(01:07:20) Agitation is Key\n(01:07:40) ADHD & ADD: Attention Deficit (Hyperactivity) Disorder\n(01:12:00) Ultra(dian) Focus\n(01:13:30) When Real Change Occurs\n(01:16:20) How Much Learning Is Enough?\n(01:16:50) Learning In (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift\n(01:18:16) Synthesis/Summary\n(01:25:15) Learning With Repetition, Forming Habits\nAs always, thank you for your interest in science!\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
