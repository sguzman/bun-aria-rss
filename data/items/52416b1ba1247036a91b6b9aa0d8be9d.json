  "description": "Today’s guest is fabulous celebrity chef turned interior designer Travis London of Studio London Co. Travis has a unique style that fuses American design sensibilities with European glamor. His distinctive point of view on color and interiors has been recognized by media outlets including Architectural Digest, Domino, and more. This colorful episode is chock-full of quotes and wisdom from Travis about his love of dogs, how his different locales have influenced his design, why he believes in different glassware for every occasion, why he and his home always smell so good, and more. Travis is lifestyle!\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nHow Travis likes to mix colors.\n\nTravis’s background from high school dropout to celebrity chef to interior designer and beyond!\n\nHow has living in Europe influenced Travis’s style?\n\nTips for how to make a room look BIG.\n\nHow has Miami influenced his color choices?\n\nHow does Travis recommend taking risks in design?\n\nWhat are a few of Travis’s favorite kitchen designing tips?\n\nWhy is Travis passionate about glassware?\n\nTravis designed the dining room in AD's The Iconic Home.\n\nHow often does Travis redo a room or house?\n\nDesigning with dogs in mind.\n\nHow does Travis eat healthy with a busy lifestyle?\n\nWhat is Travis’s next step for his brand?\n\nDoes Travis have any pet peeves in dealing with clients?\n\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Stacy,\nFirst of all, I’m going to say no to the seagrass. If it’s already a small space you’ll need a wood or tile floor and you can put a rug over that if you’d like. In terms of painting, paint it all the same color floor-to-ceiling except the border trim that’s on the inset tray that you talked about; that will accentuate it. When you choose the colors, think about how you want your guests to feel. Where the ceiling fan is, you can do a wide flush mount light or even better a flush mount chandelier like one from Kelly Wearstler. I would do wood blinds for window coverings. They are more decorative and allow for more light. They come in a wide range of colors as well.\nThe space is actually very nice and you would never know it was a garage! I would make this feel like a hotel suite. So I would also add two chairs in front of the bed, a small thin dresser on the wall and also a TV there, on the wall where you have that glass-like dresser I would add a mirror, and then, of course, two nightstands.\nIt could be so cozy in here! Travis is coming over!!!\nMentioned in This Episode:\nStudio London Co.\nStudio London Co on Instagram\nTravis London on Instagram\nAD's The Iconic Home Virtual Tour",
