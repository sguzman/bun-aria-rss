  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re looking through the lens of depression, how do you see the world? How do you react to those around you? And how do you handle obstacles that come your way?</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What about when you’re in a state of peace? How do you act? How do you react? Do you sweat the small stuff, or do you just shake it off? Does adversity rattle you, or are you able to approach challenges with confidence and ease?</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact is that you will have a very different experience in life when you are in a peaceful state, rather than a state of suffering. Your thoughts, actions and reactions - these stem directly from where you find yourself mentally and emotionally. This is why Tony says that the most important decision you will ever make is to live in a beautiful state - even when life doesn’t go your way.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because ultimately, our lives aren’t shaped by our conditions. Our lives are shaped by our decisions. And you must decide where to direct your focus. An undirected mind operates naturally in survival mode, constantly identifying and magnifying potential threats to our well-being. But the result? A life filled with stress and anxiety.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode of the Tony Robbins Podcast, you’ll learn how most people make unconscious decisions, based on habit and conditioning. You’ll see how most people believe that suffering is an inevitable part of life. Frustration, stress, sadness, loneliness - yes, these are emotions we may all encounter - but Tony shows us that we all have the power to step out of these suffering states, and cultivate a life of love, joy, gratitude, playfulness, growth and appreciation. Because life is too short to be mired in suffering. Make the decision to master your mind. Choose a beautiful state, and start living the life you were meant to.</span></p> <p><br /> <br /></p>",
