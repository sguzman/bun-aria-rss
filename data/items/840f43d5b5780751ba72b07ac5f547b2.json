  "title": "Metaphor E3: Chaotic Waters",
  "description": "<p>In part one (00:00 - 25:35), Jon reviews the image of the ideal state of humanity and postulates it as a garden mountain fortress. He asks Tim why this is so different from a more familiar one of a heaven full of clouds and angels. Tim says that it’s important not to mistake the image of a metaphor for the reality of what the image points to.<br />\nTim also quotes TS Eliot saying that poetry is a “raid on the inarticulate.” In other words, poetry is meant to describe things that can’t be described in normal, factual use of language.<br />\nTim begins to outline the use of the metaphor of chaotic water in the Bible. Chaotic water is the first image given in the Bible. It’s meant to convey a state of un-creation, a state that is uninhabitable and unwelcoming of life. Tim begins to contrast the dark chaotic water that is present at the start of Genesis with the river of life that flows through Eden and is created later in the creation story.</p>\n<p>In part two (25:35 - 40:25), Tim explains that chaotic waters often become personified as evil. For example, in the story of the Exodus, Pharoah and his army is made equivalent to the chaotic waters in Exodus 15. This story runs in parallel with Psalm 18. \"O Lord God of hosts, who is like You, O mighty Lord? Your faithfulness also surrounds You. You rule the swelling of the sea; When its waves rise, You still them. You Yourself crushed Rahab like one who is slain; You scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.\" (Rahab is a Hebrew word for Egypt).</p>\n<p>In part three (40:25 - 52:25), Tim outlines Isaiah 17:12-14.<br />\n12 Woe to the many nations that rage—<br />\nthey rage like the raging sea!<br />\nWoe to the peoples who roar—<br />\nthey roar like the roaring of great waters!<br />\n13 Although the peoples roar like the roar of surging waters,<br />\nwhen he rebukes them they flee far away,<br />\ndriven before the wind like chaff on the hills,<br />\nlike tumbleweed before a gale.<br />\n14 In the evening, sudden terror!<br />\nBefore the morning, they are gone!<br />\nThis is the portion of those who loot us,<br />\nthe lot of those who plunder us.</p>\n<p>The metaphor of chaotic waters further expands to equate the warring nations with chaotic waters.</p>\n<p>Then Tim begins to outline the new creation prophecies and their relation to the chaotic water metaphor.</p>\n<p>Joel 4:18:<br />\n18 And in that day<br />\nThe mountains will drip with sweet wine,<br />\nAnd the hills will flow with milk,<br />\nAnd all the brooks of Judah will flow with water;<br />\nAnd a spring will go out from the house of the Lord<br />\nTo water the valley of Shittim.</p>\n<p>Zechariah 14:6-9:<br />\n6 On that day there will be neither sunlight<br />\nnor cold, frosty darkness.<br />\n7 It will be a unique day, known only to the Lord<br />\nwith no distinction between day and night.<br />\nWhen evening comes, there will be light.<br />\n8 On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem,<br />\nhalf of it east to the Dead Sea<br />\nand half of it west to the Mediterranean Sea,<br />\nin summer and in winter.<br />\n9 The Lord will be king over the whole earth.<br />\nOn that day there will be one Lord,<br />\nand his name the only name.</p>\n<p>Isaiah 2:1-4:<br />\n2 Now it will come about that In the last days<br />\nThe mountain of the house of the Lord<br />\nWill be established as the chief of the mountains,<br />\nAnd will be raised above the hills;<br />\nAnd all the nations will stream [lit. “river”] to it….<br />\n3 And they will hammer their swords into plowshares<br />\nand their spears into pruning hooks.<br />\nNation will not lift up sword against nation,<br />\nAnd never again will they learn war.</p>\n<p>He says that new creation means the restoration of the cosmic mountain and the reunification of the waters.</p>\n<p>In part four (52:25 - 57:35), the guys try to crystalize their thought process. Danger and death in the Bible are described as chaotic waters and love, peace and security are described as a river of life. Tim says these images are fundamental to understanding the Bible, especially the prophets.</p>\n<p>In part five (57:35 - end), the guys recap their conversation on metaphor and talk briefly about creating the video on metaphors in the Bible. Tim briefly touches on the story of Jesus walking on the water. Why is this story in all the gospels?
