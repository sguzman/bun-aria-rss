  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane kept his head down and did what was asked of him. Known for being a team player, Minihane made numerous appearances across Barstool Radio yesterday, highlighted by CCK, where Willie Colon made the uncomfortable decision to try to intimidate Minhane but failed miserably. Today, Minihane and Blind Mike discuss the trip to New York and have it out with Willie in a simulcast of The Kirk Minihane Show and (soon to be Kirk's next show) Barstool Breakfast.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
