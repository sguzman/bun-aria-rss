  "title": "#38: How the Moon Landing Changed Tech Forever",
  "description": "This week marks the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Even if you don't care about space travel, there's a good chance the work NASA did to get men on the moon affects your life even now. First, David and Christopher chat with Al Gross, a former NASA engineer who helped design the Apollo spacesuits, then went on to use the materials and techniques to design early versions of the sturdy, super-comfy shoes we all wear now. After that, Jennifer Levasseur, the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum's space history curator, talks about the cameras used on Apollo - and how all the tech required to broadcast a TV show live from the lunar surface may have led to the tiny camera in your smartphone.",
