  "description": "<p>For those that have been following along, you'll know that I do my best to sit down with every new VaynerMedia employee within the first few months they start working for us. Undoubtedly that gets harder and harder as we continue to grow but it's still something that's incredibly important to me to ensure I'm fostering relationships and a place of comfort for our new hires. Even if it's 5 minutes long, it's enough time to plant a seed for a healthy relationship. In this meeting you'll get a feel for how I navigate these convos and the advice I give to those looking to make an impression in their early days at the company. Take a listen and let me know what you think :)</p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5227613.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
