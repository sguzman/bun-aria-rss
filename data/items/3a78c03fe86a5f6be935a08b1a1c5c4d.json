  "description": "It’s the topic everyone loves to hear about, but hardly anyone is willing to talk about. And that’s the inside secrets of distribution. Distributors “hold all the chips” so it’s time we find out how deals are made. We sit down with Mike Bridges, who owns Jack's Liquor Beer Wine in Fremont, Nebraska and was once a rep for Nebraska Wine and Spirits which was later purchased by Republic. He talks about what really happens behind those closed doors, who gets allocations (high volume stores vs small mom and pop shops), and consumer frustrations. There’s a lot of ground to cover in this one.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about the smoked grain debate.\n\nHow did you get into bourbon?\n\nTell us about your time in the food and beverage industry.\n\nHow did you transition into a distributor position?\n\nWhat was the distributor called at that time?\n\nHow do allocations work?\n\nIs there any transparency between the rep and the business?\n\nDo they tell you how you can get the allocated items?\n\nWhat motivates a distributor to sell products?\n\nHow do distributors spend money to get retailers to carry products?\n\nTalk about high volume retailers vs mom and pop retailers.\n\nDo your distributors take price gouging seriously?\n\nHow much blame are you putting on the distillers for not getting allocated items?
