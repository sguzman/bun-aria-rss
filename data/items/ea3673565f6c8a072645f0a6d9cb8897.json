That ambitious goal set her on a path that she&rsquo;s still on, more than ten years later. She has said, &ldquo;That year, I discovered that I love writing songs from the Bible: delving into a passage, putting myself in each character&rsquo;s shoes, trying to understand how this one small story connects with the whole, then coming up with a way to communicate that story through song.&rdquo; That project has led to four studio albums so far: The Blood and the Breath, A Home and a Hunger, A Seed, a Sunrise, and, most recently, A King and His Kindness.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Caroline speaks with Jonathan Rogers about producing without striving, the upside-down-ness of the Gospel, and the reasons she decided to take a sabbatical.</p><p><a href=\"https://therabbitroom.givingfuel.com/member\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: https://therabbitroom.givingfuel.com/member</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
