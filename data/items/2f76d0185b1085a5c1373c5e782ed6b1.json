It simply blew me away. After getting to know the people, their day-to-day activities, their diets, and their sense of community I can totally see why they live such long and happy lives. So, how can we embrace these same aspects of Sardinian life in our own busy Western world? Blue Zones pioneer Dan Buettner joins me on this episode to talk about that and so much more. Dan Buettner is an explorer, National Geographic Fellow, award-winning journalist and producer, and New York Times bestselling author. He discovered the five places in the world— dubbed Blue Zones hotspots—where people live the longest, healthiest lives.</p><br><p>Dan now works in partnership with municipal governments, large employers, and health insurance companies to implement Blue Zones Projects in communities, workplaces, and universities. Blue Zones Projects are well-being initiatives that apply lessons from the Blue Zones to entire communities by focusing on changes to the local environment, public policy, and social networks. The program has dramatically improved the health of more than 5 million Americans to date.
