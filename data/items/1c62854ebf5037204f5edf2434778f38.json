  "description": "After the Japanese army captured the village of Kokoda, the 39th Militia Battalion fell back to the next defensive position at Isurava. Exhausted, battered and bruised, the 39th dug in and waited. As the Japanese headed south, the 2/14th and 2/16th Battalions of the AIF were making their way north to relieve the 39th. The defence of New Guinea would be determined by which force arrived first.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
