  "title": "Ep. 814 - Sane People Are The Most Marginalized Community In America",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the backlash against Dave Chappelle grows, as the media insists that any and all jokes about, or criticisms of, LGBT people are out of bounds and automatically bigoted. They say that LGBT people are marginalized and that’s why you can’t make these jokes. But if you aren’t allowed to joke about a group of people, isn’t that an indication that they are the exact opposite of marginalized? Also, the high school student who shot a teacher and two classmates on Wednesday was released on bail on Thursday. What’s going on there? And the New York Times claims that 900,000 children have been hospitalized with COVID, which isn’t even close to true. And a new study confirms that women are attracted to men who can provide for them financially. What does it say about our society that we needed a study to confirm that obvious fact? We’ll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \nYou petitioned, and we heard you.
