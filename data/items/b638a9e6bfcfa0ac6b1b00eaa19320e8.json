  "description": "<p>I will be speaking to Phil who was out hunting over 10 years ago in Minnesota when he came across an unknown creature. Phil writes, “It was all black and I was shocked how fast it was moving, I have never seen something on two legs run like this thing ran. It ran behind a tree and then came out to look at me...”</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Jacob who was out driving at night with his girlfriend, and on the side of the road stood two of these creatures. Jacob says, “There was a tall one that stood about 7 feet tall and a smaller one that stood about 5 feet tall. They appeared to have no neck and were proportioned like a football player with shoulder pads on. I was shocked when I saw them.\"</p>",
