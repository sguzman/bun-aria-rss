  "description": "<p>In honor of Dr. Hyman’s upcoming book, Food Fix (<a href=\"https://foodfixbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">foodfixbook.com</a>), out on February 25th we are sharing a recent interview he did on Feel Better, Live More with Dr. Rangan Chatterjee.</p><br><p>***</p><p><a href=\"https://drchatterjee.com/why-we-need-to-fix-our-food-system-with-mark-hyman/\" target=\"_blank\">Why We Need To Fix Our Food System with Mark Hyman</a></p><br><p>Is it possible to create a food system that promotes health, not disease? One that regenerates ecosystems, reverses climate change and ensures no one, least of all the poorest in society, is endangered?</p><p>My guest on this week’s podcast believes it is. He is functional medicine doctor and New York Times bestselling author, Dr Mark Hyman. Mark and I talk about everything from how processed food is addictive by design, to the powerful role good nutrition, from real food, could have in hospitals, schools and prisons. We discuss why soil depletion from intensive farming is one of the biggest drivers of climate change – and why that vegan burger may not be the environmentally friendly option.</p><p>Despite the serious subject matter of this conversation, I’m sure you’ll come away feeling hopeful. Mark doesn’t simply highlight the problems we’re facing. He identifies the ‘fix’, providing practical, positive solutions. It’s a call to action that we can all do our bit to answer.</p><p>Show notes available at drchatterjee.com/98</p><p>Follow me on instagram.com/drchatterjee/</p><p>Follow me on facebook.com/DrChatterjee/</p><p>Follow me on twitter.com/drchatterjeeuk</p><p>DISCLAIMER: The content in the podcast and on this webpage is not intended to constitute or be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
