  "description": "<p>The famous parable of the prodigal son shows us not just how the grace of God changes our individual lives but also how it changes our relationships with each other, how it forms a new kind of human community, a unique human society. Jesus brilliantly ties this story in with one of the main themes of the entire Bible: exile and homecoming.</p>\n<p>Philosophers have taught that the human condition is one of profound alienation—feeling that we’re not really home in this world. Why would that be? What are we going to do about that? Those profound questions are all addressed and actually answered by this parable. We’re going to learn here about the human condition, the divine solution for it, and the new Communion that is the result.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 2, 2008. Series: The Fellowship of Grace. Scripture: Luke 15:17-32.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
