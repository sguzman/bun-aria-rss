  "description": "<div>You guys, Gillian HATED this one, so, you know, buckle up this one is frikin' great.Â <br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Meet the White family--the most notorious pill popping, gun slinging, bad-tattoo-giving-while-hammered-in-the-kitchen, clan in all of West Virginia. For one year, the hot dummies behind MTV's \"Jackass\" followed them around with cameras to see what would happen. And Guess What Happens???!!!......really nothing. But somehow it's awesome. Drugs are done, dances are tapped (which should be super gay and fabulous, but definitely isn't), kids are removed by child protective services (thank God), attempted murders are admitted to, people go to jail, and one pair of sisters have an EPIC EXPERIENCE at the Taco Bell drive thru. This one is not to be missed.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>ALSO! Check out <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">our Patreon</a> for our weekly bonus content!
