  "description": "<p>There’s no way around it, you guys: There is definitely a PORTAL TO HELL under the basement stairs in a crappy rental house in Gary, Indiana. It’s definitely definitely real, and I know this because that bro The Travel Channel--the one with the ghost hunter show or whatever-- said so. And so did the 12-foot goat-man who haunts his dreams. And he has NOTHING TO GAIN BY MAKING THIS WHOLE THING UP!</p>\n\n\n<p>Once again, we haaaaaaaaaaated this movie, so you know the episode is going to be hilarious. Zak Bagans buys the ‘haunted’ house, a little boy gets possessed and walks up a wall, and a cameraman turns evil. That’s about it. Oh and Patrick tries out the word “Bro” (it doesn’t go great) and Gillian laughs so hard she nearly chokes.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Check out our bonus episodes on Patreon!</a> We covered <strong>\"Serial\"</strong> episode-by-episode and capped the series off with an <strong>interview</strong> with <strong>Rabia Chaudry</strong>--Adnan's friend who brought his story to Sarah Koenig AND with <strong>Asia Mcclain</strong>--Adnan's alibi witness!
