  "description": "<p>When Covid hit, everything shifted online. Suddenly kids wired for participation and activity were stuck in front of screens Monday through Friday, then again on Sunday morning. Digital fatigue set in and every family was stretched thin. Some gave up altogether.</p> <p>Now as we look toward reopening and re-engaging our churches, we're all wondering: what's the winning formula for getting kids back to church? The answer will likely require some big priority shifts. In this episode, Tony and Amy are joined by Reggie Joiner and Kristen Ivy from <a href= \"https://thinkorange.com\">Orange</a> to discuss what made kids ministry during Covid so uniquely difficult and what we can learn from it now.</p> <p>For the full episode transcript, links mentioned during the show, and to download the Leader Conversation Guide, visit this episode's <strong>Show Notes</strong> at <strong><a href= \"https://tonymorganlive.com/2021/06/09/reengage-kids-students-episode-196-unstuck-church-podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">theunstuckgroup.com/episode196</a>.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Join the Live Conversation on Social Media</strong></em></p> <p>If you're listening on Wednesday, when the episode first releases, join the live conversation The Unstuck Group's team will be having on social media about this week's topic.
