  "description": "<p>As someone who didn’t like vegetables as a child, smoothies played a huge role in helping me begin consuming quality nutrition and resetting my palate. This is the case for many people—smoothies can be an incredible vehicle for getting in nutrients and starting your day off on the right foot. But not all smoothies are created equal, and it’s important to be mindful of what is going in your blender.</p> <p>If you’re not paying close attention to what you’re putting in your smoothie, it can be easy to overload on calories and sugar, raise your insulin levels, or create a concoction that is totally contradictory to your goals. A health-promoting smoothie contains an essential foundation of fiber, protein, and micronutrients. Most importantly, your smoothie should be tailored to help you on your own unique journey.</p> <p>This episode is all about helping you maximize the health benefits of the amazing smoothie.
