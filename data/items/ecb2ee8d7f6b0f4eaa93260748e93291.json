  "description": "<p>In the 12th Breezeblock episode, FA editors Charlie Clemoes and René Boer discuss the future of De Wallen (aka Amsterdam's Red Light District), which is under increasing threat from the so-called \"smooth city\": the safe, clean, well-functioning and homogenous urban environment that has been taking over cities around the world in the past few decades.</p>\n<p>In the episode, they talk about the ways in which the municipality, developers and various old white dudes are conspiring to frame the neighbourhood as an \"urban jungle\" and pushing to replace it with a \"monumental garden\". Against these moves, René has written a counter-manifesto, \"Wallen 2020\", which is intended to galvanise resistance to the neighbourhood's creeping sanitisation.</p>\n",
