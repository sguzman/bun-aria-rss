  "description": "Two years ago, a massive protest movement swept through Iraq. People were angry about corruption and a lack of basic services like electricity and health care in a country that brings in billions of dollars in oil revenue each year. That protest movement culminated in a parliamentary election, held earlier this month. <br/><br/>NPR international correspondent <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/576542412/ruth-sherlock\">Ruth Sherlock</a> reported on the election closely from inside Iraq. Through her reporting, and in conversation with host <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/2101154/ari-shapiro\">Ari Shapiro</a>, Ruth explains why Iraq's election failed to deliver on hopes for reform — and what it revealed about America's long and costly investment in the country's democracy. <br/><br/>This episode contains excerpts from multiple stories Ruth Sherlock reported over the course of weeks inside Iraq. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/576542412/ruth-sherlock\">You can find more of her work here</a>. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this\">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:considerthis@npr.org\">considerthis@npr.org</a>.
