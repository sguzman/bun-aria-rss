  "description": "<p>     It’s another exciting double barrel episode with two fantastic guests. </p><p>     First up Richard Portnow talks about his life as an actor and an amateur boxer. He also talks about the days he used to run into Tony “Junior” Sirico in the clubs of New York City. Over the years Richard has worked with some of the biggest names in the business and shares who he likes and who he doesn’t. Originally the character of Melvoin was only cast in one episode, but Richard brought so much to the role the writers kept him on as a reoccurring character. </p><p>     Then Suzanne Shepherd joins the podcast. Suzanne played Carmela’s mother in the Sopranos, Lorraine Bracco’s mother in Goodfellas and Steve’s mother in Bluebloods. She was also a finalist to play Livia on the Sopranos but was happy to see Nancy Marchand own that role. After that Michael and Steve get into this week’s episode which is all about anger and revenge. Check out Talking Sopranos #63 “Cold Cuts” S5 – EP10.
