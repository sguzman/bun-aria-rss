Taja's working style is that of an eternal optimist while being grounded in reality, a combination of futuristic, optimistic, and realistic that brands and clients deeply appreciate and look to maximize when working with her. When not guiding brands or her team of twenty at P+W Taja also writes for Forbes focusing on team culture within the creative space and retreats to the woods and lakes of Maine with her husband and two kids, some rescue animals to stay grounded. </p><p>More from Taja Dockendorf: </p><p>Website: https://pulpandwire.com/ </p><p>Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-gibson-57625271/ </p><p>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pulpandwire/</p><p>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/taja </p><p> </p><p>More from us: </p><p>Website: http://www.trentbell.com </p><p>Instagram: http://instagram.com/trentbellphotography/ </p><p> </p>\n",
