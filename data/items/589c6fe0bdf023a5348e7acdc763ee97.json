  "title": "Glenn Beck doesn't care if he alienates Trump voters (Live at SXSW)",
  "description": "Former Fox News commentator and TheBlaze founder Glenn Beck talks with Recode's Peter Kafka about being a conservative media personality at a time when a Republican he hates, Donald Trump, is president. Speaking in front of a live audience at South by Southwest 2017, Beck says he doesn't care if Trump supporters no longer listen to him, because \"right is right, wrong is wrong.\" He also weighs in on how Breitbart became a \"platform for the alt-right\" under Steve Bannon after the passing of its founder, Andrew Breitbart, and says that politicians need to put aside party labels to talk about big issues — such as how the rise of robots and artificial intelligence could lead to \"50 percent unemployment\" in the next 40 years.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
