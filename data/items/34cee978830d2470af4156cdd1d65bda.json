  "description": "We're LIVE from Downtown Fullerton at Monkey Business Café this week! Thank you to our Patreon supporters for making it possible for 75 folks to join us for free and listen to us talk about Power Under(the Cross) VS Power Over People.  Jesus demonstrated a version of power that would look neither democrat or republican. And demonstrated through great humility and observation of the future of kingdom of God, that weakness would be the way of love. Holding power over people was never the way of Jesus, contrary to how many of our contemporary churches demonstrate their views to the the public.\n\nWatch the show LIVE on Facebook here: https://www.facebook.com/voxpodcast/videos/1268148033253111/\n\nMore LIVE shows coming soon.
