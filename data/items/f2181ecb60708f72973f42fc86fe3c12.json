Today, we dig into the strategies, considerations, and challenges of rebranding with Arianna Davis, the Senior Director of Editorial & Strategy of Oprah’s recently relaunched lifestyle brand, Oprah Daily. \n\nOprah’s brand began as O, the Oprah Magazine, and with the help of Arianna, launched a digital extension in 2018 that became the fastest growing website launch in Hearst history.
