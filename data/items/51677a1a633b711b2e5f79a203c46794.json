  "description": "<p>Andy McGrath, is a Cryptozoology ‘Enthusiast’ with over 25 years of research and obsession about the unknown creatures living right under our noses, here on this tiny island in the North Atlantic.</p> <p>From a wildlife point of view, the accepted fauna of The British Isles were discovered and catalogued in their finite and immoveable state in the 19th century. Nothing has really been added to this list or considered worthy since and the continual reports of Water Monsters, Bigfoot, Mystery Big Cats and UFC’s (Unidentified Flying Cryptids) are largely ignored or used as newspaper fillers to entertain us.</p> <p>Andy’s focus is on current research and recent sightings, pictures, videos and eyewitness accounts of the many cryptids of the British Isles.</p> <p>Although vast advancements in science and technology have brought great discoveries in other lesser known parts of the world, our island lies largely underexplored and overlooked. At night, outside of the busy cities and next to the unlit lakes and lonely mountains it is an island in darkness, where nobody ventures into the woods anymore and the pervading paradigm scares all but the most foolhardy scientists away from any serious investigation of the many yet to be discovered – Beasts Of Britain</p> <p>Author of Beasts of Britain, Speaker and field investigator, he is also currently working on his own TV series under the same name: Beasts of Britain and his new podcast: Beastly Theories, featuring low key interviews with researchers around the world, whilst also continuing his passion for writing about cryptids and out of place animals in other parts of the world.
