On this week’s episode of her podcast “Archetypes with Meghan,” the duchess says she felt objectified and reduced to “bimbo” status during her time on “Deal or No Deal” as a “briefcase beauty.” But not everyone appreciates her hot take. “The View” host Whoopi Goldberg says Meghan knew exactly what she was signing up for and shouldn’t be complaining about it now. And Whoopi’s not the only who feels this way - other former DOND models are chiming in saying they disagree with Meghan too.
