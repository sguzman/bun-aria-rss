  "description": "<p>Round 1: We’d be derelict in our duties if we didn’t remind folks that violating OPSEC procedures has its consequences. Parler users are figuring that out. \n\nRound 2: I don’t know about y'all, but all this shitty news is a kick in the dick. Luckily, our friends at Military Times put out a list to keep up motivated!\n\nRound 3: President Trump is acting like the world’s greatest Lance Corporal. \n\nRound 4: In a sign that nature is healing, we return to solely military news to talk about the General who was demoted for an affair with 3 subordinates. \n\nRound 5: A couple fellas got caught grave goofin. Their explanation is just a touch weird. \n\nSong at the end is Crazy Train - Ozzy Osbourne (Motown Style Cover) ft. Jennie Lena</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
