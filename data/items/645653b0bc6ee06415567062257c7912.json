Weisenfeld is the Agate Brown and George L. Collord Professor of Religion at Princeton University. Her latest book, <em>New World A-Coming: Black Religion and Racial Identity during the Great Migration </em>is a historiography of twentieth-century black religious groups, including the Moorish Science Temple, the Nation of Islam, Father Divine’s Peace Mission Movement, and Ethiopian Hebrews. The two discuss the racial claims of these groups, the impact they had on the development of African American identity, and their interactions with government entities, other religious groups, and African American communities.  Weisenfeld also sheds light on her research process, which pulls from marriage and divorce certificates, immigration and naturalization records, and FBI files in order to create a multifaceted view of the practitioners.</p> </div> </div>",
