  "description": "<p>Beside every good man is a strong woman...Welcome to the I Am Woman Podcast!<br />Getting to know the woman beside the man! <br /><br />In a spin off from her husbands’s show Michi Marshall leads a discussion about the balance between working, marriage and motherhood, getting personal and candid about the obstacles they face balancing it all. Sitting down with Aja Crowder, Sharelle Rosado and Ashley Wheeler, the ladies open up their lives and share their journey in this new limited series. <br /><br />On this first episode, we hear how the women found love and commitment with their significant others and how they’ve made it work through the ups and downs of their husband’s NFL careers. But before they were wives and mothers, we learn about them as driven women on a mission. Sharelle and Ashley talk about their time serving in the Army and their experiences as minority women in a man’s world while Aja tackles finding independence in real-estate and Michi opens up about her passion for mental health and her initial aspirations in design, which ultimately led her to creating the House Of Athlete lifestyle apparel line. <br /><br />Adding a little spice to the episode, the ladies are treated to a visit from House Of Athlete’s own Chef Lowe who prepares them a delicious meal and also shares his admiration for strong women in leadership, especially in the era of our new Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>\n",
