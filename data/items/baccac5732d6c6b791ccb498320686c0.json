  "description": "<p>A listener writes “Thought I’d share an experience that I had back in the mid 80’s. Probably not as exciting as many of those encounters that I’ve heard on your podcast, but non-the-less interesting.</p> <p>The entire experience was at least a 10 minute observation which I shall never forget. I am now 56 years old. This took place when I was in my early 20’s. Up in the high Sierra Nevada mountains, tucked away at about 7000 feet in the John Muir Wilderness, is a popular lake named Huntington Lake. I frequented this spot as I am an avid fisherman, hiker and love to explore. This lake has easy access with “the” main highway running through the area. So in the summer months it is quite populated with tourists and such. I would often fish the lake and hike the area.</p> <p>When hiking I often times would exit the trails and go off on my own, equipped with essentials and, of course, a compass. I was coming down the mountain from an afternoon hike and found a beautiful scene too lovely to not sit and take in for a while. A small rock face, or ledge if you will, perched just 12 – 15 feet overlooking a mountain meadow surrounded by redwoods. A mile and a half down from there you could see Huntington Lake, which seemed so small considering it’s actual size. It was about 4 pm and I was sitting there, and had been for at least an hour, when I saw movement just to my left where the redwoods quit and the meadow began. Granted I was approximately 15 up on the rock ledge but the movement was not more than 25 feet or so from the rock ledge. At first I thought it was a bear or a deer due to the size of what I was able to see. As I watched further, it came out fully into the open, sniffing the air, reaching for various plants and bushes….nearly in complete silence. it would pull up a plant, or off a branch…and nibble on the leafy parts. Nope. Not a bear! Certainly not a deer! It was in the open and foraging about…unaware of my presence. The small cliff I was sitting on/in was somewhat concave so it kinda wrapped around me to a point so my perch must have been somewhat concealing. If this would have been a bear I would have been concerned. I was floored. Taken. Nearly mesmerized I could not believe nor comprehend what I was seeing! And it wasn’t like the creature was difficult to see. It was a matter of 20-25 feet from me as it worked it’s way toward the rock face that I was sitting on. The hair was orange. Similar to an orange cat. The hair under the arms from the armpits to about the wrists was longer, about 4 or 5 inches long. The skin light gray. Standing at approximately 7 feet tall, this thing was blowing my mind. I was too amazed to be afraid.</p> <p>It had this permanent expression on its face like it was worried or sad. It wasn’t worried or sad….just had that look on it’s face. The face was nearly human. No ape looking attributes at all really. That is the part that freaked me out the most. It looked like a depiction of a Cro-Magnon. It was male. Undoubtedly male. Round – faced with a slightly pointy head…but not extremely pointed. Another thing that fascinated me was his eyes. They were the same orange-gold color as the hair. Mind – blowing. I still stand in amazement at what I saw. As he worked his way toward the rock cliff and me, I noticed him sniffing the air more frequently and looking around more. I figured he possibly had picked up on my scent. At this point he was no more than 20 feet from me. I would guess perhaps even closer. But I was up about 15 feet atop him on the cliff. Figuring that I had better make myself known to him rather than scare him…I softly said “Hi” and raised my right arm and waved it back and forth. He was startled and I could clearly see his eyebrows raise. He zoomed in on me instantly Freaky! He stood there not moving. I was feeling, for the first time, like “OH SHIT!”. What was this thing going to do? Or more specifically, do to ME? His eyes were larger than a human’s eyes but not by a whole lot. I could see whites on the insides and corners of the eyes. He stood there for what seemed like a minute but was probably less. Just looking at me. He didn’t seem angry or agitated. Mostly surprised that I was there. I was staring at him as well…probably for the same reasons. He then started walking off. His body turned but not his head.</p> <p>He never took his eyes off me as he walked away. A part of me was glad that he was leaving me in peace. But the curiosity part of me didn’t want him to. He was still looking at me as he was walking away. I raised my arm and slowly waved and said “Don’t go.” This is going to really seem stupid but non-the-less true. He stopped for a moment and very slowly raised his right arm ever so slightly…then walked into the redwoods. I was relieved but stunned. I cannot believe that I asked it to stay! I don’t know what I was hoping for in doing that. I do believe that this being was very intelligent. It had a curiosity and wonderment just as we do. I also believe….no, I KNOW, that this creature could have pounded me into the earth like a hot knife goes through soft butter. But yet it chose not to. I am more than grateful for that.”</p>",
