  "description": "My guest today does a fantastic job of speaking in a not-at-all-annoying way about the inarguably important yet potentially very cheesy concept of self-love. Haemin Sunim is a Korean “mega monk” who has developed a massive online following and has written huge bestsellers. He’s also earned degrees from Berkeley, Harvard, and Princeton, and is the founder of South Korea’s School for Broken Hearts. In this conversation, we talk about how perfection resides only in your mind, how a celibate monk learned to give great relationship advice, and how he manages his own relationship to ambition. We also have a fascinating exchange about enlightenment.\nWhere to find Haemin Sunim online:\nWebsite: https://www.haeminsunim.com/en\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/haeminsunim\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/haeminsunim/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/haemin_sunim/?hl=en\nOther Resources Mentioned:\n•   Love for Imperfect Things by Haemin Sunim - https://www.haeminsunim.com/books\n•   Haemin Sunim’s School for Broken Hearts - https://www.haeminsunim.com/school\n•   Song of Myself by Walt Whitman - https://poets.org/poem/song-myself-4\n•   Ash Wednesday by T.S.
