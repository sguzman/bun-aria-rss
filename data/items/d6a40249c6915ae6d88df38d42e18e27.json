  "description": "This week, host Isaac Butler talks to cartoonist and now showrunner Noelle Stevenson about the process of rebooting the ‘80s TV show She-Ra: Princess of Power. In the interview, Noelle talks about developing a fresh vision for the show and ultimately creating one of the most diverse kids shows in history. She also discusses her webcomic, Nimona, which was adapted into a graphic novel and earned her a National Book Award nomination at the age of 23. \nAfter the interview, Isaac and co-host June Thomas offer advice to a listener who wonders if focusing on their art, rather than working with vulnerable people, is too privileged a life choice.  \nIn the exclusive Slate Plus segment, Noelle talks about The Weight of Them, a webcomic she created about her decision to get top surgery. \nSend your questions about creativity and any other feedback to working@slate.com or give us a call at (304) 933-9675.\nPodcast production by Cameron Drews.\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
