  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re hot off the heels of the Underdog Empowerment event, and today’s guest, Callye Keen, is fired up after attending. One of the topics touched on during the event was building a community, and today we’re taking a deep dive into why that is so important. Partnerships and collaboration are one of Callye’s biggest focuses as the Chief Business Development Officer at K-Form. He’s always asking himself, “Who can I work with? Who can I add value to? Who can I collaborate with to increase impact?” He’s well aware that no billion-dollar company was built alone. It’s no secret to Callye that we can do things together that we couldn’t do alone.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normally charging a minimum of $50k as a consultant, and $3,500-$5,000/month for coaching, Callye is currently offering his expertise at a heavily discounted price. He’s doing it because he wants to meet people where they are, helping the people that need it the most. By joining his community, you’ll not only learn how to start and scale a business, but he’ll share his simple strategy he used to presell 150 $700 fidget spinners with zero dollars in ads. It’s the same strategy he’s used to sell technical products to some of the biggest tech companies, including Google and Microsoft. Callye has been designing, manufacturing, and selling products for a long time, and he has plenty of knowledge to share.

There’s zero risk as if, after three months, you don’t think it’s worth it, Callye will refund your money.  To further sweeten the deal, Callye says to decline the upsell offer, and instead DM him to let him know you signed up because of Underdog Empowerment, and he’ll throw that upsell opportunity in for free. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Why community is so important.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest mistake that entrepreneurs make when starting out.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How to access Callye’s expertise for a heavily discounted price.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">And much more!!</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I want to be a leader of a community, I have to be able to solve the problem that they have.” -Callye Keen</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>Connect With Callye:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/callyekeen/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/callyekeen?lang=en\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get podcasting help</span> <a href=\"https://podcastpowertrain.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to grow your business</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!
