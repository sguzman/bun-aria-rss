  "description": "<p>Ladies love a fascist. In Victoria de Grazia's new book The Perfect Fascist, she tells the story of Lilliana Weinman -- a beautiful Jewish heiress, attracting love and devotion in opera houses around Europe -- and Attilio Teruzzi, head of the blackshirts in Mussolini's Italy. Their love story, and the way it falls apart, resonates with what drives men to fascist groups today, the political misdeeds of women, and why instead of starting a war you should maybe just go to the opera instead.</p> <p>Support this podcast: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/publicintellectual\">http://patreon.com/publicintellectual</a></p> <p>http://jessacrispin.com</p>",
