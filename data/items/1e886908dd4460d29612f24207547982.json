  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, Robert Mueller doesn’t have the temperament or objectivity to be a federal prosecutor. There is no special counsel to investigate Russian collusion, only a rogue prosecutor acting as an inquisitor and executioner with a single mission; remove Trump from office. Mueller should be investigating actual Russian collusion between Hillary Clinton, her campaign, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Donna Brazile, and the entire Democratic National Committee, yet he only focuses on President Trump, his family, and his campaign staff. The only Russian collusion that took place occurred in the shadows of the Clinton campaign. Also, there is a big difference between how a leftist is treated by the media and historians than the rest of us. Ruth Bader Ginsberg is turning 85 and she is celebrated in a way that Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Antonin Scalia were never celebrated. We shouldn’t have liberal or conservative wings in the Supreme Court, only justices faithful to the constitution. Ginsberg is just a politician wearing a black robe. Finally, President Trump has put sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2016 election, which is more than Obama did when the Russians were actually in the process of interfering. Vladimir Putin is murdering people again, using mobster tactics and military-grade poisons to kill individuals. Now Russia is targeting our energy grid; these are acts of war by Putin and we need to be pushing back.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
