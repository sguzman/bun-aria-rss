  "description": "<p>Kierra Coles was 3 months pregnant when she went missing in 2018. Now Chicago police have released new video of the postal worker. It is reportedly the  last known images of the 26-year-old.  The video shows Coles walking into her apartment. Hours later, she is seen getting into her car with a man.   About 10:42 p.m., surveillance video captures Coles withdrawing money from an ATM inside a pharmacy.  Police say Coles exited the business three minutes later. That is the last time Coles is seen.  Police eventually questioned a man, identified as a ‘person of interest,’ who is seen parking a vehicle outside Kierra’s apartment. This person has not been identified by police, although Coles' family believe they know who it is. Officers say the man gave several different accounts of what occurred. Again,  a person of interest has not been named and no charges have been filed in this case.  </p>\n<p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Karen Phillips - Victim's Mother</li>\n<li>Wendy Patrick - California prosecutor, author “Red Flags” www.wendypatrickphd.com 'Today with Dr. Wendy' on KCBQ in San Diego, Twitter: @WendyPatrickPHD</li>\n<li>Dr. Angela Arnold - Psychiatrist (Atlanta GA), AngelaArnoldMD.com, Expert in the Treatment of Pregnant/Postpartum Women, Former Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology: Emory University, Former Medical Director of The Psychiatric Ob-Gyn Clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital</li>\n<li>Mona Kay - Private Investigator, \"Mona K Investigations\" (Omaha, NE), Twitter: @monakay</li>\n<li>Dorian Geiger - National Crime Reporter/Editor, Oxygen.com (New York, NY), DorianGeiger.contently.com, Twitter: @dgeigs, Instagram: @DorianGeiger</li>\n</ul><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
