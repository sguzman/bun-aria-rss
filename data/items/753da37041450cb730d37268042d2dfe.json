  "description": "<p>Good morning and welcome to the ride! We get an El Rey Theatre memory from His Flyness. Huh!?!?  The CLO must set a woman straight about her association with the ex-wife of her man.  Ellen DeGeneres announced that after 19 seasons, her talk show will end.  Jury selection for the trial of the three men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery will begin on October 18th.  Chick-fil-A is kinda being stingy with the Polynesian Sauce.  Our girl from The Talk has a parallelism for you.  Attention all ladies. We will have girl talk with the ladies of The Steve Harvey Morning Show at 4pm today.  Carla gives us part 2 of the Porsha drama from yesterday in Reality Update.  Today the show wraps up with a friendly reminder from Shirley and Carla. Steve also has some Family Feud moments just for us.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
