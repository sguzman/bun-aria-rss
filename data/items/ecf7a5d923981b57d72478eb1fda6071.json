  "description": "<p>Reflect Project UPDATE: </p><p>In this episode of Architecture, Design & Photography we sit down with Brandon Brown, restorative justice scholar, Ph.D candidate, adjunct faculty at UMA /Colby College and former prison inmate. </p><p>Back in 2013 Brandon was part of a personal project we started called the Reflect Project. The idea was to photograph inmates at the Maine State Prison and have them write a letter to their younger selves. We then took the written letters and composited each one around the corresponding portrait, creating a more dynamic viewing experience at the subsequent gallery showing. Fast forward to present day (2022) and Brandon has been released from prison after serving more than then years behind bars. In this follow up interview with Brandon, we discuss his time in prison, the impact the Reflect Project had on him, and the work he is currently doing now that he has been released. </p><p>Brandon Brown Story: https://www.pressherald.com/2021/10/18/27004266/ </p><p>Reflect project: https://www.trentbell.com/REFLECT-Project/prisoners/11 Reflect Project </p><p>Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsHNUc4lPkc&t=2s </p><p>More from us: </p><p>Website: http://www.trentbell.com Instagram: </p><p>http://instagram.com/trentbellphotography/ </p><p>Podcast: www.adppodcast.com</p><p> </p><p>Artwork Photo: Tristan Spinski (https://www.tristanspinski.com/)</p>\n",
