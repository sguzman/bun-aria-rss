  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, people deprived of a religious exemption for vaccinations can sue their employers. The federal government has no authority to issue any such mandate, only states have that type of police power. Professor Ken Terry writes on the legality of vaccination mandates, noting that they have quarantine powers but no precedent to force inoculations. Conversely the U.S Supreme Court has underscored an individual's right to bodily autonomy on several occasions. Then, Levinites and the citizenry alike have a better understanding of utopianism and Marxism in part because of this program and its associated writings. The key to fighting this ideological war is to understand the enemy's plan and that's exactly what this program exposes. Later, Democrats attack consumers as if the industrial revolution never happened. It’s because they hate capitalism and blame all ills on it. Afterward, Terry McAuliffe is virtually running against Donald Trump in his race for governor of Virginia. McAuliffe was even called out by the media for failing to respond to Republican candidate GleNn Youngkin and rather just pays lip service to former President Trump.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
