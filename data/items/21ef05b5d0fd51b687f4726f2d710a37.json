  "description": "Today we’re joined again by PhD candidate Jakina Debnam to talk about sugar-sweetened beverage (soda) taxes in Berkeley, Philadelphia and elsewhere.  We talk about who these taxes affect the most and the reactions to the taxes from their local populations.  We also talk about how similar taxes may be levied on other goods.  Hosted by Yudong Rao, Elaine Qiu, and Professor David Just.",
