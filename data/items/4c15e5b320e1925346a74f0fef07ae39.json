Joining the show is a man who has made 5 straight Pro Bowls, one of the most dynamic players in the NFL and now free agent, FB Kyle Juszczyk joins the program to chat about free agency, what's most important to him at this point, where he's leaning, his car being broken, and his pitch to NFL teams (13:50-30:19). Next, 6x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, member of the 2010's All-Decade Team, current Saints Defensive End, Cam Jordan joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about the season that was, what he thinks is going to happen at QB, whether it seemed like it was Drew Brees' last season, his offseason plans, and much more (31:51-42:46).
