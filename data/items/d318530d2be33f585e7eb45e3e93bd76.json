  "description": "This is a special bonus episode we're releasing at the request of our Patreon subscribers. We normally do \"true crime headlines\" as part of our weekly bonus content, but when we covered the new Texas abortion ban SB8, our Patreons asked if we could make it public so they could share.\nSeeing as we live in Texas, we have received a lot of questions lately about SB8. In this segment, we discuss the legal and constitutional questions and violations pertaining to the ban. Of course, our own opinions are thrown in as well. If you're interested, please listen. If this isn't for you, that's ok, too. \nWe hope this provides a quick overview for you on what the law means, its constitutionality, and where the law is headed going forward as it impacts all people seeking access to reproductive care. We recorded this a few weeks ago when the law first went into effect. Since then, there have been some news updates, movement in litigation challenging SB8, and clarifications in the analysis of the law including who it does and does not apply to. So as we say in the segment, be sure to keep up with the updates on this law as it impacts you and those you love. You can also visit the episode link for updates that have happened since we recorded.\n\nAll our love, from TX\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
