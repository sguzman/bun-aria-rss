  "description": "If you're looking for a breather from all the great interviews lately, you might want to up your game a bit because the OM3 train just keeps rolling. JJ and Tommy celebrate the Old Man & the Three's 100th episode with yet another spectacular discussion with one of the game's very best - Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics. Jayson actually visited the show way back in August for the pod's 4th episode, and while he's still the same outstanding player he was then, a lot has changed with him, the Celtics, and the NBA overall during that time. Jayson really digs into and breaks down some hot button topics, while also displaying the attributes that make him such a special player on and off the court. Oh, and there's also some talk on the Duke brotherhood and where the program might be headed now that Coach K is leaving. Don't miss this great conversation... and start getting ready for the next 100. \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
