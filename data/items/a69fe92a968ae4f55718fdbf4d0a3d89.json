  "description": "<p>Today we welcome Tara Well, who is an associate professor of psychology at Barnard College of Columbia University where she has taught Personality Psychology, Health Psychology, and Psychology of Leadership for over 20 years. Her research on motivation, perception, and cognition has been funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). She outlines the research and benefits of her meditation program in her latest book <i>Mirror Meditation</i>.</p><p>In this episode, I talk to Tara Well about mirror meditation. What is the first thing you think of when you look in the mirror? For a lot of us, our initial instinct is to nitpick at our flaws. Using mirror meditation, Tara teaches people how to use one’s reflection to promote self-acceptance and inner knowing. The mirror can help us become kinder not just to ourselves, but to the people around us as well. We also touch on the topics of narcissism, compassion, and attachment. </p><p>Website: <a href=\"https://mirrormeditation.com/\">mirrormeditation.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tarawell88\">@tarawell88</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>01:36 Tara’s expertise in psychology </p><p>05:33 Mirror Meditation </p><p>12:22 Reflecting on identities</p><p>14:39 Sit with yourself</p><p>18:59 Unfreeze yourself</p><p>21:28 Neuroscience of narcissists </p><p>26:08 Compassion for narcissists</p><p>32:42 Anxious and avoidant self-attachment</p><p>36:31 Be there for yourself</p><p>39:20 Look at others in the eyes of love</p><p>42:07 Reclaiming your projections</p><p>43:28 How to see the best in others</p><p>45:45 Self-talk in third person</p><p>46:51 Meditation practice</p>\n",
