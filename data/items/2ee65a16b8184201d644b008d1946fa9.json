  "description": "<p>Brent Weinbach met me at the place I'm staying in LA to talk about how weird he is. Brent is, to put it mildly, a strange person. He sniffs chairs before sitting down, doesn't have a cell phone, eats baby food, and loves 8 bit music. He's \"unique.\" So we had a fun conversation about it and then I tried walking in his shoes for a moment.</p>",
