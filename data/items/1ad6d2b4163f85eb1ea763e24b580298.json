  "description": "[This episode first aired May 1, 2010.]\n\nSUMMARY\n\nDigital timepieces may be changing the way we talk, at least a little. There's Bob o'clock (8:08), Big o'clock (8:19), and even Pi o'clock. Also this week, what do you call that gesture with your fingers when you want to make an image larger on an iPhone? Does anyone use the expression fat chance any more? And do the expressions graveyard shift, saved by the bell, and dead ringer has anything to do with weird Victorian burial practices?FULL DESCRIPTIONAs members of the Bob o'clock Facebook group know, the expression \"It's Bob O'clock!\" means, \"It's 8:08!\" The hosts discuss this and other silly ways to tell time inspired by the boxy numbers on a digital clock. http://bit.ly/cufbDxWhat's the word for that gesture you make with your fingers when you want to make an image larger on an iPhone? Unpinch? Fwoop?A Wisconsin man says he learned an expression that sounds like quixibar from his father to describe something confusing or befuddling. But he's never heard anyone else use it. Is it unique to his family?Does anyone use the expression fat chance any more? Quiz Guy Greg Pliska has a puzzle about heteronyms, words that have the same spelling, but different meanings, like \"moped\" as in \"acted glum\" and \"moped\" as in a motorized bike.A San Diego caller wonders about the expression a-gogo, as in the name of a local restaurant, Hash House A-Gogo. Where'd it come from?You look like death eatin' a cracker walkin' backwards. In Appalachia, this phrase means, \"you look terrible.\" A caller wants to know its origin.A Dallas listener is struck by the fact that Texans talk about East Texas, North Texas, South Texas, and West Texas. So why, she wonders, do people in other states say things like Southern Indiana and Northern California? Grant talks about his daily work as a lexicographer.A Wellesley College student has been reading about the Victorian fear of being buried alive -- also known as taphophobia -- and the bizarre 19th-century burial practices associated with it. She's heard that they gave rise to such expressions as dead ringer, graveyard shift, and saved by the bell. Martha and Grant debunk those linguistic myths.
