Unfortunately, in reality you may have a friend that can kill a whole pizza, have dessert and eat extra fries without gaining an ounce of weight. Others seem to put on weight even looking at a plate of food. What’s the deal? Why is it so easy for some people to gain weight and so hard for others. Why are so many people still sold on the calories in and calories out solution to obesity and weight control? Gary Taubes is an investigative science and health journalist and bestselling author. His latest book, The Case for Keto, tackles a lot of the misinformation around calories and why some people struggle with losing weight even when calories are restricted to the point of a starvation diet. We are led to believe that overeating is the problem, but what if eating too much isn’t what’s making you fat? What if your partner's problem is really how sensitive their body is to storing fat?
