In both downtowns, there are vast networks of climate-controlled pedestrian bridges that reach over the streets and connect adjacent buildings. They were long viewed as modern marvels, but a lot of residents and urban planners want them gone. For critics, skyways are problematic because of who gets to enjoy them and who does not as well as their impact on street activity below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=35972&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">Beneath the Skyway</a></p>\n",
