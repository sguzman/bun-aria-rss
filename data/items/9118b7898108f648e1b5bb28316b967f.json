  "description": "Sermon on The Mount: Chapter 18 - “What’s Love Got To Do With It?” Matthew 7:7-12. “Ask, Seek, Knock…” THE GOLDEN RULE. Again(!!!), another section of the sermon that has been taught a lot, but is often missing the point or full context Jesus was bringing. Discernment continues to be the word of the day (week, year, lifetime). Jesus is wrapping up the sermon here and is beginning to tie together all the threads he has laid out, in the most brilliant and intentional way. Who in this section is asking, seeking and knocking? What does it mean? How do these actions tie into the previous sections? How do these relate to our neighbors and how we should approach them? And, why?\n\nSo much of this is about playing the long game with one another, how we coexist as humans and how to actually love our neighbors as ourselves.\n\nThese threads are weaving a beautiful tapestry that speak to so much of how we are to be, both with one another and with God. Jesus is speaking with such intention that resonates so much with where we are today.\n \nWe at VOX are committed to not only confronting all of this, first in ourselves, but also to wrestle with what Jesus would have for us in this time. We are committed to repentance and a pursuit of discernment.\n\nThis is the second section of the Sermon on the Mount. We’re excited to walk this road with you all.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
