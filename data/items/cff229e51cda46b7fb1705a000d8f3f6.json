    "media:description": "In this session, we will interactively set up a holistic Continuous Delivery pipeline with the use of DevOps enabler tools, based on Cloud, microservices and container technologies. We’ll package a Java EE web application. Its development versions will be inspected and promoted towards production environment in the Cloud, with Docker. Jenkins 2 with its native delivery pipeline features will serve as the major backbone of our DevOps toolchain gluing together other tools of the overall ecosystem. This session discusses concepts and shows tools in action. Happy cooking!",
