  "description": "<p>The third last day of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is over and we're back to go over everything that happened on another medal winning day for both Australia and Canada. Are we disappointed or satisfied with Australia's beach volleyball silver and boxing bronze today? How do we feel about Canada doing so well in athletics? How pumped are we to have more medals won for Off The Podium? Are we still so in love with modern pentathlon, even without Chloe? How good are we at commentating table tennis? What gets us so excited at the end of the episode? And what can we look forward to over the final couple of days? It's another episode that will keep your Olympic mood high so get to listening and get to being entertained!</p>",
