  "description": "<p>Today is the 75th Anniversary of the announcement of the Japanese surrender ending WWII, which became heralded as Victory in Japan Day or V-J Day. On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony are joined by Justin Voithofer to talk about the events that seemingly led to that announcement: the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima & Nagasaki. Perhaps one of the most hotly debated events in world history, these bombings were the first and (hopefully) last instances of nuclear weapons being used on people. The guys talk about the popular history around these bombings and dissect the #1 question that has haunted historians for years: was there any other alternative? Strap in for the 40th Episode of the podcast some people are talking about. Enjoy!</p>",
