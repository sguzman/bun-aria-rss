This week, Slate’s Marissa Martinelli and Laura Miller spoil Enola Holmes. \n\nEnola, who likes to remind people that her name spelled backwards is ‘alone,’ wakes up to find her mother missing. While Enola is determined to investigate her mother’s disappearance, it’s up to Mycroft and Sherlock to figure out what to do with their little sister. Can Enola outwit her intelligent brothers and break free from the stuffy, proper future Mycroft sets out for her? \n\nPlus, Marissa and Laura delve into other, more transgressive, Holmes stories with female protagonists. \n\nYou can read Laura Miller’s review here.\n\nNote: As the title indicates, this podcast contains spoilers galore.\n\nEmail us at spoilers@slate.com.\n\nPodcast production by Rosemary Belson. \n\nSlate Plus members get ad-free podcasts and access to exclusive shows like Dana Stevens’ classic movies podcast Flashback.
