  "description": "<p>Mark Redwine, 59, is on trial for the 2012 murder of his son Dylan Redwine, 13.  Redwine was arrested in Washington in 2017 and charged with second-degree murder and child abuse, years after Dylan’s death. He has maintained his innocence but prosecutors say Redwine killed his son in a fit of rage.  In 2012, volunteer search teams and authorities began scouring the area around Redwine’s Durango, Colorado, home for months, in hopes of finding Dylan. The search proved to be difficult since Durango is at an elevation of 6,512 feet with steep canyons and mountains.   In June 2013, <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2013/06/27/dylan-redwines-remains-found-near-vallecito-sheriff-says/\">searchers found</a> a few of Dylan’s bones, a part of his shirt, a sock, and his shoestring, in Vallecito, which is around five miles away from Durango. Searchers found his remains in an area difficult to get to, especially for a young boy or for someone who doesn’t know the area well.  Defense attorneys argue that Dylan ran away from Redwine’s home and was likely killed by a mountain lion or bear. Forensic expert  Joe Scott Morgan, professor at Jacksonville State University looks at the possibilities. </p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
