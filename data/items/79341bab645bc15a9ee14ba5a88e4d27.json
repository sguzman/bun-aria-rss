  "description": "Horrific terror attacks against Christians in Sri Lanka yesterday. We’ll talk about the persecution of Christians and why it continues to be largely ignored in the West. Also we’ll try to figure out why certain prominent Democrats are going out of their way to avoid acknowledging that Christians are the ones who were attacked. And I have been smeared by a British publication for comments I made about gay adoption. It's a pretty outrageous and dishonest smear and I want to address it. Date: 04-22-2019\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
