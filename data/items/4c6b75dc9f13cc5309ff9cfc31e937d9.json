With a vibrant palette and gift for storytelling, as Africans, we tell powerful stories through color, and it is this unique phenomenon that led to the development of the ‘<a href=\"https://goo.gle/coloursofafrica\">Colors of Africa</a>’ project. This ambitious initiative shares stories from Africa by Africans.</p><p data-block-key=\"c2l4l\">Design Indaba collaborated with Google Arts &amp; Culture on this brand-new, cross-continental project. In order to tell the full story of such a diverse continent, we approached 60 African creatives and asked them each to create a unique work that depicts their home country through the symbolism of color.</p><p data-block-key=\"17o8t\">At the same time we asked what being African meant to them. The resulting works and thoughts offer personal insights into African lived experience and add the <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/qQG6gURIKJ0Rfg\">ever evolving kaleidoscope</a> that is the African continent.</p><p data-block-key=\"t30v\">The stories of each creative have been woven into a colorful tapestry which is available on <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/project/colours-of-africa\">Google Arts &amp; Culture</a>. And this bespoke, online exhibit dives into the artist’s experience of their country – as well as navigating the intricacies of life as an African. In addition to the exhibits, you can spin the kaleidoscope to explore and collect the colors of Africa. Experience the different countries and travel through Africa guided by the eyes of local artists.</p><p data-block-key=\"7heb6\">Each work is a personal and completely unique experience of a country. Discover some of the colors of Africa below:</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_carousel\"><div class=\"h-c-page article-module\" data-component=\"uni-image-carousel\"><div class=\"article-module
