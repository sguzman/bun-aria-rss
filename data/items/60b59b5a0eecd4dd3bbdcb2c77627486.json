  "description": "Welcome to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged.   Marin is back!   For those unfamiliar, Marin Katusa, the founder of Katusa Research, is probably the most connected guy in the resource industry.   As always, he comes on the show to give listeners his insight and full updates in the gold, uranium, and energy industries.   Coming from a guy who is usually bullish when it comes to junior miners… Today, Marin is taking a completely different stance.   You heard that right.   Marin, who focuses 100% of his time on the resource sector, is giving investors a fair warning.   “A tsunami of selling is coming to the junior mining sector.”   And oddly enough, it has nothing to do with the companies themselves.   The rising issue for junior miners lies behind a major rebalancing of a popular Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) known as the VanEck Junior Gold Miner (symbol GDXJ).   Marin is here to give you all the details of this developing story… and explain why this already weak sector will get even worse.   In a matter of weeks, Marin expects these small-cap stocks can plummet as far 25%-50%.   However, as Marin explains, this news will lead to a chain reaction that is “music to our ears…”   “You want to buy when others are forced to sell,” he says.   This will be one of those rare market opportunities where investors can buy some of the world’s most valuable junior gold companies for pennies on the dollar.   Marin and I then talk about the one and only Northern Dynasty (NAK). Marin’s been closely studying this stock for over two years now. In fact, he’s the one who initially introduced me to it when the stock was at only 40 cents.   Now that the long awaited EPA agreement with the company has finally been settled, to end the episode, Marin shares with us NAK’s biggest catalyst going forward.   Let’s not forget: We’re talking about the world’s largest undeveloped copper and gold mine here. It’s just the beginning.   Also, don’t sign off when Marin leaves…   99% of investors, even Marin, are bearish when it comes to the oil and gas industry. But not me. On this week’s Educational Segment, I explain why we should all be aggressively buying in the sector before OPEC comes out with another game-changing announcement.   Good Investing,   Frank Curzio",
