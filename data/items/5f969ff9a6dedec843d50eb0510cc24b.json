Democrats threaten to retaliate with court-packing scheme, statehood for D.C. & Puerto Rico, and 16-year-olds voting. \"Moderate\" or \"undecided\" today just means anti-Trump. Remember, the GOP won Senate seats in 2018 thanks to Kavanaugh. What could RINO Republicans do in a vote? Why won't Plugs release his list of SCOTUS nominees?</p><p><br></p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p><br></p><p>President Trump praises Rush in North Carolina speech. Trump dares say he doubts RBG deathbed plea. A president has the power to nominate for the Supreme Court as long as he or she is president. Harry Reid ended the judicial filibuster, and now it's biting them. Somehow, it's our fault that Plugs said 200 million will die of COVID. We need to fill this seat ASAP. Andy McCarthy: The Constitution's requirements for a nomination are all met.</p><p><br></p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p><br></p><p>Leftist hate embodied by Leo Guinan's column where he demands father choose between voting Trump and never seeing his son or grandson again. Will Democrats want to be seen attacking Barbara Lagoa, the Cuban-American judge on Trump's shortlist? Barbara Lagoa, Cuban-American on Trump's short list, fought to keep Elian Gonzalez here in freedom.
