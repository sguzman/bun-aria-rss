  "description": "Emily gives you the low-down on lube and why it makes sex that much better. But before you lube up, you may or may not need to find a partner. Emily and her cohost Menace give tips for meeting someone outside the bar. You might just find your next GF/BF at the laundromat. In other news, Menace tried Viagra, got waxed, and now it’s time for him to get his penis P-jazzled (decorated with rhinestones). Emily tells you how to send a naked photo, how to count condoms to see if he's cheating, and when it's time to hire a private investigator. Emily also answers listeners questions about sex toys for men, slowly undressing women, and fantasizing about someone else while having sex.
