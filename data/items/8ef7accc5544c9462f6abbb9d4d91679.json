Although we might feel helpless and hopeless at times about this crisis, we actually have the ability to contribute to the reversal of global warming. It starts with our food choices and using our dollar to support companies that have plans to do their part and sequester carbon. In today’s episode, I talk with Paul Hawken, David Wallace-Wells, Jared Blumenfeld, and Tom Newmark about the urgency of taking action to stabilize the earth’s climate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul Hawken is an environmentalist, entrepreneur, author, and activist who has dedicated his life to environmental sustainability and changing the relationship between business and the environment. He is one of the environmental movement’s leading voices, and a pioneering architect of corporate reform with respect to ecological practices. Paul is Executive Director of Project Drawdown, a nonprofit organization dedicated to researching when and how global warming can be reversed. He is on a mission to present real, already existing solutions to reverse global warming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>David Wallace-Wells is Deputy Editor of <em>New York</em> Magazine and the author of the international bestseller <em>The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming</em>, published in February 2019, which the <em>New York Times</em> called both \"brilliant\" and \"the most terrifying book I have ever read.\" While the real truth about climate change can be scary, it’s a more important conversation than ever. Throughout our talk, David shares the history of climate change and the three major issues at hand: speed, scope, and severity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jared Blumenfeld is California’s Secretary for Environmental Protection.

Tom is the cofounder and board chair of The Carbon Underground, cofounder of the Soil Carbon Initiative, and a founding member of the Regenerative Agriculture Initiative of California State University, Chico.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens and Beekeeper’s.</p><br><p>Right now when you purchase AG1 from Athletic Greens, you will receive 10 FREE travel packs with your first purchase by visiting <a href=\"http://athleticgreens.com/hyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">athleticgreens.com/hyman</a>.</p><br><p>Beekeeper’s Natural have created B.Fueled Bee Pollen and B.Powered Superfood Honey, which I’ve been absolutely loving.
