  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the cover-up continues today, just like yesterday, with the Biden Administration praising the best airlift in history, which is actually the greatest surrender in American history. Meanwhile, Americans and Afghan nationals continue to be slaughtered on their trek to the Kabul airport. Then, Secretary of State Antony Blinken's State department is not trustworthy and is placing the onus on \"Americans that won't leave\" Afghanistan. Multiple reports have emerged from Americans and Afghani’s warning that they'll be killed if they leave their homes to get to the airport. Later, Speaker Nancy Pelosi spreads more lies about Republicans stifling the right to vote as they close the loopholes exploited by democrats who want to weaken elections. Also, Democrats are hard on vaccines and mask mandates, but not at the southern border. Yet the media will still portray effective Governors like Ron DeSantis as if he were the Taliban. Afterward, former White House Press Secretary, Kayleigh McEnany calls in to discuss how the Biden Administration lies and is covering up for one another over the Afghanistan surrender.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
