  "description": "Dopp is out this week, so Katie and Ashley throw out a bunch of bits they've always wanted to try. \"Somethings Gotta Go\" (9:49) forces Katie to get rid of one great sports accomplishment. \"Gotta Hear Both Sides\" (13:49) has her argue both for and against Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson's early engagement. In \"Bake Your Take (Working Title)\" (23:25), she tries to argue that breakfast restaurants have a unique advantage they keep failing to capitalize on. And in \"Metaphorically Speaking\" (33:20), they provide metaphors for each team in the World Cup to help you better understand what's happening and who you should put your money on (allegedly?). Oh, and a \"Bachelorette Update\" (1:10:20).",
