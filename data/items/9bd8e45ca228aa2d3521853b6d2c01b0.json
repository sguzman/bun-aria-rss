Your small intestine is also the home of your gut-immune system, which accounts for about 60 percent of your total immune system. The lining of this sophisticated system is just one cell layer away from a toxic sewer where all of the bacteria and undigested food particles live in your gut. If that lining breaks down—from stress; too many antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin or ibuprofen; steroids; intestinal infections; a low-fiber, high-sugar diet; alcohol; and more—your immune system will be exposed to foreign particles from food, bacteria, and other microbes.
