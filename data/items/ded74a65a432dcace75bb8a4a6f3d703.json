  "title": "A Conversation with Bishop T.D. Jakes on Mental Health, Spirituality & Racism + How He Deals with Anxiety",
  "description": "<p>For many of us, spirituality brings comfort and peace in times of trouble—our belief systems support us and hold us up when things get rough. But can the same be said for our society as a whole? Can faith and love win in a highly anxious, depressed and tribalistic culture? In this podcast, I speak with best-selling author, respected spiritual leader and global activist Bishop T.D. Jakes about mental health and spirituality, the power of rest, why boundaries help us be better people, racism and the church’s shortcomings, and what we can all do to bring about change and make our society a more enriching place for all people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read the show blog here: &nbsp;https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/a-conversation-with-bishop-t-d-jakes-on-mental-health-spirituality-racism-how-he-deals-with-anxiety</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>**Special offers from this week's sponsors** &nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Hiya Health (the best children's multivitamin): Receive 50% off your first order.
