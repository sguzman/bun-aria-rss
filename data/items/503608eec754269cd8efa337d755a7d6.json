A lot of these investments are linked to the Belt and Road initiative. <a href=\"https://www.bruegel.org/people/giuseppe-porcaro\">Giuseppe Porcaro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bruegel.org/people/alicia-garcia-herrero\">Alicia García-Herrero</a> invite <a href=\"https://www.bruegel.org/people/mira-milosevich-juaristi\">Mira Milosevich-Juaristi</a> to help navigate the Chinese investments in the Balkans and their strategic importance and what this means for Europe. <br>\n<br>\nThis episode is part of the ZhōngHuá Mundus series of The Sound of Economics.<br>\n<br>\nZhōngHuá Mundus is a newsletter by Bruegel, bringing you monthly analysis of China in the world, as seen from Europe. <a href=\"https://bruegel.secure.force.com/events/UpdateAcc?sf=1&s4=1\">Sign up now</a> to receive it in your mailbox!</div>\n",
