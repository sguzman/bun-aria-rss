  "itunes:summary": "Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?\n\nRare performances from CS + Kreme, Maria Moles and efp will reignite our Ritual Community Music series for 2022. Circling bodies, hallucinatory sounds and luxury systems will take place at the Meat Market Pavilion on the 11th of February. \n\nCS + Kreme is Conrad Standish and Sam Karmel’s deeply romantic and stealthily addictive music characterised by heavy dub processing and sweeping patterns of melody and noise.  Anchored by Standish’s dexterous bass and Karmel’s skewiff electronics they record slow, hallucinatory experimental music. Ahead of their performance for Liquid Architecture, Sam Karmel talks through how the duo started  working together, how they use improvisation and slowness in their music, and what to expect from their live performance. \n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/cs-kreme-maria-moles-efp\n\nRitual Community Music \n11 February 2022\nMeat Market, North Melbourne\nPresented by Liquid Architecture\n\nImage: ​​Louis Horne\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
