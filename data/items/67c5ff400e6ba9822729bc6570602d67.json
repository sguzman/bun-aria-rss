  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, it's too little too late for FISA Judge Rosemary Collyer who chose not to act in 2017 when Landmark Legal Foundation filed a 'friend of the court brief' citing the abuse of the FISA Court. Collyer denied Landmark’s request and now, two and a half years later, rebukes the FBI for their \"irregularities.\" Her actions are disappointing and she should be held to account and publicly share the facts behind her new decision to look into these matters. Then, President Trump submitted his statement on impeachment for the record today citing the lack of an impeachable offense, the erosion of our Constitution, and the ill-spirited will of Democrats in the legislature to attack him over political differences. Later, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pushes back on Sen. Chuck Schumer's request for witnesses. Similarly, Rep. Jerry Nadler makes the case against impeachment and the undoing of a national election back in 1998. Afterward, House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Rep Doug Collins challenged his Democrat colleagues with a public reading of Federalist 65 to make his case that the Democrats have failed to make a case for any impeachable offense. The big issue here is that the Democrats and never-Trumpers are upset that there's a businessman in the White House shaking things up and challenging their status quo because unlike them, he loves his country. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
