  "description": "Guns are still dominating the conversation in Washington, though Congress has come and gone this week without taking any real steps to pass legislation. President Trump held another made-for-TV meeting on school safety and gun laws where he confused and frustrated Republicans. It's also been a week of staff turmoil at the White House. One of Trump's closest and most trusted aides, Communications Director Hope Hicks, is stepping down, and his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, has lost his top-secret security clearance. And the president made a controversial announcement Thursday, that he plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. This episode: host/congressional reporter Scott Detrow, White House correspondent Scott Horsley, political reporter Asma Khalid and editor correspondent Ron Elving.
