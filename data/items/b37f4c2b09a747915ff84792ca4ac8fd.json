The Nets had already picked up Blake Griffin a few weeks ago. But, quite frankly, Drummond should have more of an impact with the Lakers than Aldridge and Griffin will combined with the Nets because at least he has a defined role. Aldridge, Griffin and Jeff Green all do the same things at this point in their careers so it's hard to determine which guy will get meaningful playing time in the postseason. On the NFL front, the San Francisco 49ers made a blockbuster trade on Friday to move up to #3 in the NFL Draft presumably to land their quarterback of the future. Naturally, many expected that would mean that incumbent starter Jimmy Garoppolo is on the trade block. Not so fast, my friend. Recent history tells us that NFL teams prefer to let their rookie quarterbacks sit on the bench for at least a few games before throwing them into the fire, especially in cases where said rookie had limited experience in college; NDSU's Trey Lance and Ohio State's Justin Fields have less than 20 collegiate starts combined. Translation - Jimmy G ain't going nowhere. Finally, Jason closes the show with a very special Elite Eight edition of the Best Bet.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
