  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Dan Bongino of NRATV fills in with Mark. The left has imposed a PC war on Conservatives, relentlessly attacking for every slight and calling them racists, homophobes, and xenophobes. They’ve imposed a danger zone mentality on us, where we focus less on the little things and more on survival; which is why President Trump has so much support. Trump has chosen to fight back against what the left has been doing to Conservatives for decades. That’s why Trump has a certain loyalty from supporters that other president’s didn’t have. Also, how many times will the media and liberals ramp up this phony Michael Cohen collusion story. The entire Russian collusion case against Trump is based on the debunked Steele dossier, and a key component of the dossier is that Cohen went to Prague to coordinate with Russia. It turns out Cohen was in California and has a strong alibi, so now it’s a big CYA moment for the media to keep the collusion narrative alive.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
