  "description": "A rumor has taken hold among some Republicans that President Joe Biden wants to curtail America’s meat consumption — a rumor that, to be clear, isn’t true. The White House has no plans to limit people to eating certain amounts of beef as part of its climate proposal. However, that doesn’t mean meat has a positive impact on the environment. Food-related emissions, including those resulting from meat production, are a major contributor to climate change. Vox senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp debunks claims of Biden’s burger crackdown — and discusses why we should be having a discussion about meat if we really want to save the planet.\n\nLearn more: \n\nRead Zack’s story about Biden’s fake burger ban here.\n\nSeason 3 of Future Perfect is about the meat industry. Listen to the trailer here.\n\n\nTell Me More is hosted by Emily Stewart and produced by Sofi LaLonde.\n––\nEnjoyed this episode?
