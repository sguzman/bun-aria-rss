  "description": "<p><p>NO SPOILERS - Johnny Bananas stops by to talk with Clem, KFC, and Feits about The Challenge and his new show, First Look. The recommendation of the week was Yellowstone, which we will watch and discuss next week. Send us your recommendations with the hashtag #WatchlistWednesday. Shooter gets the ax, much to Feitelberg's dismay. Treadstone looks good, it's the Jason Bourne origin story. The Hills is back, True Detective 3 is coming soon (are you excited about it?), and a recap of the VMAs.</p><p>What are you watching?</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
