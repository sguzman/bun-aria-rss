Each one needs enzymes to occur, and enzymes need nutrients like minerals to do their part of the job. Big picture, that means minerals have an enormous impact on our health. But we’re seeing an epidemic of mineral deficiencies, in an age of overnutrition with starch and sugar and undernutrition of essential nutrients. Even small amounts of insufficiency can lead to big problems. Today on The Doctor’s Farmacy, I’m excited to connect with Dr. James DiNicolantonio to look at the increasing issue of mineral deficiencies, how we got here, and what we can do to consciously consume more minerals.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. DiNicolantonio is a Doctor of Pharmacy and a cardiovascular research scientist.
