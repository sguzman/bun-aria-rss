He holds a PhD from Princeton University, where he worked at the intersection of cryptography and cryptocurrencies.

Before Offchain, he attended Princeton as a PhD candidate, where his research explored economics, anonymity, and incentive compatibility of cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>Arbitrum released its Mainnet for Developers last Friday. This is an EVM-Compatible Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup, which allows for scaling Ethereum's app layer without sacrificing layer 1 Ethereum security & consensus. This is a massive step forward for the blockchain space and a culmination of years of technical research and testing. This is a milestone in effectively scaling blockchains, while maintaining core cypherpunk values.</p> <p>There are tremendous opportunities and possibilities in this new digital real estate. This hub of optimized blockspace keeps the economic security guarantees of Ethereum and poses to greatly improve the DeFi user experience. To scale to a billion users, projects like Arbitrum need to earn legitimacy and demonstrate efficacy as the Ethereum ecosystem continues to mature. In the immediate term, the next few months will be exciting to watch - will we see a DeFi Layer 2 Summer?</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Arbitrum:<br /> <a href=\"https://arbitrum.io/\">https://arbitrum.io/</a> <br /> Arbitrum Twitter: <br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/arbitrum?s=20\">https://twitter.com/arbitrum?s=20</a> <br />  Arbitrum Discord:<br /> <a href= \"http://discord.gg/5KE54JwyTs\">http://discord.gg/5KE54JwyTs</a> </p> <p>-----</p> <p>Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Buffer<br /> 0:30 Intro<br /> 9:48 Arbitrum's Steven and Harry<br /> 13:00 Shipping A Layer 2 Product<br /> 17:51 A Fair Launch, Equal Opportunity<br /> 21:36 Migrating dApps to Layer 2<br /> 25:43 A Flourishing Ecosystem<br /> 29:17 Bridging the User Experience<br /> 33:16 Different than a Sidechain<br /> 36:50 Layer 2 ETH Fees<br /> 41:10 Resources & Scaling<br /> 47:03 Delay Period for Exiting<br /> 54:11 Complexity of Rollups<br /> 58:30 A Digital Nation-State<br /> 1:06:23 Ether is the Reserve Currency<br /> 1:11:23 Layer 2 DeFi Summer<br /> 1:16:30 Chainlink and Arbitrum<br /> 1:20:54 Squeezing the MEV Balloon<br /> 1:25:28 Predictions, DeFi Summer<br /> 1:30:50 Final Thoughts<br /> 1:36:38 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Not financial or tax advice.
