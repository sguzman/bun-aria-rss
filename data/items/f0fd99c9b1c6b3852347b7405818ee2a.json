  "description": "CISA is releasing this cybersecurity advisory to warn organizations that malicious cyber actors are exploiting CVE-2022-22954 and CVE-2022-22960. These vulnerabilities affect versions of VMware products. Successful exploitation permits malicious actors to trigger a server-side template injection that may result in remote code execution or escalation of privileges to root level access. Based on this activity, CISA expects malicious cyber actors to quickly develop a capability to exploit newly released VMware vulnerabilities CVE-2022-22972 and CVE-2022-22973 in the same impacted VMware products.\nAA22-138B Alert, Technical Details, and Mitigations\nAA22-138B.stix\nEmergency Directive 22-03 Mitigate VMware Vulnerabilities\nVMware Security Advisory VMSA-2022-0011\nVMware Security Advisory VMSA-2022-0014\nAll organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at central@cisa.dhs.gov or (888) 282-0870 and to the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7 CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.",
