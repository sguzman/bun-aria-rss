  "title": "Ep. 459 - Presidents Birx And Fauci",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Dr. Fauci has seemed to imply that the president should enact a national stay-at-home order, which of course would be wildly unconstitutional, not to mention redundant and useless. Meanwhile Dr. Birx is lecturing Americans for failing to follow her instructions. Are we giving too much power and trust to the medical experts? Also, Five Headlines, including new recommendations that we “socially distance” from our own families at home. And today I have the distinct honor and privilege of canceling Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
