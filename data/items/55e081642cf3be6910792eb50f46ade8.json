  "description": "<p>The Breakfast Club is back! And a big congratulations go out to DJ Envy for the delivery of him and his wife’s 6th child. Moreover, as Charlamagne is still on vacation, Angela and Envy hold down the show and opened the phone lines to hear what their listeners needed to say for“Get it off Your Chest”, after the weekend. During the segment they had a listener who spoke about her lying, cheating and manipulative boyfriend after looking through his phone, so they decided to make it into a topic and ask their listeners what’s the craziest thing they have seen in their partner’s phone. Also, they opened the phone lines to see what was ruined during Thanksgiving dinner after Envy believed Angela may have messed up Thanksgiving dinner at her place. Also, since Charlamagne is not here we had listeners call in to give their nomination for “Donkey of the Day”.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
