  "description": "<p>Amazon. No company has impacted the internet — and all of modern life — more than this one. We’ve waited seven years to do this episode, and are so, so excited to finally dive into every nook and cranny of this legendary company. And of course because we’re Acquired and this is Amazon, we couldn’t contain it all to just one episode… even a 4+ hour one! So today we focus on <a href= \"http://Amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a> the retail business, and we’ll have another full episode on AWS coming soon. And because all great series are trilogies, to fully understand Amazon we highly recommend starting first with <a href= \"https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/walmart\">our previous episode on Walmart</a>, which truly is the giant’s shoulder that Jeff Bezos stood upon. Let’s go!!<br /> <br /></p> <p><strong>**Big News**</strong><br /> We've got merch!
