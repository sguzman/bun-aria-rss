  "description": "<p>Maya Shankar sits down with Jay Shetty to talk about taking lessons from other people’s stories. While it is easy to inspire people to change when you have the tools and right environment to inspire them, it’s difficult to change a person’s mind. This is because our mind sticks to our own reality, it believes the circumstances that we are in, and it associates with the community that we belong to.</p><p>Maya is currently the Senior Director of Behavioral Economics at Google and is the Creator, Host, and Executive Producer of “A Slight Change of Plans”, a podcast with Pushkin Industries. Maya previously served as a Senior Advisor in the Obama White House, where she founded and served as Chair of the White House's Behavioral Science Team.
