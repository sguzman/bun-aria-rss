Also, speaking of why the film is needed, three middle school boys have been charged with sexual harassment for “misgendering” a classmate. And the media vultures immediately set to work politicizing a mass shooting in Buffalo. Plus, the mayor of Chicago poses for embarrassing photo ops in Texas while violence rips her city apart.
