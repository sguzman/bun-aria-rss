  "description": "<p>Andrea Seabrook spent more than a decade at National Public Radio, and covered Congress for a good part of that time. She left NPR to start something of her own: DecodeDC, a podcast and syndicated radio program (on this very network) that cuts through the blandification of politics, and speaks the unvarnished truth that gets lost in the interest of presenting supposedly balanced viewpoints. Andrea is fair, but she doesn't shrink from cutting through layer after layer of spin, something that's typically not possible in conventional broadcast media. We talk about the future of public radio and the joy of making your own decisions about what your audience wants to hear.</p>\n\n\n\n",
