  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the CDC received a blistering report regarding its handling of COVID and it was determined that it fell short of expectations and will be shaking things up. Contrary to what it sounds like the CDC will likely shake things up to make things more political while instituting additional woke policies. Then, Liz Cheney lost her election and keeps burping up platitudes about democracy instead of discussing our constitutional republic. Cheney is all about her and no one else especially not the American people in Wyoming. Cheney is no Abraham Lincoln, she's actually more like Benedict Arnold. Later, FL Gov. Ron DeSantis blasts Biden for adding 87,000 IRS agents to target the Administration's political enemies and raise money for the ruling class's pet projects. This massive spending and tax law will not reduce inflation, it will only empower the government and hurt the people. Also, under the Espionage Act, the people that write these classified documents have the responsibility to retrieve said documents, the responsibility is not the President's. Will anyone that produced or delivered classified information to President Trump be prosecuted? Afterward, Paul Manafort calls in to discuss his new book \"Political Prisoner: Persecuted, Prosecuted, but Not Silenced.\"\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Political-Prisoner-Persecuted-Prosecuted-Silenced/dp/1510772421\nManafort added that he was imprisoned in solitary confinement with a 10 million dollar bond for an alleged Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). Manafort details how the feds only mistreated him in order to get to Trump by any means necessary. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
