  "description": "Happy 4th of July! This is a special holiday for me. It brings back great childhood memories of our summer house in upstate  New York. That’s where my late dad put on a firework display that would put most professional displays to shame. I hope all of you enjoy time with your family. Drink a few beers, tell some great stories, and enjoy the barbecue. When you’re done, you’ll love my interview this week. I welcome back Hugh Agro, a superstar in the mining industry. Hugh is President and CEO of Revival Gold, a company I introduced you to six months ago on this podcast. The company just reported blockbuster drilling results at its flagship project, Beartrack. It’s a game changer—which is why the stock is one of the best-performing junior mining companies over the past 12 months. Hugh talks about these drilling results… and highlights why he’s buying more shares of his company right now. He also explains why gold prices are close to a bottom—and are likely to move much higher over the next 24 months. It’s an interview you don’t want to miss. Finally, in my educational segment… I break down a controversial investing strategy that’s almost guaranteed to make you money. It’s also likely to make a lot of listeners angry... since this secret is known to destroy people’s lives.",
