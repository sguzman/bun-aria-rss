  "description": "<p>A special and exciting interview coming your way today as we speak with our first ever Canoe/Kayak athletes and recently returned Olympians from Tokyo, Alyce & Jordan Wood, about their amazing careers and Olympic experiences! We find out from both of them how they got into the sport and how much surf lifesaving has played a part and also helped in their careers. We also learn about the differences between canoe & kayak, as well as what leads an athlete to choose sprint over slalom and how it compares to the often related sport of rowing. Added to this some great stories about their experiences in both Rio & Tokyo, finding out just how quarantine is going for them and just why super hero movies aren’t exactly on the film watching list for one of them, it’s one fun interview that you will enjoy! So get to listening! </p>",
