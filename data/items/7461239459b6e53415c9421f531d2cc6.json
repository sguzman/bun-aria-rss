  "description": "<p>It’s one of the most popular shows every year and we expect this year to be no different. It’s the Cigar Industry Prediction show. We see so many reps, sales managers and brand owners over the course of the year and we hear more then our fair share of rumors. Some of them can quickly be written off, but some of them might just hold some truth to them.</p>\n<p>This year we make our prediction on acquisitions, mergers, imports, FDA and tobacco. We will do so while we smoke a cigar from the care package, Henry Clay War Hawk.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we will light up a Mi Querida Triqui Traca as we will continue the discussion and stir the pot. We will also have a contest where you can win airfare, hotel, and a VIP ticket for next years Two Guys Smoke Shop’s 35th Anniversary. Tune in to find out how you can win!</p>\n<p>We will have all this and the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.2GuysCigars.com%2F&redir_token=__oxaDyDdFvL0tSDitXGL8P7Hqd8MTU2NTQ2OTY0NkAxNTY1MzgzMjQ2&event=video_description&v=5KB10PtanU4'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
