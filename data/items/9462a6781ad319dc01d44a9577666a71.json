  "description": "<p>We got the chance to speak with legend of stage and screen, Bob Saget. Bob&nbsp;played Danny Tanner on the ABC sitcom Full House and its Netflix sequel Fuller House, he was the host of America's Funniest Home Videos for 8 seasons, he’s been crushing the standup comedy game for 4 decades and now he’s the host of Nashville Squares on CMT.</p>\n<p>We fell in love with Bob immediately. He was so friendly and accommodating&nbsp;and you can tell that he knows no stranger, which is such a rare quality for a person as famous as he is. We took full advantage of his generosity and spoke with him for over 50 minutes. We enjoyed every second of it and we think you will too.</p>\n<p>Catch Bob on <a href=\"http://www.cmt.com/shows/nashville-squares\" target=\"_blank\">CMT's Nashville Squares</a>&nbsp;Friday nights at 8pm ET / 7pm CT.</p>\n",
