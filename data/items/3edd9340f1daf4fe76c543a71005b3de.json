We’re ready to set the trap and go on Instagram (well, we’d send Kristin’s friend on Instagram) to try to lure him into doing something inappropriate so we could expose him as the dirty cheater he is (or, to be fair, expose him as the great guy and boyfriend that he is).\nIn this case, she doesn't believe her husband is cheating. BUT she also doesn't believe he's not attracted to other women. Since they got together, he says he hasn't felt and emotional or sexual attraction for anyone else.\nIs he telling the truth? We're going to find out.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
