  "link": "https://www.spreaker.com/user/10740198/history-unplugged-super-infinite-with-ad",
  "description": "John Donne was not a typical English clergyman. Before his ordination, the 17th century Anglican priest had worked as a poet, lawyer, pirate, satirist, politician, and chaplain to the King, before ultimately becoming dean of the St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. But it was his preaching and writing that made him famous. He was so popular that thousands came to hear him, nearly killing some attendees in a stampede in one incident in 1623.<br /><br />It was his power over language that made him a celebrity. Most famous for his love poetry and erotic verse, Donne wrote about spirituality, and sex in a way that nobody else has, before or since. Taken together, Donne’s writings cements him as one of the finest writers in English, up there with Shakespeare. <br /><br />Despite his fame at the time, today he is a mystery. No diary entries, firsthand accounts, or manuscript drafts of his poems remain. What we do know of his life is that he suffered incredible hardship. He was a father of 10, often lived in squalor, and wrote a treatise on suicide as a young man. Yet despite these problems, or perhaps because of them, he was full of awe and wonder and captured that better than any other writer of his time.<br />Today’s guest is Katherine Rundell, author of Super-Infinite: The Transformations of John Donne. She discusses how Donne saw with such a unique perspective and how he set down what he knew with such precision and flair that we can seize hold of it and carry it with us today.",
