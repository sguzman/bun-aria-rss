We held NOTHING back as we challenged one another to find the TRUTH. Now, I am incredibly excited to share with you PART 2, The Liberal Perspective with Former President Barack Obama's economic advisor, Austan Goolsbee!</p> <p>This mini-series is all about THE FACTS and the HARD TRUTHS that often get skewed and filtered by biased media stations and one-sided conversations. It’s our civic duty to VOTE but we must first be well-informed before we can do so with clarity and confidence. That’s EXACTLY why I created this mini-series… because you DESERVE the unfiltered truths straight from the mouths of the ones closest to the action!</p> <p>Austan Goolsbee formerly served as the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and was a member of the cabinet of President Barack Obama. This great American economist is currently the Robert P. Gwinn Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.</p> <p>As I warned you in part 1, we don’t agree with each other on everything... but I'm holding NOTHING back as we challenge one another to find the TRUTH.</p> <p>MY JOB IN BOTH INTERVIEWS IS TO ASK HARD QUESTIONS! I’M NOT POLITICAL. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I encourage you to keep your blinders off so that you can hear out BOTH sides to make an optimal decision.</p> <p>In this interview, the facts and truths uncovered from part 1 will be challenged, dissected and new truths and facts uncovered. We talk about everything from the economy and the realities of a looming recession to Obamacare, medicare, and how those are shaping the future of our country.</p> <p>Austan even shares his disappointment of missed opportunities during Obama’s presidential term. Also, what was it like to be w the President on a historic evening he was elected.</p> <p>I share these with you guys NOT because I have an agenda, but because I genuinely care about you, your families and this country. I learned so much in both of these interviews and I want YOU to be fully equipped so that you can VOTE based on the FACTS and make the BEST decision not just for you, but for your family and for the United States.</p>\n",
