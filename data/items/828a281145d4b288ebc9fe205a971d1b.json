They are mentioned in the credits of the video :)\n\nThis is my video series about Complex Analysis. I hope that it will help everyone who wants to learn about it.\n\nThis video is about complex analysis. Here we talk about the important identity theorem.\n\nComplex analysis is a video series I started for everyone who is interested in calculus with the complex numbers and wants to expand her knowledge beyond the calculus with real numbers. Some basic facts from my Real Analysis course is needed but always mentioned in the videos.\n\nI hope that this helps students, pupils and others. Have fun!\n\n#ComplexAnalysis\n\n(This explanation fits to lectures for students in their first and second year of study: Mathematics for physicists, Mathematics for the natural science, Mathematics for engineers and so on)",
