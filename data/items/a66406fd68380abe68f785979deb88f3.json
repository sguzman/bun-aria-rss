They are living someone else's life, or they're living a life that's so disconnected from who they are that ... And they're living a life that they didn't consciously choose for themselves, and because they don't have a healthy relationship with themselves, with their interior life, it becomes very difficult to set the right goals.” [24:01] “It's easy to say, I'm an outlier. But, I'm not. I really am not anything special. I had the courage and the audacity to pursue these things. And, in so doing, I have realized that human potential is malleable. We're all sitting atop massive reservoirs of untapped potential and ability.” [35:35]  FOLLOW RICH ROLL: WEBSITE - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/1lTmUBQ\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/1lTmUBQ</a> TWITTER - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/1Rpn19v\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/1Rpn19v</a> YOUTUBE - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2ROrM2G\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2ROrM2G</a> INSTAGRAM - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2PuIWAU\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2PuIWAU</a> FACEBOOK - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2A9vDAB\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2A9vDAB</a> VIMEO - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2IXF1dk\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2IXF1dk</a> LINKEDIN - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2A9Pbop\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2A9Pbop</a> PODCASTS MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: Rich Roll Podcast - <a href=\"https://apple.co/1Aj7AES\" rel=\"noopener\">https://apple.co/1Aj7AES</a> [0:42]  BOOKS MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: Finding Ultra - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NIUj6m\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/2NIUj6m</a> [2:20] PEOPLE MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: Ryan Holiday - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2n38TNI\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2n38TNI</a> [2:35] David Goggins - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2zhZJyf\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2zhZJyf</a> [14:08] James Lawrence - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2PuO481\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2PuO481</a> [35:28] FILMS MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RMvTMB\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/2RMvTMB</a> [22:26]",
