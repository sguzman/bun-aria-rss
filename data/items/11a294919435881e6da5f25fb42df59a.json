  "description": "<p>Have you come to a point in your life where the pursuits of your younger years no longer seem meaningful or satisfying? Maybe it's time for you to transition from the first half of your life to the second.</p>\n<p>My guest today has spent decades helping people, particularly men, make this passage. His name is <a href=\"https://www.jameshollis.net/\">James Hollis</a> and he's a Jungian analyst and the author of over a dozen books, including <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P2A436/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000P2A436&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life</em></a>. We begin our conversation with a brief overview of what makes Jungian or depth psychology unique, and how it helps individuals find meaning and deal with life's existential questions. Our discussion then explores the differences between the first and second halves of life, and how the main question of the first is \"What is the world asking of me?\" while the primary question of the second is \"What is my soul asking of me?\" Jim explains why you need to sort through the influences of your family and culture on who you've become and how the second half of life is about finding personal authority and sovereignty. We also discuss why the first half of life is always \"a gigantic, unavoidable mistake,\" and why that's okay.</p>\n<p>Jim explains what triggers the impetus to move from the first to the second half of life, how it can happen at any age, how to make the transition from one phase to the other, and why the journey to the second can be terrifying because it lacks the structure of the first. Jim describes the internal systems you can use for guidance in moving forward in the absence of this external structure. He then gets into the importance of continuing to grow in your profession or marriage throughout your life. We discuss the particular reasons men can get stuck in the first half of life, and how men are more free to tend to the needs of their souls these days, but can still feel adrift. We end our conversation with how you can know if you're on the right track in pursuing the tasks of the second half of life.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/secondhalf\">aom.is/secondhalf</a>.</p>\n",
