  "description": "<p>A diffusion auction is a market to sell commodities over a social network,\nwhere the challenge is to incentivize existing buyers to invite their neighbors\nin the network to join the market. Existing mechanisms have been designed to\nsolve the challenge in various settings, aiming at desirable properties such as\nnon-deficiency, incentive compatibility and social welfare maximization. Since\nthe mechanisms are employed in dynamic networks with ever-changing structures,\nbuyers could easily generate fake nodes in the network to manipulate the\nmechanisms for their own benefits, which is commonly known as the Sybil attack.\nWe observe that strategic agents may gain an unfair advantage in existing\nmechanisms through such attacks. To resist this potential attack, we propose\ntwo diffusion auction mechanisms, the Sybil tax mechanism (STM) and the Sybil\ncluster mechanism (SCM), to achieve both Sybil-proofness and incentive\ncompatibility in the single-item setting. Our proposal provides the first\nmechanisms to protect the interests of buyers against Sybil attacks with a mild\nsacrifice of social welfare and revenue.\n</p>",
