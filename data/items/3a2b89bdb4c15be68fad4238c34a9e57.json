Both strange, one still gives me chills. I’ll let the clock decide on e order of things. Oldest first…DOG MAN? This hole Dogman thing realy set me back when I found the stories online. I have a nack, so to speek, for unusual experiences. Ghost, poltergeist, hauntings, etc. So my encounter, or sighting, of Dogman I always chalked up to a poltergeist I was living with at the time. Heart pounding stuff, if you like I’ll write you about that too. Anyway, it’s fall 1984 and I’m Laying in bed reading a book. I’m 14 years old. Book was “Christine”. Its late, past midnight, my folks are out cold. So much paranormal activity had happened in my bedroom, it became a test of wills. Well the damn ghost won, but I did find a loophole...\"</p> <p>We also welcome Jeff to the show who will be sharing encounters from his grandfather's diaries.</p>",
