started her career as a Non-Commissioned Member  in 25 Medical Company which has since grown to become <a title=\"25 Fd Amb\" href=\"http://25fdamb.ca/25fdamb/25%20(Toronto)%20Field%20Ambulance%20MAIN.html\" target=\"_blank\">25 Field Ambulance</a>.  Shannon developed as a junior leader as Medic, then became a Warrant Officer.  A decision point was reached when Shannon had to choose between developing as a Medic Warrant Officer or continue to parallel her civilian qualifications as an Emergency Nurse with the
