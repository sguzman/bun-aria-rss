  "description": "<p>August 25th, 2008. Springfield, Georgia. A 911 operator had difficulty understanding a woman who called for help. After a number of minutes, police and emergency personnel are dispatched to the home of the respected Heidt family. The details were disturbing. Someone had entered the home while Philip, Linda, and their adult son, Carey, would be asleep. Linda was actually awake, though, and was disturbed by the sound of a shotgun. Her son, her husband, as well as herself were all shot. Only Linda survived the attack. Detectives found only a few clues but they would lead them to their prime suspect. But an arrest wasn't made right away. They wanted to wait and see if Linda, who was recovering from a shotgun blast to her face and neck, would be able to identify the one who had done this to her and her family. Join us as we discuss a disturbing crime that was difficult for most of the family members to come to terms with.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
