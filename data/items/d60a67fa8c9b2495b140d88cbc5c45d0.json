  "description": "We discuss  the final layer that brings everything together. You can help kids to keep things neat by accommodating some styles to their interests, and giving them their own shelf to display their own stuff. Make a distinction between their toys and “your toys.” This can give them pride in their own stuff. Give them a delicate collection of their own delicate toys with which they have to be gentle and learn to take care of. Art books and design books are what you want to display. The average household should have about 20 cocktail table books to display. Try and get non directional items for the center of your console, such as a bowl. A bust, of family members or yourself, is a great thing to have on display, as well as vases. Candles should be large and never leave your wicks white. Candles should be in a place you can tend to it. A diffuser should be somewhere your guests will smell it, such as an entry. Avoid a round rug in general. Boxes can be used to fill space which large accessories cannot. Coral helps a lot as an accessory. It’s white, so it goes well with most things. Try to group your different coral together. You want to style for your vantage point. Hide things such as your printer down low instead of at eye level where you’re going to see it often. You can do a couple different stacks of books and stacking vertically is good in order to be able to read the title. End table needs a lamp, more books, and maybe a sculpture or bowl. Bowls are great because you can fill it with pistachios, or candy. A tray is almost always necessary. Then you can stylize everything with the tray and don’t have to worry about the rest of the coffee table. Coasters go well with the tray.<br /><br />How to go about styling and accessorizing with kids 2:25 <br />The Delicate Collection 9:32 <br />Books 11:55<br />Candles 20:20<br />Greenery 26:07<br />Steve Cordony @stevecordony 33:04<br />Nightstand and end table 44:12<br /><br />“So you’re going to want to use more non-directional things on a non-directional surface, so a circle is non-directional. The center hall table you’re going to be coming at it from all different directions because it’s the center of your household, or at least the center of your entry. So grounding it with a really large vase or ginger jar is probably our best go-to thing that I would say, and then filling that with whatever is in season.” 40:16<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a>",
