  "description": "<p>The magnetar SGR 1935+2154 is reported to have an anti-glitch, accompanied by\nfast radio bursts, and transient pulsed radio emission. In the wind braking\nmodel, this triplet event tell people that (1) SGR 1935+2154 does not have a\nstrong particle wind and can be approximated by magnetic dipole braking in the\npersistent state; (2) Its anti-glitch is due to an enhanced particle wind,\nsimilar to the first anti-glitch in magnetars; (3) Its transient pulsed radio\nemission may due to enlarged and decreasing emission beam during the outburst.\nThe enhanced particle acceleration potential and pulsar death line may not be\nthe dominate factor.\n</p>",
