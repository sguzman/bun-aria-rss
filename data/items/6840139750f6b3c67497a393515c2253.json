  "description": "This Cyber Monday, consider shopping at one of the small businesses profiled on Late Show’s #ColbertSmallBizBump, like Redmon’s Popcorn run by Zack Redmon in New Hope, Minnesota. How good is Zack’s luxury popcorn? Just ask Redmon’s official commercial spokesperson, Nick Offerman. And while 146 new Christmas movies were released this year, 2021 was set to give us zero Hanukkah movies until The Late Show stepped in with a slate of brand new holiday classics with titles like, “Home for the Challah-days,” “Casino Dreidel,” and “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Rabbi.” In part two of his conversation with Stephen, Director Peter Jackson examines the mindset of The Beatles as they prepared for a rooftop concert profiled in the new Disney+ documentary, “The Beatles: Get Back,” and sheds light on why the band suppressed the footage for decades. Jackson also mentions a chat between George Harrison and John Lennon that might have changed the direction of the band had they ever shared the details with Paul.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
