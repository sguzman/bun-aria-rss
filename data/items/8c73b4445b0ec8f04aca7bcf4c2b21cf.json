  "description": "<p>This study significantly concentrates on cryogenic InP HEMT high-frequency\ncircuit analysis using quantum theory to find how the transistor nonlinearity\ncan affect the quantum correlation of the modes generated in the circuit.\nFirstly, the total Hamiltonian of the circuit is derived, and the dynamic\nequation of the motion contributed is examined using the Heisenberg-Langevin\nequation. Using the nonlinear Hamiltonian, some components are attached to the\nintrinsic internal circuit of InP HEMT to fully address the circuit\ncharacteristics. The components attached are arisen due to the nonlinearity\neffects. As a result, the theoretical calculations show that the states\ngenerated in the circuit are mixed, and no pure state is produced. Accordingly,\nthe modified circuit generates the two-mode squeezed thermal state, which means\none can focus on calculating the Gaussian quantum discord to evaluate quantum\ncorrelation. It is also found that the nonlinearity factors (addressed as the\nnonlinear components in the circuit) can intensely influence the squeezed\nthermal state by which the quantum discord is changed. Finally, as the primary\npoint, it is concluded that although it is possible to enhance the quantum\ncorrelation between modes by engineering the nonlinear components; however,\nquantum discord greater than unity, entangled microwave photons, seems a\nchallenging task since InP HEMT operates at 4.2 K.\n</p>",
