  "description": "Is the president playing three-dimensional chess with the world by constantly offering different policies with different tone and apparently different objectives from the rest of his team including his most senior cabinet members?  Are we all too limited to understand the giant intellect of this man who sees the universe with a sort of depth and clarity reserved for the Stephen Hawkings and Albert Einsteins of this world?  Or is he just nuts?  Or is he perhaps nuts and stupid?  Or could it be that he is nuts and stupid and incompetent and surrounded by a bunch of insipid enablers?  Our great panel including Politico's Susan Glasser, the German Marshall Fund's Laura Rosenberger, Stanford's Kori Schake and Georgetown's Rosa Brooks (and our host, David Rothkopf, columnist for the Washington Post) discuss, debate and shed light into very dark places.
