    "media:description": "Special Thanks to Uncomfortable Oxford which is a student lead organization at Oxford providing historical tours in the city. Some of their tours focus on the ‘uncomfortable’ imperial legacy of the University of Oxford (hence the name). They were kind enough to provide me two tours, free of charge, in order that I could learn more about this topic for this video. I highly recommend booking a tour on their website if you’re interested- https://www.uncomfortableoxford.co.uk/\n\nSources for all my videos are in the bibliography of my scripts available for free to download on my Patreon- https://www.patreon.com/mlaser?filters[tag]=script\n\nMy Patreon- https://www.patreon.com/mlaser\n\nIf you want to directly donate money you can do so here on YouTube or on Ko-Fi- https://ko-fi.com/mlaserhistory\n\nMy Twitter- https://twitter.com/MnLaser\n\nMy second channel M.
