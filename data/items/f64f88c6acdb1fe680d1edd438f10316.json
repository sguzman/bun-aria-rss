  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, President Trump is the most investigated man in American history by every level of government and every news operation, and yet they have nothing on him. The constant assault on Trump and the absolute disrespect for the office of the President is unwarranted. It’s a clear effort to destroy him and anyone associated with him, and it’s an attack on the American people who voted for him. The media isn’t the enemy of the people but some reporters are when they distort the news. They don’t believe in freedom of the press; they believe in propaganda of the press. Also, the FISA court needs to be abolished and replaced because it has failed miserably. FISA judges are supposed to be more than a rubber stamp, but that’s exactly what they were in issuing warrants to spy on Trump. It was a plan concocted by the Hillary Clinton campaign which led to the Steele dossier, which was then used to acquire the warrants. What the FISA court has done is an absolute scandal. Finally, Mark reflects on his interview with Mike Huckabee on Life, Liberty, and Levin.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
