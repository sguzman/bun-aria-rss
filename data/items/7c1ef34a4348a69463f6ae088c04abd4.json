  "description": "Contributor(s): Dr Tom Reader | In the post-COVID world, companies (and indeed societies) will need to develop a culture that allows them to maximise productivity whilst retaining safety. How might the principles developed for managing safety in high-risk industries help organisations successfully balance these twin aims?\nOrganisations in high-risk domains, like aviation, energy and healthcare, have been managing risks around productivity and safety for many years. It is a tricky balance to reach: they must prioritise safety in order to not jeopardise operations, yet to remain solvent and successful they must also focus on productivity, and thus manage risk.\n \nMeet our speaker\nTom Reader is an Associate Professor of Organisational Psychology in the Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science (@LSE_PBS) at LSE. He directs the MSc in Organisational and Social Psychology, leads an MSc and Executive course on Organisational Culture, and is a chartered psychologist.\nThis film is part of the 'Festival Shorts' series, 10-minute talks by LSE experts released during Festival week.",
