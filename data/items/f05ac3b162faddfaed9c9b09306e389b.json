  "description": "<p>It's Ep. 4 of <em>The Pleasure Is Ours—</em>the<em> This Is Important-</em>hosted<em> </em>BONUS<em> </em>podcast all about blowing up stupid pieces of advice!</p><p>IN THIS EPISODE: They say you should never judge a book by its cover—the same way you can't tell the size of a dude's junk just by the amount of big dick energy he gives off. With that said, sometimes the dude with the sketchy face tattoo is just that: straight-up sketch. And as Blake once learned: The Great Gatsby is, indeed, as boring as it looks. </p><p>In this week's Ders-less episode of The Pleasure Is Ours (our fourth co-host is big-timing us shooting a movie with Bobby DeNiro), the boys argue over the role that judgment plays in an overly saturated cultural landscape. On the one hand, it's efficient! After all, who has the time to consume everything out there? It's easier to assume that Ders' affection for American Psycho automatically makes him a serial killer. But on the other hand, you may never discover just how wild Velma from Scooby Doo can get once she takes her glasses off...</p><p>So quick!
