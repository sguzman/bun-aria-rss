  "description": "<p><strong>This week on Drunken Philosophy, Connor and Dan dive head first into some phenomenological philosophy and see how many times they can trip over that particular phrase. They're specifically discussing Matthew Ratcliffe's recent lecture entitled Phenomenology, Naturalism, and Sense of Reality in which he attempts to describe the presupposed \"world\" that surrounds us in phenomenological terms. It's a trip, man. Which is why it's a perfect episode for Connor to quit drinking and imbibe some THC. Also discussed: Silly Puddy, Aliens movies, and philosophers with a side of beef!</strong></p>",
