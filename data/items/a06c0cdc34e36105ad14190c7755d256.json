  "description": "<p>My first exposure to Anne Lamott’s work was her iconic book, <em>Bird By Bird</em>, which as a writer, was transformative. Not just because it helped me better understand how and why to write, but also because her wonderfully wise and irreverent voice inspired me to be more real, more honest in both my work and my life. I’ve remained captivated by her writing ever since.
