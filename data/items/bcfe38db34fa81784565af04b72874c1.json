  "description": "Coronavirus has a new name: Covid-19. It has infected over 50,000 people and taken over 1,000 lives. But the crisis may be just beginning. And the response of governments from China to the United States may be only be making its potential toll worse. We speak with Pulitzer Prize winning science writer, Laurie Garrett, one of the world's preeminent experts on global public health issues about just how bad the situation is and about some of the most egregious missteps of our leaders to date. We also discuss the fact that as of right now there are multiple serious epidemics occurring simultaneously placing the global health system under unprecedented stress--a situation we could have prepared for but did not. Essential listening.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
