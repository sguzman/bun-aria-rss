  "description": "There are countries and systems that are managing the COVID-19 crisis comparatively well. South Korea, which invested heavily and early in testing is one. Singapore, in the view of renowned infectious disease expert and Pulitzer Prize-winner Laurie Garrett, may be an even better one. Their testing is almost ubiquitous and trust in the government's handling of the crisis is rock solid. Garrett, Just Security's Ryan Goodman and host David Rothkopf discuss what we can learn from these success and compare them to the still disastrous situation in the U.S. (and the lunatic approach embraced by the government of the U.K.).
