  "description": "<p><strong>Adopted and raised by a loving family, you were still curious enough to seek out your biological parents and learn their story when you reached adulthood.</strong> It turns out you were the result of a forbidden tryst between a traveling American woman and the married Australian man who briefly employed her on his farm. When you reached out, your biological mother was happy to make contact, but your biological father? Not so much. In fact, he's been \"happily\" married for 50 years and refuses to admit he had any part in your existence -- probably because he'd then have to confess everything to his family. Now you're conflicted. Should you just let it go, or should you fly to Australia and surprise him at his front door where he can't continue denying that you're real? We'll try to find an answer to this and more here on Feedback Friday!</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Gabriel Mizrahi</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GabeMizrahi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@GabeMizrahi</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
