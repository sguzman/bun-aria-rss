  "description": "On Monday, Alex Murdaugh’s attorneys Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin filed a federal lawsuit in an attempt to block Richland County from releasing more jailhouse calls through the Freedom of Information Act.\nIn today’s episode, we tell you exactly why this case isn’t a typical true crime story and why Alex isn’t your typical (alleged) criminal. In this case, we’re dealing with a former public official and a whole lot of alleged public corruption.  \nAs we peel back the layers of history in the Murdaugh family, We see that Alex and Paul Murdaugh’s misdeeds didn’t happen in a vacuum. \nFor decades, it appears like people have been looking the other way as the Murdaugh family’s unchecked power spun out of control. \n\nSee more videos on the Murdaugh Murders here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPC7aLBzSFHqIz_jDachzQA\n\nAnd a special thank you to our sponsors: Cerebral, Hunt-A-Killer, Bannon Law Group, Nature's Highway CBD, Embark Vet, VOURI, Hello Fresh and others.\n\nThe Murdaugh Murders Podcast is created by Mandy Matney and produced by Luna Shark Productions.
