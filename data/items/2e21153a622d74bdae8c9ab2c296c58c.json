In this conversation from January 2022, I spoke with Lilianne Milgrom, a Paris-born, internationally acclaimed artist and award-winning author. She holds two degrees from Melbourne University and an associate degree from the Academy of Art in San Francisco. She exhibits her artwork around the world and is the recipient of multiple awards and residencies. In 2011, she became the first authorized copyist of Gustave Courbet’s controversial painting L’Origine du Monde (The Origin of the World) which hangs in the Orsay Museum in Paris. Milgrom spent a decade researching and writing L’Origine, her debut novel, all about Courbet’s incredible painting—as well as Milgrom’s own personal experience of copying the work. L’Origine has snagged no less than six literary honors, including the Publishers Weekly 2021 US book award for Best Adult Fiction.\nPlease SUBSCRIBE and REVIEW our show on Apple Podcasts and FOLLOW on Spotify\nTwitter / Instagram / Facebook / Fireside\nDon’t forget to show your support for our show by purchasing ArtCurious swag from TeePublic!\n\nBuy L'Origine Here!\n\nSPONSORS:\nBombas: get 20% off your first order with our link\nIndeed: Listeners get a free $75 credit to upgrade your job post\nAcorn.TV: Use promo code “artcurious”--all lowercase--to try Acorn free for 30 days\nSundance Now: Try Sundance Now free for 30 days with promo code ARTCURIOUS.\n\nWant to advertise/sponsor our show?\nWe have partnered with AdvertiseCast to handle our advertising/sponsorship requests.
