  "description": "<p>Matt and Bow: A Tale of Two Coasts! The boys connect while socially distancing due to Covid-19 and discuss this new (but temporary!) normal, as well as the habits they've developed in isolation. They touch base on the culture that's gone down over the past month including the <em>Real Housewives of New York</em> premiere (as well as the LEAH of it all), Dua Lipa's new album <em>Future Nostalgia</em> and Gaga's <em>Chromatica</em> delay. Both the boys reveal their new TV binge obsessions while in quar (<em>Survivor</em> for Matt, <em>The Leftovers</em> for Bowen) and also talk all things Quibi! Matt's new show <em>Gayme Show!</em> is out now on that platform, and you can check it out now. And...against all odds...the boys literally almost forget to talk about <em>Tiger King</em>, but not to fear, they touch on it! So if you were hungry for more Carole Baskin takes? We got you, bitch. Stay safe and stay inside and...give the pod a 5 star review. See?
