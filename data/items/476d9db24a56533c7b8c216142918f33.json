Rudy Gomis told us “Bul Ma Miin” is a sort of advice about not just getting used to someone and forgetting who they are or take their presence simply for granted. The lyrics state that “showing affection doesn’t equate with being weak.”</p> <p>“You know, when you’re together for a long time, it can come to an end when you forget the other person,” Rudy said. “Like couples where they run into these huge problems because they just forget the other person.”</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
