  "description": "I love when I get a note about a quilt project that is unique. Julie Brown Neu collaborated with her sister Karen H. Brown on a children’s book. Julie did the illustrations which are quilts! I love collaborations and the story behind them. Julie is also a talented quilt maker that brings her love of detail into her other work. We’ll hear how the book came about and she has some great tips for us on using Y Seams.\nhttp://julieneu.com/\n------------\nWe are so lucky in the quilting world when great designers do quilting fabric collections. Robin Pickens is a Moda designer, and you will find her art of many different products. I had so much fun chatting with her at the show and today she is going to give us a look at how she works with designs and colors.\nhttp://www.robinpickens.com\n----------------\nI’m delighted that Linda Thielfoldt is my quilt expert joining me every month in 2017. She is an award winning quilter, a teacher, designer, author and she quilts for hire too. With Linda’s deep technical knowledge of the quilt making process we are picking a topic each month and digging deep on it. This month we’ll give you all the tips and tricks for getting your quilt ready to quilt.\nhttp://www.thequiltedgoose.com/\n-------------\nMy Q&A today is about your workspace and things you need in it.
