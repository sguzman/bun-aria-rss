  "description": "Welcome to another of Tin Foil Hat with Sam Tripoli.  This episode Sam and Ryan welcome the Great, the Wonderful, the Woke Abby Martin to the World Famous Comedy Store to record one seriously kick ass conversation.  We discuss RT News, Julian Assange, the Mainstream Media, Yemen, Syria and we get Abby's take on some classic conspiracy theories.  We can't thank Abby enough for spending some time with us and for dropping some amazing truth bombs for all of us to enjoy. Also the Comedy Store is haunted and word is you can see a floating orb above Abby Martin's head during this podcast. Thank you for you support!",
