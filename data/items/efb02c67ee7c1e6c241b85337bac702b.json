  "description": "<p>About 1.5 miles off the shores of San Francisco, California lies a rocky island with the infamous name \"Alcatraz.\" Some of the most notorious criminals in American history were sent to a prison built on the island that bears the same name because of the impossibility of escape. But long before the likes of Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly and Robert \"Birdman\" Stroud came to the island affectionately nicknamed \"The Rock,\" the island housed a light house and a military prison. Many desperate souls wiled away their lives on Alcatraz Island and many of those souls seemed to have stayed. Those souls include not only prisoners, but banished Native Americans. Some claim a portal exists on the island. Come with us across the cold waters of the San Francisco Bay as we explore the history and hauntings of Alcatraz. The Moment in Oddity features Dancing Mania and This Day in History features the St. Hilaire Train Disaster.</p>",
