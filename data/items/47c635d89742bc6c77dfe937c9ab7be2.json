  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrat Party has sided with David Duke as far as the Jewish community is involved. Speaker Pelosi was weak in defending the anti-Semitism displayed by Rep Ilhan Omar and allows bigotry to continue to take root in the Democrat Party. The Democrat Party and the media allow hate speech with no condemnation and defend fundamentalist front groups like the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). Rep. Steve King was excoriated for his comments and removed from committee assignments in Congress, yet Omar remains on the Foreign Relations Committee and goes unnamed in resolutions condemning her anti-Semitic rhetoric. The media is focused on destroying Fox News for their dissenting reports because they don’t go along with commentators that support the president, while they spend all their time trying to take President Trump down. Then, the Republicans need to step up; Sen. Mitch McConnell needs to whip the votes and support the president on the National Emergencies Act instead of adding to the problem like Sen. Rand Paul. Where are Senators Tillis, Murkowski, and Collins? Afterwards, maybe the socialist sympathizers in America should live under it and experience it firsthand. No cars, planes, private healthcare, just public health facilities, bicycles, and vegetables free of all fossil fuels. Later, Mort Klein, the President of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), calls in to give his take on Ilhan Omar's anti-Semitic comments.. Finally, Victor Davis Hanson calls in and discusses hiw new book, the Case for Trump.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
