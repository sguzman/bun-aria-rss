  "description": "The most charitable man in the industry joins us today! Scott Fish is here to talk about his Fantasy charity, the Scott Fish Bowl and a 0.5 PPR mock draft. Oh, and he weighs in on Cam Newton (6:55) as Heath also tells us where he has Cam in his rankings ... We discuss the most interesting picks of a 0.5 PPR mock draft we completed recently. Josh Jacobs and Derrick Henry were the 7th and 8th picks, respectively (16:00). Is that justified given their lack of catches? James Conner went 33rd (23:15) and Keenan Allen was the 24th WR selected (26:35). Find out who went ahead of Allen. Finally, Mark Ingram fell to the 6th round (28:50). What gives!? The guys don't seem to think it's unreasonable ... We review Scott's team (40:00) including whether or not he made a mistake with his RB depth. Then Scott discusses the Scott Fish Bowl (51:00) and what you need to know about the scoring system ...
