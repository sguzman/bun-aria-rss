  "description": "In one story, a dragon is rampaging around the countryside unless he gets his favorite meal: teenage girls. In the other, a young woman trapped in an impossible situation meets a new friend who might just be able to save her: a parrot with a secret. Two stories with two very different heroines who share one defining characteristic: their unbreakable will to survive. On the creature of the week, when it comes to making a deal with the devil, you could choose infinite wealth, power, or epic guitar skills...or you could do what the strix did and become a stinky owl monster.
