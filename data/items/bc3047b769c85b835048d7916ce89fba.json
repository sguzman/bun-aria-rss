  "description": "<p>Released April 9th, Taylor’s re-record of her breakthrough 2008 album was easily the most anticipated album of 2021 for legions if Swifties! We’re dissecting everything on the album from lyrics, to new songs, and more! We’ve got resident Swiftie Kate Racker Ackerman who puts us all to shame with her extensive Taylor knowledge. From Taylor teasing the release (she capitalized random letters in the text that when strung together spelled out “APRIL 9” and 4+9=13, her lucky number) to the date she announced it (February 11 and 2+11=13). And who could ignore the fact that 2021 marks 13 years since the original Fearless was released…this is an episode you’re not going to want to miss.</p>",
