  "description": "What a weekend… I give my thoughts on the big game, which included a few frustrating play calls. [0:30] Speaking of frustrating… I need to rant about the impending conflict between Russia and Ukraine. I’ve done a ton of homework on the tensions between these two countries. A lot of folks won’t like what I have to say. Brace yourself for the truth about who’s right in this conflict… and why the U.S. has no business being involved. [4:55] I break down why Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the world… What history tells us about the issues between the two nations… And the ridiculous politics involved. [7:40] Plus, I highlight which country is the real threat to the U.S. even though most folks are afraid to admit it. [12:00] I explain why Ukraine (potentially) joining NATO is such a huge deal… and why it will probably never happen. [15:50] Finally, how worried should investors be about the Ukraine situation? It’s triggering a lot of volatility in the market… but you can use it to your advantage. [19:45] And speaking of the choppy market, we’re running a special promotion for —which focuses on profiting from volatility. I break down Genia Turanova’s strategy… and highlight a recent trade that generated a 165% gain in less than a month. [23:35] Enjoyed this episode?
