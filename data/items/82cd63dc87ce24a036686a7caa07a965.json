  "description": "<p>The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, a key mission in multiwavelength and\nmultimessenger studies, has been surveying the gamma-ray sky from its low-Earth\norbit since 2008. Its two scientific instruments, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor\n(GBM) and the Large Area Telescope (LAT), cover 8 orders of magnitude in photon\nenergy. The GBM consists of 12 Sodium Iodide detectors and 2 Bismuth Germinate\ndetectors, covering the 10 keV - 40 MeV energy range, arrayed on two sides of\nthe spacecraft so as to view the entire sky that is not occulted by the Earth.\nThe LAT is a pair production telescope based on silicon strip trackers, a\nCesium Iodide calorimeter, and a plastic scintillator anticoincidence system.\nIt covers the energy range from about 20 MeV to more than 500 GeV, with a field\nof view of about 2.4 steradians. Thanks to their huge fields of view, the\ninstruments can observe the entire sky with a cadence of about an hour for GBM\nand about three hours for LAT. All gamma-ray data from Fermi become public\nimmediately, enabling a broad range of multiwavelength and multimessenger\nresearch. Over 3000 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), including GRB 170817A associated\nwith a neutron star merger detected in gravitational waves, and 5000\nhigh-energy sources, including the blazar TXS 0506+056 associated with\nhigh-energy neutrinos, have been detected by the Fermi instruments. The Fermi\nScience Support Center provides a wide array of resources to enable scientific\nuse of the data, including background models, source catalogs, analysis\nsoftware, documentation, and a Help Desk.\n</p>",
