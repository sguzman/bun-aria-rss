  "description": "<p>We present a systematic study of fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC) with\nboth small-scale and large-scale numerical simulations in spherical symmetry.\nWe find that FFCs can, in general, reach in a quasi-steady state, and these\nfeatures in the non-linear phase are not characterized by the growth rate of\nFFC instability but rather angular structures of electron neutrino lepton\nnumber (ELN) and heavy one (XLN). Our result suggests that neutrinos can almost\nreach a flavor equipartition even in cases with low growth rate of instability\n(e.g., shallow ELN crossing) and narrow angular regions (in momentum space)\nwhere flavor conversions occur vigorously. This exhibits that ELN and XLN\nangular distributions can not provide a sufficient information to determine\ntotal amount of flavor conversion in neutrinos and antineutrinos of all\nflavors. Based on the results of our numerical simulations, we provide a new\napproximate scheme of FFC that is designed so that one can easily incorporate\neffects of FFCs in existing classical neutrino transport codes for the study of\ncore-collapse supernova (CCSN) and binary neutron star merger (BNSM). The\nscheme has an ability to capture key features of quasi-steady state of FFCs\nwithout solving quantum kinetic neutrino transport, which will serve to\nfacilitate access to FFCs for CCSN and BNSM theorists.\n</p>",
