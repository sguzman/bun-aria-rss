Also, a crazed leftist tries to kill Brett Kavanaugh, but you’d never know it if you rely on corporate media for your news. Plus, Joe Biden disintegrates on live TV while talking to Jimmy Kimmel. Joy Behar claims that black people don’t have guns. We’ll fact check that claim. And a DisneyLand employee is feeling the heat for intervening in a marriage proposal. In our Daily Cancellation, a popular YouTuber debunks my film What Is A Woman. Or so I’m told.
