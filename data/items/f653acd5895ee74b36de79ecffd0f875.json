  "description": "<p>EPISODE 32 - DICK POPE - Cinematographer</p> <p>Team Deakins has an entertaining conversation with cinematographer and long time friend, Dick Pope (Mr. TURNER, SECRETS & LIES, ANOTHER YEAR, THE ILLUSIONIST). We talk about his start in film, his work in documentaries and his long term collaboration with director Mike Leigh. Along the way, we also touch on the importance of trust between DP & Director, working with keys that you don’t know and in particular how he works with gaffers. We touch a bit on operating and even end up with a bit on film vs digital, although we weren’t planning on going there! It’s a fascinating episode and we promise you will laugh during parts!</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: Any Mike Leigh film</p>",
