The very definition of a high performing elite athlete with a slew of world-records and Olympic gold medals to prove it.</p><p>But Aaron is not his career.&nbsp;Aaron Peirsol is different.</p><p>Let's set the stage. Aaron burst onto the international swimming scene at the age of 17, walking away from the 2000 Sydney Olympics with a silver medal in the 200m backstroke.&nbsp;At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Aaron won gold in both the 100m and 200m backstroke (that one by an incredible 2.5 secs) and a third gold leading off the 4×100 medley relay.&nbsp;At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, Aaron took gold in the 100m backstroke and the 4×100 medley relay, taking silver in the 200m back behind teammate Ryan Lochte.</p><p>The following year,&nbsp;Aaron raised the bar one last time with a stunning 1:51.93 world record setting performance in the 200m backstroke at the World Championships in Rome — a world record that to this day still stands – an astonishing 6 years later.</p><br><p>7 Olympic medals. 5 gold, 2 silver. 10 long-course World Championships.</p><p>Aaron is of course incredibly proud of his accomplishments.&nbsp;But victories, defeats, podiums and bling fail to tell the story of Aaron Peirsol. They are not&nbsp;who he is.</p><p>Over the course of his career, I vividly recall watching Aaron on television — one triumph after another. But far more interesting than his performances was how he acquitted himself outside the pool. There is just something completely unique about this guy. He is unlike any other high performing athlete I know.</p><p>More contemplative. Consistently thoughtful. A bit soft spoken. And always laid back.</p><p>More soul surfer than Type-A competitor.</p><p>How does a guy so chill thrive in such a pressure cooker universe? Not just through 1 Olympiad but 3?</p><p>Today I get answers. Today we enter the&nbsp;world of elite competitive swimming. A consideration of his career and the elements required to not just win, but keep winning. But most of the conversation centers around character — what makes Aaron tick.</p><p>His perspective might surprise you. Because for Aaron, it’s not about competition – it never was.</p><p>For him, it’s about a lifelong love affair with water.</p><p>For him, it’s always been a spiritual journey.</p><p>Specifics covered today include:</p><br><p>* the world of elite competitive swimming</p><p>* the importance of coaching & mentorship</p><p>* Aaron's preparation for the 2004 Olympics</p><p>* acceptance & surrender in the wake of his Olympic DQ</p><p>* Aaron's love affair with water</p><p>* Aaron's spiritual vs. competitive nature</p><p>* career sustainability & passion</p><p>* the fallacy of ‘use it or lose it'</p><p>* the perils of overtraining</p><p>* characteristics of fellow Olympians</p><p>* retirement motivations</p><p>* environmental interests</p><p>* what it means to own your journey</p><br><p>What is the core motivation behind your passion?</p><p>I'd love to hear all about it in the comments section below.</p><p>Aaron is a special guy.
