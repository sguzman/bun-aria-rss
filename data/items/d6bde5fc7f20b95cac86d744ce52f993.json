  "description": "Move are afoot--everywhere.  In the Koreas, North and South are posturing pre-negotiations while back in the U.S. the president is writing his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.  In the Middle East, Israel is working with the U.S. (and maybe the Saudis) to try to find a way to torpedo the Iran nuclear deal...and the Europeans are pushing hard in the other direction.  Somewhere between the two U.S. policy masterminds (one with a bushy mustache) are trying to figure out how to blow up one nuclear deal while striking another (so the president can start packing or his trip to Oslo to pick up his hardware).  Who is guiding these processes?  Could it be Sarah Huckabee Sanders through her mascara laden tears?  We discuss on this episode of Deep State Radio with David Sanger of the New York Times, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Kori Schake of IISS and host, David Rothkopf, lost in New Jersey.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
