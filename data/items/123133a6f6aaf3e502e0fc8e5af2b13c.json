  "description": "<p>Tonight we will be chatting with Nick who is currently serving in the United States military. He is going to share with us his experience while training at Fort Polk.</p> <p>Nick said “It was a strange night and I wasn’t the only person to experience this thing, whatever it is. I have also seen the lights on Fort Polk. There is a term that is used among solders and we call it the box witch.” The term has nothing to do with a witch but Nick will explain why they call it that.</p> <p>Nick said I’ve started a side project of collecting Soldiers stories, specifically what they’ve experienced with “not normal.” It’s on Instagram @Tales_From_The_Gridsquare.”</p> <p><strong> </strong></p>",
