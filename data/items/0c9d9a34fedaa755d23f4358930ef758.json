  "description": "<p>On today's new episode, Jonah and Vanessa welcome fellow Ohio native and host of Spotify's \"60 Songs That Explain the 90s\" Rob Harvilla to the podcast. They revisit their senior projects, which included organizing record bins, helping the community, and surfing the Internet. Jonah and Rob reminisce about their time working together at Alternative Press, including towers of promo CDs and their reviews of up-and-coming bands. Don't worry, they were nice and honest! Vanessa showcases her amazing Fred Durst impression as they navigate which song Limp Bizkit was known for performing. They discuss tablature music and their grunge band rankings, which leads to a discussion about their parents' collection of records from all genres of music. True Colors, Prince, Bob Dylan, Diana Ross and much much more. All this talk really gets the Bayers thinking about getting a record player. Sponsors, are your ears open?! We end the pod with a round of \"Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan?\" where they review the Plain Dealer for complaints among the Greater Cleveland area including cable networks going to hell, unrealistic expectations of punctuality, and school deficit politics. You will not want to miss this music-filled episode! </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
