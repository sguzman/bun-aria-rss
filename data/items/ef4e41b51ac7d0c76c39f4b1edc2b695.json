  "description": "<p>Scot and Jeff discuss The Clash with CJ Ciaramella, a criminal justice reporter for <em>Reason</em> Magazine.</p>\n<p><span><strong>Introducing the Band</strong></span>:<strong><br />\n</strong>Your hosts Scot Bertram (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScotBertram\">@ScotBertram</a>) and Jeff Blehar (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EsotericCD\">@EsotericCD</a>) with guest CJ Ciaramella. He is a criminal justice reporter for <em>Reason</em> Magazine. CJ is on Twitter at @cjciaramella and you can read his work at <u><a href=\"https://reason.com/\">reason.com</a></u>.</p>\n<p><span><strong>CJ’s Music Pick: The Clash</strong></span>:</p>\n<p>The gang wraps up its second year of Political Beats with a discussion of The Only Band That Matters! From rock to pop to reggae to ethno-fusion to, well, “Fingerpoppin’,” The Clash belie their reputation as one of the greatest punk acts of all time with the startling diversity of their music. And what a weird career arc it is, encompassing not only one of the most important punk rock records of all time (their self-titled debut), one of the greatest double albums in any genre of modern music full-stop (the glorious <em>London Calling</em>), and one of the <em><u>worst</u></em> TRIPLE albums in history (the fascinatingly failed <em>Sandinista!</em>).  Scot, Jeff, and C.J. love much of this music passionately and are deeply confused and dismayed by some of it as well (please, dear reader: never listen to <em>Cut The Crap</em>) but celebrate all of it anyway.</p>\n<p>Happy Holidays to all of our listeners, and we’ll see you again in January!</p>\n",
