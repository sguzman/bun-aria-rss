  "description": "<p>“Making connections with people has often been quite difficult for me, you know, this can be really isolating, but it's so incredible to make this book that so many people are interested in reading and enjoying, and they look at it, and they're like, <em>Oh, this feels really relatable</em>.” More than 5.4 million people follow Rachel Smythe’s <em>Lore Olympus</em> on Webtoons, and now she’s adapted the first 25 chapters of her retelling of the myth of Persephone into a fabulous book. Rachel joins us on the show to talk about the inspiration behind her relatable story and unforgettable art; her favorite books and writers, including <em>The Odyssey</em> translated by Emily Wilson, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett; color theory and the joys of brainstorming, and more. (She even shares a little advice for comics creators at the start of their career.) Produces/hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>",
