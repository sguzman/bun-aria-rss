Chris and Matt prepare to do battle, or simply just survive a triumvirate of monster movies.&nbsp; The first beast unleashed is ‘Psycho Goreman’, a film that has the bacony stink of Canada all over it as a ruthless alien bad ass comes under the thrall of an entirely too bossy tween girl.&nbsp; Then power couple Milla Jovovich and Paul WS Anderson returns with another video game adaptation, ‘Monster Hunter’.&nbsp; This time Milla and her military unit get transported to another world filled with monsters and martial arts star Tony Jaa and surfer Ron Perlman.&nbsp; Our last stop on our monster tour brings us to a post-apocalyptic Earth as we join a young man on a quest to see his true love, and all the wacky hijinks and terrifying creatures he experiences on the way in ‘Love And Monsters’. There’s the absolutely gorgeous rundown of the big releases on Physical Media, featuring the Straight to DVD and Streaming Picks of the Week.
