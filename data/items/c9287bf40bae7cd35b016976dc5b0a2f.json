  "description": "It's hard to imagine a band doing more with limited time than the Welsh-raised, London-based pop-rock trio The Joy Formidable. The group had to cut its set at NPR Music's daytime SXSW party in Austin, Texas, down to a lean four songs due to time constraints. But those spiky, bouncy songs absolutely slayed. Hear the band perform live at NPR Music's SXSW day party from The Parish in Austin, Texas, on March 17, 2011.",
