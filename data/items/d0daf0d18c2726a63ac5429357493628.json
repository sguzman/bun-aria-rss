He unpacks 200 years of American church history to show why so many evangelicals favored Trump over other conservative, Christian candidates. Plus, Phil, Christian, and Skye deconstruct Chris Pratt’s brilliant mini-sermon at the MTV Awards, and wonder why Christians in Nevada are supporting “America’s #1 Pimp” for the state legislature.
