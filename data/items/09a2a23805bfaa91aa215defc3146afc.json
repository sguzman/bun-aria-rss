  "description": "In this episode we enjoy the pleasure of speaking with Godless, co-host on the the Metal Sucks Podcast and writer at www.chuckandgodless.com.  Godless identifies as a agnostic atheist and after an explosive podcast episode with He and Mark Salomon in heated debate on the https://soundcloud.com/pastor-with-no-answers podcast, we discussed the interaction with Mark and thought it would be exciting to talk to Godless ourselves.  While we left many things unsaid, we look forward to going further on the issues and challenges discussed in this show.  Please, leave your thoughts and comments below!
