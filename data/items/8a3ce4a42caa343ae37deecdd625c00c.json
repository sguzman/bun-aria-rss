  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, Yes, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should be impeached. Congress, the most powerful branch of government, the branch with oversight power, has a constitutional duty to exercise that power over the other two branches when circumstances demand action. If Congress waited around for Trump to fire Rosenstein the Democrats and the media would demand that Trump be impeached for firing Rosenstein. Later, apparently Freedom of the press rests on the shoulders of CNN reporter Kaitlyn Collins. If she doesn’t get to ask her questions where and when she wants then it’s an assault on all reporters. The media is free to cover Trump, in fact they never stop covering him. The press was invited to the oval office but is not entitled to shout out questions in an attempt to gain popularity by appearing to be tough on the president. We have big issues that need concentrated reporting and are ignored. Yet the so-called media outlets are obsessed with Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
