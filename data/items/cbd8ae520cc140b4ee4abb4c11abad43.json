  "description": "<p>It’s not enough to just know about God— we must actually know him. One of the marks that you know God is spiritual growth: when the Holy Spirit comes into your life, it is going to change you. That means there are no excuses for Christians not having a changed life. In this passage, there are four things we can learn about spiritual growth— spiritual growth is 1) possible, 2) vital, 3) gradual, and 4) memorable.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 5, 2010. Series: To Know the Living God – The God Who Can Be Known. Scripture: 2 Peter 1:1-9.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
