  "description": "<p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 1:</p><p>Brett Winterble guest hosts for Rush on Wednesday. Capitol riot not in doubt, the culpability is. Impeachment trial is religious zealotry. There’s no direct connection from Trump to attack. Democrats use Jan. 6 acts to flip script on Republicans. Jamie Raskin better than Schiff and Nadler at impeachment. Dems hail Founders that they otherwise wish to cancel. Leftists on Discord admit they infiltrated rally and incited violence. Long game of impeachment. A tale of two realities. Washington is force. It’s all about control. Guilt by association.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>Joaquin Castro’s incitement. Dirty little secret for impeachment managers. John Sullivan incites violence but Democrats use his footage for trial. Eric Swalwell’s Chinese penetration is fair game. Bill Cassidy virtue signals after impeachment vote. Mark Cuban panders to China and the woke, ditches Star-Spangled Banner. Dems repeat the same things over and over at trial. Sullivan has more capability than Trump. Colin Kaepernick’s social justice SPAC. We, the people, should remain patriotic. Trump impeached for having a different opinion.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p>An overwhelming majority did not storm the Capitol. The left’s fear. Legitimate questions. It’s about dollars in coffers, not opening up schools. Dirty little secret: Teachers unions feel safer at home. Rush is right again! Salesforce says 9 to 5 workday is dead. Underwhelming Trump attorneys. Another 9/11? No, the Capitol riot was another Benghazi. The Great American MacGuffin. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. A first 100 days to crash and burn. If we stay united, we can’t lose this fight.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
