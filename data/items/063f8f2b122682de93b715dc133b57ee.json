  "description": "Pamela Hupp. August 16th, 2016. O'Fallon, Missouri. A woman attempts to call for help as she is pursued by a man threatening her with a knife. The incident ends when she shoots the man dead at her home. In the man's pocket were $900 in cash and a note with instructions to kidnap, retrieve money from and kill Pamela Hupp. Five years before, her best friend, Betsy Faria, had been viciously murdered with a knife. Betsy's husband, Russ Faria, had later been convicted of the crime, but a re-trial ended with his acquittal. Did Pamela Hupp lawfully defend herself? One week after she shot Louis Gumpenberger dead, she was arrested by police. Don't miss this bizarre case that will remind you that truth is stranger than fiction.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
