  "description": "<p>It’s time to do a deep dive on raising financially savvy kids! We’re joined by Liz Frazier who is a fee-only, Certified Financial Planner and she is also the author of “Beyond Piggy Banks and Lemonade Stands: How to Teach Young Kids About Finance.” Liz is all about kids and finance, and to get specific, it was when Liz was pregnant with the first of her three children that she was setting up a 529 acct and preparing her will, that everything clicked. That’s when she realized that she wanted to be a financial planner because, like so many new parents, she realized the overwhelming need to make sure her family was financially prepared. And raising children who are equipped with financial knowledge is an important part of that role as a parent. During this episode we talk about having money conversations that stick with our kids, the way Liz does allowance with her 3 kids, how to get kids excited to save, spend, and share, among many other helpful topics.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed an Baerlic Beer Co Pioneer Fresh Hop ESB- a massive thanks to Brandon for sending us these beers that were fresh off the vine!
