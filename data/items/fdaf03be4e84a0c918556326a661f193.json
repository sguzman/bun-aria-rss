  "description": "<p><strong>Connor couldn't record this week so you're old uncle Dan sat down to record an extra special solo ep just for you. This week, we're discussing Jean-Paul Sartre's essay \"Anti-Semite and Jew\" which unfortunately has a very timely application these days. There aren't a whole lot of jokes in this ep, just some good, old-fashioned philosophy and a lot of audio that will one day be cut together to make Dan look like a terrible person. Enjoy!</strong></p>",
