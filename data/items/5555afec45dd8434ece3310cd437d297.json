  "description": "In September 2008, Ewald Nowotny joined the governing council of the European Central Bank. Just two weeks later, Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in US history - so triggering a global financial crisis and recession. In September 2019, he retired just before the coronavirus pandemic struck.\nThis book charts the political and literary development of a young Social Democrat economist in postwar Vienna, his education in Austria and the US, and his experience in banking in the pre-Lehman stage of the crisis.\nFor \"ECB-watchers\", Geld und Leben (Braum端ller Verlag, 2020) provides a fascinating insight into the contrasting presidencies of Jean-Claude Trichet and Mario Draghi, into how council meetings are conducted, and the ruses used by members to influence the markets.\nNow a self-styled \"independent economist\", Ewald Nowotny was a professor of economics at Vienna and Linz universities, a member of Austria's parliament, a vice-president of the European Investment Bank, and governor of the Austrian National Bank.\nTim Gwynn Jones is an economic and political-risk analyst at Medley Global Advisors.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
