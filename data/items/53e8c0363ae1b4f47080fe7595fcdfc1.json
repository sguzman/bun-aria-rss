  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, Ben Ferguson fills in for Mark. A caravan of immigrants are coming illegally to America and the media is cheering them on, and President Trump is the bad guy because he wants to defend our border with the U.S. Military. Trump is right to call out Mexico because they’re supposed to be an ally, and allies don’t let illegal immigrants break into your country when they know about it weeks in advance. Meanwhile, the same media that is calling Trump too strong and mean on illegal immigrants is saying that he isn’t being tough and mean enough to Saudi Arabia. Also, low unemployment numbers are bad for Democrats because they need people to rely on government to succeed. It’s bad business for the left to see people succeeding on their own. Finally, revisiting Disney movies from the 1930s is how you know the #MeToo movement has gone off the rails.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
