    "media:description": "Speedrun Bad Ice Cream is a lot more difficult than you think, but my sister and I still went fast\n\nMy 2nd channel (WEEKLY UPLOADS): https://www.youtube.com/eaziestspeezy\nWatch live at: https://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nEdited by: @The Suited Bird \nWatch the world record speedrun here: https://youtu.be/TFKXmDlHLOU\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\n#EazySpeezy #BadIceCream #Speedrun",
