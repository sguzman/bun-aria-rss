  "description": "<p>EPISODE 151 - CILLIAN MURPHY - Actor</p> <p>Team Deakins catches up with actor Cillian Murphy (INCEPTION, THE DARK KNIGHT, 28 DAYS LATER) and the result is a great conversation about many subjects including acting , working in the business and somehow balancing your life. We explore the idea of how living a normal life between projects is so important and using that in the work. We talk about many of his films and his approach to creating the character. He shares his experiences working with Neil Jordan, Ken Loach and Christopher Nolan. We learn that mastering an accent is “like going to a gym for your mouth”, we also talk about his relationship with the camera department and what he looks for in a director. We touch on the differences of shooting a film, acting on stage and working on a TV series.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span> Definitely not an episode to miss! <span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>",
