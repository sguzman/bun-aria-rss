  "description": "<p>WHERE MY MOMS AT!? It's the show by the Moms for the Moms. Hosted by everybody's favorite \"cool mom\" Christina P! Not only the most REAL show for moms, but the most interactive. An open place to admit no one really knows what they're doing.</p> <p>Christina just had her 44th birthday and she got RIPPED. Christina goes into a bit what it was like doing standup back then. Christina teaches Nadav about basic bedding and hygiene practices and they go back and forth on figuring out what a husband wants vs what a wife wants. Hint: one is universally much easier to figure out than the other. Then we get into some absolutely genius mom hacks, some terrible mom fails, AND we ask \"Where My Dads At?!\" We hear from the dad listeners about what their spouse does to annoy them the most.</p> <p>Christina P. wants to hear from you since she is seriously lacking in cool mom friends. If you want to share a \"Mom Fail\" or \"Mom Hack\" please call into our voicemail (213)375-5184 and let Christina know! We want to talk to as many moms across America as we can.</p>\n",
