  "description": "Dr. Joseph U. Lenti’s Redeeming the Revolution: The State and Organized Labor in Post-Tlatelolco Mexico (University of Nebraska Press, 2017) focuses on state-labor relations in the decade directly following the massacre of peacefully protesting students in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the the Tlatelolco district of Mexico on October 2, 1968. The massacre was a turning point in twentieth-century Mexican social and political history, and as Lenti demonstrates, it pushed Mexican political leaders to re-assert their perceived role as the stewards of the ideals of the Mexican Revolution with Mexico’s working classes. The new revolutionary populist approach rekindled the old state-labor alliances that marked the post-revolutionary era, but masked new social chasms that had emerged in the era of the Cold War. Lenti’s work illustrates the limits of revolutionary rhetoric in the face of post-Tlatelolco social and political realities in Mexico.\nJulian Dodson is a Post-doctoral Teaching Fellow at Washington State University. His research interests include nineteenth and twentieth-century Mexican history, specifically the period of the Mexican Revolution, 1910-1940.  Other interests include the history of the U.S.-Mexico border, U.S.-Mexico diplomatic relations, environmental, transnational, gender, and cultural history.
