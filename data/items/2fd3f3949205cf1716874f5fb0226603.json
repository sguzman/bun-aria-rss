Joining the program to give an update on the Antonio Brown situation, if there were any other significant injuries or covid related issues this past weekend, and what to look for as we approach the season's final week (30:05-45:55). Later, Darius Butler joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about who the real contenders in the AFC and NFC are, what the problem with the Colts is, how the Titans have just continued to win, if teams should be worried about playing the Eagles going into the playoffs, if Dallas can make a run or not, whether or not Matthew Stafford is going to be an issue for the Rams moving forward, and what his other big takeaways from an entertaining week 17 were (1:16:02-1:35:58).
