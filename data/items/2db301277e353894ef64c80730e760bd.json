Bid on spots in Podcast Leagues, pre-draft calls with our analysts and more https://ebay.to/3p4Dc3Z\nOh boy, Trey Lance did not look good on Thursday night. Are we concerned? And how much of a riser is Dameon Pierce after another good showing (4:00)? The guys also give you one player they've been gravitating towards recently (9:45). Keep these names in mind when you're drafting! ... Which WR has the most bust potential in Rounds 2-3 (15:00)? Is it Keenan Allen? Mike Evans? And we re-evaluate the impact of the Tyron Smith injury. Based on recent evidence, the Cowboys skill position players could be noticeably worse without him. What does that mean for the rankings (17:00)? ... Looking at the biggest risers in average draft position (30:30)! Should Brian Robinson be drafted ahead of Antonio GIbson? Allen Robinson, A.J. Dillon and Kenneth Gainwell are also risers, and we discuss three wide receivers who are moving up (41:50) plus Cole Kmet (44:35). Now let's focus on the ADP fallers (47:50) including George Kittle, Dak Prescott and Chris Olave. And we leave you with some preseason thoughts (52:50) and some Podcast League entries (57:15)!
