We delve into this year's Earth Day theme \"Restore Our Earth\" to uncover how art can help motivate us to be more ecologically-minded, and how art might just be able to heal us and our planet.  We were inspired by some of Kristy's amazing eco-art including her series titled, Earth Texts.  See her website for more of her awesome art at https://kristydeetz.com/\n\n*Episode Note: John Sabraw extracts toxic drainage from abandoned coal mines.  The iron oxide he extracts is used to create a series of colors by Gamblin paint company called Reclaimed Earth.",
