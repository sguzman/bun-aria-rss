  "description": "<p>September 7th, 1988. Long Island, New York. A high school senior woke up one morning to discover that his parents, Seymour and Arlene Tankleff, had been brutally attacked in their home. His mother was dead and his father was just clinging to life. While that is Martin's account, the detectives who began an investigation saw things very differently. The Tankleffs were very wealthy and might their teenaged son have attacked them to get them out of his way so that he could have their money and live the life he truly dreamed of? Join us on this first episode of a two part series that covers an unbelievable case of greed, violence, and conflicting narratives.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
