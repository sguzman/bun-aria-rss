  "description": "<p>The fact that God can be our Father is possibly one of the most important things that the Bible tells us. Jesus came and lived and died, so that we could have a family relationship with God — so that we can call God “Father.” This should be a source of wonder for us, something that electrifies us, and should never be commonplace.</p>\n<p>If God is our Father, then, what does that mean? 1) To live in covenant; 2) To live in grace; 3) To live in confidence when bad things are happening; 4) To live in intimacy; 5) To live in gratitude. </p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on June 5, 2011. Series: To Know the Living God – The Adequacy of God. Scripture: Psalm 103:1-18.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
