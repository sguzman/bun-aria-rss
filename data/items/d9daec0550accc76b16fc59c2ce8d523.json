  "description": "<p>On today's episode, Jason kicks things off by taking a small victory lap following the Milwaukee Bucks' blowout victory over the Brooklyn Nets to force a Game 7. He tried to warn us that Kevin Durant would be unable to put together another Herculean effort on such short rest and that the Bucks were the pick not only to win Game 6 but to win the series outright. If Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton can keep up the solid play, Jason may be proven right. Later, Producer Rob G joins the show to help discuss the turmoil surrounding the Dallas Mavericks now that both general manager Donnie Nelson and head coach Rick Carlisle have been let go in the past few days. On the surface, you'd think that getting the opportunity to coach the best young player in the game in Luka Doncic would be a dream job for any coach. But, dig a little deeper and you'll see that the front office is in turmoil, owner Mark Cuban is very hands-on and Luka just might wield more power over his team than anyone this side of LeBron James. Good luck to any coach who thinks they can thread that needle. Finally, Meadowlark Media NBA analyst Tom Haberstroh swings by to discuss the uncertainty surrounding Zion Williamson and his future with the New Orleans Pelicans, why he would caution Zion about looking to bolt for greener pastures so quickly, why it's important to remember that Daryl Morey isn't the one who hired Doc Rivers as the Philadelphia 76ers head coach and may not necessarily feel obligated to keep him long-term, why he still thinks there are a ton of teams who would have interest in trading for Ben Simmons if he were to become available, why he believes Bradley Beal has the potential to become the second-coming of James Harden on the offensive end, why he isn't surprised that the Paul George-led Los Angeles Clippers are up 3-2 over the Utah Jazz even without Kawhi Leonard, why he believes Luka will be the one to take over for LeBron as the Face of the NBA, and much more!</p><p><br></p><p>Click <a href=\"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fstraight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre%2Fid1523353907&data=04%7C01%7CBeauBenson%40iheartmedia.com%7C685d891201a54868676508d932173122%7C122a527e5b714eba878d9810b495b9e3%7C0%7C0%7C637595897497204282%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=isn0FBfZvEZsoRE2xMUj7OwKMJqWkdJwATLLY9nrUG0%3D&reserved=0\">here</a> to subscribe, rate and review all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
