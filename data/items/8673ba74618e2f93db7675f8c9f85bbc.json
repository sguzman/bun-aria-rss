  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Dr. Rick Bright is yet another Trump-hating disgruntled employee that self-identifies as a whistle-blower against the Trump administration’s response to coronavirus. Sec. Alex Azar responded to Bright's complaints by saying that every need raised by the doctor had already been met by the Trump Administration. Bright's complaints simply don't hold water. Also, just like other blue-state Democrats, power-hungry governors have been abusing their authority and enjoying the limelight provided to them by their partners in the media. This is one of the reasons why the Democrats are the greatest danger we face in America. Then, the media is running cover for James Clapper and others are known to have 'unmasked' Gen Michael Flynn by using circuitous rhetoric as a smokescreen to hide the fact that it’s not the number of unmasking’s that matter but who they unmasked that matters as well as leaking that classified information to the Washington Post. Later, Sen. Lindsey Graham joins the show to warn of the dangerous precedent being set by Judge Emmett Sullivan in the Flynn case. This would effectively end anyone else in the future from withdrawing a plea in the face of new exculpatory evidence not originally presented by the government. Afterward, Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel calls in to discuss the political differences with coronavirus in different states.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
