Casey and his father set-up a meeting for the following weekend to discuss what was going on.  He left his shift at the Waffle House at 4:30am on the 8th and was last seen later that morning at a gas station in Marshall, Texas.  His Isuzu truck was later found abandoned with bullets scattered all over the floor.  Was Casey being scammed and finally caught on?  Who would have had the motive to harm Casey?
