  "description": "<p>Happy Independence Day! We’re marking the occasion by talking with Sam Dogen- one of the pioneers of the Financial Independence Retire Early movement. Sam is the founder of Financial Samurai which he founded over 10 years ago. He retired at age 34 after a career at Goldman Sachs, but then came out of retirement as retired life was a bit too boring for him! He has written over 2,100 articles at his site and now his new book “Buy This, Not That” is about to be released very soon which is an excellent guide on how you can optimize your money to build wealth and live life on your own terms. During this episode we talk about why Sam isn’t a huge fan of the 25x rule, maximizing your earning potential, engineering a layoff- we’re excited to talk about all of that and more today!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Daily Serving by Trillium- and thanks again to Sean for sending this one our way!
