  "description": "This year, transgender liberation is at the forefront of Pride Month discourse, with a staggering number of conservative, religious, and gender critical-backed bills challenging trans people’s rights to use public restrooms, participate in organized sports, and even expect inclusive language at the doctor’s office. These would-be laws seek to legislate and restrict trans identity—especially that of trans children—despite the fact that trans people have always existed and will continue to exist, living lives that sometimes include having children of their own.\nFor trans masculine writer Krys Malcolm Belc, pregnancy taught him more about gender identity and transition than he expected—an embodied experience that ultimately encouraged him to begin Hormone Replacement Therapy. In his stunning experimental debut, The Natural Mother of the Child: A Memoir of Nonbinary Parenthood, Belc uses original photographs and documents to outline the expansion of his family and the surprising revelations of this journey. The result is a can’t-miss book about trans identity and parenthood full of poignancy, humor, and love.\nToday on the New Books Network, join us as we sit down with Krys Malcolm Belc to learn more about The Natural Mother of the Child, available now from Counterpoint (2021).\nZoë Bossiere is a doctoral candidate at Ohio University, where she studies and teaches creative writing and rhetoric & composition. She is the managing editor of Brevity: A Journal of Concise Literary Nonfiction, and the co-editor of its anthology, The Best of Brevity (Rose Metal Press, 2020).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
