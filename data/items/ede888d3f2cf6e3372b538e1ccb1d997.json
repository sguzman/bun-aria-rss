  "description": "<p>Most platforms implement some form of content moderation to address\ninterpersonal harms such as harassment. Content moderation relies on\noffender-centered, punitive justice approaches such as bans and content\nremovals. We consider an alternative justice framework, restorative justice,\nwhich aids victims to heal, supports offenders to repair the harm, and engages\ncommunity members to address the harm collectively. To understand the utility\nof restorative justice in addressing online harm, we interviewed 23 users from\nOverwatch gaming communities, including moderators, victims, and offenders. We\nunderstand how they currently handle harm cases through the lens of restorative\njustice and identify their attitudes toward implementing restorative justice\nprocesses. Our analysis reveals that while online communities have needs for\nand existing structures to support restorative justice, there are structural,\ncultural, and resource-related obstacles to implementing this new approach\nwithin the existing punitive framework. We discuss the opportunities and\nchallenges for applying restorative justice in online spaces.\n</p>",
