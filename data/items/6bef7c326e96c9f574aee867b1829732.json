  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the Roadhawks come to you live from possibly the nicest hotel room on the planet overlooking the New York City skyline. They discuss the 2nd leg of their #RoadToWrestlemania trip from DC to Baltimore and from Baltimore to New York City, and chat about some of the things they've been doing so far in New York including Boston Connor not knowing how to act like an adult around other professionals when the crew went to the Bleacher Report offices, the #RoadToWrestlemania video that they put together for the WWE (available on their Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook), Zeet's many personalities coming to life throughout the trip, and the guys dive into Pat and Nick's experience going to a local barber shop in Brooklyn and the hilarity that ensued there. They also question if teams need an elite WR to win a Super Bowl when discussing whether or not the Chiefs are going to give Tyreek Hill big time money, and Pat breaks down how he was booked possibly the worst hotel room in New York City before moving to his new hotel, while Foxy got booked what is essentially the penthouse suite. Also included are some hilarious moments from The Lefkoe Show that Pat recorded with Bleacher Report's Adam Lefkoe from today (1:17:18-2:04:13). Also don't forget to check out the NXT preshow (Friday) and Wrestlemania preshow (Sunday) that are offered for free to new subscribers of the WWE Network. Today's episode is a fun one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
