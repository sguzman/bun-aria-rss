  "description": "<p><em>This post was also sent to /r/keyboards if you're interested in the discussion. \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/sftgx1/my_adventures_trying_to_find_a_wired/\">Link</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Like a lot of people, I had to put together a small office at home come March \n2020. While I'm quite comfortable now, my main issue is that my keyboard is a \nregular one, a <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/accessories/products/keyboards/wired-desktop-600?activetab=overview%3aprimaryr2\">Microsoft \n600</a> \nI'm quite happy with, but it takes a lot of space on the table.</p>\n<p>I did a bit of research (clearly not enough) and I thought a mechanical keyboard \nwould solve this. I got a nice \n<a href=\"https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-non-backlight-wireless-mechanical-keyboard\">Keychron</a> \nwith brown switches because the key layout was excellent, but it came with two \nproblems: it was way noisier than I was willing to stand and it was too high. I \ncould have bought a wrist rest to solve the second issue, but the noise was also \na deal breaker. I managed to sell it second hand just this morning. Red switches \nmay fix a bit of this, but I was not convinced. Don't get me wrong: it's not a \nbad keyboard, it just wasn't a good fit.</p>\n<p>I've been searching a bit more for a keyboard I might like: wired, no numpad, \nnon-mechanical; I'm comfortable typing on membrane and chiclet. I discovered \n<a href=\"https://ergocanada.com/\">ergocanada.com</a>, which has a nice catalog of compact \nkeyboards (including some \n<a href=\"https://www.ergocanada.com/ec_home/manufacturers/typematrix_1.html\">aberrations</a>), \nbut so far I haven't found anything too convincing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Matias has \n  <a href=\"https://matias.store/collections/scissor/products/fk308pcbb\">this</a>, which \n  might be exactly what I'm looking for, but several online reviews point at \n  quality issues.</li>\n<li>Adesso has <a href=\"https://www.adesso.com/product/adesso-akb-111ub-slimtouch-mini-keyboard/\">this \n  one</a> \n  but again, looks like the quality is not the best.</li>\n<li>It turns out you can buy the <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/keyboards-and-mice/keyboards/4y40x49493?&amp;cid=us:sem|se|google|gs_smart+shopping_1po_push|gs_accessories||4Y40X49493|15914561996|129233503381|pla-1597507124330|shopping|brand&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3MLC49jX9QIViR-tBh0sjQ_NEAQYASABEgIfB_D_BwE\">ThinkPad \n  keyboard</a> \n  and connect it to a regular computer. I hate the trackpoint, though. It's not \n  entirely clear to me if this is a wired keyboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I were willing to go wireless (I'm not, but <em>if</em>), there are a few options \nout there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Logitech has the <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-keys-mini.920-010473.html\">MX Keys \n  Mini</a>, \n  which looks good, but lacks 4 keys I use regularly: Home, End, PgUp, PgDown.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2A3LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english?fnode=18c3f275bd715bf9cca7fb147eebc4fecf497163097e9611903eff9be18043c348c7c50156d7e40186bc1b2d57688503f06efdc5dd354303febb70e0d794f4eb131950750257ce3a56d235e5d9a2054261e9bc45eb6715a6e131987244d34cec8547c546fe7e53178f3b9bd892746649\">Apple Magic \n  Keyboard</a>: \n  same as above.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/microsoft-designer-compact-keyboard/8zhrtr7zcswq?activetab=pivot:overviewtab\">Microsoft Designer \n  Compact</a> \n  also looks good, though that emoji key kills me a bit. I want my right CTRL.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jellycomb.com/collections/keyboards?page=1\">Jelly Comb</a> has some \n  nice ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end I've given up: I can't seem to find a compact keyboard that I like \nand that I can be more or less sure won't break after the first week of use (I \ntype hard). What I've learned after all this research<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup> is that a standard \nkeyboard with chiclet keys is probably better than what I have right now. I'm \neyeing <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-ca/shop/dell-wired-keyboard-kb216-black/apd/580-admt/pc-accessories?ref=p13n_ena_pdp_vv&amp;c=ca&amp;cs=cadhs1&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs\">this very basic Dell \nkeyboard</a> \nfor when mine breaks.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: the Reddit thread linked above was useful. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/sftgx1/my_adventures_trying_to_find_a_wired/hus4c0o/\">/u/5349 \nsuggested</a> \nthe <a href=\"https://www.cherry.co.uk/cherry-stream-keyboard-tkl.html\">Cherry Stream \nTKL</a>, which apparently \nchecks all the boxes.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I received my Cherry Stream TKL yesterday and couldn't be happier. \nIt's everything the Keychron wasn't: very low profile and extremely silent. For \nanyone in my position (would like to get rid of the numpad for whatever reason \nbut doesn't like mechanical keyboards) I think this is one of the best options \nout there.</p>\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>yep, I did my own research. Get the vaccine.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
