  "description": "<p>In the end-of-line test of geared motors, the evaluation of product qual-ity\nis important. Due to time constraints and the high diversity of variants,\nacous-tic measurements are more economical than vibration measurements.\nHowever, the acoustic data is affected by industrial disturbing noise.\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the robustness of features\nused for anomaly detection in geared motor end-of-line testing. A real-world\ndataset with typical faults and acoustic disturbances is recorded by an\nacoustic array. This includes industrial noise from the production and\nsystematically produced disturbances, used to compare the robustness. Overall,\nit is proposed to apply features extracted from a log-envelope spectrum\ntogether with psychoacoustic features. The anomaly de-tection is done by using\nthe isolation forest or the more universal bagging random miner. Most\ndisturbances can be circumvented, while the use of a hammer or air pressure\noften causes problems. In general, these results are important for condi-tion\nmonitoring tasks that are based on acoustic or vibration measurements.\nFur-thermore, a real-world problem description is presented to improve common\nsig-nal processing and machine learning tasks.\n</p>",
