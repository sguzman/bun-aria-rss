Toby was sent to a juvenile facility in Northern California and was shifted around between different family members. Then, he just disappeared, and everyone seemed to believe Toby had run away. Since Toby had been in trouble, running away didn’t seem far-fetched. Toby’s father searched for him and contacted relatives in other states to see if he had turned up there, but he never did. Then, Toby’s dad died, and not much was done to look for him. Decades later, a cousin took an interest in finding Toby. She learned that some of what she had been told about Toby couldn’t be true, and what she began to uncover was truly horrifying.</p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Toby Anderson, please contact the Oregon State Police at (541) 776-6236.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://shopify.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://shopify.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify.com/<strong>vanished</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>ALL LOWERCASE, for a FREE fourteen-day trial and get full access to Shopify’s entire suite of&nbsp;features.</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">case submission form</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
