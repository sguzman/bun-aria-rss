  "description": "Children being born now will experience extreme climate events at a rate that is two to seven times higher than people born in 1960, according to a <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi7339\">new study </a>in the journal <em>Science.</em> <br/><br/>The researchers compared a person born in 1960 with a child who was six years old in 2020. That six-year-old will experience twice as many cyclones and wildfires, three times as many river floods, four times as many crop failures and five times as many droughts. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/09/28/1041118810/children-born-after-2020-extreme-climate-events\">Read more about the study here. </a><br/><br/>These extreme changes not only endanger the environment, they take a toll on our mental health.
