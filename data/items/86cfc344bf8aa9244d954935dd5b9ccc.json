  "description": "The story of Azarias is rooted in the tragic loss of his wife as he tries to come to terms with who he truly is. As new people enter his life he begins to question his own past. The book captures elements of science fiction and personal self-reflection about whether we create our own history or whether it is self-determined by a higher power. \n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
