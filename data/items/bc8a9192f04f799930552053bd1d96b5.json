  "description": "Author Imani Perry is a child of the South. In her newest book <em>South to America: A Journey Below the Mason-Dixon to Understand the Soul of a Nation</em>, she gives the reader a look at the South's complicated history, interwoven with her own personal anecdotes. Even though the South has a difficult history, Perry contends, it provides important context for America today. Perry told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly that in order to write this book she had to stop romanticizing the place she calls home – and, instead, look at it starkly. This is an encore episode from January 2022. ",
