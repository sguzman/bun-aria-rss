  "description": "On the newest episode of Worldly, Vox.com’s foreign policy podcast, Yochi, Jenn, and Zack talk about how worried we should be about North Korea’s nukes, what it means that one of the most reclusive countries on earth has a missile that can hit the US, and why the Trump administration can’t get on the same page about whether it wants to bomb North Korea or talk to it. On Elsewhere, they look at Putin’s decision to kick hundreds of State Department personnel out of Moscow and whether the Kremlin has any regrets about trying to help Trump win the White House. Zack lets loose with an anti-Lindsay Graham hot take, Jenn busts out the Putin-related pun of the year, and Yochi gets to use the one word of Russian that he knows. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
