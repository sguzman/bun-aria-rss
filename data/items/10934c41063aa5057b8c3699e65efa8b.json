  "description": "Jay Williams is one of the most accomplished college basketball players of all time. And with predictions of becoming the next Michael Jordan, he was drafted number two overall by the Chicago Bulls in the 2002 NBA draft. At just 21 years-old, he achieved his dream of playing in the NBA and became a multimillionaire. But months away from his second season, he suffered a devastating motorcycle accident leading to 10 surgeries, several months in the ICU, and unclear of whether he would walk again, let alone play the sport he loved.

Today, not only is he thriving, but he has carved an incredible new path as one of the most popular ESPN analysts.
