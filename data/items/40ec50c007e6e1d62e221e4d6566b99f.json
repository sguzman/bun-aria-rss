  "description": "<p>WHERE MY MOMS AT!? It's the show by the Moms for the Moms. Hosted by everybody's favorite \"cool mom\" Christina P! Not only the most REAL show for moms, but the most interactive. An open place to admit no one really knows what they're doing.</p><p>Christina gets ready for the big winter storm hitting Texas, she shows a cool new service offered by a manicurist to do your baby's nails, and we review a riveting Vice article about a cool new breastfeeding trend in India! Christina reveals a Pazsitzky Effect that she can take classes in things she's interested in learning, like painting... who would have thunk it?! Rob Iler tells Christina about Alpha Con and she is AMPED for it! We get into some mom hacks about post cards, using your kids to ask questions, and drying your clothes. We get into some Pazsitzky Effects about updating contacts in your phone, turning lights on when you can't see, and throwing away things you don't like. We try to problem solve messy bath time, doggy doors, and bad water bottles. We get into the magic of child birth and wrap up with an amazing song we got made about Enny. </p><p>Christina P. wants to hear from you since she is seriously lacking in cool mom friends. If you want to share a \"Pazsitzky Effect\" or \"Mom Hack\" please call into our voicemail (213)375-5184 and let Christina know! We want to talk to as many moms across America as we can.</p>\n",
