  "description": "<p>On this date 160 years ago today, the American Civil War officially began with the recently founded Confederate States of America firing on the Federal installation of Fort Sumter in the middle of Charleston Harbor. So for this episode, Avery, Codie & Tony are joined by their friend, Rebekah Ryer, to discuss the first military engagement of the \"War Between the States\" and how it all played out. This episode not only delves into the battle, but the events that led up to it and the lasting ramifications of Fort Sumter not just in the context of the rest of the Civil War, but in our collective American Past as well. This was a good time for the BnB team and were happy to drop this on the 160th anniversary of the battle itself. Enjoy!</p>",
