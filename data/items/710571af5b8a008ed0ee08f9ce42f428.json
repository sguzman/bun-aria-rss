  "description": "In this sample from the CAFE Insider podcast, Preet Bharara and Joyce Vance break down DOJ’s unsealed, heavily-redacted affidavit in support of the Mar-a-Lago search warrant and a memorandum of law explaining the redactions. \n\nDid DOJ present a strong case that there was probable cause to believe that the FBI would find evidence relating to a potential crime at Mar-a-Lago? Why did DOJ make so many redactions to the affidavit? And does former President Donald Trump have strong arguments to challenge the search?\n\nIn the full episode, Preet and Joyce discuss:\n\n– The letter that Trump’s lawyer sent to DOJ to persuade prosecutors to stop the investigation into his alleged mishandling of presidential documents; \n– The order in which a federal judge signaled willingness to grant Trump’s request for the court to appoint a special master to review the seized documents;\n– DOJ’s request for permission to file an extra-long brief in response to Trump’s claims; and \n– The Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s investigation into the potential national security risks arising from the disclosure of information contained in the seized documents.\n\nStay informed.
