The term originally referred to the 1990s, but the 2000s and the 2010s can be added to the list due to the country’s economic stagnation. We’ll look at the postwar Japanese economic miracle, the bubble economy of the late 1980’s and the lost decades that Japan has experienced since.  We will also discuss any overlaps between the Japanese Economic miracle and the last thirty years of growth that has been seen in China – and discuss to what extent history could repeat itself.\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nPatreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\n\nVisit our website: www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://twitter.com/PatrickEBoyle\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join",
