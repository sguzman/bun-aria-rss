But, along the way, a series of events would profound change her path. While still an undergrad she found herself being held at gunpoint in the middle of a standoff with police. That moment shook her and she found herself, much to her surprise turning to running as a way to both process the trauma and reclaim her power.</p><p>What began as a two-mile jog to school after a largely sedentary life, turned into a deep passion for movement, running, especially at night in the city with a sort of fitness-counterculture group of friends, taking on marathons and ultramarathons. This passion would eventually lead her out of the law, into the world of fitness, media, teaching, activism and to writing a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2X8g7Bk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Shut Up And Run</em></a><em> (</em>https://amzn.to/2X8g7Bk) about her philosophy of movement and life.
