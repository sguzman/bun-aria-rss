What does foraging look like in a place like New York City? We find out this week on <em>Eat Your Words</em>, as guest-host Talia Ralph chats with Ava Chin. A native New Yorker from Flushing, Queens, Ava Chin forages throughout the five boroughs and the tri-state area, writing about her finds for places like the NY Times City Room and Saveur magazine. Her memoir Eating Wildly: Foraging for Life, Love, and the Perfect Meal (Simon & Schuster, May 2014), about being raised by a single mother and loving Chinese grandparents, reveals how foraging and the DIY-food movement helped Ava to heal up from the wound of an absent father and taught her important lessons in self-reliance.
