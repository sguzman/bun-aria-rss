  "description": "<p>Mr. Mojo Risin once sang, This is the end, beautiful friend, This is the end, my only friend, the end, Of our elaborate plans, the end, Of everything that stands, the end, No safety or surprise, the end,I’ll never look into your eyes, again. Today we discuss if we should pull the plug or continue to ride the King’s Highway.</p>\n<p>We will celebrate the record of most cigar podcasts with a cigar that is worthy of such a milestone. The Padron Serie 1926 80th Anniversary is our smoke for the first hour as we talk with a listener who has been there since the beginning. Rudy from Canada will speak with us Live from the land of Neil Young and Rush.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we turn to The Cigar Authority Care Package and the JD Hightower which features the name of the cigar branded into the wrapper. It is during this smoke that we will make an official decision on whether or not to continue.</p>\n<p>We will have this all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n",
