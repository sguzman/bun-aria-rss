  "description": "On Friday, May 7th, 2021, Colonial Pipeline suffered a cyberattack that forced the company to shut down its operations. As a result, gasoline outages were reported in many East Coast states. \nThe entity behind the attack is a criminal group known as DarkSide. Nate Nelson, our Sr. producer, spoke with Assaf Dahan - Head of Threat Research at Cybereason - about the Colonial Pipeline attack: how & why it happened, and its implications - both for the security of critical infrastructure in the US, and for the criminal underworld of Ransomware groups. That last one is particularly interesting, since it seems that the Colonial Pipeline attack has set off a somewhat unexpected trend on the dark web.",
