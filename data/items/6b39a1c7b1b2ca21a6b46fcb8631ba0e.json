  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/invest-senior-living\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Assisted living investing</strong></a> isn't your typical type of rental property investing. When someone thinks “I want to get rich in real estate,” they’re often not considering setting up a home for seniors, those in medical decline, or medical patients. Investors almost prematurely dismiss any idea of<strong> RAL homes (residential assisted living) </strong>if they have no medical background and no personal need to do it themselves. This can become a costly mistake, especially when the evidence adds up on why assisted living could be<strong> the most </strong><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/crisis-investing-101-the-most-recession-proof-real-estate-niches\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>recession-proof real estate</strong></a><strong> investment out there</strong>.</p><p><strong>Isabelle Guarino-Smith</strong> is one of the investors that decided to go down this path. Without any medical experience of her own, she led her family business to become a <strong>successful assisted living brand throughout the state of Arizona</strong>. When her grandmother needed care many states away, Isabelle’s father realized that building not only a better facility, but a more profitable portfolio, was a smart move to make. And this risk has paid off significantly, as Isabelle now takes home a<strong> five-figure monthly </strong><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/cash-flow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>cash flow</strong></a><strong> from each of these properties</strong>.</p><p>She knows that the “<strong>silver tsunami</strong>” is coming in quickly and that <strong>capitalizing on this niche</strong> now could mean even great profits in the future. But, this isn’t all about the money for Isabelle and her team. She’s seen <strong>how much better care seniors can get in smaller facilities</strong> and that this type of investment doesn’t just pay itself back in profits, but in knowing that you’re making a
