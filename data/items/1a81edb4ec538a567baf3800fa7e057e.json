  "title": "Unlocking the Rhythms of Rosalía",
  "description": "Back in the fall of 2017, our producer Megan Lubin went for a stroll near her house, popped in earbuds, and heard a song that’s stuck with her ever since: “Si Tú Supieras Compañero” (“If you only knew, my friend”), by the Spanish pop star Rosalía. Since then, Rosalía’s star has continued, especially after the 2018 release of “El Mal Querer,” Rosalía’s genre-blending album of R&B and flamenco. \nOn this episode, we dig into Rosalía’s sound to try and figure out what stopped Megan in her tracks back then, and what keeps us coming back. With the help of New York Times Magazine writer Marcela Valdes, we break down key elements of the flamenco tradition, like the hard-to-define magic of duende, and count out some of the diabolical rhythms that keep us dancing. \nSongs Discussed\n\nRosalía - Si Tú Supieras Compañero\n\nRosalía - BAGDAD (Cap.7: Liturgia) \n\nRosalía - PIENSO EN TU MIRÁ (Cap.3: Celos)\n\n\nEpisode Spotify Playlist:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/4zRce31m3RhCjVwmSSMz2Q\nRead “Rosalía’s Incredible Journey from Flamenco to Megastardom” by Marcela Valdes: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/08/magazine/rosalia-flamenco.html\nWatch Rosalía performing “Me quedo contigo”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32d1bq-kG5c\nMore coverage of Rosalía from The FADER magazine: https://www.thefader.com/artist/rosalia\n\n**A previous version of this episode claimed that Alicia Key's \"Fallin'\", Aretha Franklin's \"I Never Loved a Man\", \"Marvin Gaye's \"Here, My Dear\" and Kelly Clarkson's \"Breakaway\" were all written in 3/4 time.
