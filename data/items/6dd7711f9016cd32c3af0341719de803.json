  "description": "<p>AI agents designed to collaborate with people benefit from models that enable\nthem to anticipate human behavior. However, realistic models tend to require\nvast amounts of human data, which is often hard to collect. A good prior or\ninitialization could make for more data-efficient training, but what makes for\na good prior on human behavior? Our work leverages a very simple assumption:\npeople generally act closer to optimal than to random chance. We show that\nusing optimal behavior as a prior for human models makes these models vastly\nmore data-efficient and able to generalize to new environments. Our intuition\nis that such a prior enables the training to focus one's precious real-world\ndata on capturing the subtle nuances of human suboptimality, instead of on the\nbasics of how to do the task in the first place. We also show that using these\nimproved human models often leads to better human-AI collaboration performance\ncompared to using models based on real human data alone.\n</p>",
