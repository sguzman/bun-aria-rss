  "description": "<p>The most influential factor on your health and success in life is the health of your relationships.</p> <p>Nothing can influence your mindset, motivation, decisions, and destination more than the people you travel through life with.</p> <p>When you are with the right person, in the right situation, being healthy, fit, and happy can seem almost effortless. Sure, everyone has their challenges, but when two people come together with a common goal and real understanding, nothing can stand in the way of their power.</p> <p>No matter where you are in your relationship right now (or if you're currently looking for the right relationship), I guarantee that you'll glean some powerful lessons from this episode that will last you a lifetime.</p> <p>Darren and Danielle Natoni are two incredible people individually, but when they come together, they are truly a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>They are on a mission to teach and inspire other people to tap into their true fitness and health potential, and they are leading by example.</p> <p>Remember, no one is more influential than the person you choose to spend the rest of your life with. If you want to have an exceptional relationship, then you have to make it a study. It's not about perfection, it's about the process and wanting to grow and be better.
