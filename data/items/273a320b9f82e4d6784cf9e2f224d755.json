  "description": "As with the other major prophets, the Book of Isaiah can be intimidating–its sheer length, its seemingly disjointed organization, its varied and distant historical context. While a few passages are familiar, like Isaiah’s call in ch. 6, the prince of peace in ch. 9, and the suffering servant in ch. 53, yet getting a handle on the logic and flow of the whole book remains a significant challenge to many. Here to help on todays show is Andrew Abernethy, discussing his recent publication: The Book of Isaiah and Gods Kingdom: A Thematic-theological Approach (InterVarsity Press 2016).\n\nAndrew T. Abernethy is Assistant Professor of Old Testament at Wheaton College (Wheaton, ILL). In addition to the book well be discussing, he is also the author of Eating in Isaiah: Approaching Food and Drink in Isaiahs Structure and Message, and he’s the co-editor of Isaiah and Imperial Context: The Book of Isaiah in Times of Empire. Clearly Abernethy knows the book of Isaiah–listen in.\n\n\n\nL. Michael Morales is Professor of Biblical Studies at Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the author of The Tabernacle Pre-Figured: Cosmic Mountain Ideology in Genesis and Exodus (Peeters, 2012), and Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord?: A Biblical Theology of Leviticus (IVP Academic, 2015).
