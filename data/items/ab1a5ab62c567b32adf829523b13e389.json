  "description": "Andrew Rannells has come a long way from Omaha, which he left in the late '90s to follow his dream of becoming a Broadway star in New York City. His new book, \"Too Much Is Not Enough: A Memoir of Fumbling Toward Adulthood\" tells the story of his early years there. He tells Sam about learning his dad died on a half-hearted date, getting drunk in piano bars with his best friend, Zuzanna, and how a failed audition for Rosie O'Donnell might have changed the course of his career.
