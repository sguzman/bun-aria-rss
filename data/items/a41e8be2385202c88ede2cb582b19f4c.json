  "description": "<p>The two biggest contradictions of Biden's disastrous SOTU: No masks, and \"fund the police\" after 2 years of Democrats calling to defund the police. Clay says, \"It feels as if basically Biden's done, like there's nothing more that he's going to be able to accomplish as president at this point.\" Buck says that it makes no sense that they were social distancing at SOTU but not wearing masks since, he emphasizes that, other than if you are around a sick person, \"Social distancing, may I remind everybody, is a totally made-up, absurd idea in the first place.\" The \"wow\" moment: Veep explains Ukraine in a much dumber way than Clay has ever done to his first grader. Rep. Lauren Boebert joins Clay and Buck to explain why she called out Biden on the 13 American troops that died on his watch in Afghanistan. Clay adds his informed opinion about the MLB lockout.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
