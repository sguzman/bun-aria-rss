  "description": "<p>No one else can do your push-ups for you. This means that there is always an amount of personal responsibility and action you need to take to be a better version of yourself.</p> <p>Those are your arms, your lungs, and your chesticles you’re working doing those push-ups. But, in many ways, we share our hearts and minds with others.</p> <p>Your desire to be better for your kids could be the WHY behind your reps. Your drive to show your community what’s possible could be the WHY behind the choices you make at the dinner table each day. Our relationships drive us.... and they also devastate us. They give us the fuel we need to grow: the good, the bad, and the ugly. But I’m here to share with you today that you can have a lot more of the good, and a lot less of the ugly, if you realize how to approach your relationships with heart, intention, and a willingness to be better yourself.</p> <p>I’m in a pretty interesting place because I’ve been with my wife for almost 15 years, yet a lot of the time I feel like I just met her, and I’m overjoyed just to be around her. I don’t think there’s anything innately different about us… there was a phase when we pretty much wanted to avoid each other (insert laughing but serious here). But something changed… we DECIDED to work on us. Not just separately, we had plenty of personal development we were working on, but deciding to work on us together as a unit is what shifted everything. We’ll call it Together Development™ (that’s right… called dibs!).</p> <p>My guest today is the person who’s helped me to grow the most. She’s shown me through her actions, words, and being how to love, be loved, and be the best human that I can be. She’s the mastermind behind several successful businesses, she’s an inspiring speaker and force in so many people’s lives, she’s a devoted mother, giving friend, and a fox of a wife. Please enjoy this episode with the one and only, Anne Stevenson.</p> <h2>In this episode you'll discover:</h2> <ul> <li>Why some people mistakenly believe that once you get fit, the mission is over.</li> <li>How irritation can happen when your reality doesn’t match your identity.</li> <li>The difference between supporting someone’s growth and trying to change them.</li> <li>How external motivation can ignite your internal fire.</li> <li>How commitment and structure in the gym can transfer over to structure and execution throughout your life.</li> <li>Why being honest with yourself is critical for real success.</li> <li>How your personal dedication to health can be a huge influence on your family’s culture.</li> <li>Why you need to “make room” for relationships that match your mission.</li> <li>Why there’s a balance between challenging yourself and loving yourself.</li> <li>The #1 skill to develop to influence your family to improve along with you.</li> <li>How acceptance is a powerful tool for happiness.</li> <li>The two different types of people when it comes to motivation to achieve goals.</li> <li>Why it’s essential to take time out to solve conflicts with your significant (no matter what).</li> <li>Why exercise is a lifeline for parents.</li> <li>How to stand up in your role and step into your power.</li> </ul> <h2>Items mentioned in this episode include:</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/thrivemarket\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thrive Market Exclusive</a>- 25% off your entire 1st order + free shipping!</li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/organifi\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Organifi.com</a>⇐ Use the coupon code model for 20% off</li> <li><a href= \"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/5-keys-to-an-amazing-relationship/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Keys To An Amazing Relationship - With Anne Stevenson - Episode 176</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/put-yourself-first/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Put Yourself First - With Anne Stevenson - Episode 117</a></li> <li><a href= \"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/8-steps-healthy-pregnancy-birthing-process/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8 Steps To A Healthy Pregnancy & Birth - With Anne Stevenson - Episode 43</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh-bF0xU3yI&t=137s\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eric Thomas: The Key to Success with Lewis Howes</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/etthehiphoppreacher\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TGIM - With ET</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/fitness-mindset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You Vs.
