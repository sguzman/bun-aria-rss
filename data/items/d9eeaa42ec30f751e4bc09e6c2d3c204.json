  "description": "The first of two parts in the Brenda Sue Schaefer murder case. Brenda was a modest, hard working woman just looking for the right man to fall in love and enjoy life with. Unfortunately she met Mel Ignato instead. This installment we’re getting Ashcentric with it and talking about who Brenda was, what her first relationships were like and what the events were leading up to her disappearance. Of course we gotta leave you on a cliffhanger, but feel free to head to a chilli restaurant while you wait for part two!
