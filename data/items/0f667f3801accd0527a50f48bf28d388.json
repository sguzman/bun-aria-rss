  "description": "Tony liked ducks.  He was introspective enough to enter therapy.  He loved his family.  He had a code of ethics.  He even drank every so often.  He had a soul.  He was likable.  In short, he was everything our president is not.  But would you really prefer him as president to the current Gangster-in-Chief who tampers with witnesses in the open, praises the guts of lying co-conspirators and, well, has his own considerable history with the mob?  Edward Luce of the FT, attorney Katie Phang and host of Deep State Radio's \"Washington for Beautiful People\" Emily Brandwin discuss.  (And spoiler alert: They all prefer Tony.)
