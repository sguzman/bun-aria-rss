But what are colon polyps, why do we develop them, and how can we prevent them from forming in the first place?</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Elizabeth Boham to discuss the Functional Medicine approach to preventing and treating colon polyps. They dive into the importance of eating an anti-inflammatory diet and optimizing gut health to create a terrain in the body where cancer is less likely to grow.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing, she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing.

She is part of the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine and has been featured on the <em>Dr. Oz</em> show and in a variety of publications and media including <em>Huffington Post, The Chalkboard Magazine</em>, and <em>Experience Life</em>.
