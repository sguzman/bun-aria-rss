It is a relatively cheap web service that is highly scalable and has good deliverability. It can be used for sending transactional emails (my use-case), marketing and newsletters, etc.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>I assume you already have a Ruby on Rails app and you know how to use ActionMailer. This guide is forÂ replacing the SMTP server with Amazon SES so everything else should already be in place.</p>\n<p>As such, most of this guide pertains to setting things up inside Amazon&#8217;s Developer Console.</p>\n<p>The only thing that has to change on the Rails side is your config file (e.g. /app_root/config/environments/production.rb).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Setting up Amazon SES</h3>\n<p>1. Go to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/console/\">https://aws.amazon.com/console/</a> and login.</p>\n<p>2. Search for &#8220;ses&#8221; (or similar) in the search bar and click on the result.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JkDsRhE.png\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. Go to the &#8220;Verified Identities&#8221; tab on the left-side navigation, and create 2 email addresses (one for the sender, one for the receiver) by clicking the button that says &#8220;Create Identity&#8221;.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Q6807FU.png\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. After creating the email identities, you&#8217;ll receive a confirmation link at each email address. Click them to verify.</p>\n<p>5. Create an identity for the domain you want to send emails from (e.g. for me that&#8217;s deeplearningcourses.com). This takes a bit more work as you&#8217;ll need to update your DNS configuration.</p>\n<p>6. Go to your &#8220;Account dashboard&#8221; and then click the button that says &#8220;Create SMTP credentials&#8221;. This will give you a username (you get to pick) and password. Create and download those, and store them safely.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PacwyOx.png\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7. Using your credentials, you can now update your production.rb (or development.rb) file with the SMTP credentials you just created.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/lazyprogrammer/3e64dcfad3d7ee0a108c9b5418f108c8.js\"></script></p>\n\n<div class=\"twitter-share\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Flazyprogrammer.me%2Fsend-email-with-amazon-ses-in-ruby-on-rails%2F&#038;via=lazy_scientist\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lazyprogrammer.me/send-email-with-amazon-ses-in-ruby-on-rails/\">Send Email with Amazon SES in Ruby on Rails</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lazyprogrammer.me\">Lazy Programmer</a>.</p>\n",
