  "title": "108 - Lizzie Borden Took an Axe...",
  "description": "<p>During an oppressive heat wave in August 1892, prominent Fall River residents Andrew and Abby Borden were brutally murdered in their home; each dealt multiple and savage blows to their heads with a hatchet. Were they killed by Andrew's strange, thirty-two year-old daughter? A lot of evidence points to her being the killer. But, she was acquitted. I for one, think Lizzie was probably guilty. But will you? Make your own decision after listening to today's Timesuck?</p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you by the <strong>The Jim Jefferies Show podcast</strong>.
