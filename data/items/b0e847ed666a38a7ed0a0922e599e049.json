It was a story that had everything: a titillating costume change gone wrong, a powerful black woman who refused to grovel, and a squeaky-clean, young white upstart who was only too happy to align himself with power. Racism, sexism and misogyny collided to turn one of the greatest entertainers in the world into nothing more than a political scapegoat.&nbsp;</p><p>In the first episode of our special two-part series, we'll tell you the story of how one woman found a way to achieve the American dream — then had it all snatched away in an instant.</p><p>Listen ad free with Wondery+.
