  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Jefferson's final letter penned opposition to slavery while promoting the ideas of equality and unalienable rights. Even then, in the midst of the Revolutionary War, it was clear that the colonies had to choose between independence or subjugation, and chose to fight against the most powerful military on Earth at the time. Also, Eric Trump joins the show to discuss the bogus case that the New York City District Attorney and State Attorney General have brought against the CFO of the Trump Organization. The biggest offense that Mr. Weiselberg committed was having a corporate card and a company car. This is an abuse of power in keeping with their declaration to impeach Trump in the Washington Post, published just 19 minutes after Trump's inauguration. Eric added that his father is very strongly considering a 2024 run for the White House, hence the unending attacks against all things Trump. Later, the left continues to implement ideas that cause rot in the fabric of America's future as children are indoctrinated. Critical gender theory goes unchecked at many levels as children are taught about new gender identities. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
