  "description": "<p>When you ask people about their schedules, they'll typically tell you they're very busy, and don't have enough time for sleep or for leisure activities. Yet when they're actually asked to track their time, it turns out that they work less and sleep more than they realize.</p><p>My guest today studied and dug into this disparity. Her name is <a href=\"https://lauravanderkam.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Vanderkam</a> and she's the author of several books on the personal use of time, including the focus of our discussion: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735219818/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0735219818&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Off the Clock: Feel Less Busy While Getting More Done</em></a>.</p><p>Today on the show, Laura and I discuss why there's a gap between how busy people think they are vs. how busy they actually are. We then unpack what the people who don't feel oppressed by the phantom of busyness do differently than those who do, why time goes by faster when you're older than it did when you were young, and how you can still slow down time as an adult. We talk about how what you really want are more memories, not more time, and how to find more adventure in your ordinary life. We end our conversation discussing how tracking your time can create a more memorable life, why you need to create open spaces in your schedule, and the one tactic you can begin doing this week to start making more of your time.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/offtheclock\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/offtheclock</a>.</p>\n",
