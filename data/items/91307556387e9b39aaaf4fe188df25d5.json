  "description": "<p>Replace ego with the eternal. Trade selfishness for service—and self-absorption for unity. Together, let’s explore the spark of divinity that resides within us all.</p><p>Meet&nbsp;<strong>Raghunath Cappo</strong>.</p><p><em>Punk rock icon. Spiritual warrior. Bhakti yoga devotee.</em></p><p>A teen in search of meaning, Ray Cappo fled his suburban Connecticut enclave for New York City—and found community among the misfits of Manhattan’s Lower East Side. He fell in love with punk rock, so he started a band and a record label. Success soon followed. By the late 1980’s, Youth of Today had thousands of fans, cementing Ray as a leading voice and trendsetter at the bullseye of hardcore culture.</p><p>However, a growing existential itch led Ray to call it quits. At just 22, he walked away from his band and label and decamped for India—a spiritual pilgrimage that led him to the holy village of Vrindavan.</p><p>It was there that Ray fell in love with the wisdom and traditions of Bhakti yoga.</p><p>It was there that he would remain for the next six years, living as a monk.</p><p><em>It was there that Ray became Raghunath.</em></p><p>This is the incredible story of a modern day yogi.</p><p>But it’s also about the search we all go on. The journey for personal meaning beyond the ego. And the quest for universal consequence beyond the material.</p><p>It’s about the timeless that lives and breathes within all of us—that which is eternal, and past our limited senses.</p><p>It’s about transcending the illusions that hold us back. What it means to truly devote oneself to greater truth.
