Unfortunately, conventional medicine rarely allows for physicians to spend enough time with patients to explore the many reasons someone might be experiencing fatigue. Functional Medicine, on the other hand, uses an extensive personal history to look at a patient’s patterns over his or her entire lifetime and connect the dots.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Elizabeth Boham to discuss the common drivers of fatigue and the Functional Medicine approach to treating it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices functional medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing. Dr. Boham has contributed to many articles and wrote the latest chapter on Obesity for the Rankel Textbook of Family Medicine. She is part of the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine and has been featured on the Dr. Oz show and in a variety of publications and media including Huffington Post, The Chalkboard Magazine, and Experience Life.
