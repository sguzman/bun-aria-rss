    "media:description": "Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz pressed China on its support for Russia in Ukraine during talks in Beijing on Friday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang.\nScholz also addressed controversy over economic and human rights issues. He is traveling with a business delegation and has faced calls to reduce Germany's over-dependence on its biggest trading partner. Allies like France and the US are critical of the visit. \nScholz noted that he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are coming together at a time of \"great tension.\" He pressed China to exert its influence on Russia in the name of peace. But while Scholz was outspoken on Russia, Li Keqiang didn't even mention China's ally by name.\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/dwnews_hangout\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\n#Germany #China #Russia",
