  "description": "<p>Recently, the higher order Tur\\'{a}n inequalities for the Boros-Moll\nsequences $\\{d_\\ell(m)\\}_{\\ell=0}^m$ were obtained by Guo. In this paper, we\nshow a different approach to this result. Our proof is based on a criterion\nderived by Hou and Li, which need only checking four simple inequalities\nrelated to sufficiently sharp bounds for\n$d_\\ell(m)^2/(d_{\\ell-1}(m)d_{\\ell+1}(m))$. In order to do so, we adopt the\nupper bound given by Chen and Gu in studying the reverse ultra log-concavity of\nBoros-Moll polynomials, and establish a desired lower bound for\n$d_\\ell(m)^2/(d_{\\ell-1}(m)d_{\\ell+1}(m))$ which also implies the log-concavity\nof $\\{\\ell! d_\\ell(m)\\}_{\\ell=0}^m$ for $m\\geq 2$. We also show a sharper lower\nbound for $d_\\ell(m)^2/(d_{\\ell-1}(m)d_{\\ell+1}(m))$ which may be available for\nsome deep results on inequalities of Boros-Moll sequences.\n</p>",
