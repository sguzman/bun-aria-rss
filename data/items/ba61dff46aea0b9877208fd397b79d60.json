  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Jon Stewart is getting lots of attention because he's disagreed with Stephen Colbert on the origins of the coronavirus, but Conservatives don't need validation from the left. We embrace our ideas because they are solid, not because they are lauded by the left. A revolution is launched and won by the minority, not the majority of the population. The American Revolution, for example, was because the British governing system smothered liberty. The French Revolution was a cultural revolution to destroy and replace everything in their society, not just the governing system. Marxism is about power and centralized control of civil society. This is why conservatives must become, more aware, shrewder, and more engaged in the public discourse. Conservatives must take on the culture. Then, AG Merrick Garland is a radical dressed in judicial robes and now says that the greatest domestic threat to the US comes from White supremacists. If this is true, then President Biden and Garland's rhetoric about people that are White paints 60% of the US population with a very broad brush lumping all White people with radical violent militia groups and neo-Nazi's. Garland also lumped in anyone that took \"overt steps based on beliefs that the United States has overstepped its Constitutional authority.\" Later, Terry McAuliffe is downplaying critical race theory to delegitimize his critics. In a classic example of going on offense, the Nevada Family Alliance is considering a proposal to have teachers wear body cameras. Parents and taxpayers have every right to know what's going on in these classrooms. Afterward, Zuhdi Jasser, President of the Islamic Forum for Democracy, joins the show and points out that the Democrats have given 'the squad' the green light to destroy the American economy in the name of a green new deal. Jasser added that Democrats are silent on anti-Semitism and human rights abuses in China and the Middle East just so that they could advance their anti-American political agenda. Jasser said that Islamists come to the Western world to proselytize in the name of jihad. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
