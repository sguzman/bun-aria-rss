This inspirational powerhouse led the Women's U.S. National Soccer Team to WIN Back-to-back Women's World Cups. This world-class USA soccer coach, wife, and mother, explain all things from what it takes to be on her WINNING team, the struggles she endured having to hide who she was, a gay woman, equal pay, what it really means to LEAD, and her beautiful relationship with her wife and daughter. We dive deep into EQUAL PAY, sharing her thoughts on the #wagegap and how the views of President #Trump have changed us as a community… and what this means for ALL genders. I get emotional in this video because we get very HONEST and REAL about the realities of being a part of the #LGBT community and how this plays a role on and off the field. Find out what the MOST important piece to winning is and how to find self-love and self-confidence simply by showing up as yourself and owning who you are! This episode will teach you how to be TRANSPARENT and stand in your TRUTH so that you can fulfill your purpose and calling on your life and truly #MAXOUT.
