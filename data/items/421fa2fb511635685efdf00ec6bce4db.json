Using Microsoftâ€™s Quantum Development Kit to abstract away the mathematical complexities, this book builds your understanding of quantum computers by actively developing for them. Youâ€™ll start by learning QC fundamentals by creating your own quantum simulator in Python. Soon youâ€™ll move on to using the QDK and the new Q# language for writing and running algorithms very different to those found in classical computing. When youâ€™re finished youâ€™ll be able to apply quantum programming techniques to applications like quantum key distribution, and tackle real-world examples such as chemistry simulations and searching unsorted databases.",
