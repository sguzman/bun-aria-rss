Its also smart in that in will\nonly write out any single object once, making it effective to store recursive\nstructures like graphs. For these reasons pickle is usually the default\nserialization mechanism in Python, used in modules likes\n<a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-memcached/\">python-memcached</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, using pickle is still a terrible idea that should be avoided whenever\npossible.</p>\n\n<p class='more'><a href='http://www.benfrederickson.com/dont-pickle-your-data/'>Read more ...</a></p>\n     "
