  "description": "<p>January 15, 1999. Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Miriam Iles, estranged wife of a prominent heart surgeon, had been on the phone talking with her two sisters-in-law when the call abruptly went silent. They thought that a storm that was passing through must have interrupted the phone line. But after Miriam didn't show up the following day for the Sunday school class that she taught, a few people went to her home to check on her. What they saw through a window horrified them and the police were called. Law enforcement officers broke through the door and found the 47 year old woman dead of a gunshot. Detectives immediately focused their attention on her husband but he maintained his innocence, had an alibi, and none of the evidence collected matched him. Did Miriam's husband kill her as Police suspected?
