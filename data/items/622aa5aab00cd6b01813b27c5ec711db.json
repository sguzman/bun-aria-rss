  "description": "<p>This week Tig is joined by actor, comedian, and podcast host Rainn Wilson, best known for playing the iconic and quirky Dwight in The Office for nearly a decade. Rainn talks about how he applies one of Dwight's most quotable pieces of advice in real life. Rainn also discusses the greatest lesson he learned from his own father. Together he and Tig encourage a self-professed oddball to let her freak flag fly, and advise an engaged couple on how to dis-invite guests to their wedding that has been postponed by COVID so long they're barely friends anymore. </p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Betterhelp (go to Betterhelp.com/TIG for 10% off the first month of online therapy),  and Sakara (go to sakara.com/dontask for 20% off your first order) and Truebill (Truebill.com/tig). </p>\n<p>Need advice?
