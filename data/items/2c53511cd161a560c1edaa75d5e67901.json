Here are the changes for RSiteCatalyst 1.4.8, which should be <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSiteCatalyst/index.html\">available on CRAN</a> shortly:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"segment-stacking\">Segment Stacking</h2>\n\n<p>RSiteCatalyst now has the ability to take multiple values in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">segment.id</code>Â keyword for the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Queue*</code> functions. This functionality was graciously provided by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FootballActuary\">Adam Gitzes</a>, closing an <a href=\"https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/issues/129\">issue</a> that was nearly a year old. At times it felt like I was hazing him with change requests, but for Adamâ€™s first open-source contribution, this is a huge addition in functionality.</p>\n\n<p>So now you are able to pass multiple segments into a function call and get an â€˜ANDâ€™ behavior like so:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-r\" data-lang=\"r\"><table class=\"rouge-table\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter gl\"><pre class=\"lineno\">1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"n\">stacked_seg</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&lt;-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">QueueRanked</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"zwitchdev\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n                          </span><span class=\"s2\">\"2016-03-08\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n                          </span><span class=\"s2\">\"2016-03-09\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n                          </span><span class=\"s2\">\"pageviews\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n                          </span><span class=\"s2\">\"page\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n                          </span><span class=\"n\">segment.id</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">c</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"5433e4e6e4b02df70be4ac63\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"54adfe3de4b02df70be5ea08\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\">\n                          </span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>The result (Visits from Social AND Visits from Apple Browsers):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rsitecatalyst-segment-stacking-1024x58.png\" alt=\"rsitecatalyst-segment-stacking\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"queuesummary-now-with-dateto-and-datefrom-keywords\">QueueSummary: Now with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">date.to</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">date.from</code> keywords</h2>\n\n<p>In response to <a href=\"https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/issues/158\">GitHub issue #158</a>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">date.to</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">date.from</code> parameters were added; this was a minor, but long-term oversight (itâ€™s always been possible to do this in the Adobe Analytics API). So now rather than just specifying the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">date</code> keyword and getting a full-year summary or a full-month, you can specify any arbitrary start/end dates.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"trivial-fixes-silenced-httr-message-clarified-documentation\">Trivial Fixes: Silenced <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">httr</code> message, clarified documentation</h2>\n\n<p>Starting with the newest version of httr, you get a message for any API call where the encoding wasnâ€™t set. So for long running <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Queue*</code> requests, you may have received dozens of warnings to stdout about <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8.\"</code> This has been remedied, and the warning should no longer occur.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the <a href=\"https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/blob/master/man/QueueRanked.Rd#L86-#L93\">documentation for the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Queue*</code> functions</a> was clarified to show an example of using SAINT classifications as the report breakdown; hopefully this didnâ€™t cause too much confusion to anyone else.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"volunteers-wanted\">Volunteers Wanted!</h2>\n\n<p>As I referenced in the first paragraph, while Iâ€™m fully committed to maintaining RSiteCatalyst, I donâ€™t currently have the time/desire to continue to develop the package to improve functionality. Given that I donâ€™t use this package for my daily work, itâ€™s hard for me to dedicate time to the project.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again to Adam Gitzes who stepped up and provided significant effort to close an outstanding feature request. I would love if others in the digital analytics community would follow Adamâ€™s lead; donâ€™t worry about whether you are â€˜good enoughâ€™, get a working solution together and weâ€™ll figure out how to harden the code and get it merged. Be the code change you want to see the world ðŸ™‚</p>"
