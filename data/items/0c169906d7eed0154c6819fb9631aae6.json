  "description": "<p>Osiris - god of the dead, resurrection into eternal life, and judge of the deceased. Ra - god of the sun, order, kings, and the sky. Babi - weird, very well-endowed baboon monster who wants to eat your guts. Talking about a lot of interesting stuff today! We head to ancient Egypt to look at the religion of the longest-lasting empire on Earth. We go over one of the more popular creation stories for the old gods of Egypt and we look at how Egypt's old gods made their way into later religions.
