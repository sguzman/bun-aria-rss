  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the leftists agenda is supposed to be our reality, nothing is dismissed as wrong. What is going on in our newsrooms when ideas like the Green New deal are legitimately considered by the media despite not even being considered by the very same politicians that proposed it? The U.S Senate couldn't get a single member of any Party to vote \"Yes\" on it —even the Bill's Senate Sponsor Sen. Ed Markey didn't vote \"Yes\". Even in the early days of our republic Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton all leaked to various newspapers like the National Gazette which was in favor of Jefferson and the Gazette of the United States for Hamilton. Despite this being a low time for journalism, their partisanship was transparent and they did not try to hide it, they were clearly known as the party press. Today the one-party press shrouds itself in false objectivity rather than reporting news as they claim, they editorialize and effectively promote propaganda. Then, Michelle Obama's former Chief Of Staff has interfered in the legitimate prosecution of Jussie Smollett. Prosecutor Kim Foxx, who recused herself, was friendly with Smollett and won her election with the familiar funds of George Soros' acolytes. Later, Joe Biden is apologizing for being part of a group of white guys that made up the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearing, but his apology for being white was only directed at Anita Hill, not toward Judge Clarence Thomas who is also African American.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
