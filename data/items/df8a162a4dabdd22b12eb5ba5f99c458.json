  "description": "Democrats accuse DeSantis of \"human trafficking\" for sending 50 illegals to Martha's Vineyard. By that standard, Joe Biden is the biggest human trafficker in history. \"Not in my backyard\" libs exposed. Kamala Harris, the greatest orator since Winston Churchill, talks nonsense on community banks. Dr. Oz returns to C&B to talk about his building momentum in the race against John Fetterman for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. Trend lines look better for GOP chances to win the Senate. Never Trumpers will be Never DeSantis or Never whoever comes after Trump. Clay's bold call: GOP could win 5 of 6 toss-up Senate seats.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
