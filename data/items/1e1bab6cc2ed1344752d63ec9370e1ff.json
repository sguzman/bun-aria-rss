    "media:description": "I show that it's possible to climb most of the snowman 0xA without the shell in SL.\n\nThe current strat for Snowman's Big Head 0xA involves using the shell to climb most of the way up the snowman, and then using the fly guy to get onto the head (https://youtu.be/0LgUMkw51_4). Marbler (https://www.youtube.com/user/supermarble94) was theorizing that maybe we could collect the star 0xA without the shell, which could save time. So I investigated whether we could climb the snowman without the shell, and it turns out we can. However, it's quite slow due to having to punch forward during the VSC section, so I'm doubtful it would save time in the end. Nevertheless, I'm still documenting it for posterity.",
