  "description": "When it debuted, Better Call Saul, AMC's Breaking Bad prequel about the early years of unscrupulous lawyer Saul Goodman, drew most of its attention for its ties to its parent series, one of the greatest TV dramas of all time. But over its first two years and now in its third, Better Call Saul has carved out its own space as a weird, funky hybrid of legal dramedy and dark crime tale. Lots of its success is thanks to this week's guest, Rhea Seehorn, who plays Kim, a woman who dragged herself up by her bootstraps to a thriving legal career -- only to have said career intersect with those who might tear it all down. Rhea was known mostly for comedic roles prior to Saul, and she joins Todd this week to talk about playing Kim, why she thinks Saul Goodman might be a good person, and all the great TV pilots she made that you'll never get to see.\n      \n      \n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
