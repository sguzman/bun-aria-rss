  "description": "Hey HBs! This week we’ve got a fabulously bonkers historical romance, Duke of Sin by Elizabeth Hoyt. There’s a fancy blackmail-loving duke who’s been living in the walls of his house, a housekeeper who’s moonlighting in personal espionage, dick-out murders, wrist licking, kidnapping, exhibitionist baths, and SO MUCH MORE.\n Big Content Warnings: child abuse (sexual, physical, and emotional), rape, pedophilia, animal abuse, and murder. \n Bonus Content: dusty velvet bows, our adoration for a fancy man, HB's first Admiration Boner, and England Times Lanyards, to name a few.\n Lady Loves: \n Erin: Cats. They’re for petting and loving and companionship and laughing at them when they try and catch a laser pointer. They’re not for murder.\n Melody: bonkers books in general. Get your romance friends together and rec some bonkerstown bananas books to each other. They feed the soul!\n Subscribe! Rate! Review!

While most people only know about him being the god of wine, which is pretty great on it’s own with all the revelry and whatnot, we’ve recently learned there’s so much more. For one thing, Dionysis was associated with rebirth, with grape vines needing to be pruned back dramatically and going dormant in the winter in order to bear fruit again. That’s one reason you’re so good at pivoting when something doesn’t work out. Plus, I don’t know if you knew this, but Dionysis invented dolphins. I know, it shocked me, too. So, you’ve got some unexpected tricks up your sleeve even now.\nMentioned in this episode:\nSeptember in the Temple!\n- This month we're back with Katee regaling us with more Fertile in My Ex-Boyfriend’s Dungeon (and we discover an actual hard limit for Katee!), and Hannah Whitten is going to stop by to give us all her best spooky season recs. \n- In Book Club news, everyone in the Joy Bringer and Celebrant tiers can download their ebooks of MY WICKED PRINCE by Molly O’Keefe and the entire audiobook collection of COURT OF THE VAMPIRE QUEEN by Katee Robert! \n- And finally, Joy Bringers and Celebrants can check out all the digital art we’ve created for the Temple!
