  "description": "In this episode, Sharon is joined by FOX News and Forbes contributor, Richard Fowler, to talk about storytelling and how it shapes American politics. Richard shares how and why storytelling plays a powerful role in our democracy; people will not always remember the policy, but they will always remember the story attached to it. As well, Sharon and Richard explore how storytelling helps humanize others, enabling us to see them as an individual instead placing them in a collective category of people. Sharon and Richard discuss why polarizing issues do not have to be strictly black or white and why it is important to see the shades of gray. Join Richard and Sharon as they teach us how to empathize through listening to others’ stories and how we can spark change by telling our own. <br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
