  "description": "<p>This week we finish breaking down Lecture Circuit. Pam and Michael make a detour to visit Holly at the Dunder Mifflin Nashua branch only to encounter her new boyfriend, AJ. Angela Martin sold her engagement ring from Andy to buy Princess Lady, a fancy cat, and now has to intervene with her other cats to make sure Princess Lady is bonding appropriately. We hear clips from guest star, Rob Huebel, on what it was like to play AJ, Angela gives us a breakdown of the cat licking scene and Jenna reveals who wrote the Holly letter she read on Michael’s behalf. This episode is so good, you’re gonna ask for more “Office Ladies” at your work birthday, instead of an hour of napping or an hour of TV.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Friend Zone with Rob Huebel and Paul Sheer: <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.twitch.tv/friendzone__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!KwGWQAgIqI36zB4xWWXY8koObLLoD5I-VSb7sY8WjlGXkIObe3B4C98QwtGC1g$\">https://www.twitch.tv/friendzone</a> </p>\n<p>The Fan Connection: <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.fanconnectionmovie.com/the-fans__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!KwGWQAgIqI36zB4xWWXY8koObLLoD5I-VSb7sY8WjlGXkIObe3B4C986kAJ-4A$\">https://www.fanconnectionmovie.com/the-fans</a> </p>\n<p>Cat Tongue Pacifier Video: <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_beJnlTeTk__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!KwGWQAgIqI36zB4xWWXY8koObLLoD5I-VSb7sY8WjlGXkIObe3B4C9_Y3AfyOQ$\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_beJnlTeTk</a>  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n",
