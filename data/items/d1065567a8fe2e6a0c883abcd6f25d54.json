  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the Rage Room inside of Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center. It's a first for a major professional sports arena. The room allows fans to release some stress by smashing items inside of what's called the Disassembly Room. Some of the items even include objects adorned with that night's visiting team's logo. It costs $35 for one person or $60 for two. Also discussed is the continuing battle between China and the National Basketball Association, which is supposed to stage a pair of exhibition games between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers. The dispute stems from a pro-Hong Kong tweet from Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey and Commissioner Adam Silver's support of his right to speak out. Also talked about is the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee's changes to Rule 40, which governs how athletes can promote their marketing partners before and during the Games. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr</p><p>Producer: Bob Bragg</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
