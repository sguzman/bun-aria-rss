  "title": "What Next: Was the Kyle Rittenhouse Verdict Inevitable?",
  "description": "Last August, then-17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse crossed state lines with a semi-automatic rifle, and fatally shot two people and wounded another during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rittenhouse’s lawyers leaned heavily on the teenager's right to defend himself. In Wisconsin, that means the prosecution had to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Was it inevitable that Rittenhouse would walk free? And how did the community react when he did? \n\nGuest: Stacy St. Clair, reporter for the Chicago Tribune. \n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
