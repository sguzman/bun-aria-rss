  "description": "While Marques is away being a professional athlete, Andrew and David sit down to discuss the news of the week. First they go over the new Nothing Ear(stick) earbuds before digging into the new iPad and iPad Pro. After that, we have a pre-recorded phone-guessing segment that Marques played with Austin Evans the last time he was in town. Finally, we finish up with the answer to some difficult trivia questions. If you have any good tech trivia that you think we should ask make sure to tweet it at us!
