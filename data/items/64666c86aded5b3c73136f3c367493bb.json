  "description": "<p><p>The only thing that sucked worse than Tom Brady and the Patriots last night was the New England sports media. Kirk Minihane says the Pats are done for, but Blind Mike is still holding out hope for one more Super Bowl. Clint Eastwood's new movie about Olympics security guard Richard Jewell, a man who was railroaded by the media and the FBI, is being criticized its alleged pro-Trump slant. MHB took to the hit YouTube show Mike & The Minifans over the weekend to offload some criticisms of the Kirk Minihane Show, but he struck a different tone in private messages to Kirk. Minihane regales us with stories from his prep school years. Spoiler Alert: Minihane was the shittiest roommate imaginable. The crew dives in to the simmering debate over calls for the federal government to ban porn. Gerry Callahan joins the show tomorrow.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
