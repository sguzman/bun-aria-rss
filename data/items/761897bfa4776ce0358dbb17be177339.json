  "itunes:summary": "The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 18\nRepressive Tolerance Series, Part 2 of 4  \n\nIn this second part of his annotated reading of Marcuse's \"Repressive  Tolerance,\" James Lindsay reads and explains the portion of the essay  where Marcuse defines the \"administered society\" that he claims we live  in. The listener will find striking parallels to today's world, which  certainly qualifies as the type of \"administered society\" far more  accurately than the world that Marcuse inhabited in the 1960s when he  wrote the essay, but paradoxically, or ironically, because it adopts the  logic of this very essay as justification for its administration! This  part of the series, then, raises particularly interesting questions  about whether or not Marcuse would support the fruits of his own work  and thus sheds interesting light on the problem we currently find  ourselves in. It sets the stage for answering at the end of the series  how we might go about solving this problem while avoiding the mistake  Marcuse plainly made.\n\nSupport New Discourses:\npaypal.me/newdiscourses\npatreon.com/newdiscourses\nsubscribestar.com/newdiscourses\nyoutube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join\n\nWebsite:\nnewdiscourses.com\n\nFollow:\nfacebook.com/newdiscourses\ntwitter.com/NewDiscourses\ninstagram.com/newdiscourses\npinterest.com/newdiscourses/\nlinkedin.com/company/newdiscourses\nminds.com/newdiscourses\nreddit.com/r/NewDiscourses\n\nPodcast:\n@newdiscourses\npodcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-…es/id1499880546\nbit.ly/NDGooglePodcasts\nopen.spotify.com/show/0HfzDaXI5L4LnJQStFWgZp\nstitcher.com/podcast/new-discourses\n\n© 2021 New Discourses.
