  "title": "War Of The Roses: She's Afraid Her Husband Is Doing Something Odd",
  "description": "We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.\nWe loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.\nFrom their first date, her husband made it clear that he does not tolerate infidelity. However lately he's been very distant, and she thinks he's the one cheating. Is her feeling right? We'll find out!  \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
