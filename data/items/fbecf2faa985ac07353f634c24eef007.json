  "description": "<p>Happy New Year! It's 2020 and I'm kicking off a monster January with my first guest of the new decade! My HoneyDew this week is Dan Soder! Dan and I have similar stories and this episode came right when I really needed it. When Dan was 14 his dad died of cirrhosis and when he was 16 his older sister was killed in a car accident. We get into what happens when significant people in your life die and how that plays out over the rest of your life. This was such a fun, deep episode! I hope y’all enjoy it as much as I did. Subscribe, download & review!</p>",
