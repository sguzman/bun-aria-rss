  "description": "<p>Brandon Lawson is a man who went missing in 2013 after his truck ran out of gas and he made and received a number of calls. We covered his case on episode 193. With a new push to get answers for the family, Jason Watts, a friend of Brandon's, reached out to us to see if he could speak about Brandon Lawson's case on Generation Why. We discussed the case, where it's at now and what Brandon's supporters are planning for the future. I really hope that their luck improves and that the case can finally move forward. It has been almost six years since Brandon went missing. How can you help?
