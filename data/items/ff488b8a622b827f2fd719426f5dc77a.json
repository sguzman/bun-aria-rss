  "description": "This one’s a must-listen. Our good friend, apologetics specialist Gerald Morgan stopped by for two whole hours (starting at 16:00) to make the historical and scientific case for Christmas, why it happened and just the kind of impact that it had on the world.  Did Jesus exist? Where/when was he born? Why do so many people miss it? Do not miss! This week, yes we were joined by the fantastic Michelle Malkin.  But you can watch that interview on video here.",
