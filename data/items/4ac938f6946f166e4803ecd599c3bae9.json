    "media:description": "Skijp to 11:08 for a typing demonstration. \nToday we get to take a look at Weytec's Smart Touch keyboard, a highly interactive multifunctional that can control multiple workstations at once across an integrated platform. Loaded, as per usual with Weytec, with functions and options, this is not an easy type of board to review, but I hope you enjoy the video anyway :D . \n\nIntro by Kyle Carter\nOutro by Facundo Cabanne\n\nMy keyboard reviews: http://bit.ly/1TbOtft\nMy switch teardowns: http://bit.ly/2C1QGHz\nMy TOP X videos: http://bit.ly/2FmpZfd\nMy XL typing demos: https://bit.ly/2OoAW3w\nMy tutorials and featurettes: https://bit.ly/2OrkLUh\nMy unboxing videos: https://bit.ly/2TSrr0m\n\nI'm Thomas and I do videos and reviews on mechanical keyboards ranging from the most sickening modern RGB gaming keyboards to vintage hardware relics, or sometimes keycaps or keyswitches ranging from Cherry MX to Alps SKCM to IBM buckling springs and anything in between.\n\nFollow me on Twitter for updates on my keyboard videos! https://twitter.com/chyrosran22\n\nThe practice sentence was: \"Hello my name is Thomas and I'm typing on a Weytec Smart Touch keyboard right now. This is such a cool piece of hardware, but it's got such crappy keycaps and switches!\"",
