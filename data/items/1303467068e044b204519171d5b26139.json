  "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Modern, and contemporary criticism of African and African diasporic art is an area of inquiry that Professor Chika Okeke-Agulu insisted must exist. Professor Okeke-Agulu, along with others like Salah Hassan and Okwui Enwezor wrote into life a genre, and a lineage of artists who diagnose and critique African nation states and related projects. Okeke-Agulu is author of the recent <em>Postcolonial Modernism: Art and Decolonization in Twentieth-Century Nigeria,</em> which takes a broad view. His new work, <em>Obiora Udechukwu: Line, Image, Text,</em> takes a more narrow view, focusing on a former teacher who he names as the most influential Nigerian artist of the 20th century. Okeke-Agulu is currently at work on a book called <em>Contemporary African Art in the Age of the Big Man</em>, which tells the story of contemporary art after dictatorships, civil wars, IMS, and the devastation of African economies in the 1980s.</span></p>",
