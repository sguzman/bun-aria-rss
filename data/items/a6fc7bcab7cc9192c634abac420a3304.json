After questioning tracts of the investigation in the local press, Fitchburg, Wisconsin detective Shannan Sheil-Morgan all but cut Margie out of the loop. As state prosecutors launched a secret John Doe investigation into the circumstances around Amos's disappearance, Margie was left in the dark about whether anything was even being done to find her son. \n\nHer relationship with law enforcement only deteriorated over time as Margie learned important leads weren't being followed up, as people she suspected of being involved went unquestioned, and as detective Morgan herself made unprofessional comments, such as blaming the investigation for \"ruining [her] marriage.\"\n\nA feature-length documentary film called \"What Happened to Amos?\" is currently in production.

In part four we will explore detective Morgan's theory and Nathan will unveil his findings for the first time ever. \n\nIn this exclusive interview with Margie, Nathan asks Margie about her experience with law enforcement, what more could be done to find the vanished, and what her hopes are for finding her son. \n\nSIDENOTE Nathan is writing and co-producing the feature documentary, What Happened to Amos?.
