  "description": "Phil talks with a brain surgeon, an emissary of the pope, and an atheist — all in one week. You know we live in trying times when Dr. Ben Carson requests a meeting with a redneck duck-call maker. Phil also describes his unexpected visit from a representative of Pope Francis, and Jase thinks the guy must have drawn the short straw. Phil shares his Gospel symbols with the emissary, signs a duck call for the pope, and makes a quick video tutorial to show him how to use it. Meanwhile, Jase is the target of a strange accusation and makes a big mistake when looking for a church to attend in Texas. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
