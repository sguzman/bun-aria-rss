  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, what would Americans think if FDR used the IRS to attack political enemies or if JFK used the FBI to spy on Martin Luther King Jr.? What about LBJ using federal law enforcement to spy on the campaign headquarters of Barry Goldwater? These Democrats did that and much worse when they were in power. Then, Democrats take loyalty seriously and there are next to no examples of Democrat Attorneys General turning on their former bosses. However, when it comes to Republicans, they are happy to turn on the president they served under. Later, Nancy Pelosi should be urged to visit Taiwan especially since China is threatening to take action if Pelosi travels to the island. Biden has acquiesced and said she should stay home, and Gen. Milley has indicated that the U.S will mobilize military assets near the region. Pelosi would be the highest-ranking US politician to visit the nation. Afterward, Ohio Senate Candidate JD Vance joins the show to explain how the Democrat in the race is positioning himself as a conservative. Vance agreed that the party needs to come together to beat Tim Ryan who is the preferred candidate of Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
