  "description": "<br><center>narrated by Chris Gratien<div class=\"moiwnames\"> featuring Joshua White, Zoe Griffith, Sara Nur Yıldız, and Neelam Khoja </div></center>  <div class=\"hidden_synopsis\">  | The Mongol conquests of the 13th century were an unprecedented event. Not since the Islamic conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries had such a rapid political rise occurred. For a time, Mongol successor states controlled most of Asia. And though many of these dynasties would not last, the lasting consequences of the Mongol Empire would be many.  In this episode, we study the consequences of the Mongol period for the Islamic world, focusing both on the immediate destructive impacts that appear in the Islamic sources from the period as well as the lasting transformations introduced by Mongol rule. Whether in terms of political ideology, law, trade, or culture, the Mongol period represented a significant departure for Muslim societies east of Egypt. In addition to highlighting the impacts of the Mongols in former Seljuk domains of Iran and Anatolia, we discuss the rise of the Timurid dynasty in Khorasan and foreshadow its legacy for South Asia.  </div>  <a href=\"https://www.ottomanhistorypodcast.com/2020/12/mongols.html#more\">« Click for More »</a>",
