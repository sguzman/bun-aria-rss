  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, China is our enemy! They are committing acts of war against the U.S. and we have a President who is fighting back. China has as its purpose to defeat the U.S economically and geopolitically and its long overdue we confront them. They are stealing our technology and military designs and it’s not to help their people but to build up their military. The issue with China is being discussed in the context of trade but that’s not right. This isn’t about a trade war, it’s about our national security and defending trade and commerce. Also, the United States has issued more sanctions today on Russian oligarchs, proving once again that Trump is harder on Vladimir Putin and Russia more so than Barack Obama ever was. Later, Robert Mueller is a rogue prosecutor who is investigating nothing. There is no underlying crime. The official position of the Department of Justice is that a president cannot be indicted while he is in office. So, Trump can't be a criminal target because he can't be indicted.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
