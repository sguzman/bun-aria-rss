  "title": "What Next: Abrams vs. Kemp vs. Perdue",
  "description": "When Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced his intent to run for reelection, he knew he was facing down a rematch with voting rights activist and former state lawmaker Stacey Abrams. What he likely didn’t expect was a challenge from the right in the form of David Perdue, a local businessman, former senator, and good friend who was encouraged to run against him by Donald Trump. Now, the question is whether Trumpism can be a winning argument in Georgia—or whether Democrats might be able to exploit Republicans’ division to score a win in the deeply purple state. \n\nGuest: Greg Bluestein, reporter covering state politics for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
