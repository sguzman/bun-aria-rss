  "title": "Koral Dasgupta, \"Kunti: The Sati Series II\" (Pan Macmillan India, 2021)",
  "description": "Kunti, a rare matriarch in the Mahabharata and one of the revered Pancha Satis, holds an unforgettable position in the Indian literary imagination. Yet, little is known about the fateful events that shaped her early life. Taking on the intricate task, Koral Dasgupta unravels the lesser-known strands of Kunti’s story: through a childhood of scholarly pursuits to unwanted motherhood at adolescence, a detached marriage and her ambitious love for the king of the devas. After the remarkable success of Ahalya, the first book in the Sati series, Kunti: The Sati Series II (Pan Macmillan India, 2021) presents a brilliant and tender retelling of a story at the heart of our culture and mythology. * In the Sati series, Koral Dasgupta explores the lives of the Pancha Kanyas from Indian mythology and reinvents them in the modern context with a feminist consciousness.\nRaj Balkaran is a scholar, educator, consultant, and life coach.
