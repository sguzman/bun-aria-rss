  "description": "Diedrich Bader was born in D.C, lived in Paris, Dad worked for the CIA (yup, that CIA) and he has an IMDB page that's longer than a CVS receipt. I think it's official, Diedrich Bader just claimed the title as the most interesting man in the world. Growing up, Bader's family's business was USG and as a result we had a lively, passionate, wide ranging conversation on what's working and what isn't working in Washington (hint: D.C. is broken y'all.) You know Bader as the scene stealer from Veep, Office Space, and American Housewife, but really get to know him on this podcast.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
