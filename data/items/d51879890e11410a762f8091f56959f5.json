  "description": "<p>Each July, we celebrate Bebe Moore Campbell National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month. This year, the theme we’ve chosen is The Skin I’m In.</p><p>So often as Black women we’re told it’s okay to be ourselves as long as it doesn’t make others uncomfortable. We’re told to embrace our individuality but in the ways that align neatly with the expression of individuality that’s digestible for society. But what happens when you don’t feel like you fit into the mold? We’re not always shown how to manage the othering and the stigma that comes with it. Well this month, we’re doing exactly that and expanding what it means to show up as a Black woman and sharing words of encouragement to any sisters struggling to accept what feels natural to them. </p><p>All month long you can expect content on our blog, here on the podcast, in our Sister Circle community, and across our social media channels to celebrate being authentic to you. We’ll be engaging the ways history has impacted the way we love and value ourselves and tapping into the ways we can combat negative self-image. So be sure to visit us at <a href=\"https://therapyforblackgirls.com\">therapyforblackgirls.com</a> to stay connected and follow us on both IG & FB @therapyforblackgirls or on Twitter at @therapy4bgirls</p><p>And if you want to get the inside scoop and reminders about events and conversations for the month, you can text the word 'July' to 504-499-0663.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
