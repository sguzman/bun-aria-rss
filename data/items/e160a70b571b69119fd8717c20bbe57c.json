  "description": "<p>Coonbo will be stopping by tonight to talk about infrasound and Sasquatch behavior.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Linda, and Linda writes, “Hi Wes, I live in Midland county, MI but I am from Oklahoma. My mom is from there and my dad is from MI. They met when he was in the Airforce,so I am an airforce brat. Every summer my family would drive to Michigan in July for family vacation. I have a lot of cousins I would get to see and our family would go to the UP for camping and fishing.</p> <p>In the summer of what I think was 1978, I was at my aunt and stepuncles house in rural midland county. Our parents had all left the house to go out for a drive and us kids were in the back yard looking for something to do. My cousins were excited to let me know they had a minibike. So we all decided to take turns on it and drive back into the woods,on a trail that goes through there. After a couple of them took turns,my step cousin Kathy and I went together,she drove and I was on the back.</p> <p>We got going along this trail and we drove into this clearing that was a sandy turnaround that went to the left in a circle,and back out the trail. Well when we got into this turnaround,straight ahead above some blueberry bushes, was a big dark brown/black head of a creature that had huge round dark eyes and it was staring at us, not moving. Well I guess Kathy saw it the same time I did,because she turned the bike over on us,I burned my leg on the muffler.</p> <p>We didn’t say anything,just grabbed up the bike and took off out of there. When we got back I asked her if she saw what I saw,and she stated:Yes but I don’t want to talk about it: She went in the house then and I didn’t ride that bike either again. None of the other kids mentioned anything about seeing anything that day…..So now we are all older and have all talked about this and I found out that both my cousins saw that thing and also with a neighbor kid,when they saw it picking apples off a tree out in a field.</p> <p>When I saw it that day on the minibike,it had a large kind of flattened nose,big eyes,no hair,at least not what I could see, on its face. It had dark hair or fur on its head,the bushes that summer were about 6ft 2 inches,and this thing was a full head taller than the top of the hushes. I have pics that I took that day with my new kodak 110 pocket camera my mom had bought me for Christmas but the pics don’t tell me which year it was, but I believe it was 1978. Of course I didn’t have my camera on me when I got on the bike and probably would not have took a pic anyway as I was in shock and at the time did not realize what I had seen.”</p>",
