  "description": "<p>Gary had a weekly segment on Heartland Radio for quite some time where he’d test new material out on us and the listeners but we’ve never really had the chance to interview him in depth. So, after the release of his new comedy special “The Great Depresh” released on HBO this past weekend Gary was nice enough to give us the opportunity. (7:35 - 44:13)</p>\n<p>This is a 40 minute interview that dives deep. It dives deep into Gary’s life-long struggle with depression. It dives deep into how he almost lost that struggle. It dives deep into how he was able to not only get healthy enough to leave in-patient treatment, but how he got healthy enough to resume his standup career and build a special that tells the story of his victory over this horrible&nbsp;disease. Oh, and Judd Apatow produced it. No big deal.</p>\n",
