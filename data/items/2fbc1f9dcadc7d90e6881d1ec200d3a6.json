  "description": "<p>In this hour of The Herd with Colin Cowherd, there's a new rule for Colin--let's stop talking about when Tom Brady is going to retire until he actually retires. Also, why should Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson have to endure more seasons going 5-11 and getting beat up in Houston when he could flee now and optimize his potential while he's in his prime? Plus, former Green Bay and current free agent running back Aaron Jones on the business side of the NFL and his relationship with Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Finally, 2021 is \"The Year of the Old Guy,\" according to Colin. He shares examples of athletes who achieve greatness through wisdom, experience and longevity. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
