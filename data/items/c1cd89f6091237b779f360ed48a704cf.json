  "description": "It’s not unusual for the U.S. to lend intelligence to another country. It’s a little more unusual for the U.S. to talk about it. \n\nWhy is the American military confirming reports that it’s helping Ukraine vanquish Russian targets? Could that candidness lead to an expansion of the war? Or will it be the deciding factor in finishing the conflict?\n\nGuest: Shane Harris, reporter covering intelligence and national security for the Washington Post. \n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
