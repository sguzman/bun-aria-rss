  "description": "<p>After sharing the true story of a hard-charging master sergeant with a voice like a jackhammer who went on to become a famous artist, Mike recalls the lessons learned from his soft-spoken grandfather – an artist of a different kind - whose unique talents inspired a show called Dirty Jobs, and a foundation called mikeroweWORKS. It’s a rumination on men who scream, and men who whisper, complete with a song about a nose that wouldn’t stop bleeding.</p>\n",
