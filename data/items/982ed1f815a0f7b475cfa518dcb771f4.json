Just text DRLEAF to 80519\n \n \nFighting injustice and fighting for what you believe often sounds exciting, but it can come at a great cost. Yet the cost of being inauthentic, of denying who you are and what you believe in, is often greater, and can keep you in bondage, as I discuss in this week’s blog and podcast with speaker, NY Times best-selling author and top podcast host Jen Hatmaker. As Jen discusses in her amazing new book Fierce, Free and Full of Fire: The Guide to Being Gloriously You, even though standing up for what you believe is right and embracing who you are and what you want in life can be challenging, the struggle is worth it. On the other side you will find beauty, fulfillment and true freedom.\n \n \nThis week's podcast is made possible by our sponsor BiOptimizers (my favorite supplement company)!
