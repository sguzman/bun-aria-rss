  "description": "<p>Kirk Minihane has a bone to pick with the Florence VFW who lavishly praised Steve’s contribution to the live show, thus minimizing Kirk’s role as creator, innovator, and fundraiser. Azaria of Lego Barstool fame joins Kirk to discuss his custom mini-figurines. Then Kirk gives Quantum Week Chris a letter grade for his performance on the show yesterday, while simultaneously Matt takes shots at Jared Carrabis.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
