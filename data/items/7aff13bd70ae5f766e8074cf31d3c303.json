As the athletes and their families begin to create an idyllic 'sports utopia,' Du Pont devolves into a state of constant paranoia. As his mental state deteriorates and goes unchecked, Du Pont becomes suspicious and distrustful of the athletes who've come to depend on him--a combination that results in a brutal and senseless murder.</p>\n\n\n<p>For even more TCO, find our weekly bonus mini episodes and our monthly Full Bonus Episodes on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">our Patreon page!</a></p>\n",
