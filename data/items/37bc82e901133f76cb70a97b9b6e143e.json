  "description": "<p>r/Maliciouscompliance OP is enlisted in the military, and he also works a normal 9-5 job. He gets orders to appear for a training drill, so he informs his boss. Like an absolute idiot, OP's boss tries to tell him that coming into work is more important than showing up for military duty, so OP will be fired if he skips work. Well, turns out that violating an active soldier's rights is a pretty big deal in the eyes of the US military. After OP makes just one phone call, the manager is stumbling over himself trying to apologize to OP.</p>\n",
