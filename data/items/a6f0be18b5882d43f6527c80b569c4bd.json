  "description": "Tim Perry is adjunct professor of theology at Saint Paul University in Ottawa and at Trinity School for Ministry in Ambridge, PA. As the author of a number of studies of the relationship between Catholic Christianity and evangelicalism, his most recent project has been to edit a volume of essays by leading protestant theologians on one of the most important recent Popes. The Theology of Benedict XVI: A Protestant Appreciation (Lexham Press, 2019) gathers together work from contributors including Carl Trueman, Ben Myers, and Katherine Sonderegger, which shows how seriously protestants are taking Benedict’s claims. This beautifully designed and carefully edited volume represents what must be one of the finest attempts to interact with the commitments and achievements of the Bishop of Rome who might have most to say to modern protestants.\nCrawford Gribben is a professor of history at Queen’s University Belfast. His research interests focus on the history of puritanism and evangelicalism, and he is the author most recently of John Owen and English Puritanism (Oxford University Press, 2016). \nLearn more about your ad choices.
