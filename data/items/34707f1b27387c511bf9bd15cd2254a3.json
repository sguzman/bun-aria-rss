  "description": "Fostering and maintaining relationships with our allies and partners is an integral part of USSOCOM's SOF Strategy. That's why USSOCOM hosts the largest gathering of international SOF personnel outside of NATO, known as J3-I and why this year's SOF Week is even more important as it includes the ISOF Commander's Conference. Our guest for this episode is an operations officer from Czech Republic's SOF, whom we'll call Igor. Igor shares his motivation for serving his country, joining his nation's SOF, and talks about how partnerships with USSOCOM directly influenced him on the battlefield as well as his time stateside as part of USSOCOM's J3-I. <br /><br />Subscribe to SOFcast today!
