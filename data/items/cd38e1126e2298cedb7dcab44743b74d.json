  "description": "“Management teams only tell the best part of their story” -– Michael Alkin Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. This week, one of my favorite short sellers in the business, Michael Alkin, joins the show. While most short analysts will only study company reports (revenues, earnings, or recent guidance), Michael takes the extra step others ignore.... He talks with customers... former employees... suppliers... and distributors. Only then will he decide where the chips fall. And on today's show, Michael tells one of the best stories I've heard on Wall Street. It includes an incompetent company… a costume… and one ballsy analyst. Tune in to learn more about Michael's contrarian approach to short selling… along with two sectors he predicts are about to blow up. Good Investing, Frank Curzio",
