  "description": "Harris Beider is the author of White Working-Class Voices: Multiculturalism, Community-Building, and Change (Policy Press, 2015). Beider is chair in Community Cohesion at the Center for Trust, Peace, and Social Relations, Coventry University, UK, and visiting professor at Columbia University, School of International and Public Affairs. Many of the same socio-economic changes that scholars have associated with the rise of President Donald Trump in the US have been associated with recent political events in Great Britain. The white-working class has been at the center of many of these debates, but often based on limited empirical evidence of their beliefs and attitudes. Based on over 200 interviews in multiple sites in the UK, Beider challenges conventional notions of the white working-class. Especially on issues of race and multiculturalism, the book adds nuance and detail to the ways white working-class people have reacted to de-industrialization, the changing racial and ethnic makeup of the country, and the strategies taken by major political parties.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
