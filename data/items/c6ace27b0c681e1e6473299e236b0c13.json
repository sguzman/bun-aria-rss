  "description": "<p>We investigate nonlinear structure formation in the fuzzy dark matter (FDM)\nmodel in comparison to cold dark matter (CDM) models from a weak lensing\nperspective using perturbative methods. We use Eulerian perturbation theory up\nto fourth order to compute the tree-level matter trispectrum and the one-loop\nmatter spectrum and bispectrum from consistently chosen initial conditions. We\ngo on to derive the respective lensing spectra, bispectra and trispectra in CDM\nand FDM in the context of a Euclid-like weak lensing survey. Finally, we\ncompute the attainable cumulative signal-to-noise ratios and an estimate of the\nattainable $\\chi^2$-functionals for distinguishing FDM from CDM at particle\nmasses $m=10^{-21}$ eV, $m = 10^{-22}$ eV and $m = 10^{-23}$ eV. We find that a\nweak lensing survey can potentially be used to distinguish between the FDM and\nCDM cases up to a mass of $m = 10^{-22}$ eV.\n</p>",
