  "description": "<p>Episode 314 - Please welcome my new friend, Matt Coplon to the show today. He’s the vocalist from “screamo” (the original description) heroes Reversal of Man and a professional BMX rider. I have wanted him on the show for quite some time and was excited that we finally made it happen. We talk about BMX riding (and if it is still considered lame by skate culture), poetry and unsustainable touring. It’s a glorious chat and you must listen!
