  "description": "Buck rocks it solo while Clay takes the day off to do dad stuff. SCOTUS reaffirms right \"To Keep and Bear Arms\", voting 6-3 to strike down New York's unconstitutional concealed-carry law.  Buck says, \"As an adult, I have not been able to enjoy 2nd Amendment rights in my home state... It's obscene.\" Unelected Governor Hochul knows nothing about the 2nd Amendment. Buck reads from Justice Thomas' brilliantly written opinion on the NY gun law. Buck takes a call to wrap up the hour.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
