  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">At numerous points throughout American history, Christians had a choice to confront the evils of racism or quietly ignore them. In a challenging conversation Jemar Tisby, author of “The Color of Compromise” and host of the “Pass the Mic” podcast, explores key moments from the arrival of the first African slaves in 1619 to the rise of the Religious Right in the 1970s when the white church in America chose silence or complicity rather than faithfulness. He also explains how Christian arguments to justify slavery are still being used by some today in the wake of police violence and Black Lives Matters. Also this week, Skye and Phil discuss why neighborhoods are becoming more segregated than ever. Tim Keller’s definition of “righteous” challenges our American and economic belief in self-interest. IBM is using A.I. to create fake crowds for televised sports during the pandemic. Plus, Amsterdam has an innovative solution for a scourge of “wild peeing.”</p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\">“The Color of Compromise: The Truth about the American Church’s Complicity in Racism” by Jemar Tisby: <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Color-Compromise-American-Churchs-Complicity-ebook/dp/B07BB6R827\"> https://www.amazon.com/Color-Compromise-American-Churchs-Complicity-ebook/dp/B07BB6R827</a></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\">“IBM’s Watson to help tennis fans argue with each other:” <a href= \"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/tech/ibm-artificial-intelligence-us-open/index.html\"> https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/tech/ibm-artificial-intelligence-us-open/index.html</a></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\">“These planter-like urinals are Amsterdam’s answer to the problem of ‘wild peeing’”:  <a href= \"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/amsterdam-sustainable-urinal-scli-intl/index.html\">https://www.cnn.com/style/article/amsterdam-sustainable-urinal-scli-intl/index.html</a></p>",
