  "description": "<p>Big Jay Oakerson and I went up to a buddy's rooftop in New York and talked about garbage music while we looked into people's windows hoping to find some action. Jay has the worst taste in music. He likes all my least favorite bands. So we talked about that a little. But we also got majorly sidetracked as we started seeing a bunch of interesting stuff in the windows. I also talk a lot about Bonnaroo in the intro and outro.</p>",
