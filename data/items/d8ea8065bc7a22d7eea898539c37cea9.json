  "title": "206 - The Strange Kidnapping of Patty Hearst",
  "description": "<p>Who joins the gang that kidnapped them and held them for ransom and helps them rob banks long after they're free to leave? Patty Hearst did that in 1974. And who the Hell is Patty Hearst? She's the granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst, a man who created the largest newspaper, magazine, newsreel, and movie business in the world in the early 1900s. Patty is the daughter and granddaughter of billionaires. And when she was kidnapped, she was a nineteen-year-old college kid studying at Berkeley. She was kidnapped by the SLA - the Symbionese Liberation Army - a small group of radical, militant communists lead by career criminal Donald DeFreeze. She was, to the group, an important symbol of the \"fascist pig\" capitalism they despised, and within weeks of being kidnapped, Patty transitioned from captor to communist soldier and became the world's most famous example of Stockholm Syndrome. It's a crazy, extremely unique tale, and I'm excited to tell it, today, on Timesuck.  </p>\n<p><strong>Donating $6600 to the YWCA's Idaho County Fund!</strong> <br /><br />To donate yourself to this important cause, go to <strong><a href=\"http://ywcaidaho.org\">ywcaidaho.org</a> </strong>and earmark your donation to “General Fund Idaho County” by typing that in the comments section of the online donation form.
