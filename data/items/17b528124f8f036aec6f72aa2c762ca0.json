  "description": "Tuesday was a sad one in the NFL as one of the league's all-time winningest coaches, Marty Schottenheimer, passed away at the age of 77. Will Brinson spends a few moments remembering the coach famous for Marty Ball (0:00). Then, he welcomes on Jared Dubin to discuss another unhappy quarterback. Russell Wilson is frustrated with the Seahawks (as reported by our own Jason La Canfora). Russ has reason to be upset but what will ultimately get accomplished? Brinson and Dubin break down the future in Seattle (6:00). Next, they turn their attention to what's next for the two teams that just played in the Super Bowl. The Bucs have crucial free agents on both sides of the ball, as the guys examine who Tampa Bay should prioritize (20:00). The Chiefs are in better shape in terms of free agency and still have Patrick Mahomes for the next decade, so it's no surprise they are the early favorite to win Super Bowl LVI (32;30). \n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
