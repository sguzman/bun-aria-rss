  "description": "<p>On <em>The Phenomenology of Spirit</em> (1807), ch. 1 \"Sense Certainty\" and ch. 2 \"Perception.\"</p> <p>We walk through the first step in considering Hegel's dialectical analysis of theories of knowledge. Sense-certainty claims that we have direct access to sensory particulars which can act as foundational. But can we really refer or point to a particular thing without bringing some universal concepts to bear, like \"this\" (which can refer to any number of things), as well as \"here\", \"now\" and even \"I\"?</p> <p>Part two of this episode is only going to be available to you if you sign up at <a href=\"https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/support\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">partiallyexaminedlife.com/support</a> or via <a href= \"http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/the-partially-examined-life/id318345767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple Podcasts</a>. <a href= \"https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/08/13/ep276-2-hegel-perception-citizen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get it now</a> or <a href= \"https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/08/16/preview-ep-276-hegel-on-perception-part-two/\"> listen to a preview</a>.</p>",
