  "description": "<p>January 6, 1998. Chatham, Ontario. The Jenkins family, Brian, Leslie, Mason, and Jennifer, seemed to be a happy one. But whatever serenity they had was shattered after the parents arrived home one evening to find their daughter's body in the basement. Their son Mason wasn't in the house and they feared that he was in serious trouble as well. The authorities, though, tracked their son down. When they caught up to him he was riding a horse and did not want to go to the police station. Jennifer had been shot five times. Police believed that Mason killed her. His parents could not understand that and stood by their son. As time went on, Mason's account began to change again and again. Did he kill his sister? And if he did, would his parents continue to support him?</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
