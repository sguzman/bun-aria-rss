  "title": "The free boundary SABR: natural extension to negative rates",
  "description": "In the current low interest rate environment, extending option models to negative rates has become an important issue. Here, Alexandre Antonov, Michael Konikov and Michael Spector extend the widely used SABR model to the free boundary SABR model that can handle negative rates. They derive an exact option pricing formula for the zero correlation case, and a suitable approximation for the general case. The analytical results are successfully compared with the Monte Carlo simulations",
