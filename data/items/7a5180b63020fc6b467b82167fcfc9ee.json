  "description": "For this special episode we’re joined by Dean Lynn Perry Wooten, Dean of the Dyson School to talk about the incoming Dyson class and its constitution at the undergraduate and MPS level.  From there we explore the greater makeup of our fields, discus the diversity therein and how to attract a wider array of people to them.  He also talk about the dearth of diversity of CEOs and in C-Suites in general except for under some notable circumstances.
