  "description": "Mining legend and CEO of McEwen Mining, Rob McEwen talks about the recent surge in gold stocks and why we are still in the early innings of a long-term bull market.   McEwen then talks about his early years in the mining industry.  This includes death threats, class action lawsuits, and a four year strike which led to the creation of Goldcorp - one of the biggest gold producers in the world.   McEwen is pioneer in the mining industry.  And McEwen Mining is one of the few shareholder-friendly companies in the industry that does not use leverage, pays a solid dividend and has huge insider ownership.  That's why he's made his early investors a fortune in the mining industry over the past 40 years. ",
