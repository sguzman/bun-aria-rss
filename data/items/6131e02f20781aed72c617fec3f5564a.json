  "description": "<p>r/Bridezillas The woman into today's episode is one of the most disgusting, selfish, awful people I've ever read about. She messages her friend, who has just lost a child to a miscarriage, and demands that she sucks it up and just gets over it because she doesn't want anybody to cry at her wedding. That is just unbelievably callous and selfish! Luckily, OP told the bridezilla that their friendship was over after that.
