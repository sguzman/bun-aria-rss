  "description": "<p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has attracted extensive attention in\nrecent years. However, most research focuses on the scenario of the narrowband\nand/or instantaneous channel state information (CSI), while wide bandwidth with\nthe use of millimeter-wave (mmWave) (including sub-Terahertz) spectrum is a\nmajor trend in next-generation wireless communications, and statistical CSI is\nmore practical to obtain in realistic systems. Thus, we {consider} the ergodic\nachievable rate of RIS-assisted mmWave multiple-input multiple-output\northogonal frequency division multiplexing communication systems. The widely\nused Saleh-Valenzuela channel model is adopted to characterize the mmWave\nchannels and only the statistical CSI is available. We first derive the\napproximations of the ergodic achievable rate by means of the majorization\ntheory and Jensen's inequality. Then, an alternating optimization based\nalgorithm is proposed to maximize the ergodic achievable rate by jointly\ndesigning the transmit covariance matrix at the base station and the reflection\ncoefficients at the RIS. Specifically, the design of the transmit covariance\nmatrix is transformed into a power allocation problem and solved by\nspatial-frequency water-filling. The reflection coefficients are optimized by\nthe Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithm. Simulation results corroborate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\n</p>",
