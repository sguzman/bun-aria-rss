  "description": "<p>This week, we discuss the recent outage of Facebook, Instagram and Whats App and share our thoughts on the realisations it brought up. We rely on these apps for all sorts of things - we connect with our friends, we share our art, and some of us run our businesses using at least one of these platforms. When they vanish, we can feel lost. But we believe this outage reminds us that there are other ways to stay in touch and other ways to market our work. And that in fact, we could focus our efforts a little more widely. Neither of us believe that we will have to do without social media, but we can make it a little less central. We end our chat with a challenge to you, so stick with us to the end!</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Louise's book from her publishers <a href=\"\">https://birdeyebooks.com/products/life-force-a-painters-response-to-the-nature-poetry-of-ted-hughes</a></p>\n<p>Louise's book from Amazon <a href=\"\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Force-Painters-Response-Nature/dp/1914079647</a></p>\n<p>George Pointon on Twitter <a href=\"\">https://twitter.com/GeorgePointon_</a></p>\n<p>Grand Designs <a href=\"\">https://www.channel4.com/programmes/grand-designs</a></p>\n<p>Location, Location, Location <a href=\"\">https://www.channel4.com/programmes/location-location-location</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
