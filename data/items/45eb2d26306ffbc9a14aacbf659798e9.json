  "title": "Anderson Cooper | House of Horrors",
  "description": "The insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th came after a half dozen Republican lawmakers developed a blueprint to publicly hammer home the idea that the election was tainted, and plotted to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. Elsewhere, Stephen Colbert performed a special song to cheer up theatergoers who missed their Broadway shows last night due to Covid closures. And our annual Late Show Christmas Cartoon is back! It's Christmas Eve, and Santa is about to certify the Naughty & Nice List in the Klaus of Representatives, when he's interrupted by a \"Stop the Sleigh\" rally, fueled by the shadowy internet cult \"Scrooge-Anon.\" Will Christmas survive a full-scale tinsel-rection led by Ted Cruz and Marjorie Taylor Greene? Only Santa and Mrs. Claus stand in their un-merry way. Next, CNN's Anderson Cooper takes shots of tequila with Stephen and watches footage of himself drunk on the air while hosting CNN’s “New Years Eve Live” with Andy Cohen. Tune in this year to see what trouble Anderson gets in while hosting the ball drop in Times Square.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
