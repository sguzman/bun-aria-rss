Although her accomplishments are far too numerous to list, among Danica’s many notable glass ceiling explosions include:</p><br><p>* first woman to lead the Indy 500;</p><p>* highest Indy 500 female finish ever (4th);</p><p>* first woman to win an IndyCar circuit race; and</p><p>* first woman to win pole position at Daytona 500</p><br><p>Off the track, Danica is a media magnet.
