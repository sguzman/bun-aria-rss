Our gut bacteria regulate many of our bodily functions, from creating vitamins to controlling our immune system, our brain function, and, of course, our metabolism and weight. They are critical to our long-term health. But even if you’re eating the right things, you may need some outside assistance maintaining plentiful and diverse gut bacteria. Probiotics help populate your gut with beneficial bacteria, improving your sleep, daily elimination, brain health, and so much more.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Dhru Purohit, Dr. Tracy Shafizadeh, and Dr. Elizabeth Boham about probiotics, the importance of the gut microbiome starting in infancy, and why you should work with a skilled practitioner to choose the right probiotic for you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dhru Purohit is a podcast host, serial entrepreneur, and investor in the health and wellness industry. His podcast, <em>The Dhru Purohit Podcast</em>, is a top 50 global health podcast with over 30 million unique downloads. His interviews focus on the inner workings of the brain and the body and feature the brightest minds in wellness, medicine, and mindset.</p><br><p>Dr. Tracy Shafizadeh is leading the work in understanding the infant microbiome. She is a nutritional scientist who helps new and expectant moms learn about creating healthy gut bugs in their babies. Dr. Shafizadeh received her Ph.D. in nutritional biology from the University of California, Davis, and spends her free time \"loving the guts\" out of her two boys.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health, Paleovalley, and InsideTracker.</p><br><p>Rupa Health is a place where Functional Medicine practitioners can access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, and Great Plains.
