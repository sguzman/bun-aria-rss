And he's worked with every material and in every medium he could fathom—metal, paper, glass, plastic, rubber, foam, plaster, pneumatics, hydraulics, animatronics, neon, glassblowing, moldmaking, and injection molding, to name just a few.\n\nIn 1993, Adam began concentrating his career on the special-effects industry, honing his skills through more than 100 television commercials and a dozen feature films, including Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace and Episode II – Attack of the Clones, Galaxy Quest, and the Matrix sequels. \n\nA decade later, Adam was chosen, along with Jamie Hyneman, to host MythBusters, which premiered on Discovery Channel in January 2003. 14 years; 1,015 myths; 2,950 experiments; eight Emmy nominations; and 83 miles of duct tape later, that version of the series ended in March 2016.\n\nToday, Adam hosts and executive produces MythBusters Jr., as well as a brand-new series, Savage Builds, which premieres on Science Channel in June 2019.

The current line (available at AdamSavage.com) includes two sizes of the EDC (\"Everyday Carry\") and pouches, with more product both available on the site and on the way.\n\nFinally, in 2019 Adam wrote his first book, Every Tool's a Hammer, which is, in Adam's words, \"...a chronicle of my life as a maker.

Permission to grab hold of the things you're interested in, that fascinate you, and to dive deeper into them to see where they lead you.\"</p><p><strong>This episode of the Tim Ferriss Show is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://theochocolate.com/tim\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Theo Chocolate</strong></a>, which is the first organic and fair-trade chocolate company in North America. The folks there reached out to me because they spotted some neatly stacked bars of their dark chocolate coconut in a recent Instagram photo of my fridge (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BvM7owQA4ly/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see it here</a>).</p><p>This is a brand that does everything from scratch, and the difference shows. It's why <a href=\"http://theochocolate.com/tim\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Theo</a> is one of my favorite chocolates. It offers tons of different bars, little snacks like coconut bites, and also imaginative creations like a cinnamon horchata bar, beer and scotch chocolates, and its signature s'mores bite -- The Big Daddy. My personal favorite: <a href=\"http://theochocolate.com/tim\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Salted Almond Butter Cups</a>, which are ridiculous.</p><p><a href=\"http://theochocolate.com/tim\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Theo</strong></a><strong> </strong>is helping drive its industry forward by working with communities in the Congo and Peru to make the economics of the cocoa trade fair for farmers, and by using sustainable farming practices.
