  "description": "<p>Today’s episode is all about your belly button aka navel aka umbilicus. And not just<em> your </em>belly button -- every single person you can think of has one. This means our listeners have LOTS of questions about them. We're going to tackle several of these fascinating navel-gazing questions like: is your belly button connected to your insides? Where does belly button fuzz come from? Why do some belly buttons stick out? And do cats and dogs have belly buttons? Plus, we have a tricky mystery sound for you to guess and a Moment of Um that answers the question: How do carrots grow if they don't have seeds?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Indeed (<a href=\"http://indeed.com/brainson\" title=\"indeed.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">indeed.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n",
