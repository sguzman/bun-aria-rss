  "description": "Fiona Hill may have risen to public prominence during Donald Trump's first impeachment but there is much more to her story than just her time in the White House. In her new book \"There is Nothing for You Here: Finding Opportunity in the Twenty-First Century\", she describes her journey from a coal-mining town in Northern England to studying in Moscow and ultimately to serving three different Presidents. Hill argues that expanding opportunity rather than clinging to the past is the only way to save democracy in America and elsewhere and that Putin and Trump are more alike than you may think. We discuss this fascinating new book with Fiona in a can't miss conversation. Join us.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
