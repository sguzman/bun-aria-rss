  "description": "On today's show, Pat welcomes in the former QB coach of Peyton Manning in Indianapolis, a man who has been coaching 40+ years, and the new Quarterbacks Coach for Tom Brady in Tampa Bay, Clyde Christensen. Pat and Clyde reconnect about his time in Indianapolis and what it was really like coaching Peyton Manning, he gives a couple of stories regarding Peyton Manning and Tom Brady spending time together that have never been heard before, talks about Tom Brady adapting to Bruce Arians' system, and chats about his time with Jameis Winston and how he thinks he'll bounce back stronger than ever (4:04-34:20). Next, on another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ welcome Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, AJ's former teammate in Green Bay, and 10 year NFL veteran, TJ Lang. The guys discuss what it's like trying to create an opportunity for yourself in the NFL as an offensive lineman and the moment TJ really had to make a decision in order to become great. TJ also chats about his recent burials on Twitter, what his time in Detroit with the Lions was like after leaving the Packers and his thoughts on Matt Patricia. TJ and AJ also tell Pat about what it was like hearing a pregame speech from Mike McCarthy and how it always got them ready to run through a wall, and everything else you could imagine in an incredible conversation (34:22-1:42:04). To close out the show, Pro Bowler and 2x Super Bowl Champion, Damien Woody FaceTimes in. Pat and Damien chat about his thoughts on Tom Brady going to Tampa Bay, what it was like being a teammate of Tom Brady, why he thinks Cam Newton hasn't been picked up by anybody yet and who he thinks makes the most sense going after him, his entrance into the TikTok game, and what he thinks about the idea that certain teams may rescind free agent offers if they can find a player in the draft and aren't able to get a player in for a physical or see them due to the coronavirus (1:42:06-2:04:20). Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the opportunity to win some free merch, and as always, stay safe out there and try to enjoy the weekend as much as you possibly can. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
