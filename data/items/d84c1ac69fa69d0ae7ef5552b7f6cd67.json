  "description": "<p>In this note we construct augmentations of Chekanov-Eliashberg algebras of\ncertain high dimensional Legendrian submanifolds that are not induced by exact\nLagrangian fillings. The obstructions to the existence of exact Lagrangian\nfillings that we use are Seidel's isomorphism and the injectivity of a certain\nalgebraic map between the corresponding augmentation varieties proven by Gao\nand Rutherford. To the best of the author's knowledge, these are the first high\ndimensional examples of this type.\n</p>",
