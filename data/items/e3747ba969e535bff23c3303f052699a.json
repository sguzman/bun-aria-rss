And when children learn to nurture we as a society collectively embrace our better nature.”</p><p>Stephen Ritz</p><br><p>Insurgent educator Stephen Ritz&nbsp;is truly one of the most inspiring game changers I have ever met. A South Bronx elementary school teacher and administrator, he has faced and overcome tremendous bureaucratic, political, and socio-economic odds to catapult generations of young, underprivileged at-risk students to unimaginable academic success and upwardly mobile employment — all while simultaneously reclaiming and rebuilding the Bronx from the inside out.</p><p>The modality leveraged to serve this end? Food. Specifically, growing food.</p><p>The personification of triple bottom line values and a staunch advocate of project-based, experiential learning, it all began when Stephen accidentally began growing plants in his classroom. The unexpected result was a level of student engagement even this maverick educator could not have predicted.&nbsp;So&nbsp;what began by fluke soon became Stephen's passion. It wasn't long before his Bronx classroom featured the first indoor edible wall in the entire New York City Department of Education — a wall that routinely generates enough produce to feed healthy meals to 450 students while also training the youngest nationally certified workforce in America.</p><p>Stephen's classroom farm would soon expand, both in the classroom and out, spreading across a community in desperate need for healthy food options. Under his spirited leadership and the tireless efforts of his student and community growers, vacant lots and rooftops across the Bronx — fairly characterized as an urban food desert — have been literally transformed, now boasting bountiful gardens that have produced&nbsp;more than 30,000 pounds of vegetables. Food that feeds his students and the greater borough at large.</p><p>In the Bronx public school system, student attendance and graduation rates are historically abysmal. But Stephen's passion and engagement with his students resulted in attendance skyrocketing from a mere&nbsp;40 percent to 93 percent daily. Not to mention it&nbsp;helped create 2,200 youth jobs. And now he is committed to building the first ever independently financed <a href=\"http://greenbronxmachine.org/the-national-health-and-wellness-center-at-ps-55/\" target=\"_blank\">National Health, Wellness and Biodiversity Center</a> in a 100+ year old reclaimed Bronx public school library.</p><p>The staggering success of Stephen's non-traditional teaching methods have captured the world's attention. His work has been featured in&nbsp;Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, ABC, CNN, NBC, NPR and beyond. Accolades include being one of three Americans&nbsp;named a 2015 Top Ten Finalist for the prestigious <a href=\"http://www.globalteacherprize.org/top-10-finalist/stephen-ritz\" target=\"_blank\">Global Teacher Prize</a>– teaching's Nobel Prize.
