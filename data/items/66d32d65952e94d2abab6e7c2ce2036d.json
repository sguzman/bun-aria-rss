  "description": "Jase and Phil are joined by Jep Robertson in the studio to discuss the bigness of God and to ask why Jesus really had to die. Zach discusses the movie being filmed about Phil's life and his hopes that people will look at Phil and realize that you can never be too far gone to be saved by God. Jase and Jep exult in how no sin can outweigh the infinite blood of Christ. Jase examines the problem of pouring new wine into old wineskins. Zach tells the story of a friend of his who was a heroin addict who felt he needed to get his life straight before he decided to follow Jesus Christ, in order to be worthy of the calling. Phil explains how God is the one who sanctifies us, not that we practice the process of sanctification in order to be saved.\n\nGet \"Your Daily Phil: 100 Days of Truth and Freedom to Heal America's Soul\" by Phil Robertson, available now: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400235936\n\nWatch the Unashamed overtime show, only on BlazeTV: https://BlazeTV.com/Unashamed\n\nVisit https://AHS.com/PHIL and get $50 off any plan\n\nVisit https://OmegaXL.com/PHIL and buy one bottle and get a second bottle free\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
