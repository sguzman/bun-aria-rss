  "description": "<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, OP resists joining his neighborhood HOA. The HOA eventually tricks OP into joining under false pretenses, and then starts billing OP for a huge amount of money. However, the HOA screwed up OP's contract, which left him with all of the power. He went to his lawyer and discovered that he absolutely had the HOA by the balls. They had to do whatever he said, and there was nothing they could do to stop him. He embarrassed the HOA so badly the the HOA president moved out of the country LOL!</p>\n",
