  "description": "<p>Danish and Oneill met me at my AirBnB in Echo Park while I was in town to shoot This Is Not Happening season 2 (new episodes February 24 at 12:30am) to do an interview about Ari Shaffir. Ari Shaffir is the host of a semi popular comedy podcast called Ari Shaffir's Skeptic Tank. This is the first interview we did and I'm airing it second because so many people wanted me to release it. It takes us from the birth of Ari until his birth as a comedian. It leaves off where episode 250 picks up. So enjoy this interview with the guy on this podcast who never gets asked any questions. It's the first time I don't have to butt in to get my point across. </p>",
