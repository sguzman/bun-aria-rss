  "title": "Ep. 801 - The Media Spins Its Most Absurd False Narrative Yet",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media specializes in spinning false narratives. But the narrative they’ve concocted about border patrol agents on horseback whipping and lassoing Haitian immigrants is perhaps the most absurd yet. We’ll discuss today. Also, speaking of those illegals, shouldn’t we be treating the immigrant invasion as a biological terror threat, given that none of them are masked or vaccinated? We treat unvaccinated American citizens that way, after all. Plus, Australia descends further and further into fascism. Is it a preview of things to come in this country? And Facebook conducts its own research and discovers that social media is deeply harmful to kids. It then did the responsible and ethical thing and immediately swept those findings under the rug. We’ll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \nYou petitioned, and we heard you.
