  "description": "<p>In this episode of Inside Trader Joe’s, we’re bringing you more information about how we’re responding to Covid-19, both in our stores and throughout our supply chain. The activity in our stores has been constantly evolving over the last few months, from packed aisles to social-distancing. So, too, has the volume of products flowing in and out of our stores. We’ll talk about how that in-store activity has impacted our supply chain, and how we’ve continued – and even strengthened – our commitment to being a good neighbor, through our longstanding Neighborhood Shares program.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/pdfs/transcript-pdfs/InsideTJs-Episode25-Transcript.pdf\"> Transcript (PDF)</a></p>",
