  "link": "https://news.bloombergtax.com/podcasts/uncommon-law",
  "description": "Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's trial has been a two-week whirlwind of emotional witness testimony so far, including police department officials, bystanders, medical experts, and an overwhelming amount of video evidence.Opening statements from the prosecution used a viral video of Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes before his death to convince jurors that the killing was murder, while defense attorney Eric Nelson said the videos did not tell the full story. Witnesses as young as nine years old were called to the stand alongside expert witnesses, including doctors and a pulmonologist.\nThe chief of the Minneapolis Police Department opened the second week of the trial with his testimony, saying that the tactic used by Chauvin to restrain Floyd, pressing his knee into his neck, did not follow police policy.\n“I absolutely agree that violates our policy,” testified Chief Medaria Arradondo at Chauvin’s trial.\nNeedless to say, a lot has happened in the courtroom, but we are still likely weeks away from a verdict. In this episode of [Un]Common Law, host Adam Allington and Bloomberg Government's Adam Taylor retrace some of the key moments from the first two weeks of Chauvin's trial.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
