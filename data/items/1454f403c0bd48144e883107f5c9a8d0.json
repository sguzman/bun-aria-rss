  "description": "<p>40-year-old Ingrid Lyne, a mother of three, disappears after a date to a professional baseball game. Her date, 37-year-old John Charlton, tells police he was too drunk the night before to remember what happened. Lyne's partial remains were found in a recycling bin miles away from her home. Investigators believe Lyne was killed in her own home, and dismembered in the bathtub with a 15-inch pruning saw. Human flesh and blood were found in the bathtub drain. An investigation finds that Charlton has a criminal history in six states and that his parents had taken out a restraining order against him. Today on Body Bags, forensics expert and former death scene investigator Joseph Scott Morgan looks at what it would take to go through with this type of grisly crime.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
