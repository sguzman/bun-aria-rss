  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, today the Trump administration released the greatest employment numbers our economy has seen in half a century. This shows that capitalism is the most humane system. President Trump did exactly the opposite of what Nancy Pelosi would have. The people either love the American spirit or you don't. Adam Schiff is a fascistic uncivil un-libertarian who is abusing his power to go after 3,500 phone records. However, the media spins the truth saying the White House is not willing to participate in the process. Even though the White House has not been able to interview their own witnesses, there's been no semblance of due process, and no ability to effectively defend himself. Then, the public is turning against CNN, their cable TV ratings are abysmal because they have lost their way. Later, Joe Biden may face impeachment if he ever wins the presidency. In fact, it's likely that the next Democrat elected to the White House will be impeached, because that's the precedent that Nancy Pelosi has set.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
