/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The key word here is &#8216;the plumbing around it&#8217;. I think looking back at the whole &#8216;big data&#8217; wave and the &#8216;Machine Learning&#8217; wave, is that there was a lot of vendor-driven hype around &#8216;technology&#8217;. As I wrote in <a href=\"https://peadarcoyle.com/2020/04/26/how-can-data-scientists-survive-layoffs/\">this post</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>biggest mistake teams make in ML is they don’t focus on getting something working end-to-end. They either go off and yak-shave a large infrastructure project, OR they build a complicated model without the infrastructure that’s needed for that model. When something is in production and can be shown to users it has a LOT of value – they can respond, and the model can improve. Get something into production. Not just a Jupyter notebook.</em></p><cite>Peadar Coyle</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I sometimes call this the <em>&#8216;hackers news&#8217; effect.</em> Which I&#8217;ve often found in teams. Where someone comes to me with &#8216;we want to use deep learning because Airbnb/Uber/Google/Stripe/Etc is using it&#8217;. They may explicitly say that or they may say different words but have that effect. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of any team is to <em>add value to the business</em>. So don&#8217;t call yourself a programmer or a data scientist. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve just spent near two years building out our pipelines for audio production at my <a href=\"http://www.aflorithmic.ai\">startup</a> and the resulting core value in terms of business value is rarely the ML side. This isn&#8217;t to say that ML isn&#8217;t important, but it&#8217;s a small part of the puzzle. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Algorithms are just cogs in a system</li><li>Algorithms are dumb and are often optimising for a specific use case</li><li>Algorithms live in a mess</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the core lessons?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most ML systems live as part of an end-to-end system. In the case of our audio production system. There&#8217;s the following rough parts</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A UI for writing text and annotation</li><li>Data collection and automatic transcription of audio for training jobs</li><li>ML models for synthetic voice</li><li>cron jobs for copying wav files and mp3 files from system to system</li><li>A business rules engine for quality insurance</li><li>Audio post production process</li><li>An asset store for storing assets and delivering them via an API</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these are connected via batch processes and API calls and various cron jobs. And testing this stuff end to end is tricky and involves a lot of nuance/ understanding of a domain specific problem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ML is just <strong>one part</strong> of a much larger system. It&#8217;s frankly a messy process, and it can often be very difficult to figure out what&#8217;s broken. However, in terms of leverage &#8211; our leverage is often on the <strong>automation side</strong>. Improving the reliability of our software allows us to onboard more clients, not to mention offer more product features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s an element of human-in-the-loop here as well. Especially for focusing on edge-cases. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what should you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Focus on understanding business problems, if you can reason about business and talk in trade offs &#8211; you&#8217;ll always have a job.</li><li>Learn to sell your work as a data scientist &#8211; you need to be able to communicate results</li><li>Work on your software skills &#8211; learn stuff like React, Vue, Serverless etc &#8211; so you can show results end to end</li><li>See yourself as a problem solver.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re probably seeing a bit of pushback against AI/ML etc. However, we shouldn&#8217;t neglect that we are seeing process improvements and enhancements in productivity. However, these are often due to automation and the interaction of humans with algorithms as opposed to anything else. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Further reading</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/\">Don&#8217;t call yourself a programmer</a> <br><a href=\"https://koaning.io/posts/the-future-is-past/\">The future of Data Science is past</a></p>\n",
