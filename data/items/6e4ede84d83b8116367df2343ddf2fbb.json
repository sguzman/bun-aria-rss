It is the best window into Piketty's thinking to date in part because it is, unlike his previous books, mercifully short (244 pages, not counting the appendix).<p></p><p>Of course, Piketty's thinking is very different from mine. Words like supply, demand, comparative advantage, and the mutual gains from trade are almost entirely absent from his book. Instead, we hear a lot about political power and exploitation of the weak by the strong. In Piketty's worldview, the standard undergraduate textbook in economics is largely a <i>non sequitur</i>. So is Adam Smith's <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>.</p><p>This new book purports to summarize the key points of the massive volumes that Piketty has previously written. What I found most interesting, therefore, was what was not included. Piketty does not mention \"the central contradiction of capitalism,\" to use the phrase from his book <i>Capital in the 21st Century</i>. In that earlier book, we were told that r&gt;g leads to an \"endless inegalitarian spiral.\" For reasons I explained <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mankiw/files/yes_r_g_so_what.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, I always thought that this claim was absurd.</p><p>Why is this major theme from the earlier book omitted in this new one? Has Piketty tacitly recanted? It is hard to say.</p>",
