  "title": "PMS 2.0 710 - Logan Paul, Feel The Beat With Matt \"Money\" Smith, Sal Capaccio, & Matt Schneidman, Plus Kyle Brandt, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys chat more about the Stephen Ross situation in Miami, and whether or not the NFL will appeal Judge Sue Robinson's decision to suspend Deshaun Watson for 6 games, and the opportunity he has to turn babyface for maybe the first and last time in his tenure as Commissioner. Joining the progrum is WWE Superstar, Boxer, and internet legend, Logan Paul, to chat about his career up until this point, when he started to realize what he was doing business wise, competing in the WWE and why it seems like he was always destined to do this, getting back in the boxing ring and who he might be facing next, and more (21:31-34:03). Later, for the second week in a row, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys feel the beat from around the NFL as they get reports from training camp from the Chargers with Matt \"Money\" Smith (52:04-1:02:28), Sal Capaccio from Bills camp (1:02:29-1:13:12), and Matt Schneidman from Packers camp (1:13:28-1:23:11). Later, co-host of Good Morning Football, electric factory and friend of the show, Kyle Brandt joins the progrum to chat about his new show with Omaha productions, his relationship with Jim Rome, what type of high school and college football player he was, how he continues to have the energy to do Good Morning Football that early in the morning, his workout regimen and whether he'd entertain doing \"The Challenge\" on MTV, and more (1:23:13-1:48:02). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show, and listen on Sirius XM Channel 82, Mad Dog Radio.
