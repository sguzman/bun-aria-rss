  "description": "This week, the gals bury themselves in a whole new paranoia. Topics include a very shocking funeral service, a pair of especially stupid homicidal pals, and the true (and terrifying) weight of dirt. Bust open a bottle of La Garrocha Amontillado, tie on your bell strings, take shallow breaths, and tune in for Buried Alive.",
