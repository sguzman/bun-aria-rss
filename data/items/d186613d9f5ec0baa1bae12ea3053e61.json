We can only go up from here!  Right…right? [Insert Anakin & Padme meme].  Then it’s on to the sci-fi thriller, ‘Prospect’, featuring First Run Favorite, Pedro Pascal.  He’s a not-so-nice guy that ends up teamed with a young woman as they try and find their way home.  In space.  There’s the rundown of the big releases in Physical Media, featuring the Streaming and Straight to DVD Picks of the Week.  Then the show closes with Matt and Chris sharing their picks for the 5 Worst Movie Dads in honor of this past week’s Father’s day.  And also the fact that both films this week have some weird things to say about families.  So we’ve got that going for us, I guess. \n\n00:00-11:25: Intro/The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard\n11:26-25:30: Physical Media Picks\n25:31-37:20: Prospect\n37:21-54:30: 5 Worst Movie Dads\n54:31-57:02: Wrap Up\n\nTheme music by Jamal Malachi Ford-Bey",
