  "description": "<div>The United Nations World Happiness Report is out, and it says the United States is still behind the world’s happiest countries. Can we learn anything from them, or does America’s diversity mean perpetual conflict? Then, pastor and author Mandy Smith says Western culture has warped our understanding of what it means to be a Christian by focusing too much on knowledge and power. The antidote? Embracing Jesus’ call to childlike faith. Also this week—covid skeptics have some explaining to do because last year life expectancy in the US dropped the most since WWII—and it wasn’t because of murder hornets. Plus, a woman sues McDonald’s for tempting her to break her Lenten fast.</div> <div><strong> </strong></div> <div><strong>News Segment:</strong></div> <div> </div> <div>Woman sues McDonald’s after burger ad compelled her to break Lent fast [2:55]<br /> <a class=\"gmail-c-link\" href= \"https://nypost.com/2021/08/06/woman-sues-mcdonalds-after-burger-ad-made-her-break-her-lent-fast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\">https://nypost.com/2021/08/06/woman-sues-mcdonalds-after-burger-ad-made-her-break-her-lent-fast/</a></div> <div> </div> <div>COVID-19 caused U.S. life expectancy to drop 1.5 years [09:38]<br /> <a class=\"gmail-c-link\" href= \"https://time.com/6082192/covid-19-us-life-expectancy-drop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\">https://time.com/6082192/covid-19-us-life-expectancy-drop/</a></div> <div> </div> <div>White evangelical COVID-19 vaccine acceptance has jumped 11 points since March [09:38]<br /> <a class=\"gmail-c-link\" href= \"https://www.relevantmagazine.com/current/nation/study-white-evangelical-covid-19-vaccine-acceptance-has-jumped-11-points-since-march/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.relevantmagazine.com/current/nation/study-white-evangelical-covid-19-vaccine-acceptance-has-jumped-11-points-since-march/</a></div> <div> </div> <div>UN report on global happiness [21:47]<br /> <a class=\"gmail-c-link\" href= \"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/03/21/americans-are-unhappiest-theyve-ever-been-un-report-finds-an-epidemic-addictions-could-be-blame/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/03/21/americans-are-unhappiest-theyve-ever-been-un-report-finds-an-epidemic-addictions-could-be-blame/</a></div> <div><a class=\"gmail-c-link\" href= \"https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\">https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/</a></div> <div> </div> <div><strong><strong>Interview with Mandy Smith:</strong></strong> <p>Unfettered: Imagining a Childlike Faith beyond the Baggage of Western Culture - <a href= \"https://amzn.to/3nhS6o7\">https://amzn.to/3nhS6o7</a><span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> </div> <div> </div> <div>Interview Start [48:06]<br /> How is Western civilization in a tailspin?
