  "title": "2.6 Dreaming or Thinking: Cristina Rivera Garza with Kate Marshall and Dominique Vargas",
  "description": "ND stages a trialogue this week with MacArthur \"Genius\" Cristina Rivera Garza and Notre Dame critics Kate Marshall and Dominique Vargas. Professor Rivera Garza recalls roadtripping through Mexico in a bochito (a Volkswagen). For her, such drives became the mother of literary invention: there was no car radio and when family conversations died down, the window (and not an iPhone) became the screen that occupied her. In a more serious vein, CRG, Kate, and Dominique also discuss the role of linguistic mobility and translation in bringing Rivera Garza’s novels and essays to English-speaking audiences. CRG reflects on how books change when they cross languages and reminds us that the United States is the second largest Spanish-speaking country in the world. This episode productively estranges us from a number of received narratives about national monolingualism and experimental writing. Professor Rivera Garza rejects the notion of aesthetic individualism and the idealized image of the solitary writer. She declares that language always has plural roots and her work is underpinned by the belief that we only become individuals when community fails.\nMentioned in the Episode\n\nJuan Rulfo\n\nRosario Castellanos\n\nRamón López Velarde\n\nVirginia Woolf\n\nMarguerite Duras\n\nSuzanne Jill Levine & Aviva Kana, Translators of The Taiga Syndrome\n\nSarah Booker, Translator of Grieving: Dispatches from a Wounded Country\n\nTranscript available here.\nAarthi Vadde is Associate Professor of English at Duke University.
