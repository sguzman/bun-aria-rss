  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing the changes in actors cast in roles thought of as the 'heavy' and how their stature has changed over the years.  They then turn to the phones and speak to a caller who wants their thoughts on people who wear the wallet chain. They also speak with a caller who has concerns about the psychology surrounding the long term effects of masking children in schools and what the unforeseen byproducts may be. They also discuss the recent Andy Warhol documentary they both viewed and they offer their thoughts on how he was able to fit into a time that maybe wasn't ready for his art. As the show wraps up they speak to a caller who is wondering if Adam has any of the work he created from his time as a ceramics major in high school. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nGetRoman.com/ADS\nGeico.com\nMagbreakthrough.com/AdamDrew\nPluto.TV",
