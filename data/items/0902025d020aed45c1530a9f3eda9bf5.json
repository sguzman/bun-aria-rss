  "description": "The professional women's baseball team the Rockford Peaches were immortalized in the 1992 box office hit <em>A League Of Their Own</em>. Thirty years later, they're back in a new Amazon Prime series of the same name. Co-created by and starring <em>Broad City</em> alum Abbi Jacobson, the series showcases a new set of fictionalized characters, played by Chanté Adams, D'Arcy Carden, and more. While exploring queer themes and racial segregation, the show is a fresh take that both pays homage and stands on its own.",
