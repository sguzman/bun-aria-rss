  "description": "Contributor(s): Dr Jan Lucassen, Professor Sara Horrell | Jan Lucassen provides an inclusive history of humanity’s busy labour throughout the ages.

He examines how labor is split between men, women, and children; the watershed moment of the invention of money; the collective action of workers; and at the impact of migration, slavery, and the idea of leisure.",
