You turn your hosts into murderous psychopaths incapable of controlling their wrath and paranoia. You are ruthless, crafty, and devoted to survival at all costs. It's not the most glamorous job, but you do get to hang out in Alaska, which is pretty cool. Even cooler, you delivered that great scene where Mulder and Scully check each other's bodies for parasitic ice worms.
