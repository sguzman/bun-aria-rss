  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden signed the putrid, massive spending bill today known as the Inflation Reduction Act which will not ease inflation but add to it. This fractures the connection between the individual citizen and their government in a way that empowers the bureaucrats and weakens the people. This bill will add to the deficit and further hurt the struggling U.S energy industry. Biden will subsidize illegal immigration, the industry-crushing Green New Deal, and pitch this bill as a win for Democrats and a detriment for Republicans that voted against it. Then, the DOJ has admitted to an \"over-collection of evidence\" which is their admission to violating the Constitution. Former FBI Assistant Director Kevin Brock has gone on the record criticizing the FBI for operating outside the scope of the warrant and intentionally violating or disregarding Trump's 4th Amendment rights. Later, James O'Keefe calls in to discuss how a source within the U.S Department of Homeland Security reported to Project Veritas that government will list individuals that question the raid on Trump's home or the outcome of the 2020 election as Domestic Violent Extremists or DVEs. Project Veritas was also raided by the FBI last year for their journalism, that's something that has never happened in American history. Afterward, Donald Trump Jr. joins the show to discuss the unequal application of the law. Don Jr cited how the once great federal law enforcement in our country has been weaponized against the people. Don Jr blasted Merrick Garland for calling for transparency while sealing the warrant and hiding it from the public and using the media as a mouthpiece to deceive the public.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
