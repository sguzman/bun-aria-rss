  "description": "<p>It's time for a Friday Flight! These episodes are all about the week’s news and the effects of Covid-19 on your personal finances. There are a lot of headlines out there, but we are distilling it down to specific takeaways that will allow you to not just weather this health and financial crisis, but to come out on the other side even stronger. In this episode we cover some interesting and helpful stories like where you can find a literal diamond in the rough, some updates on a new stimulus bill, as well as an update to the original stimulus check, the effects of the election on investing, bad credit cards to stay away from, and our thoughts on the types of spending that will resume after we’re finished with ‘rona. After all of that, we have a chance to talk with Lindsey Bell of <a href=\"https://www.ally.com/howtomoney\">Ally Invest</a> about social responsible investing- it’s something we’re doing more of these days and Lindsey explains why it really makes a lot sense!
