  "description": "<p>Hey everybody! Hope you're all keeping sane as best you can out there. This week on Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony are joined by the LT himself, Justin Voithofer, for their newest addition to the \"Remastered/Rebooted/Remade\" Series: The Invasion of Normany on June 6, 1944 during World War II, more famously known as D-Day. Avery has trouble pronouncing Cotentin Peninsula, Tony keeps everybody laughing, Codie gets lost (connection-wise) a few times, and Justin wonders what he got himself into. Strap in for a hilarous ride with improved audio this time around. Enjoy!</p>",
