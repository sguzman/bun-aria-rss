  "description": "<p>Friday 6/15 - Fathers day is coming up, but did you hear about the \"Baby Daddy\" cards that Target got backlash from?? Well we opened up the phone lines to see if our listeners took offense to the cards. Also, our friend to the room Amanda Seales stopped by and spoke about her \"Smart Funny and Black\" Tour, having her own entities and more. Also Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to another crazy Florida man who called the police asking them to test his meth, cause he thinks he got a bad laced batch. Also, since it is flashback Friday we had Darius McCrary or better known as Eddie Winslow from Family Matters stop by, and he spoke about his comments on the \"Me Too\" movement, his relationship with Karrine Stephans better (super head) and more. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
