  "description": "<p>My whole life, I've wanted to violently beat anyone who chalks up shitty behavior to the phrase \"but what IS normal?\" Despite the psychological community's insistence that there is no norm, I think there is. If you've grown up in a dysfunctional home, you know for a fact there IS a \"normal\" and it probably involves not getting hammered and throwing plates of food at each other. In this episode I discuss the traits of adult children of Alcoholics - but I have a feeling you don't need a drunk Mommy or Daddy to relate to a lot of this stuff. Let's get deeeeeeep as fuck on it, bros. </p> <p> </p>\n",
