  "description": "When Tom Hiddleston’s Loki tells us to kneel, then, by God, we kneel! We can’t resist an evil British accent nor a man who knows how to cry. But what happens when a dreamboat drifts off course? In 2016 The Incident occurred, and Tom went from being a lovable slender snack to the ex we ignored on social media. Special guest Alanna Bennett, BuzzFeed TV and film writer, stops by the studio to help us figure our way back to Tom — that melodious voice, the puppy-dog earnestness, the smoldering passion of his characters. Sidenote: this week’s Fanfic Wars broke us both. \nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line!
