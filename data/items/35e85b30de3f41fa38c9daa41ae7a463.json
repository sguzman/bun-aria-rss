  "description": "<p>Meditation: Letting Life Live Through You(2016-06-29) - This meditation begins with quieting the mind and collecting attention with the breath. We then awaken the senses through a body scan, open to sound, and rest in open awareness, allowing sounds and sensations to move through. Like an ocean, when we rest in openness, it’s possible to open to the waves that most want attention, without grasping or resisting. This engaged presence is the very essence of freedom, of inhabiting a wholeness of being.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <a href=\"http://www.tarabrach.com/donation/\" target= \"_blank\">www.tarabrach.com/donation/</a>.</p> <p>With gratitude and love, Tara</p> <p> </p>",
