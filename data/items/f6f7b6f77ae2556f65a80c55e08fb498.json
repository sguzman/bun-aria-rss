  "description": "<p>The detection of benzonitrile (C6H5CN), 1- and 2-cyano-naphthalene (C10H7CN)\nin the cold, dark molecular cloud TMC-1 at centimetre (cm) wavelengths has\nopened up prospects for the detection of other N- and CN-containing polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this light, the pure rotational spectra of\nN-pyrene (C15H9N), CN-pyrene (C15H9CN), N-coronene (C23H11N) and CN-coronene\n(C23H11CN) are reported here for the first time. The B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level\nof theory, in the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, achieves the\nbest performance for calculating the spectroscopic parameters and simulating\nthe rotational spectra. The large permanent dipole moment of CN-PAHs makes them\nthe most suitable PAH species for detection in the interstellar medium.\nAdditionally, pyrene's smaller partition function makes CN-pyrene a prime\ncandidate to be discovered in cold, dark molecular clouds such as the TMC-1.\nThe present work sets a benchmark for theoretical rotational spectra of N- and\nCN-containing PAHs and may act as a guide for laboratory experiments and\nobservational searches.\n</p>",
