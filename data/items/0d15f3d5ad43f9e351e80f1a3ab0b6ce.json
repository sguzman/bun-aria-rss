  "description": "<p>The Fyre Festival was the defining scam of the millennial generation. Marketing for the 2017 music event went viral with the help of rapper Ja Rule, instagram stars, and models, but wound up being an epic failure as it stranded thousands of people in the Bahamas. <strong>Featuring an exclusive interview with Billy McFarland</strong>, the convicted con-man behind the festival, FYRE FRAUD is a true-crime comedy documentary bolstered by a cast of whistleblowers, victims, and insiders. And we have LOTS of feelings about it. </p>\n\n\n<p><strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Binge our 40+ bonus episodes via Patreon!</a> When you join our <strong>Patreon fam</strong>, you not only support us, you also <strong>INSTANTLY get our entire catalog of bonus episodes</strong>, including our episode-by-episode coverage of \"<strong>SERIAL,\" \"THE JINX,\" \"THE STAIRCASE,\" and \"MAKING A MURDERER.\"</strong> You also get our <strong>interviews</strong> with Asia McClain (Adnan Syed's alibi witness), Rabia Chaudry, \"Tower\" director Keith Maitland, all of our mini-episodes, extended outtakes, AND full bonus episodes covering \"Madonna: Truth or Dare\" and \"The Queen of Versailles.\" <strong>AND IT'S ALL COMMERCIAL FREE!</strong> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Join here!</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>WANT TO SEE US LIVE?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.truecrimeobsessed.com/see-us-live\">Go Here</a> for information and tickets to our upcoming live events like our February live shows or our <a href=\"https://www.ticketcentral.com/online/default.asp?doWork%3A%3AWScontent%3A%3AloadArticle=Load&BOparam%3A%3AWScontent%3A%3AloadArticle%3A%3Aarticle_id=A74DEEBB-2C77-46E7-AF9E-71AAC002452B&BOparam%3A%3AWScontent%3A%3AloadArticle%3A%3Apromocode_access_code=TCOPRIDE\">Pride show in June!</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>LOOKING FOR OUR ADVERTISERS / PROMO CODES?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.truecrimeobsessed.com/get-our-promo-codes\">Go Here!</a> We now have a whole page of our site for you to check out and <a href=\"https://www.truecrimeobsessed.com/get-our-promo-codes\">GET.
