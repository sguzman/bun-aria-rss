  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, Hillary Clinton compared Trump rallies to Hitler rallies. President Biden called MAGA Republicans a threat to democracy. Republicans. Not the party of Jim Crow, not the party of lynching, or the party of racially motivated riots, but the Democrats are calling republicans Hitler supporters, and this will be parroted by the media and become acceptable speech to the consumers of fake news. Then, Joe Kennedy was supportive of Hitler and the Democrat Party has a history of being an evil racist political party. Biden is using tried and tested tactics of totalitarians and repeating them. Their goal is to think for you so that you simply abide. Later, Biden probably won’t not seek reelection and doesn't care who wins the next election. Therefore, he is politicizing the government, spending trillions, and signing executive orders like no other president in modern history. He acts without legislation or regard for the American people. Afterward, Missouri AG Eric Schmitt calls in to discuss his race for the US Senate. Schmitt emphasized how important it is to win this senate seat because elitist Democrats are trying to pack the court, remove the filibuster, and ram whatever legislation they want straight through Congress with no debate. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
