  "description": "<p>In this article, we give the classification of normal del Pezzo surfaces of\nrank one with at most log canonical singularities containing the affine plane\ndefined over an algebraically non-closed field of characteristic zero. As an\napplication, we have a criterion for del Pezzo fibrations with canonical\nsingularities whose generic fibers are not smooth to contain vertical\n$\\mathbb{A}^2$-cylinders.\n</p>",
