  "description": "<p>Experts call it “estrogen pollution”. We are living in an era where we are bombarded with estrogenic compounds, and the health effects are extremely disturbing.</p> <p>This is a problem for all of us. Both men and women have estrogen receptors. These receptors are present throughout our entire bodies, from our brains to our reproductive organs. If your body is in balance, then you are producing the correct amount of estrogen endogenously (within yourself) and it’s fitting nice and snug into those receptor sites and life is good.</p> <p>The problem is, our exposure to xenoestrogens (foreign estrogens from outside of yourself) are at an all-time high today. These xenoestrogens can fit right into the receptor sites for estrogen in your body and “turn on” programs that more estrogen will encourage.</p> <p>For men this could mean lowered sex drive, accumulation of fat on the butt and hips, gynecomastia (man-boobs), shrinking of the reproductive organs, and many other red alerts.</p> <p>For women this could lead to <em>estrogen dominance</em> which encourages cancers of the breasts, ovaries, and other reproductive organs, fibroid tumors, depression, decreased sex drive, and very difficult to get-rid-of body fat.<span id=\"more-5254\"></span></p> <p>How is all of this possible with just one hormone being off? Well, it’s because your hormones control EVERYTHING about your physiology and how every cell in your body communicates with each other.
