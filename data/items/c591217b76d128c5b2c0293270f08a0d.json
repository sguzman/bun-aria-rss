  "description": "On the Best of Mark Levin, the DOJ seeks more than 130 new attorneys to prosecute more January 6th cases. Most of these charges are for trespassing on public land but carry charges that are more severe and carry stiffer penalties for those that don't take the government's plea deals. One such matter is the latest false claim against top Trump staffer Dan Scavino for potentially having advanced knowledge of the Capitol attack. Then, the federal government is using extra-constitutional parallel path like a handpicked congressional committee and overreaching subpoenas to circumvent the DOJ's legal limitations in order to get information they otherwise could not get. Biden and the Democrats are skirting the legal system by using Congress as the investigative arm of the Department of Justice and cherry-picking what they leak to the media. Democrats have been pushing the lie that the Russians elected Donald Trump in 2016 for years. This was the worst abuse in modern American history but for the subsequent abuses from Democrats toward the sitting President. Those who hate liberty are using the Constitution in order to destroy the Constitution. Then, Ketanji Brown Jackson dodged the question of defining a woman is because she intends to help Democrats redefine the legal definition of what a woman is in future supreme court cases on women's sports and transgender school cases. This activist Judge is a happy progressive warrior. Later, wheat shortages in Russia and Ukraine will not impact the U.S, but President Biden's energy and economic policies are doing plenty of damage. Rising gas prices and inflation are driving up the cost of American goods. Biden is the cause of food shortages in America, not Putin.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
