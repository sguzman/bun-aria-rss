  "description": "Eric's wife, Kay, asked if her best friend could move in for a bit because she needed a place to stay.  He was fine with it but now things are getting weird.  He noticed that Kay and her best friend, Ivy, cuddle on the couch together, Kay keeps the fridge stocked with Ivy's favorite food, they go to the bathroom together, and a few other things.  So now Eric is wondering if something's going on and if they might be MORE than just friends.",
