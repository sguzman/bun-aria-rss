  "description": "As you go through your life's journey, you will be presented with opportunities to work with, invest in, and support others. It is a Biblical standard for you to teach others what you know. However, there is a right way and a wrong way to share your knowledge and wisdom with others.\n In this episode, the guys discuss how to be strategic in providing information to others while planting the seeds, allowing you to control your life. They share words of wisdom and caution such as:\n  Don't throw pearls before swine. By all means, help people develop but, don't just give stuff away. People respect what they have to earn. When they don't earn it, they don't value it as much.\n Make sure when you're negotiating with others that the outcome is win-win.\n  Listener Perks\n  Organifi is giving our listeners up to 20% off of their order!
