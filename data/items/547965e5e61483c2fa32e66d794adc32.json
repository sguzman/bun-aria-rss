The event is sold out. Vlastelica, a former Fox Sports digital executive vice president, talks about the growth of esports, the younger demographic that follows the genre, and how traditional sports league owners like the New York Mets, Kraft Sports Group and billionaire Stan Kroenke are investing in the property. Vlastelica also talks about his league's plan to move its teams to their host cities beginning next season, creating what he says is the first truly global sports league where clubs from across the globe face each other regularly. He also talks about the company's approach to shooter games, and the plan to keep Overwatch relevant for years to come. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
