Mix to combine.</p> <p>- Add water and mix to combine. Then, knead dough on low speed for 10 minutes. The mixture should come together into a unified mass that barely sticks to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads. If dough sticks, add flour 1 tablespoon at a time to the mixer while it is running, until the mass barely sticks to the bowl. If the mixture is too dry, add water 1 tablespoon at a time to the running mixer.</p> <p>- Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. It can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.</p> <p>- When ready to make pizza, transfer dough to a floured work surface.</p> <p>- Divide dough into four even sections.</p> <p>- Coat four small containers or bowls with nonstick cooking spray or olive oil.</p> <p>- With floured hands, form each section into a ball. Place one dough ball into each coated container or bowl. Lightly spray the top of each dough ball with nonstick cooking spray or coat with olive oil.</p> <p>- Cover each container or bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Each dough ball should double in volume. Make the Sauce</p> <p>- Make the sauce by either pushing the tomatoes through a food mill or simply pulsing them in a food processor until a chunky liquid is formed.</p> <p>- Heat oven to at least 475 F, higher if your oven allows. If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat as well.</p> <p>- Assemble the Pizzas</p> <p>- Onto a well-floured surface, stretch out each ball into a 10-inch circle. Use a floured rolling pin if you need it. Don’t worry about the dough being a perfect circle!</p> <p>- Place one dough ball onto a lightly floured pizza peel, shake gently to ensure that the dough is not sticking.</p> <p>- Spread about 1/3 cup of sauce over the dough, leaving about a 1/2- inch edge unsauced.</p> <p>- Top the sauce with a quarter of the mozzarella slices. Tear a few basil leaves on top (according to your liking) and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. You can also add the basil and olive oil after the pizza is cooked.</p> <p>- Transfer pizza from peel to the hot stone and bake about 5 to 7 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and crust is charred in places.</p> <p>- Repeat with remaining dough balls and ingredients.</p>",
