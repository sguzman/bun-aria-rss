  "description": "<p>Most of the UK went to the polls last week, and the vote in Northern Ireland was perhaps particularly significant. Next year will mark 25 years since the 1998 Belfast or Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland after nearly 30 years of conflict. The power-sharing arrangements established by the Agreement have brought many successes, but they are teetering on the edge of collapse. Whether a new Executive can be formed following last week’s elections is far from clear, but the consequences of failure could be severe.</p><p>So can power-sharing be restored? If so, how? And how might Northern Ireland move beyond repeated collapses of devolved government and find a more stable political footing? </p><p>To explore these questions, UCL Uncovering Politics is joined by <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/about-us/people/alan-whysall\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Whysall</a>, Honorary Senior Research Associate at the UCL Constitution Unit, and by <a href=\"https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=tanname\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Etain Tannam</a>, Associate Professor of International Peace Studies at Trinity College Dublin. </p><p><strong>Mentioned in this episode:</strong></p><ul><li>A.
