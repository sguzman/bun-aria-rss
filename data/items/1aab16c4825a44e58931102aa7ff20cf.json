Won't work otherwise.**\n\nI've talked about Audacity briefly before.\n\nI use it religiously in my own language learning and it's got a lot of uses. One of which is track labeling and converting those track labels to subtitles.\n\nLike this style of video? Let me know in the comment section and I'll do more just like it.",
