  "description": "<p>Caroline Stansbury assaults another cast member with her unicorn hump and all hell breaks loose. Juliet might not be invited to har parties now. The class on display in Ladies of London can only be followed by our favorite show about maids, of course. Alex P Keaton yells about his power while everyone else gets naked and covered in carbs.
