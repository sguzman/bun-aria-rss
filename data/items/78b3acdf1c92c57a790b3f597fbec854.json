  "description": "<p>Bob Garrett returns to share his <a href= \"http://sasquatchmountain.wordpress.com/?s=Scary+night+on+the+lone+star+trail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scary night on The Lone Star Trail</a>. \"There came a smell on the wind that we knew well. We had smelled it many times. We had a Sasquatch near by. I could hear some moving around behind the camp. It was coming closer to us! But that was ok, we had this happen before. There was a row of eight to ten inches round pines right next to my right side. Those pines began to shake as something was coming through them right at me! The screams were making my ears ring. I saw huge hands coming right for my head and so I dropped to one knee and put my shotgun in this enraged Sasquatches middle. I was about to shoot this thing, but it backed off quickly\"  </p>",
