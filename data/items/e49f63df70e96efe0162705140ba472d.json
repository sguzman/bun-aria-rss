  "description": "<p>This specific episode was cited in <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/podcasts/lolita-podcast-12-28-20\">The New Yorker this week</a>, so we’re giving it an encore refresh with bonus material and a 2020 update from Dr. Esposito herself!</p>\n<p>Scorpions: the victims of undue shade. If you've ever wanted to impress a date with weird facts THIS IS THE EPISODE FOR YOU. A handful of people on planet Earth have a PhD in scorpions and Dr. Lauren Esposito is one of them. She spills the beans on how venom works, what's up with the blacklight glow effect, how dangerous they *really* are, what all the movies get wrong, the best names for scorpions, where she's traveled to look under rocks, where a scorpion's butt is, if scorpions dance or make out (SPOILER: YES), what good mothers they are, how big they used to be millions of years ago and how -- technically speaking -- they are not poisonous. Also: how much does a gallon of venom cost? Oh, and why she started the visibility campaign 500 Queer Scientists.
