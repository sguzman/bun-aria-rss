  "description": "“Life is a game. There’s no way to understand the human world without first understanding this. Everyone alive is playing a game whose hidden rules are built into us and that silently directs our thoughts, beliefs and actions. This game is inside us. It is us. We can’t help but play.”\nSo begins “The Status Game,” a new book by acclaimed writer Will Storr.\nHe continues: “We play for status, if only subtly, with every social interaction, every contribution we make to work, love or family life and every internet post. We play with how we dress, how we speak and what we believe. … Life is not a journey towards a perfect destination. It’s a game that never ends. And it’s the very worst of us.”\nDoes it have to be?\nWe may not be able to quit the status game, but Will says we can learn to play it better. In this episode, he explains how.\n---\nDownload The Next Big Idea app today at nextbigideaclub.com/app/",
