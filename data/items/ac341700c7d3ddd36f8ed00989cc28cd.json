  "description": "<p>This week we’re breaking down “Stress Relief”! To kick off this two-part episode, the ladies break down one of the most famous cold opens of “The Office”, featuring clips from Rainn Wilson, Oscar Nuñez, Brian Baumgartner and cinematographer, Randall Einhorn. When Dwight stages a fake fire, Stanley has a heart attack and Michael goes into overdrive to protect Stanley. The ladies reveal how much went into this episode that premiered right after SuperBowl XLIII, which includes Angela walking us through everything that went behind “Save Bandit!”. Jenna points out the use of a montage that was unusual for the show and we rock out to the Bee Gee's “Stayin' Alive”, which giving CPR to its beat actually saves lives. So keep away from Michael so you can be stress free and relaxed while you listen to this very epic episode.</p>\n",
