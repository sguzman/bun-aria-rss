    "media:description": "Stokes' Theorem is the crown jewel of differential geometry. It extends the fundamental theorem of Calculus to manifolds in n-dimensional space.\n\n---\n\nThis video aims to give an intuitive discussion of Stokes' Theorem, without the complicated equations and formalism. For those interested in the details, here's a thorough treatment of the topic: \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07862\n\n(Be warned, this rabbit hole goes very deep!)\n\n---\n\nFollow me!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/00aleph00\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/00aleph00\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/00aleph00\n\n__\n\nPictures:\n\nBoundary and Green's Theorem - \"Calculus: Early Transcendentals - 8th Edition\" by James Stewart \nExterior Derivative - \"A Geometric Approach to Differential Forms\" by David Bachman\n\nMusic:\n\nRelaxing Guitar Music - Acoustic - Calming Music for Stress Relief, Studying",
