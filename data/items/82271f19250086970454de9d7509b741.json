  "description": "<p>We are so excited to bring you a new series on Emotional Intelligence! In this series, John Maxwell references the book <em>Emotional Intelligence</em> by Daniel Goleman and shares five attributes of an emotionally intelligent leader. In this part of the series, John teaches the first two points and explains the importance of self-awareness and self-regulation.</p> <p>We’re also excited to bring back Chris Goede as the co-host for this series, along with Mark Cole, the CEO of The John Maxwell Enterprise. Chris and Mark emphasize the importance of self-awareness in relation to consistency. The less we know ourselves, the more we roleplay, causing us to behave inconsistently. But the more aware we are of ourselves, the more consistent we are with everyone.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Emotional Intelligence Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Emotion and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Intelligence-Matter-More-Than/dp/055338371X\"> <em>Emotional Intelligence</em> by Daniel Goleman</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://johnmaxwell.com/greatestreturn\"><em>The Leader’s Greatest Return</em> by John C.
