And because of that, I'm able to keep going and keep performing. But if I just tried to run in the red all the time, then I would stop having fun. I would not want to do it anymore, and I would give up.” [13:26]<br /><br />“As you figure out what that business is going to be that you're growing, make sure that it's something that you would love doing every day, even if you were failing.” [17:01]<br /><br />“Don't buy into a narrative that you need to run your own business or that you need to be an entrepreneur or anything like that. What you want to figure out is, where will you love existing? Where can you chase fulfillment the hardest? Where can you engage with your passions most deeply? That's the question.” [25:07]<br /><br />“If you can't say in a single sentence what really fills your tank, what gives you that energy, what makes you feel alive… if you can't say that in a single sentence, you're in trouble.” [26:42]",
