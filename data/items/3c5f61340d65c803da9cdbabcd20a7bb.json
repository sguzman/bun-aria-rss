  "description": "<p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 1:</p><p> </p><p>Clinton-Maxwell affair story a cover for Clinton involvement with underage Epstein girls. Media catches up with stories Rush covered yesterday. Rush overcomes low-grade fever, due to PhD in recluse and hermit. Looting in Minnesota. If you're triggered in America, you can go to Target and steal an air fryer. No worry from media about Minnesota rioters social distancing. No excuse for George Floyd's death, what's seen on the video is totally unjustified and should make everyone angry. Floyd died in a blue state, blue state governors sent citizens to die in nursing homes. What's going on with Biden? Rush cannot describe the anger he feels over Floyd death, sullies good cops all over the country, it's absolute disgrace. Caller's interesting take: Cops drunk with lockdown power. You can loot a business in Minneapolis, but you can't open one. Cuomo and Newsom hold national economy hostage.</p><p><br></p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p> </p><p>Latest audience model run shows 50 million listeners. Leaked FEMA coronavirus model projections didn't come true, projected 3K deaths a day, 200,000 new cases a day. Democrat Minneapolis mayor blames 400 years of racism. Bernie Kerik says Floyd arrest defies common sense. Dems think Biden will help them down ballot. Biden confuses D-Day, Pearl Harbor Day, Delaware Independence Day. The tech billionaires behind Biden. Defense attorney tries to defend cops in Floyd case. George Floyd did not deserve to lose his life.</p><p><br></p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p> </p><p>Frustration in Minneapolis is about much more than George Floyd's death. Drs. Fauci and Birx must be happy rioters and looters are wearing masks. Nurse to Rush: If your temperature reaches X, go straight to your casket. CBS news layoffs. Minneapolis city council. Zuckerberg: Facebook isn't the arbiter of truth, but they fact-check too. Michael Flynn legal defense fund.
