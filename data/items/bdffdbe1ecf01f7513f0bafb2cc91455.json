    "media:description": "In this video, I present Euler's proof that the solution to the Basel problem is pi^2/6. I discuss a surprising connection Euler discovered between a generalization of the Basel problem and the Bernoulli numbers, as well as his invention of the zeta function. I explain Euler's discovery of the connection between the zeta function and the prime numbers, and I discuss how Riemann's continuation of Euler's work led him to state the Riemann hypothesis, one of the most important conjectures in the entire history of mathematics.\n\nIf you would like to support the production of our content, we have a Patreon!
