  "description": "Thank you so much for coming for tuning in for another special episode of Tin Foil Hat with Sam Tripoli.  This episode is brought to you by the Ridge Wallet and RigidWallet.com (I had to record the read in a hallway so sorry it sounds so tingy!).  Today we welcome Occult expert Jay Dyer and comedian Allison Weber to discuss the connection between the military and intelligence agencies with Hollywood. We look into how much the famed counter culture of the 60's was actually counter and how much was controlled opposition.  Thank you so much for all of your support. <br />Please check out our friends at Ridgewallet.com and use the promo code \"TFH10\" for ten percent off.",
