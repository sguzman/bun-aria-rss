  "description": "<p>Living a life “on purpose” requires a healthy brain; so <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #13</strong> takes us to places we've never gone before on the show! In this fascinating hour-long chat, <strong>Dr. Andrew Hill</strong> joins us to discuss the newly emerging science of nootropics — supplements and functional foods that improve one or more aspects of mental function such as focus, memory, and motivation. We also talk about NeuroFeedback, a type of biofeedback that uses real-time displays of brain activity such as EEG to teach self-regulation of brain function, as well as neuroplasticity and much more!</p>\n<p>About: <strong>Andrew Hill</strong> is a UCLA graduate with a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from the department of Psychology, employed as a Lecturer at UCLA, teaching multidisciplinary courses on Healthy Brain Aging, Neuroscience topics, and Biofeedback. He has extensive experience working with clinical and research populations across many areas, including neurodevelopmental, inpatient and outpatient, and people working to overcome substance abuse challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hill</strong> received his PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from UCLA in 2012, studying how attention operates in the brain. He is currently lecturing for the Undergraduate Education Initiatives program at UCLA, teaching a course sequence gerontology, and the neuroscience of healthy brain aging. <strong>Dr. Hill</strong> has published chapters on measuring and modulating human attention, and continues to research self regulation. Prior to UCLA, Dr. Hill obtained extensive experience working with both psychiatric and developmental populations as well as gaining experience in high technology areas. He received his B.S. in Psychology/Neuroscience from UMass Amherst.</p>\n<p>To learn more about <strong>Dr. Hill's</strong> work, visit: <a href=\"http://www.alternativesbh.com\">http://www.alternativesbh.com</a> or <a href=\"https://trubrain.com\">https://trubrain.com</a>.</p>",
