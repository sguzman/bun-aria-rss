  "description": "With so much focus on scandal, corruption, nuclear war, racism, isolationism, protectionism, and nationalism in the era of Trump, we sometimes lose site of the little things.  Like the future.  Or the urgent problems we have to solve.  Or the truth.  On this episode of Deep State Radio Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks, IISS Deputy Director General Kori Schake and Vice President for the National Security Program at Third Way Mieke Eoyang debate the people, processes and mind-sets that are our problem and what to do about them.  And they defend the idea of objective truth, even visiting for a bit with most famous ever Bishop of Cloyne, George Berkeley.  Fun? Right?
