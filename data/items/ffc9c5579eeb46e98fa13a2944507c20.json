  "description": "<p>“To me, science is the rigorous attempt at understanding the world around you. And most people think that that means you're in a lab wearing a coat, working with test tubes. But I think that that's just a matter of using the scientific method in your everyday life. It's a matter of observing the world around you and being curious enough to ask questions and having the logic skills and some math and science skills to find the answers to those questions. But it goes beyond physics and chemistry. It goes beyond math. It goes beyond psychology and sociology, the social sciences.” Dr. Moiya McTier delivers a very fun and somewhat surprising look at our universe in her debut, <a href= \"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-milky-way-moiya-mctier/1140658096?ean=9781538754153\"><em>The Milky Way: An Autobiography of Our Galaxy</em></a>.
