  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including Stephen Curry's decision to sponsor the creation of men's and women's golf teams at Howard University -- bringing the sport back to the historically black university for the first time in decades. Curry didn't reveal the exact amount -- it's a seven-figure donation paid out over six years, but funding for the teams can cost hundreds of thousands a year. Also discussed is a TMZ report that says Jay-Z will soon become part owner of a National Football League team. The report cited people close to the entertainer and mogul. The NFL last week announced a tie-up with Jay-Z, whose Roc Nation agency will oversee the league's entertainment, including the Super Bowl halftime show, and social initiatives. Also talked about is the ongoing saga surrounding Oakland Raiders wide receiver Antonio Brown's search for a comfortable helmet.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
