  "description": "To start today’s show, Daniel and I discuss the ultimate DIY project: building your own casket.  Despite horrible sentiment going into the quarter, Netflix (NFLX) reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings yesterday. We share how the company is maturing… and why it’s becoming a value stock. Next, I compare Netflix’s results to Disney (DIS)... and explain why all streaming companies aren’t created equal. Long-time listeners know I’ve been bearish on Disney for a while… but there’s a simple move it could make to quickly double its stock price. We also break down the latest earnings from Baker Hughes (BKR) and Halliburton (HAL). While both are in the oil industry, the results and outlook couldn't be more different. Bitcoin is finally rallying after the long selloff in the crypto sector. Daniel explains why the recent pain is a long-term positive… and I highlight the big money moving into the space. In this episode:  How to build your own casket [0:55] A recap of Netflix’s earnings [4:34] Disney vs. Netflix [8:10] Baker Hughes vs. Halliburton [12:35] How DIS could quickly double its share price [21:40] Bitcoin is finally in rally mode [27:15] Big money is pouring into crypto [34:40]  Enjoyed this episode?
