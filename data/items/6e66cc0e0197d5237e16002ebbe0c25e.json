  "description": "<p>Bobby address questions such as: \nWhat are some of the signs of spiritual warfare? \nWhat can we do to protect ourselves from it? \nHow does an accurate understanding of spiritual warfare shape our apologetic endeavor?\n\nTake a course at: \n<a href='https://oneminuteapologist.com/courses'>https://oneminuteapologist.com/courses</a>\n<a href='https://www.patreon.com/oneminuteapologist'>https://www.patreon.com/oneminuteapologist </a>\n\nDo you ever doubt your ability to answer bigger than life questions like, “Why do I exist? What is the purpose of life? Can I know God? If so, how? Are miracles possible?” And if God exists what’s with all the evil in the world? Do questions like these ever nag at you? If so, you’ve come to the right channel. I too am a fellow wonderer who thinks about stuff like this. I (Bobby Conway) am the founder and host of the rapidly-growing ministry, The One Minute Apologist, which is found on YouTube and at oneminuteapologist.com. Here I provide quick, credible answers to apologetic questions that resource people with a hunger to defend their Christian faith. These videos will often include interviews. I’ve had the privilege of interviewing some of the world's leading Christian apologists. Among them are: William Lane Craig, Josh McDowell, Hank Hanegraaff, JP Moreland, Norman Geisler, Frank Turek, and many more.</p>\n",
