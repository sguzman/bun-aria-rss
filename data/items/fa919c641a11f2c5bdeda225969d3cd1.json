Experience the story from the beginning here: https://youtu.be/pDtpEiMyGT4\n---\nDylan Bajda/Sheather Website: https://sites.google.com/site/worldofserina/\nDylan Bajda/Sheather Deviantart: https://www.deviantart.com/sheather888 \n\nThis video is a new chapter in my long-running series exploring the incredible speculative evolution saga of Serina, the world of birds. Serina was created by the talented artist and worldbuilder Dylan Bajda — and many extraordinary developments have occurred since we last explored this distant moon.\n\nThe triumphs and tragedies, the joys and the sorrows of this era are perhaps greater than any that have come before. So, for this entry into the archive, we’ll chronicle the rise and fall of fascinating species, and discover astonishing revelations as the world of Serina creeps ever closer to its end…\n\n0:00 Serina: A New Era\n1:07 Stewards of the Sea\n5:22 A Cold Wind\n9:29 Born Different\n11:55 The Third Essence \n15:12 When All Falls Apart\n18:36 The Dark Before The Dawn\n21:25 The Visitor\n25:48 Always Forwards\n\nCopyright Disclaimer: Under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education, and research.
