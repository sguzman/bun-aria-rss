  "description": "The Dixmoor 5. Chicago, Illinois. November 19, 1991. A young teenager named Cateresa Matthews leaves her grandmother's house to go home but doesn't make it there. At first she is simply missing, but on December 8th of that year her body would be discovered in a field. She had been abducted, raped, and murdered. The police acted quickly and built a case against five boys who knew her. After a successful trial it seemed as though justice had been done but, due to a dna test on evidence collected from the victim, it later became clear that they had prosecuted five innocent people. Worse still, the prosecutors and the investigators were aware of this from almost the start of this case and prosecuted them anyway. Cateresa's mother as well as the Dixmoor 5 would find that, in Chicago, justice isn't always easy to come by.
