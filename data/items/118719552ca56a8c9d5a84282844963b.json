  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a universally challenging year for all, there have been so many blessings – if we take the time to stop and look.

Note your big accomplishments (and the little ones!), remember the magic moments, reconnect to the joy and laughter that can easily be forgotten but recreated just as quickly as you ground yourself in gratitude and appreciate those moments all over again. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider the challenges of the past year, too, through a different lens – the circumstances or situations that may have caused pain at the time but pushed you to evolve and grow, built resilience, forged progress, and, as a result, ultimately blessed your life. Find the blessing, be the blessing, and your life will be blessed.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, as you’ll hear in this episode, as we head into the New Year and this entirely new world we all find ourselves in, Tony wants to give you the opportunity to grow even more, and create whatever it is you truly desire – the life you were made for.  </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch below to take part in the <a href=\"http://www.make2021myyear.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">gift he is offering</a>, free of charge, so that you can make 2021 not just better than the last, but your best year ever.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you’re resolved, you’ve cut off anything other than what you’re committed to – every ounce of your soul is there.” – Tony Robbins</span></p> <p><strong>About The Fireside Chat Series:</strong> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">In the 1930s and 40s, a time when the country was struggling even more than it is today, we had an amazing leader named FDR.
