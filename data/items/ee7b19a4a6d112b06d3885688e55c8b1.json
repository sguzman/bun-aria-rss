  "summary": "It was April 4th, 2016, and our bootstrapped SaaS company, Mealime, was doing just fine, thank you very much. At $6,600 MRR and near-0 costs, it earned enough for its 3 founders, Jeff, Maria and me, to live off of. Sure, it was no monumental success. My &ldquo;salary&rdquo; was barely a 5th of what I would earn as a developer for another company. But that modest success meant something big to us: if the slow growth continued, we would never have to &ldquo;work&rdquo; again. In short, we had something to lose."
