  "description": "So many of us are navigating transitions right now: back to school, last days of vacation, or adjusting to commutes again. For Amir Nathoo, CEO of online learning platform Outschool, this regular season of transition is coupled with a few more big life changes: a second baby, the end of paternity leave, and the return to work (from home). In this episode, Dr. Becky talks with Amir about strategies that help us show up for ourselves *and* our kids in these times, such as thinking about \"family jobs\" and engaging in the expansive world of play. Their conversation explores all of the tricky feelings that come up during transitions, and how wiring our kids for resilience now prepares them to cope with these feelings for years to come.\n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
