  "description": "<p>Maps play a key role in rapidly developing area of autonomous driving. We\nsurvey the literature for different map representations and find that while the\nworld is three-dimensional, it is common to rely on 2D map representations in\norder to meet real-time constraints. We believe that high levels of situation\nawareness require a 3D representation as well as the inclusion of semantic\ninformation. We demonstrate that our recently presented hierarchical 3D grid\nmapping framework UFOMap meets the real-time constraints. Furthermore, we show\nhow it can be used to efficiently support more complex functions such as\ncalculating the occluded parts of space and accumulating the output from a\nsemantic segmentation network.\n</p>",
