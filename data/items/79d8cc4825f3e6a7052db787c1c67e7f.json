  "description": "<p>Evangelicals are no longer the largest religious group in the South. Russell Moore says they’ve been replaced by a dangerous new kind of southern secularism. These MAGA-vangelicals don’t attend church, don’t follow the moral teachings of the Bible, and are fixated on politics and conspiracy theories but still call themselves “Christians.” What role does the church have in mitigating the danger of this new sect? Plus, a church in Texas faces legal trouble for performing an evangelistic revision of the musical <em data-stringify-type= \"italic\">Hamilton</em> without a license. Then, Katelyn Beaty is back to discuss her new book <em data-stringify-type= \"italic\">Celebrities for Jesus: How Personas, Platforms, and Profits are Hurting the Church</em>. She explains why we keep manufacturing more Christian celebrities despite their high failure rate, and why accountability structures aren’t enough.
