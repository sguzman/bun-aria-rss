  "description": "<p>Comedian Bob Saget’s autopsy shows head trauma caused the actor’s death. Saget’s family revealed that officials had “concluded that he accidentally hit the back of his head on something, thought nothing of it and went to sleep” while on tour. The autopsy shows Saget had fractured his skull which caused bleeding on the brain.</p><p>A security guard found the 65-year-old “tucked in bed” and unresponsive when his family, hadn’t heard from him and contacted the hotel. Saget’s key card showed that he returned to his room at about 2:20 a.m. Dr. Joshua Stephany, the chief medical examiner of Orange and Osceola counties, attributed Saget’s injuries to a fall.</p><p>The trauma caused veins in Saget’s brain to rupture, which then caused blood to pool, creating pressure on the hemispheres of the brain. Stephany found no other injuries and ruled the death accidental. The actor had no illegal drugs in his system, but there were signs of prescription drugs used to treat depression and panic attacks.</p><p>Stephany found no indication that either drug contributed to Saget’s death. The autopsy report further found that Saget had an enlarged heart and that he showed signs of the coronavirus on a PCR test.</p><p><br></p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Domenic Romano - NY Corporate Lawyer and Entertainment Attorney, Romano Law www.romanolaw.com</li>\n<li>Caryn Stark - NYC Psychologist, www.carynstark.com, Twitter: @carynpsych, Facebook: \"Caryn Stark\" </li>\n<li>Lisa M.
