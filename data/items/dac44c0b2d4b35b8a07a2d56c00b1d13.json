  "description": "In today's podcast we hear, second-hand but ultimately from Vladimir Vladimirovich himself, that Russian hackers are free-spirited, patriotic artists, and maybe he'd be in a position to know. WikiLeaks dumps more Vault7 documents. White hats reconsider crowdsourcing membership in the exploit-of-the-month club. OceanLotus may be weaponizing a ShadowBrokers' leak. Fireball malware used for ad fraud. A think tank warns of Royal Navy submarine cyber vulnerabilities. Kmart discloses a point-of-sale breach.  Jonathan Katz from UMD on undetectable backdoors. Leo Taddeo from Cyxtera Technologies on what the Comey firing means for encryption and cyber security. And a motorcycle gang is hacking cars. Why? Because that's the way they roll.",
