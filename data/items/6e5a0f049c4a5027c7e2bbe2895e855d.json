  "description": "If you're an NBA fan, then you know exactly who we're talking about when the words \"The Glove\" are uttered. That's right, on the pod today is NBA Hall of Famer and one of the greatest defensive players to step on the court, Mr. Gary Payton. He discusses his career in full detail - from making the jump from a draft disappointment to an elite player, his journey to try and win that elusive ring, his presence on and off the court and what made him such a special talent. He also breaks down his partnership with Hennessy and their \"Unfinished Business\" campaign to help small businesses as part of the NBA 75th Anniversary. Now, you would think that's enough, but there's even more great conversation to cover as NBA correspondent Mikal Bridges joins the program as well. He starts everything off by addressing the Suns devastating playoff exit to the Mavs and tries to make sense of what went wrong. Then, after the Payton interview, he returns for the OM3 draft, which focuses on the \"Top 5 dishes served at chain restaurants\". It's a can't miss double shot on the OM3.\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
