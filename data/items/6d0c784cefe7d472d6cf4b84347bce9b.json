  "description": "In this episode, Sharon is joined by author Catherine Price, whose new book, <em>The Power of Fun: How to Feel Alive Again</em> explores the concept of fun and why it’s a necessary part of the human experience. Catherine set out to pinpoint the definition of “fun” and she found that universally fun experiences meet three criteria: playfulness, connection, and flow. Catherine explains why play is so much easier when we’re children, and how passive “fun” like scrolling through social media, is not an equal stand-in for active fun. Learn how to create the habit of noticing daily delights and embrace opportunities for fun.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
