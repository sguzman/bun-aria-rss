  "description": "Professor Eddie Glaude Jr. argues in his groundbreaking book Democracy in Black that we live in a country founded on a “value gap”—with white lives valued more than others—that still distorts our politics today. Whether discussing why all Americans have racial habits that reinforce inequality, why black politics based on the civil-rights era have reached a dead end, or why only remaking democracy from the ground up can bring real change, Professor Glaude crystallizes the untenable position of black America--and offers thoughts on a better way forward. Forceful in ideas and unsettling in its candor, Democracy in Black is a landmark book on race in America. \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/words-matter.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
