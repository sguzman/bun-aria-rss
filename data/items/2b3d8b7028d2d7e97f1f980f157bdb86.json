  "title": "278 - Sex, Silverware, and Immortality: The Oneida Community Cult",
  "description": "<p>Did you know that if lots of people  have lots of unprotected sex and the men never ejaculate you can help Jesus create his kingdom on Earth?  No? Well then you would NOT have been accepted into the Oneida Community Cult and you would've never gotten to live in a 93,000  square foot compound in Oneida, NY with around three hundred other followers.  This is just one of the super crazy messages John Humphrey Noyes  taught the followers living in his community. He also taught them that he was perfect. Literally perfect. And then, when he finally had to flee the country or be arrested for having sex with underage girls, his followers went on to built the largest silverware company North America had ever seen. I love how weird this episode is - hope you do too! <br /><br />The Bad Magic Charity of the month is Love Thy Neighbor! We'll  be giving $15,500 to this Denver-area based 501(3c) nonprofit dedicated to working with local businesses to hand out free food to the homeless.
