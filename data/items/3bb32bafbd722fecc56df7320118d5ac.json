Volleyball England has run a number of online initiatives during the past few months but is now eagerly awaiting Government advice on how indoor sports can resume playing.</p><br><p>Sue only took over at Volleyball England in late 2019 and oversees the disciplines of Indoor Volleyball, Beach Volleyball and Sitting Volleyball in the country. Whilst she admits the chances of sending a GB team to take part in the Olympics is a long way off, she highlights the achievements of the Sitting Volleyball team and highlights the involvement of Martine Wright, who lost both her legs in the Aldgate underground explosion, on the 15th anniversary of the 7/7 bombings in London.</p><br><p>She also notes that with Beach Volleyball on the programme for the next Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in 2022, there is a fantastic opportunity to raise the profile of the sport.
