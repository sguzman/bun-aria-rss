  "description": "Based on previous Bitcoin halving cycles, the king crypto (BTC) has surged by an average of 3,158% in the one year after each halving event. By removing the 2012 anomaly, the average increase is 412.5%.\n\nUsing the extrapolation from January 2017 to an extrapolated May 2024 projected Bitcoin price of $108,000 and incorporating a 1-year price increase of 413% between May 2024 and May 2025, BTC could hit $446,000.\n\nIncorporating the estimated 413% increase between May 2028 and May 2029, BTC would be on target to hit $2.08 million by May 2029, giving BTC a January 2030 value of $2.11 million.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
