He hasn’t written a book. He's not an in demand speaker.</p><p>But I can almost promise that you have seen Trampas Thompson —&nbsp;you just didn’t know it.</p><p>Working behind the scenes, Trampas is a Hollywood stuntmen extraordinaire, collecting blockbuster credits performing a dizzying array of delicious, death-defying acts in some of the world's most popular movies and television shows.</p><p>Trampas has run the streets on fire, sword battled with Johnny Depp in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and most recently doubled Michael Keaton in Birdman. Yes, that was Trampas, not Michael, who lept off a New York Theatre District rooftop in the most memorable scene from last year's Oscar winning best picture.</p><p>His credits are impressive: The Dark Knight Rises, National Treasure, 21 Jump Street, Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull, The Wolf of Wall Street, and on and on.</p><p>But what drew me to Trampas as a great fit for the podcast actually has very little to do with his work. Far more fascinating? Who he is.</p><p>What kind of person becomes a stuntman?</p><p>God broke the mold with this guy. Larger than life, Trampas is one-of-a-kind. A renaissance man living life full throttle 24/7. The kind of guy who survived a skydiving accident when his parachute didn’t open, then jumped again. A person unapologetically himself, incapable of doing anything half-assed and utterly fearless.</p><p>This is another epic, thoroughly entertaining 3-hour conversation with a truly singular human about living life on one’s own terms. It's about dragonfly tattoos, synchronicity, Burning Man and the never ending spiritual quest to grow and expand consciousness.</p><p>It's about what it means to hand-wring the adventure out of life.</p><p>I sincerely hope you enjoy this conversation with one of my favorite people.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><br><p>Listen & Subscribe on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rich-roll-podcast/id582272991?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes</a> | <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/richroll\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a> | <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/30437\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a></p><p>Thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p><p>StrideHealth:&nbsp;The first health insurance recommendation engine tuned & tailored to the life of the individual.
