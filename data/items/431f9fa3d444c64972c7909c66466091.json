To say I am thrilled is an understatement. His parts in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czoZ9EBahXQ\">legendary skate videos</a> like 411 and others not only got me stoked on his talent but the music he chose was always a bit different and always hit the punk/hardcore/metal side of things real hard. I knew his affinity for the music runs deep, but how deep I didn't know until now. We discuss his feelings around being a video game character, Discord Records and so much more. Enjoy the listen! </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://taken.limitedrun.com/\"><strong>Buy Podcast Merch Here</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/tapestrygoldmusic?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\"><strong>Theme Song by Tapestry Gold</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_akI_b6HY7yrc2Zc1ciBvw\"><strong>Subscribe to the podcast on YouTube</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rockabilia.com/\"><strong>Rockabilia sells you officially licensed Merch from ALL your favorite bands (and your Dad's favorite band, your siblings etc...).
