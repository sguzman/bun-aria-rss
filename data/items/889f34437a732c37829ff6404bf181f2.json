  "description": "<p>Bishop Robert Barron is a bona fide bibliophile. Any quiet moment outside his holy hours, he can be found at his workbench writing a book or on his patio reading one. In this episode of the Word on Fire Show, Bishop Barron discusses some new and notable books that he's read, which range from the scholarly insight of Dietrich von Hildebrand to the poetic storytelling of Sally Read to the popular encouragement of Rick Warren. The listener question comes from a college student who wonders how God can be all-loving to his people and rain fire down on cities in the Old Testament.</p> <p><strong>Topics Discussed</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>0:17  </strong>- Introduction, Bishop Barron's 2017 goals and resolutions</li> <li><strong>3:15</strong> - Who is Dietrich von Hildebrand and why does he matter?</li> <li><strong>5:30 </strong>- What was the liturgical movement that took place in the 1920's and 30's.</li> <li><strong>7:00</strong> - According to Hildebrand, how does the faith and liturgy shape a well-cultivated personality?</li> <li><strong>10:00 </strong>- Who is Sally Read and what is her story?</li> <li><strong>14:0o</strong> - What is the way of beauty and why is it important?</li> <li><strong>18:20</strong> - What is the premise of Rick Warren's <em>The Purpose Driven Church</em></li> <li><strong>21:10</strong> - What are some of the things that Evangelical churches do right in terms of church growth and health?</li> <li><strong>20:35 </strong>- What can Catholics learn from the mega church model?</li> <li><strong>25:33</strong> - Listener question: If God exists non-competitively with his creation and is all-loving, why does he rain down fire on cities?</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Bonus Resources</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Videos</strong> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://www.wordonfire.org/resources/video/bishop-barron-on-fleming-rutledges-the-crucifixion/5226/\"> Bishop Barron on Fleming Rutledge’s “The Crucifixion”</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://www.wordonfire.org/resources/video/bishop-barron-on-all-the-light-we-cannot-see/5077/\"> Bishop Barron on Anthony Doerr’s “<em>All the Light We Cannot See</em>”</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://www.wordonfire.org/resources/video/reflections-on-the-book-of-revelation/291/\"> Bishop Barron on the Book of Revelation</a></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>DVD's</strong> <ul> <li><em><a href= \"http://pivotalplayers.wordonfire.org/\">CATHOLICISM: The Pivotal Players</a> </em>(Word On Fire)</li> <li><em><a href= \"http://www.wordonfire.org/resources/dvd/faith-clips/4421/\">Faith Clips</a></em> (Word On Fire)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Articles  </strong> <ul> <li><em><a href= \"https://www.wordonfire.org/resources/blog/why-bishop-barron-thinks-you-should-read-liturgy-and-personality/5304/\"> Forward to Hildebrand's Liturgy and Personality</a> </em>(Bishop Barron)</li> <li><a href= \"https://www.wordonfire.org/resources/article/why-you-should-read-cs-lewis-the-great-divorce/5128/\"> <em>Why you should read C.S.
