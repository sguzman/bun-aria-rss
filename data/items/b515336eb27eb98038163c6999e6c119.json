  "description": "<p>In this fifty-ninth episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast, we interview Dr. Annie Davis Weber yet again, this time on the subject of \"Finding Peace\" with Buddhism. This episode is different and special, as the very first wholly live episode, recorded while on the air live on WRFL Lexington, 88.1 FM in Lexington, Kentucky. The episode aired and was recorded on December 18th, 2017.</p> <p>Dr. Annie Davis Weber earned her doctorate in Higher Education Leadership and Policy at Vanderbilt University and is the Assistant Provost for Strategic Planning and Institutional Effectiveness at the University of Kentucky. In this episode, she is representing only her own point of view. This episode is a follow-up of sorts on Ep0.1 from the \"pilot season,\" titled \"Acceptance and Happiness with Stoicism.\" We talk about Annie's experience learning about and growing from some challenges that arose at the start of Eric and Annie's daughter's life, when Helen suffered a stroke and other medical difficulties. Annie learned a great deal from Buddhism and joined Anthony and Eric in this episode to talk about her experience and the insights that she found most valuable from the Buddhist tradition. We also celebrate the end of our first official season of Philosophy Bakes Bread. </p> <p>Listen for our “You Tell Me!” questions and for some jokes in one of our concluding segments, called “Philosophunnies.” Reach out to us on Facebook <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at <a href=\"mailto:philosophybakesbread@gmail.com\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">philosophybakesbread@gmail.com</a>; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.
