  "description": "<p>It is Bowen and Matt's thrill and pleasure to welcome songwriting dynamo and queer musical life-giver Justin Tranter! Join the Cultch boys in their track-by-track exaltation of Justin's prolific work across so many wonderful artists, because chances are they've written a bop or three for your fav at some point. A true dump of creativity! Listen for wonderful bits of process, creativity and juicy stories, from Justin's experience working with The Chicks to reuniting with Gaga after one of the biggest pop tours of all time. It's all there, plus some business up top that mostly revolves around Christine Quinn and the rest of the \"Selling Sunset\" group, and as always some searing IDTSHs. It's ear candy on ear candy!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
