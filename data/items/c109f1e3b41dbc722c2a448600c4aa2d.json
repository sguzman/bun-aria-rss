  "description": "<p>Dear Steve and Shirley, I'm an older female with old school ways of doing things. After many years of marriage I'm now divorced and back on the dating scene. I never would have imagined how much things have changed when it comes to dating. I am learning about all of these online dating apps but they scare me so I've been dating the traditional way. I've met two nice men in my community but I have a problem with how they communicate with me. They both like to send text messages instead of calling me to get to know me. Please tell me that texting is not the new way of talking to people........</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
