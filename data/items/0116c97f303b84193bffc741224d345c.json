  "description": "<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast we have a fun episode for you to kick off a fun series of episodes that will come up from time to time, “In Search of the Austen Adaptation.” This week our hosts Angelina, Cindy and Thomas are joined by Atlee Northmore, and together they are debating which film version of Jane Austen’s <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3xu6P25\">Pride and Prejudice</a></em> is the best. Atlee shares some of the history of the Pride and Prejudice adaptations that were made for TV and film. Angelina highlights different ideas of what makes a good film adaptation of a book. Cindy brings up the importance of the casting, and Angelina talks about why she still feels like no film has gotten Mr. Darcy right. She also talks about the difficulty of embodying the virtues that Jane Austen gives her characters. Our hosts critique each major movies from over the decades, sharing what they like and dislike about each one.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.theliterary.life/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Pride-and-Prejudice-Adaptations.pdf\"> Click here</a> to download the PDF Atlee created for all the Pride and Prejudice film adaptations.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>If we cannot get the better of life, at any rate, we can be so free as to laugh at it.</p> <cite>Desmond MacCarthy</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Jane Austen is thus a mistress of much deeper emotion than appears upon the surface.
