  "description": "<p>Being an artist is an up and down business. One minute you're making things you love, the next minute everything has turned to rubbish. One month you sell lots of paintings, the next month you can't give them away. So what do you do? How do you navigate this unpredictable career without going mad or giving up? Not sure we have all the answers, but we have learned some lessons over the last few years and we've both become better at rolling with the punches. We hope this conversation serves as a reminder that we all struggle and we can all come out the other side if we just keep going.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Jenny Fermor <a href=\"\">https://www.jennyfermorart.com/</a></p>\n<p>Sara Breinlinger <a href=\"\">https://www.sarabreinlinger.com/</a></p>\n<p>The Sensationalists on iPlayer <a href=\"\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m001cbst/sensationalists-the-bad-girls-and-boys-of-british-art</a></p>\n<p>Crossfire on iPlayer <a href=\"\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m001c9gh/crossfire</a></p>\n<p>Find Alice and Louise at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
