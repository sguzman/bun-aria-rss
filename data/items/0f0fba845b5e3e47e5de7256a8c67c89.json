  "description": "Why do kids suddenly turn on their friends and ice them out of a group? It’s something Dr. Lisa says she's been hearing about more often. Kids need shared interests to hold their groups together and that \"social glue\" has been depleted by the pandemic. We take a look at how negative behavior can emerge among friends and become destructive. Reena asks if adults should call out mean girl behavior or reach out to other parents when social groups turn sour. Dr. Lisa covers what kids should do when classmates are nice to them one-on-one but won't include them in groups at school.\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn @AskLisaPodcast, @LDamour, @ReenaNinan\n\nCheckout Dr. Lisa’s website for more resources: \nhttps://www.drlisadamour.com/\n\nAsk Lisa is produced by: \nWww.GoodTroubleProductions.com\n\nSee acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
