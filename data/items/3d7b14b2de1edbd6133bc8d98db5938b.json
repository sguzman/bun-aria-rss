And then— kind of all of a sudden— they turn to the international stage. They start traveling around the world as foreign fighters,\" said Hegghammer.\n\n\"Azam is is crucial because he is the main entrepreneur behind the mobilization of  the so-called Arab-Afghans in the 1980s. The Arab-Afghans were basically the foreign fighters in the War in Afghanistan in the 1980s— and Abdullah Azzam was the man who more or less brought them there.\"\n\n\"He set up an organization called the Services Bureau to streamline the recruitment and reception of foreign fighters. And he wrote several very influential books that motivated people to go.  By the late 1980s, he was without a doubt the most famous jihadi in the world.\"\n\n\"He exercises influence today,\" said Hegghammer. \"Even though he died in 1989, he is still widely read by jihadis today.\"\n\nHegghammer is a senior research fellow at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment in Oslo.\n\nMusic for this season's podcast was created by Feras Arrabi.
