  "description": "This is just me walking my dog and take about how much Mitzi Shore meant to me.  The audio isn't perfect and there's no conspiracies on this episode so if that doesn't interest you you might want to skip this one.  This is just me saying to good bye to someone who did more for me than I can ever express.  Without Mitzi Shore I would just be a no name bum.  Mitz, your kindness and love will never be forgotten.  Thank you forever thing you did for comedy. Long Live The Memory of The Queen!",
