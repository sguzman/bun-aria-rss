  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Rich Zeoli from WPHT fills in. Mark Levin was right in 2017 when he said that the Obama Administration spied on the Trump campaign. Then, Republicans in the Senate Judiciary Committee should drag out any potential impeachment trial and call Joe and Hunter Biden to the stand, as well as every single Burisma board member. However Democrats don’t want that, they'd prefer to change things by altering court documents and saying it was a mistake. The question is whether this bad behavior will affect all citizens or is it just for the President of the United States. Imagine a world where you can use fake information to get warrants to spy on your political opponents? Sen. Lindsey Graham was clear in his statements today as he excoriated Inspector General Michael Horowitz who appeared in front of the senate judiciary committee. Graham expertly drove home the point that there was no collusion between the campaign and Russia. .John Brennan told Congress that he never spoke with President Obama yet we now know that he did, in fact, he sent this information to Obama. What the Democrats fail to recognize is that voters from 31 vulnerable Democrat Districts that President Trump won will very likely vote for him again. Later, Trump signed an executive order to combat anti-Semitism. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is the best and most entertaining candidate to face off against Trump in 2020.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
