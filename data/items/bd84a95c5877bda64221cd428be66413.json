  "description": "<p><strong>This week, Connor and Dan venture to the far east to explore the philosophy of premier Japanese philosopher Keiji Nishitani, specifically his work on nihilism and nothingness. Like with every episode that touches on Eastern philosophy, there's a lot of talk about one-ness and nirvana courtesy of two white guys who barely know what that means. Also, Connor goes to the hospital and details his date with a 32-year-old Japanese bikini store clerk, Dan fondly remembers terrible internet videos and everybody gets out of there in under 40 minutes.</strong></p>",
