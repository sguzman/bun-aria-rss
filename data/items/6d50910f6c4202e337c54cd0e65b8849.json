  "title": "#317: VICTIM F (Part 1) - Denise Huskins & Aaron Quinn Interview",
  "description": "<p>This episode is our first in a series about an extraordinary case called \"Victim F.\" In March 2015, Denise Huskins and her boyfriend Aaron Quinn awoke at 3am to a nightmare. Armed men bound and drugged them, then abducted Denise, warning Aaron not to call the police or she would be killed. Aaron agonized about what to do. Finally he put his trust in law enforcement and dialed 911. Instead of searching for Denise, the police accused Aaron of her murder. Days later, when Denise was let go, instead of pursuing her abductors, they turned on her, accusing her of faking her own kidnapping. In their book, \"Victim F\" Aaron&nbsp;and Denise recount the horrific&nbsp;ordeal that followed. It is an unbelievable story that is all too true. You can read their book, co-written with investigative journalist Nicole Weisensee Egan \"Victim F\" available now on Amazon.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dhzvCJ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://amzn.to/3dhzvCJ</a></p><p><br></p><p>#VictimF</p><p>#DeniseHuskins</p><p>#AaronQuinn</p><p>#NicoleWeisenseeEgan</p><p>#believevictims</p><p><br></p><p>The clips used in this episode are from ABC's 20/20 : Taken.
