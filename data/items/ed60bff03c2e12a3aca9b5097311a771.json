  "description": "<p>CALLING ALL OLOGISTS: If you’re a scientist who wants to help with the COVID-19 pandemic -- boy howdy have we got an episode for you. Dr. Mike Wells, a neurobiologist at Harvard University and the Broad Institute, knows we need tests in the U.S. and is coralling all the wonderful scientists willing to pitch in. He explains how testing for the SARS CoV-2 virus works, what other countries are doing, and even the book that inspired him to pursue science. Also: if you’re feeling helpless and want to help, Patrons give dozens of ideas on how to help those around you, and where to go for resources if you need help, and how to take care of your own mental and physical well being during an uncertain time. Also the album I’m listening to too much and how much toilet paper I have left. </p>\n<p>To sign up -- or for access to the database -- click here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/COVID19SciVolunteers\">https://tinyurl.com/COVID19SciVolunteers</a> </p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Michael F.
