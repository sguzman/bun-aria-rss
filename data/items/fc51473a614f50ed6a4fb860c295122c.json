  "description": "Welcome back to Frankly Speaking!  This week I answer questions on interest rates, deflationary trends - and the impact they have on gold going forward.  Also, an update on Northern Dynasty (NAK). I've been recommending this stock for a couple months now. Tune-in as I give you my perspective after recent news. That, and much more.  As always, thanks for all the great questions.  Enjoy the weekend!",
