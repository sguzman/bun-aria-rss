  "description": "<p><p>The Ellie/Yankees live stream was some of the best content Barstool ever put out. Inside the Barstool Upfronts. Should construction have to start after Feitelberg wakes up? No. Should people feel bad for White Sox Dave? Also no. Voicemails: Buying nudes, Athlete sperm, what would you do if you had the remote from the Adam Sandler movie Click?</p><p>Matt Barnes returns to talk to us about his new podcast with Stephen Jackson, how the NBA is handling the China situation and whether Lebron smokes weed and just doesn't tell anybody.</p><p>Rude Jude is also back and also discusses drugs. The time he brought a toddler to The Shelter from 8 Mile in Detriot to see Kelis. His new wine offering. And how the term \"Say Less\" almost got him in a feud with a rapper.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
