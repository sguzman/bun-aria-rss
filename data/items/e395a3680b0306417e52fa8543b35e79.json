  "description": "History’s patterns repeat, but many things (like truly severe pandemics) may only happen once in a lifetime. So if you only think about what you’ve personally experienced, you will be unprepared for the future. As a dedicated student of history, Ray Dalio is on a mission to help us weather a coming economic storm that may be even worse than what happened in the late 1920’s and early 1930’s.
