  "description": "Glenn rants about the lack of appropriate medications to deal with COVID. BlazeTV host Mark Levin joins to compliment Glenn on his wardrobe and discuss the hypocrisy of President Biden’s statements about January 6. Bill O'Reilly joins for his weekly news recap, discussing President Trump’s possible re-election and COVID. NBC’s Chris Hayes posted a critique of a painting hung in Glenn’s house, but as always, there’s some missing context behind the painting that would have been easy to Google. Alas, the Left never misses an opportunity to take a swipe at political opponents — even if it's dead wrong. Author and podcaster Michael Malice joins Glenn to discuss Glenn’s painting, media manipulation, and President Trump. Ben Weingarten, author and senior editor of Real Clear Investigations, joins to discuss and compare the January 6 riot with the 2020 \"Black Lives Matter\" riots.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
