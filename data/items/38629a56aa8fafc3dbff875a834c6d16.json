  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, Philadelphia Eagles player DeSean Jackson tweeted anti-Semitic quotes from Hitler and none of his NFL colleagues are denouncing it. Although the NFL forced Jackson to apologize, there remains a high tolerance for bigotry and Jew-hatred on the left. ESPN Sportscaster Stephen A. Smith calls in and explained the what Jackson tweeted was uncalled for but the Eagles shouldn’t release him for it. Then, Marxism and anarchism are turning this country inside out and America must defund the left and start with challenging Professor tenure. People that hate our country and teach this doctrine. Later, Joe Biden is encouraged to decline any debates with President Trump unless he meets demands that he knows President Trump will reject. In fact, a NY Times columnist is suggesting that no debate be held until Trump presents his tax returns. This program suggests that perhaps an equally acceptable condition could be for each candidate to submit a brain scan before the debates. Another such pre-condition might be for the American people to first hear from Tara Reade before any debates occur.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
