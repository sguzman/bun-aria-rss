  "description": "<p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 1:</p><p>Todd Herman guest hosts for Rush on Thursday. Media refused to air voter fraud hearings. What do we have to gain and what do we have to lose? Flip the perspective. Will we be ruled or will we speak up? There’s no lockdown on the economy, there’s a lockdown on you. 18 international life scientists: COVID tests fatally flawed. Bezos should do what he pretends to do: help the little guy. Student loan bailouts. Trump has exposed the Deep State, what do we do with that opportunity? Confused by not voting for GA Republicans to own the libs.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>We live in the age of disinformation. Media lies and hides select information to benefit one side. What the Drive-Bys program us to believe. The Supreme Court needs to take this case live so we can watch. Obama admits Rush is right: Democrats can’t run on what they believe. Demand answers for voter fraud data anomalies. Did the Democrats create an environment for fraud? Follow the law. Missing context.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p>Democrats set up environment for fraud. Unnatural occurrences in raw data. The Supreme Court must hear this case. Some young people have not learned to stand on their own two feet. The case for personal responsibility. Georgia video play-by-play. Imagine this scenario with Obama v. Romney. This is the video that will be remembered if SCOTUS doesn’t hear the case. The Big Banks’ student loan bailout grift.
