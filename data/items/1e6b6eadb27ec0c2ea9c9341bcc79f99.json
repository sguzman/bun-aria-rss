  "itunes:summary": "The Colin Kaepernick-NFL situation took an unexpected turn in recent weeks when the exiled former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers was invited to a public practice by the Atlanta Falcons. For three years Kaepernick has been forced to sit on the sidelines, exiled from the 49ers and blacklisted by the ownership of every other NFL franchise for his controversial choice to “take the knee” during the ceremonial playing of the American national anthem in protest of the increasing violence against African American citizens perpetrated by American law enforcement.\n\nWhile Kaepernick’s return to the field was surprising, the muted response by the NFL and its various franchises was not, with the vast majority of teams choosing to ignore the practice altogether, citing the inconvenience of a last-minute change in venue and an alleged lack of need for an elite-level quarterback on the bench.\n\nBut while Kaepernick continues to be treated as a pariah by the league he has become a contemporary folk hero for anti-oppression social movements throughout the United States and the world at large, and a central part of the #BlackLivesMatter movement that has come to redefine social movement activity in the digital age.\n\nAnd he’s not alone in this regard – from Megan Rapinoe and the women of American soccer pushing not only for equality within their sport but American society at large, to Lebron James’ Twitter critiques of the American President, athletes have emerged as some of the most prolific and influential non-political voices in the political world. And while the practice of this agency has taken a very specific shape in the current era of #MeToo, #BlackLivesMatter and social media, the tradition of the ‘athlete as rebel’ is one that has a long history, stretching back to Tommie Smith and John Carlos, Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson.\n\nOn this week’s podcast we focus on the politics of the game using an institutional lens, dissecting the institutional logics of both elite and amateur sport leagues, the place of politics in sports and the political agency of athletes with Professor Aaron Ettinger, an assistant professor specializing in international relations and foreign policy with Carleton University’s Department of Political Science.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nFollow us on social media:\ninstagram.com/cu_poli.sci\nfacebook.com/carletonu.polisci\ntwitter.com/CarletonPoliSci\ncarleton.ca/polisci\n\nThanks so much for listening, and an extra thanks to Sappheiros for use of his music for our theme.\nLights by Sappheiros @sappheirosmusic\nCreative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: bit.ly/LightsSappheiros\nMusic promoted by Audio Library youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n🎵 Track Info:\nTitle: Lights by Sappheiros\nGenre and Mood: Dance & Electronic + Inspirational\n———\n🎧 Available on:\nSpotify: open.spotify.com/album/4KnoJn...\niTunes: music.apple.com/us/album/ligh...\nDeezer: deezer.com/us/album/88114572\nYouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=xq3_uCEtiJI\nSoundCloud: @sappheirosmusi...\n———\n😊 Contact the Artist:\nzachremick1@gmail.com\nsappheiros.bandcamp.com\ndeezer.com/us/artist/13811001\n@sappheirosmusic\nmusic.apple.com/us/artist/sap...\nyoutube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC...\nopen.spotify.com/artist/5ZVHX...\npaypal.com/paypalme2/sappheiros\ninstagram.com/sappheirosmusic\nfacebook.com/SappheirosMusic\ndiscordapp.com/invite/Pk87yN9\ntwitter.com/SappheirosMusic\npatreon.com/sappheiros",
