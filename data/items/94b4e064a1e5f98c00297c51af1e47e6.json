  "description": "<p>It is essential for us to learn how to thrive while working from home. Our modern workforce has been heading towards working remotely for years, but of course the coronavirus has all but eliminated the ability for non-essential offices to continue to function as they had previously. The problem is that most of us don’t have home offices, or if we do, there are still countless distractions in our home that we’re not used to. And additionally, many of us have kids at home as well- while they are wonderful, they are likely distracting us from the other myriad tasks at hand! How do we work from home and do it well? We can’t continue with a system that hampers our ability to actually get work done, so we’re going to speak to how we as individuals can work from home without going crazy.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Same As It Ever Was by Monday Night Brewing, makers of some of Atlanta’s best craft beer.
