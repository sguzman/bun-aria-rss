Allergies occur when the immune system reacts to substances in the environment making IgE antibodies that trigger mast cells to release histamine. High histamine levels cause symptoms like itchy watery eyes, sneezing, stuffy nose, headaches, and more. Conventional treatments may help reduce symptoms temporarily, but they often include steroids which can be detrimental to your immune system, may contribute to osteoporosis, and, most importantly, don’t address the root cause of the immune dysregulation.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman discusses seasonal allergies with Dr. Cindy Geyer. They talk about how our early life informs the immune system and what steps parents can take to ensure a healthy gut flora and healthy immune system, right from the start. They also discuss ways to address the root cause of the allergy symptoms using diet, supplements, stress reduction, and more.</p><br><p>Dr. Cindy Geyer received her Bachelor of Science and her Doctor of Medicine degrees, with honors, from the Ohio State University. She completed residency in internal medicine at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, N.Y. and is triple board certified in internal medicine, integrative medicine, and lifestyle medicine. She joined The Ultrawellness Center in 2021 after practicing and serving as the medical director at Canyon Ranch for 23 years. She has served on the Board of Directors for the American College of Lifestyle Medicine and is a recently elected fellow of ACLM. Dr. Geyer has been a core faculty member at The Center for Mind-Body Medicine (CMBM) for 20 years, teaching physicians and other healthcare professionals how to use food and lifestyle to address health concerns in their own lives and those of their patients. A clinician, educator, and avid hiker, she is passionate about collaborative approaches to health and wellness: from the integrative team model in working with individual patients, to community partnerships that together can affect healthy changes in the places people live and work.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health and MitoPure.</p><br><p>Rupa Health is a place for Functional Medicine practitioners to access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, Great Plains, and more.
