Our conversation covers the challenges of space (both in buyers' homes and our own studios); the need to use bigger tools; and the importance of mixing up a lot more paint. We also look at the inherent difficulties of scaling up collage work, and offer a few suggestions of how to handle that transition. In the end, making large work is a new challenge for each of us, and requires us to find our own solutions, but we have both found the process rewarding enough to make it worthwhile.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Sam Lock <a href=\"\">https://www.samlock.com/</a><br>\nBibby Gignilliat large scale collage <a href=\"\">https://www.bibbyart.com/</a><br>\nParanormal cold case podcast: Battersea poltergeist <a href=\"\">https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-battersea-poltergeist/id1548946506</a><br>\nMichelle Walker: Paintbrush & Ivories podcast <a href=\"\">https://michellewalker.com.au/podcast/</a><br>\nArt 2 Life podcast (episode 12) <a href=\"\">https://www.art2life.com/2022/01/12/the-artists-gift-nicholas-wilton-ep-12/</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
