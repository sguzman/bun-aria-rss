  "description": "Pete Prisco makes his triumphant return to the podcast to break down the biggest questions surrounding teams as Training Camp begins across the league. First, Pete and host Will Brinson discuss how the MLB's return to play (and subsequent positive COVID-19 results) could impact the NFL. Then, they dive into the most pressing questions concerning proven contenders and those that are hoping to contend this season. Did the Seahawks get fleeced in the Jamal Adams deal (19:30)? The Chiefs and 49ers were the best two teams in 2019, but can they manage the same success in 2020 (31:30)? The Bucs (42:00) and Cowboys (46:30) figure to be two of the most high-interest teams in the league but have questions just like everyone else. Quarterbacks are often the focal point for exercises like these and not always for good reasons, but Pete shares his confidence in Joe Burrow, Josh Allen and even Baker Mayfield.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nNominate Pick Six for The People's Choice Podcast Awards: https://www.podcastawards.com/app/signup/\nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @PriscoCBS\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
