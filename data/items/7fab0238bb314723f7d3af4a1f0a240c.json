  "description": "<p>We study the impact of an environment on the electromagnetic responses of a\nmolecule in the presence of a dielectric medium. By applying the dipole-dipole\ncoupling between the molecule's and the environment's degrees of freedom, we\ncan reduce the complex system into its components and predict excitation\nlifetimes of single and few molecules attached to a dielectric surface by\nknowing the entire quantum-mechanical properties of the molecules, such as\ntransition energies and dipole moments. The derived theory allows for the\ndescription of superradiance between two molecules depending on the geometric\narrangement between both concerning their separation and orientation with\nrespect to each other. We analyse the possibility of superradiance between two\nmolecules bound to a dielectric sphere and determine a change of the relevant\nlength scale where the usually considered wavelength in free space is replaced\nwith the binding distance, drastically reducing the length scales at which\ncollective effects can take place.\n</p>",
