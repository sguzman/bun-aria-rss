  "description": "I grew up with that famous Groucho Marx joke, “I wouldn’t want to belong to a club that would have me as a member.” It always resonated with me. As my grandfather would say, “I resemble that remark.” We all know that belonging -- to a tribe, a family, a group of any sort -- is a key part of human happiness; science bears this out. But my guest today, Sebene Selassie, is taking this concept of belonging to a much, much deeper level. To the “oneness with the universe” level. That’s obviously one of the world’s greatest spiritual cliches, but in her new book, Seb unpacks and defends the concept incredibly effectively. The book is called “You Belong.” Seb is a writer and teacher based in Brooklyn. She is a regular on the Ten Percent Happier app. And she is a great and valued friend.\nWhere to find Sebene Selassie online:\nWebsite: https://www.sebeneselassie.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sebeneselassie\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sebeneselassie\nBook Mentioned:\nYou Belong by Sebene Selassie: https://www.sebeneselassie.com/youbelong\nWe care deeply about supporting you in your meditation practice, and feel that providing you with high quality teachers is one of the best ways to do that.
