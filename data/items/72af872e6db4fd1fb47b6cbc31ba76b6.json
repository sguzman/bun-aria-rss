In his book <em>Hippie Food: How Back-to-the-Landers, Longhairs, and Revolutionaries Changed the Way We Eat</em> Kauffman journeys back more than half a century—to the 1960s and 1970s—to tell the story of how a coterie of unusual men and women embraced an alternative lifestyle that would ultimately change how modern Americans eat. Impeccably researched, <em>Hippie Food</em> chronicles how the longhairs, revolutionaries, and back-to-the-landers rejected the square establishment of President Richard Nixon’s America and turned to a more idealistic and wholesome communal way of life and food.</p>\n<p><em>Eat Your Words</em> is powered by <a href=\"http://simplecast.com\">Simplecast</a></p>\n",
