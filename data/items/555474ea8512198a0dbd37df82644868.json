  "description": "<p>YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE YESTERDAY. We are all governed by fear. Even when good things happen, we’re afraid they will go away. Once you accept and welcome your fear, it won’t have control over you anymore. It’s about embracing the duality. You have to be ok with the best outcome and the worst outcome. Here’s the truth: you don’t have to live anxious and scared. You don’t have to be governed by your story. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about increasing your receiving vibration with a comedian turned motivational speaker: Kyle Cease. Kyle Cease is a New York Times best-selling author with two #1 Comedy Central specials to his credit. He has been a guest speaker at thousands of colleges, summits, and Fortune 500 conferences and has made over 100 TV and movie appearances. Kyle teaches that most of our “triggers” are fears we have based on old stories. Once we dig deep to figure out where those are rooted, we can stop letting them control us. So get ready to learn how to let go of fear on Episode 839.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhy do we resist fear? (56:30)<br />\nHow do we overcome our fears?
