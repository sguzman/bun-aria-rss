  "description": "<p>We prove large deviation principles (LDPs) for random matrices in the\northogonal group and Stiefel manifold, determining both the speed and good\nconvex rate functions that are explicitly given in terms of certain\nlog-determinants of trace-class operators and are finite on the set of\nHilbert-Schmidt operators $M$ satisfying $\\|MM^*\\|&lt;1$. As an application of\nthose LDPs, we determine the precise large deviation behavior of\n$k$-dimensional random projections of high-dimensional product distributions\nusing an appropriate interpretation in terms of point processes, also\ncharacterizing the space of all possible deviations. The case of uniform\ndistributions on $\\ell_p$-balls, $1\\leq p \\leq \\infty$, is then considered and\nreduced to appropriate product measures. Those applications generalize\nconsiderably the recent work [Johnston, Kabluchko, Prochno: Projections of the\nuniform distribution on the cube - a large deviation perspective, Studia\nMathematica 264 (2022), 103-119].\n</p>",
