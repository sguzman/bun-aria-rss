  "description": "Nick Saban got paid a lot of money to coach Alabama last year. He will get more money thanks to his new deal because nobody will listen to our plan to trick coaches into signing terrible incentive-laden contracts. Don't worry, most of this podcast isn't about the crazy money college football coaches make at the top. It's pointless meanderings about grocery stores, like:\n- Can you beat Whole Foods at their own hot bar game?\n- Is Trader Joe's for assholes?\n- Did you know there are grocery stores where you can buy liquor?\n- Why are there grocery stores that don't sell liquor?\n- Are Publix Subs that good?\n- What's the B in H.E.B. stand for?\n- Pork bleaching?\nLearn more about your ad choices.
