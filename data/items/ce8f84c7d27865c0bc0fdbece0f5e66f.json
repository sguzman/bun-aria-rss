But unlike President Trump, he’s not quite convinced China would intentionally devalue the Yuan. Then Alberto Ramos, Goldman Sachs Head of LatAm Economics, came on to talk through Brazil’s economic reality and their complex election on the horizon.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
