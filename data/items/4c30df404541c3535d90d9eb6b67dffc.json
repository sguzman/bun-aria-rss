  "title": "A Defense of the Neoliberal Order with Glenn Hubbard + Big Tech Antitrust Bills",
  "description": "Glenn Hubbard is Professor and Dean Emeritus at Columbia Business School, and also served as Chair of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers, among others. In his new book, \"The Wall and the Bridge: Fear and Opportunity in Disruption's Wake\", he addresses the underlying forces behind the global populist anxiety by reimagining the process of \"building bridges, not walls\". He talks with Bethany and Luigi about trade, reforming social insurance, preparing the labor force for technological change, and the role of state, markets, and community in the economy.\n\nFor our Is/Isn't segment (43:44), Bethany and Luigi discuss the latest antitrust effort in the U.S. Congress to regulate Big Tech – the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which could be up for a vote this summer.",
