  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrats are running the whitest most translucent field of candidates ever. They rely on racial diversity so much that their entire slate is white. Yet, Sen. Berne Sanders says that America is racist from top to bottom, does that make him a racist from top to bottom? Sanders is not truly a Democratic socialist, he believes in Marxist socialism but he doesn't believe in Democracy. He just wants to double the size of our government and use it to destroy our lifestyles. That's the thing about Marxism, you have to destroy things in order to rebuild them in your socialist image. Then, Michael Bloomberg is an oligarch spending hundreds of millions to influence state and local races to protect and advance his own personal interests in red China. Later, President Trump has proposed an excellent budget that would balance the federal budget within 15 years while protecting social security and the military.  Finally, Mark Meckler, President of Citizens for Self Governance, calls in to give us an update on South Dakota and convention of states.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
