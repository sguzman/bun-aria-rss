  "title": "279: How To Stay Politically Engaged Without Losing Your Mind | Sharon Salzberg",
  "description": "In the heat of an election that is both incredibly nasty and hugely consequential, it might be tempting to try to shut out all the feelings of anger, frustration, and powerlessness. But my guest today makes a compelling argument for engagement -- and for the notion that nothing should be excluded from your meditation practice, not even politics. Sharon Salzberg has a new book, called Real Change, which is about how to stay socially, civically, and politically engaged without losing your mind. We talk about how to develop patience when it seems there’s no light at the end of the tunnel; why it’s wise to cultivate compassion, even for people you find deeply objectionable; and ways to limit our Twitter doomscrolling, something Sharon struggles with herself. Loyal listeners will know Sharon well. She’s a towering figure on the American meditation scene, the cofounder of the Insight Meditation Society, the author of several books, including Real Love, Real Happiness and Real Happiness at Work, and a founding teacher on the Ten Percent Happier app.\nWhere to find Sharon Salzberg online: \nWebsite: https://www.sharonsalzberg.com/ \nPodcast: https://www.sharonsalzberg.com/metta-hour-podcast/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sharonsalzberg\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SharonSalzberg/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sharonsalzberg/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/SharonSalzbergVideo\nBook Mentioned:\nReal Change by Sharon Salzberg: https://www.sharonsalzberg.com/realchange/\nTo find meditations and courses guided by Sharon Salzberg in the Ten Percent Happier app, visit https://10percenthappier.app.link/SharonSalzberg \nOther Resources Mentioned:\nJay Michaelson / https://www.jaymichaelson.net/\nReal Change: Sharon Salzberg in conversation with Anu Gupta / https://asiasociety.org/new-york/events/real-change-sharon-salzberg-conversation-anu-gupta\nOren Jay Sofer / https://www.orenjaysofer.com/\nMudita Nisker and Dan Clurman / http://www.comoptions.com/ \nBell Hooks / http://www.bellhooksinstitute.com/\nMaillka Dutt / https://mallikadutt.com/about/\nAdditional Resources:\nTen Percent Happier Live: https://tenpercent.com/live\nCoronavirus Sanity Guide: https://www.tenpercent.com/coronavirussanityguide\nFree App access for Frontline Workers: https://tenpercent.com/care\nFull Shownotes: https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/sharon-salzberg-279\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
