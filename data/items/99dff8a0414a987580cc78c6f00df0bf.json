Craig is f*cking nuts. He's done more sh-t in his life than 5 of us will. And he loves mushrooms. Because they're part of a healthy breakfast. So what better way to celebrate this year's shroomfest than to talk to a wild man about the magic fungus. It was a really fun episode. I hope you all have a wonderful shroomfest. I'll see you on the other side of the galaxy.</span></p>",
