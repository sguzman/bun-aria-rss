  "description": "This week we give you part 2 with Tim Gombis!  Together Mike, Bonnie and Tim sit down with Gombis to discuss if God is actually in control or if we read this (and other) doctrine into the text.  \n\nIf you haven’t already listened, we encourage you to listen to part one that began when Tim Gombis wrote a blog post asserting that God may not actually be in control.  \n\nThe arc of topics in these two episodes include God’s omniscience, the Church and the implications of control, the role of the Bible in our life of faith, and if it’s permissible to read doctrine into the Text.  \n\nThis is part 2 of a 4 part series in which we will do an outdo on many of the major topics discussed in this series.  \n\nTo find out more about Tim Gombis or read his original blog post, you can visit: www.timgombis.com\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\n\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
