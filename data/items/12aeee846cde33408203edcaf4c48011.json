  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys discuss Colombo mob boss, Sonny Franzese's son, John, who was recently outed by an Indianapolis newspaper with his daily routine and locations published, and try to decide if he's a rat or not and whether they all would flip on their dads if necessary. The guys also cover two elephants dying at the Indianapolis Zoo which spawns a conversation about what type of zoo animal each of the guys would choose as a pet. Also included are conversations about a man in Canada taking it upon himself to fill in potholes and being paid with weed and whether or not any of the guys would consider doing something like that in Indianapolis, a heated debate regarding if George Clooney is overrated or not, some movie talk, and as always, the guys each pick a couple of songs for Friday Bangerz to help catapult you into the weekend. It's a fun one, come and have a good time with us.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode features @toddmccomas, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @HeyGorman, @VivalaZito, @evanfoxy, and @baileymccomas</p>\n",
