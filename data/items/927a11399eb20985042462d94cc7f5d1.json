  "description": "<p>The task of testing whether two uncharacterized devices behave in the same\nway, known as cross-platform verification, is crucial for benchmarking quantum\nsimulators and near-term quantum computers. Cross-platform verification becomes\nincreasingly challenging as the system's dimensionality increases, and has so\nfar remained intractable for continuous variable quantum systems. In this\nLetter, we develop a data-driven approach, working with limited noisy data and\nsuitable for continuous variable quantum states. Our approach is based on a\nconvolutional neural network that assesses the similarity of quantum states\nbased on a lower-dimensional state representation built from measurement data.\nThe network can be trained offline with classically simulated data, and is\ndemonstrated here on non-Gaussian quantum states for which cross-platform\nverification could not be achieved with previous techniques. It can also be\napplied to cross-platform verification of quantum dynamics and to the problem\nof experimentally testing whether two quantum states are equivalent up to\nGaussian unitary transformations.\n</p>",
