  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, at America's constitutional convention the framers spent five months brainstorming how to make and keep a republic. The Democrats have spent this entire election trying to remake America. It would help America if citizens could get information and decide for themselves on the various election cases, but the dishonest media says that everything is frivolous. The Pennsylvania case before the Supreme Court is solid and important. No one knows how the court will handle the case, but it remains extremely important nonetheless. Then, the plenary power of states must be defined so that its limits are clear otherwise a lawful election process will remain unknown. Plenary power does not mean a state can violate its own state constitution in order to influence or affect an election. This case is not about disenfranchising 2.4 million mail-in voters, it's about disenfranchising the more than 4 million other PA voters and more than 70 million other American voters who are negatively impacted by the decisions of the state in this case. Also, if this PA case arrives in Congress they will sort it out because they have a job to do, just like the US Supreme Court has a job to do too. Beyond chiming in on the next cultural case where they can stifle religious liberty. Ultimately, the mob will not rule. Outside of the abortion issue, the left doesn't advocate for choice because ultimately they're totalitarians. Additionally, it’s the anniversary of Pearl Harbor and it’s important to recognize it. If a people lose their history, they will lose their country. Later, some establishment Republicans and publications like National Review no longer have any purpose. They compare Constitutionalists to the extreme radical left. Yet, how many constitutional conservative patriots have burned down a storefront, punched a police officer, or condoned ballot fraud? Imagine if George Washington or Abraham Lincoln listened to critics saying he's lost the confidence of the troops and that they should just move on. These pseudo-conservatives are more concerned with positioning themselves for the future and how newsrooms will view them. Afterward, Mitt Romney says that Washington needs to plead for people to wear masks and social distance. Meanwhile, other countries have become complete police states and it has not impacted the spread of the virus. However, the fascistic media makes viewers believe that you're either for Anthony Fauci or against him, or that you're either for Trump or against him.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
