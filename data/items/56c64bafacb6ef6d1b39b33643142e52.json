  "description": "<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>When I joined Google last year to lead G Suite, I couldn’t have imagined how the world was about to change. But in a few short months, working together took on a whole new meaning, and meetings became about so much more than getting things done. From doctor check-up meetings, to meetings with financial advisors, to study meetings, workout meetings, and birthday meetings. They may not look or feel like traditional meetings, but they’re the most important meetings happening right now.</p><p>That’s why we’ve re-engineered Google Meet, originally built for secure business meetings, to make it free and available to all. Since making Meet's advanced features free for all G Suite and G Suite for Education users in March, we've seen daily usage grow by 30x, with Meet hosting 3 billion minutes of video meetings daily. Last month, we were adding roughly 3 million new users every day. That's why we're expanding the offering to more people around the world.</p><p>Now that the rollout <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/meet/bringing-google-meet-to-more-people/\">we announced</a> two weeks ago is complete, anyone with an email address can sign up and get started at <a href=\"http://meet.google.com\">meet.google.com</a>, for free. And to make meetings even more accessible and helpful, in the coming days you’ll also be able to use Meet directly in Gmail.<br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_carousel\"><div class=\"h-c-page article-module\" data-component=\"uni-image-carousel\"><div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\"><ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\"><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure class=\"h-c-grid\"><div aria-label=\"None\" class=\"article-carousel__slide-img h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1\" data-loading='{\n                      \"mobile\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Gmail_1_Meet_in_Gmail_highlight.max-1000x1000.png\",\n                      \"desktop\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Gmail_1_Meet_in_Gmail_highlight.max-2000x2000.png\"\n                    }' style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Gmail_1_Meet_in_Gmail_highlight.max-200x200.png);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">None</span></div></figure></li><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure class=\"h-c-grid\"><div aria-label=\"None\" class=\"article-carousel__slide-img h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Gmail-2.-Start-a-meeting-v3_kw.gif);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">None</span></div></figure></li><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure class=\"h-c-grid\"><div aria-label=\"None\" class=\"article-carousel__slide-img h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Gmail-3-Join-a-meeting-v3_kw.gif);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">None</span></div></figure></li></ul><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate glue-pagination-previous uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n            \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n            \"category\": \"interaction\",\n            \"action\": \"image carousel\",\n            \"label\": \"arrow - left click\"\n           }' data-glue-pagination-label=\"Previous\" data-glue-pagination-update-model=\"false\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate-wrap\"><svg class=\"h-c-icon h-c-icon--keyboard-arrow-left\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#mi-keyboard-arrow-right\"></use></svg></div></div><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate glue-pagination-next uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n            \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n            \"category\": \"interaction\",\n            \"action\": \"image carousel\",\n            \"label\": \"arrow - right click\"\n           }' data-glue-pagination-label=\"Next\" data-glue-pagination-update-model=\"false\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate-wrap\"><svg class=\"h-c-icon h-c-icon--keyboard-arrow-right\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#mi-keyboard-arrow-right\"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class=\"h-c-carousel__navigation\"><div class=\"glue-pagination-page-list uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n            \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n            \"category\": \"interaction\",\n            \"action\": \"image carousel\",\n            \"label\": \"arrow - dot click\"\n           }'></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Click “Start a meeting\" and a new window opens with a unique, secure meeting for you to join and then share with others. You can also easily join meetings shared with you by entering a meeting code. And you can plan video meetings and invite others directly from Google Calendar.</p><p>Because video meetings have never been more important, we’ve been fast-tracking the most requested features for Meet, and are now making them available to all. Anyone can use Meet’s simple scheduling and screen sharing, real-time captions, and layouts that adapt to your preference, including an <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/productivity-collaboration/introducing-tiled-view-and-other-top-requested-features-in-google-meet\">expanded tiled view</a>—all built on Google’s secure, reliable global infrastructure. Speaking from my own experience, the new features in Meet are already making our team (and my family) meetings better. We love how tiled view makes us feel more connected—and the occasional surprise visits from kids and family pets! </p><p>And we’re continuing to look for ways to make Google Meet more accessible and useful. For example, we know video meetings can be challenging to follow for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, which is why we made sure AI-powered automatic live captioning was available to everyone. One of the most meaningful emails I’ve received was from a parent whose child was able to feel more included thanks to live captioning. Google AI has also made it possible to provide helpful features like low-light mode, which can <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P4p6CdOhkvQ\">automatically adjust your video</a> to make you more visible to others.</p><p>Meet is available for free for everyone at <a href=\"http://meet.google.com\">meet.google.com</a> and on <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1013231476\">iOS</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.meetings\">Android</a>. If you have an existing Google Account (for example, if you’re a @gmail.com user), you can sign in at <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/\">meet.google.com</a> to get started. If you don’t have a free Google Account, it only takes a minute to create one using your work or personal email address of choice (we require this step as a security measure, and you’ll only need to do this once). Or look for Meet right in Gmail.  </p><p>We hope Meet will help you connect to all your important meetings—from work meetings, to graduation meetings, to wedding meetings, and everything in between.</p></div></div></body></html>",
