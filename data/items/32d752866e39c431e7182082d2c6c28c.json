We discuss the unacceptable death of a young woman, as described by her grieving mother, and media coverage that conveys the opposite of what is true. We discuss GoFundMe, and recommend the hashtag #GoTruckYourself. We hear words from Canadian politicians, and from a corporal in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who speaks of his duty to neither comply, nor be complicit, with unlawful policies and regulations. We discuss Joe Rogan, flak over the target, crossing the Rubicon, and grief.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p> </p><p>Vivo Barefoot: Shoes for healthy feet—comfortable and regenerative, enhances stability and tactile feedback.
