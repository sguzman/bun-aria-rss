  "description": "<p>Jessica Kirson met me at Gas Digital studios to tell me about what her daughter has been going through with heart surgeries. Her kid was born with major heart problems so she's been through multiple surgeries before she was 4 years old. So she's spent tons of times at Children's Hospital. It's crazy what Children's Hospital does for some of these kids. Jessica has seen it all while she's been there. Both with her own daughter and with other people's kids as well. </p> <p>Make sure to watch her debut special on http://www.comedycentral.com that's out right now! She fucking kills!</p> <p>The Music:<br /> I Hope You Dance - Lee Ann Womack<br /> Jessica - Rick Springfield<br /> Hospital Food - Eels<br /> I Will Survive - Cake</p>",
