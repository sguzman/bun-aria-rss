  "description": "<p>A room filled with some heroes - Dan Hanzus, Marc Sessler, Gregg Rosenthal and Colleen Wolfe recap all the latest news from around the league. We begin the show with an important ATN announcement (2:23) before getting into the news. Kareem Hunt’s trade request was swiftly denied by the Browns (10:20), and Matt Rhule spoke about Sam Darnold trade rumors (13:37). We round up some injuries around the league (17:02) and take a trip to the kicker club to celebrate Justin Tucker’s extension (24:01). Then, we combine Connie’s Camp Check-Ins with Gregg’s training camp takeaways, starting with Colleen’s recent trip to Rams camp (33:25). The Patriots have struggled with their new offensive scheme in practices (38:27). Colleen gives us her observations from Bucs training camp (44:53), Carson Wentz continues to struggle with accuracy (48:18), Colleen is excited about the Colts this season (51:42), and the heroes have concerns with the Packers’ offensive line situation (55:55). The gang runs through some rookies to watch in the preseason (57:30) before we spin through another round of Camp Quotables (1:04:34), hearing from Matt Rhule (again), Mike McCarthy, Geno Smith, Carl Lawson, Russell Wilson and Dan Campbell.</p>\n<p>Note: timecodes approximate.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
