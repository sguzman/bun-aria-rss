  "description": "This episode continues to cover skill position prospects in the upcoming 2021 NFL Draft. Emory Hunt joins Will Brinson to focus on the running backs in this year's class. 2 UNC RBs land inside the Top 10, but Emory ranks 1 much higher and 1 much lower than the consensus. Trey Sermon balled out on a big stage at Ohio State, but will his game translate to the next level? Jermar Jefferson, Khalil Herbert and Pooka Williams are names to keep an eye on as well. Then, we get to the #3 slot which features Travis Etienne, who some have as the top back in 2021. The Alabama product, Najee Harris, leads the way, but Emory still says not to count on a RB being selected in the 1st round. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
