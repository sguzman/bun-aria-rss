    "media:description": "In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force. Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity. #stringtheory\n\n⭐️  Table of Contents ⭐️  \n⌨️  (0:00:00) Why string theory\n⌨️  (0:09:57) Classical string theory\n⌨️  (0:22:34) Quantum string theory\n\n⭐️ Credit ⭐️\nCourse Author by:  Prof.  Marcus Berg\nWebsite: https://www.youtube.com/user/marcusbergmovie/about\n\n⭐️ Join Us ⭐️\nJoin our FB Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/cslesson\nLike our FB Page: https://www.facebook.com/cslesson/​\nWebsite: https://cslesson.org/",
