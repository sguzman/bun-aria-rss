All told, 40 miles of running and 6 miles of swimming.</p><p>It was a truly extraordinary experience. Punishing. Humbling. Brutal, beautiful and beyond extreme.</p><p>Along the way we met gale force winds. Sideways rain. Bone-chilling Baltic waters. And six-foot swells. We were on our hands and knees, scaling vertical granite slippery as ice. We trudged through bogs in knee-deep mud. Loose rocks left us flat on our backs. We bushwhacked terrain so difficult, so impossibly technical, it all feels now like an impossible dream.</p><p>Today we share the incredible story.</p><p>I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><br><p><br></p><br><p><br></p><br><p><br></p><br><p>P.S. – For more on the adventure, please read Adam Skolnick's piece for the New York Times,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/sports/a-brutal-competition-island-to-island-in-sweden.html\" target=\"_blank\">A Brutal Competition, Island to Island, in Sweden.</a>&nbsp;I am deeply honored&nbsp;to be featured.
