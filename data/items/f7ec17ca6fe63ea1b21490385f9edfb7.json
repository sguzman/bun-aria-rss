  "description": "<p>What's the relation between \"truth\" and meaning? Can we scientifically verify our visions while tripping? Are psychedelics tools or teachers? Is astrology \"real?\" Why has \"myth\" come to mean something that isn't true in recent years, when no one ever claimed that myths were any truer than novels or poems? These and other questions are discussed (but not really answered) in this episode recorded on a bright, chilly Sunday afternoon in Kaş, Turkey.</p> <p>Intro music: \"Brightside of the Sun,\" by <a href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/\">Basin and Range</a>; \"Blue Sky,\" by <a href=\"https://dwaynehoover.bandcamp.com/album/ham\">Dwayne Hoover</a>; \"Smoke Alarm,\" by <a href=\"https://www.carsieblanton.com/\">Carsie Blanton</a>.</p> <p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://omgyes.com\" class=\"linkified\" target=\"_blank\">OMGYES.com</a>. <a href=\"https://www.omgyes.com/?o=tg5&utm_source=tangential&cookieConsent=false\"> Click here</a> for 10% off your lifetime membership.</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
