  "description": "<div>One cold winter night in 1991, best friends Vicki Arnold and Julie-Anne Leahy vanished from their town of Atherton, Queensland. The two women had left for a late-night fishing trip but never came home. Two weeks later, their bodies were found in Julie-Anne’s car on a remote bushland track, in the opposite direction from where they’d been headed.  <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nNarration – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/casefilehost\">Anonymous Host</a>\n</div>\n<div>Research & writing – Erin Munro</div>\n<div>Creative direction – Milly Raso<br>\nProduction and music – <a href=\"http://mikemigas.com/\">Mike Migas</a>\n</div>\n<div>Music – <a href=\"http://www.andrewjoslynmusic.com/\">Andrew D.B.
