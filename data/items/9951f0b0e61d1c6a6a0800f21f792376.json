  "description": "Hey Rehabbers,\nMost people leave this out when they talk about success. This is the most significant contributor to my success over the years. But this is also REAL FOR ME; it's who I am. I could have talked about this for over an hour, but I wanted to respect your time. Just know when people feel seen and valued, they will support you for life.\n\nFavorite Quote from episode 152\n\"Grandma told me When the world tries to get your head in the clouds, make sure you never forget where you came from to keep your feet on the ground.\"\n\nThank you, @CaitClarke8, on IG for sharing this moment.",
