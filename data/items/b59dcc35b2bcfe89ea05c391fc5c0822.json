  "description": "<p>Matt and Bow have a new daddy! And it's comedy legend Will Ferrell. Not to brag! Of course, by daddy we mean PRODUCER, as Will has just begun his new podcast platform Big Money Players Network, which Las Culturistas is so proud to be a part of! The boyz talk Will's new film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, which comes out on Netflix on June 26th, working with Rachel McAdams and Demi Lovato, and how a trip to Sweden inspired the film. They also dive into Eurovision culture, the polarizing initial reaction to Anchorman, how working at SNL inspired the rest of Will's comedy choices, and the ways in which Ron Burgundy is interacting with 2020 on The Ron Burgundy Podcast. Also, can you fucking believe Will's culture that made him say culture was for him is \"Disneyland Character Meet and Greet Culture\"?! The Cultchas are gonna have to almost pass OUT at THAT one. All this, the tale of how Matt and Bowen used to perform the Jaws Universal Studios attraction live on stages in NY (Bowen was the shark), and so much god damn more. A moment for the pod!
