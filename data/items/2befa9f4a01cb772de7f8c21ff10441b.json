Not only do we discuss the concept and how it's a new medium of socialization (that may or may not actually be better than our real lives), we talk VR Porn and our experiences with it, and lastly, we touch on how the rise of interest/hype around the metaverse has paralleled that of NFT's and Crypto's and their potential use cases. We've got celebrities like Justin Bieber and Paris Hilton on the NFT train and it's not looking like it's going to stop anytime soon. </p><br><p>Come join us this week as we wonder if the Metaverse as a current concept is too amorphous, how its development may influence the internet and real world as a whole and what the next wave of socialization will look like (and how will AR/VR fit into that)?  </p><br><p>Don't forget to follow us, review our podcast and subscribe on our socials!</p><ul><li>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BasicandBrain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@BasicandBrain</a></li><li>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/TheBasicandTheBrain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@TheBasicandTheBrain</a></li><li>TikTok: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thebasic_and_thebrain?\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@thebasic_and_thebrain</a></li><li>Website: <a href=\"https://www.thebasicandthebrain.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thebasicandthebrain.com</a></li></ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
