Today al-Kindi is regarded as one of the greatest scholars of the medieval Islamic world.\n\nWith:\n\nHugh Kennedy\nProfessor of Arabic at SOAS, University of London\n\nJames Montgomery\nSir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic Elect at the University of Cambridge\n\nAmira Bennison\nSenior Lecturer in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies at the University of Cambridge.\n\n\nProducer: Thomas Morris.",
