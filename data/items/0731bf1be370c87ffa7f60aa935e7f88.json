  "description": "<p>We all make the occasional money mistake. Some missteps are small and the impact they have is a tiny blip on our radar. Other money mistakes can be like an albatross weighing us down for years to come. But whether our mistake is more of a bump in the road or if we’ve made a mistake that will impact us for a long time, it’s important to learn how to overcome these mistakes so we can move on and start kicking butt with our money again. In this episode we cover some common mistakes we make, why we make them, and then how we can pivot to handling money well in those circumstances. And then aside from specific mistakes, broadly speaking there are some important steps to take that will allow us to move forward more quickly when we’ve made an error with our money. This is a great episode for anyone who has ever had some money regrets!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Hydrus Double IPA by Two Tides Brewing!
