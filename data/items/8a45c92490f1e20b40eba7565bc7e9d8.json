  "description": "Winter is coming. Not to get all Game of Thrones on you, but... while there are some optimistic signs on the horizon in the form of vaccines, it looks like we could be heading into some dark months of rising caseloads and restrictions on our lifestyle. Consequently, we are launching a 2-part series to help you ride this out. Next week, we will talk to happiness researcher Laurie Santos (host of the Happiness Lab podcast). Today, my guest today is Zindel Segal, a clinical psychologist from the University of Toronto and a pioneer in developing and studying ways to use mindfulness for depression and anxiety. While not all of us will experience clinical depression or anxiety in the coming months, we may well experience significant doses of sadness and worry. In this conversation, we talk about: what the science shows about the benefits of meditation for depression and anxiety; the importance of establishing and maintaining routines as a form of antidepressant; the differences between depression and anxiety; and how to treat depression like an old friend.\nWhere to find Zindel Segal online:\nWebsite: https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/psych/person/zindel-segal\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zindelsegal\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Zindel-Segal-955303284518859/\nBook Mentioned:\nLost Connections by Johann Hari: https://thelostconnections.com\n2020 has been a doozy, so this year we’re offering Ten Percent Happier subscriptions at a 40% discount.
