Themes discussed in this episode include: seeing and not seeing, reason’s response to faith, the dream motif, the similarities with the story of Iphigenia, baptism and crossing the river, and the ways relationships change over time. Another topic our hosts highlight is the tension between mysticism and rationalism and the truth that transcends the inadequacy of these.</p> <h3>Listen to The Literary Life:</h3> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>“Self-consciousness is a great barrier to faith.</p> <cite>A.
