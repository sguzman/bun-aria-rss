We&#8217;ll also follow up with yesterday&#8217;s guest for a question about refugee placement in the United States, and explain how Elon Musk made it to the top rank of the world&#8217;s richest people.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s everything we talked about on the show today:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:list --></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2022/03/16/what-the-feds-move-could-mean-for-mortgage-interest-rates/\">&#8220;What the Fed&#8217;s move could mean for mortgage interest rates&#8221;</a> from Marketplace</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080713/how-banks-set-interest-rates-your-loans.asp\">&#8220;How Banks Set Interest Rates on Your Loans&#8221;</a> from Investopedia</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/teslas-elon-musk-drives-past-jeff-bezos-in-forbes-list-of-billionaires-12582816#:~:text=There%20are%2019%20times%20as,today%20after%20adjusting%20for%20inflation.&text=Elon%20Musk%20is%20now%20the,first%20time%20in%20four%20years\">&#8220;Tesla&#8217;s Elon Musk drives past Jeff Bezos in Forbes&#8217; list of billionaires&#8221;</a> from Sky News</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/elon-musk-birthday-ceo-tesla-b1874017.html\">Elon Musk&#8217;s immense wealth — from emeralds to PayPal, SpaceX and Tesla </a>from The Independent</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n",
