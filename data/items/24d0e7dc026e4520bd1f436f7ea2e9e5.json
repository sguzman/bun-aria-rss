  "description": "<p>We got some spooky ass woods for you guys! Alaina tells us the tale of Robinson Woods located in Illinois. This place has a pretty heavy energy as it is both a Native American burial ground and the location of a triple homicide that took place in the 50s. Ash then takes us just outside of Mexico City to talk about Isla De Las Muñecas or The Island of the Dolls. This is where Don Julian Santana Barrera dedicated his days to making the island a peaceful sanctuary for the spirit of a young girl he once encountered.
