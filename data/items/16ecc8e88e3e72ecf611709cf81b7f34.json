  "description": "<p>500 EPISODES.</p><p>Over seven years ago, I sat down in a damp and echo-y warehouse on the north shore of Kauai and hit record for the very first time.</p><p>There was no agenda. No commitment to even record a second episode. And certainly zero idea that what began as a fun experiment would evolve into both a passion and a vocation.</p><p>And yet here we are. Without fail, beginning in late 2012, I have uploaded at least one episode every single week, amassing over 1000 hours of conversation and a global audience that downloads this show more than 3 million times a month — in total, over 70 million streams and counting.</p><p>The numbers are great, but they fail to capture what is truly meaningful: the opportunity to go deep and unfiltered with some of the most amazing people currently walking planet Earth; and in turn share their incredible wisdom with all of you.</p><p>Today I give thanks for taking this journey with me -- a calling and a service I consider the best job in the world. It's been a privilege -- a great honor and a profound responsibility I don’t take lightly.</p><p>I believe in celebrating milestones. So today we do just that. And we do it in style with two of my most most beloved brothers from other mothers.</p><p>Enter&nbsp;<strong>John Joseph</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Mishka Shubaly.</strong></p><p>Between these two gentlemen, I count 14 total previous appearances on the show, including one vivid episode five years past (<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-95-explicit-john-joseph-mishka-shubaly-the-post-punk-algonquin-round-table-peace-plants-pma/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RRP #95</a>) that involved the three of us huddled on a small bed in a cramped New York City hotel room.</p><p>Today we fertilize our bromance, reprising those sweet sweet punk rock, Algonquin table vibes with another turntable spin on plants & punk. On running and writing. And on addiction & sobriety.</p><p>This one is all over the place. No point in even trying to describe it other than&nbsp;that Mishka showed up with a bottle of Pepto Bismol. Kinda says it all.</p><p><strong>Heads Up:&nbsp;</strong>This conversation is packed with expletives. It might even hold the RRP f-bomb record. As many of you know, these laddies simply can’t be muzzled, nor would you want them to be. So just an alert that this episode is neither family friendly nor workplace approved.
