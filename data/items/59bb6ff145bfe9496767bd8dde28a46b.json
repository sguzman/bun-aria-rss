  "title": "Psychological Traumatology (PTSD & STRESS) with Nicholas Barr",
  "description": "<p>What happens to the brain under extreme stress? Why do past traumas haunt us? What kind of therapies work for veterans? And what can we do in day-to-day life to be more resilient to adverse experiences? Traumatologist and social worker Dr. Nicholas Barr has studied PTSD in veterans and homeless youth and explains how traumas affect the rest of our lives and how to bounce back by getting a little help. Also: great resources for lower-cost therapy and what you can do to support loved ones who have experienced trauma.
