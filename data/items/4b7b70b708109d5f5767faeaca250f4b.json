  "summary": "<p>Jupyter notebooks provide a useful environment for interactive exploration of data. A common question I get, though, is how you can progress from this nonlinear, interactive, trial-and-error style of exploration to a more linear and reproducible analysis based on organized, packaged, and tested code. This series of videos presents a case study in how I personally approach reproducible data analysis within the Jupyter notebook.</p>\n<p>Each video is approximately 5-8 minutes; the videos are\navailable in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYCpMb24GpOC704uO9svUrihl-HY1tTJJ\">YouTube Playlist</a>.\nAlternatively, below you can find the videos with some description and links to relevant resources</p>",
