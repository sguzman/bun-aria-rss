  "description": "<p>There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. You’ve heard phrases like this your entire life but are they true? And how can we specifically apply them to our personal finances? We had fun talking about some common money phrases earlier this year, but since then we’ve realized that there were a <em>bunch</em> of good ones we didn’t cover! So we figured it was a good idea to hit up even <em>more</em> common money phrases that we’ve all heard and dissect them. And the reason we feel this is surprisingly important is because the sayings we hear can often bore into our brains and if we hear them enough we believe them as fact. But many of these common sayings have flaws in them or are just downright wrong. So have a listen as we think through some more money sayings and how they apply to our personal finances.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Elderberry Northwest Sour Ale by Cascade Brewing!
