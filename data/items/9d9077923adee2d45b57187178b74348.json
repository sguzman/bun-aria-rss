  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrats lack virtue and are exploiting the coronavirus. The media makes angels and devils of people, but former First Lady Michelle Obama will get a pass and won't be criticized for her hateful comments about President Trump. John Adams famously said. \"Liberty can no more exist without virtue and independence than the body can live and move without a soul.\" Then, Kamala Harris wants Plexiglas at the VP debate to advance the Democrat narrative that Trump killed all of the people that have died from the viruses. But for President Trump, states that squandered their budgets and failed to prepare would have been short-handed on PPE, ventilators, and six Trillion in emergency stimulus cash. Plus, Stanley Kurtz joins the show to request that Nikole Hannah-Jones from the NY Times be stripped from any consideration for a Pulitzer Prize for her 1619 project. Afterward, Joe Biden's bigotry is on display again. This time he said he was able to stay sequestered in his home because some Black woman stocked the grocery shelves. Finally, candidate Bob Good for Virginia’s 5th congressional district calls in with an update on his campaign.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
