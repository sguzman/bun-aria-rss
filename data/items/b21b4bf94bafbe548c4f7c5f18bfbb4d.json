  "description": "<div>Trev's got his glasses on so you know this is a super smart episode. The  boys do some investigative journalism and figure out that Bigfoot  probably had a hairy dick, the Golden Generation was actually pretty  shitty, and then learn all about MMA fucking. They also decide that  fingering your own ass in the afternoon is a bad idea.  <br>\n<br>\nWant the full episode?
