  "description": "<p>When it comes to San Diego, few other homes carry the historical significance of the Whaley House. It was built in 1856 by Thomas Whaley, Jr., who had followed the call of the Gold Rush from New York. The home would become a social center in San Diego and over the years it would serve as a courthouse, theater, school and many other businesses. The spot Whaley chose to build his home upon seemed like a choice piece of land, but the history says otherwise. This was hanging ground. And one executed criminal by the name of Yankee Jim seems to have stayed right there on that land, even when a house was built on that spot. The Whaley House is considered by some to be THE most haunted house in America. There are several spirits that seem to be here, both of the human persuasion and animals. The house was thought to be cursed. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Whaley House! The Moment in Oddity features Mallows Bay and This Day in History is by April Rogers-Krick and features the San Francisco fire of 1851.
