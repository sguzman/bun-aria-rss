  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, does the Mississippi abortion law violate the federal constitution? If it doesn't, then the Roe V. Wade decision can be weakened. Even Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has acknowledged that their basis for Roe v. wade was not rooted in the Constitution. The 14th Amendment freed the slaves and has nothing to do with abortion. It is not a right to privacy to murder a child in a woman's womb. Even if the Supreme Court finds that these laws can't be upheld federally, states will still have the right to authorize them. Then, the Solicitor General argued that viability was central to one's 'right' to abortion. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas questioned where such a right is found in the U.S Constitution. Later, Anthony Fauci announces the first Omicron variant case which emerged in San Francisco, CA, and the infected individual was fully vaccinated. Fauci still can't find an answer to why border crossers are being admitted into the country without testing or vaccinations. Afterward, Sen. Mike Lee joins the show to discuss his plan to shut down Biden's vaccine mandate by attaching it to an upcoming continuing resolution from Congress. The government was happy to shut down private businesses but is fearful to have a government shutdown for even a single day.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
