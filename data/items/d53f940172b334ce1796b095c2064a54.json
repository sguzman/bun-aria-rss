  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, thanks to Big Media, America is engaged in a conversation on mass shootings, and mental illness with no real facts, or hard data. A word of thanks also goes to Mitch McConnell and the RINO Republicans for discussing pointless gun control measures in Congress, even though there isn't a single bill they could pass that would stop crazy people from hurting innocent people. We must thank President Biden for focusing his attention on 9mm pistols and revealing how senseless their gun-grabbing desires are, right? Then, the increased cost of every gallon of gas that you pay for is squarely Biden's fault. By limiting the production of energy, you increase the demand and the price. This was clear 14 months ago when this program noted that increased federal spending and decreased energy supply would drag us over the cliff to inflation and into a recession. All because of leftist climate ideology, not economics. Later, The Democrat Party and American Marxists never leave what's good alone; they create anarchy in energy production, our food supply, and our policies. Secretary Janet Yellen admits that she was wrong about inflation. Secretary Vilsack wants to transform agriculture. Democrats have destroyed our cultural history and economy. Afterward, according to FEC filings the Uvalde Police Chief, Pete Arredondo, donated to Democrat Beto O'Rourke's campaign in 2017. O'Rourke is famous for saying he was coming for your AR-15 if elected President. MSNBC host Joy Reid entertained commentary on her program that suggested that the police response was slowed due to the community being poor or Hispanic. Incidentally, this makes no sense as it is believed that Chief Arredondo, a Uvalde native, is also of Hispanic heritage. Finally, Andrew Pollack, whose daughter was murdered at Stoneman Douglas High School, calls in to tell parents to demand more security in schools. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
