  "description": "In Episode #217, I sit down with dietician Ginny Messina to address common nutrition myths about the vegan diet.\nWith an abundance of nutrition “information” presented to us any time we use social media, it becomes difficult to identify whether a claim is fact or fiction. Misinformation is a common issue across all patterns of eating — including a plant-based diet — and understanding the full picture is incredibly important to ensure health and longevity. Ginny Messina, MPH, RD joins me to address common nutrition myths about the vegan diet, providing a broader view that will help plant-based eaters make sense of nutrition needs.\nIn this episode, we address 16 myths that could have negative health implications if followed. Ginny Messina speaks to the limitations and strengths of the evidence that we have, provides recommendations for optimal health, and discusses the ethical reasons for making diet choices. We also cover supplementation, concerns about vegan diets, and how to evaluate claims you find online.\nSpecifically, we discuss:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nBecoming Vegan (3:13)\n\nRisks of Vegan Misinformation (10:16)\n\nWhole Food Diets (20:36)\n\nAre Humans Herbivores? (22:55)\n\nProtein Myth (25:42)\n\nProcessed Vegan Food (28:05)\n\nCalcium Needs (30:07)\n\nDairy: Cancer & Addiction (33:40)\n\nSeafood & Mercury (39:34)\n\nLow Fat (44:18)\n\nWhole Foods vs Processed (51:47)\n\nOil-Free (59:01)\n\nRaw Foods Diet (1:04:30)\n\nVitamin B12 (1:08:35)\n\nSupplementing (1:23:16)\n\nMedication & Statins (1:31:38)\n\nIndustry Funded Research (1:34:36)\n\nGreatest Risk to Vegans (1:39:40)\n\nOutro (1:43:55)\n\n\nTo connect with Ginny, you can find her on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
