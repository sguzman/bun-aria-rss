  "description": "<p>A Michigan mother says that the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants threatened to kill her if she did not kill her 3-year-old daughter. Prosecutors say 22-year-old Justine Johnson stabbed the girl multiple times, then discarded her body in a trash bag at her home. Johnson says she had been experiencing hallucinations amid weeks of heroin withdrawal and lack of sleep. Johnson's brothers found the little girl hidden in a back room, a small foot sticking out of the trash bag. Police searched the home and found bloodstains on a closet door, couches and items in a bedroom. Three knives were also recovered. Inside the bag, investigators found Sutton’s body wrapped in a comforter and a pair of jeans that had traces of blood on them. Johnson is being held on charges of felony murder and first-degree child abuse in connection with the death of her daughter, Sutton Mosser.</p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Stacey Honowitz - Assistant State Attorney (Florida), Sex Crimes & Child Abuse Unit, Author: \"My Private Parts are Private\", \"Genius with a Penis - Don't Touch!\" and “The Bully at School is Really Uncool”, staceyhonowitz.com, Instagram: @staceybhonowitz</li>\n<li>Dr. Angela Arnold - Psychiatrist, (Atlanta GA) www.angelaarnoldmd.com, Expert in the Treatment of Pregnant/Postpartum Women, Former Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology: Emory University, Former Medical Director of The Psychiatric Ob-Gyn Clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital</li>\n<li>Dan Corsentino - Former Police Chief, Former Sheriff, Served on US Homeland Security Senior Advisory Board, Private Investigator www.dancorsentino.com </li>\n<li>Dr. Kendall Crowns – Chief Medical Examiner Tarrant County (Ft Worth), Lecturer: University of Texas and Texas A&M, Affiliated Faculty: University of Texas Medical Branch</li>\n<li>Cole Waterman - Crime Reporter, MLive.com, Instagram: @dollarshort, Twitter: @ColeWaterman</li>\n</ul><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
