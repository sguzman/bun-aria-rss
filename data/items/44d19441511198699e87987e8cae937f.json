  "description": "<p>Who and where do you want to be in the future? It's a question we typically answer by looking ahead. But, my guest would say, you can actually best find the answer by looking back.</p>\n<p>His name is William Damon, and he's a Stanford psychologist who studies adult development and purpose, and the author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2V18xcq\"><em>A Round of Golf With My Father: The New Psychology of Exploring Your Past to Make Peace With Your Present</em></a>. On the show today, Bill explains why you should consider doing something called a \"life review,\" a process you can initiate at any age in order to get greater clarity on what is now probably a blur of memories around how you ended up who and where you are today. Bill explains the steps of doing a life review, and how doing one can do two things for you: 1) help you think more positively and gratefully about your life story — even its regrets — and understand why you made certain choices and developed as you did, and 2) help you refine your life's purpose, recognize that you can change and grow no matter where you are in the life cycle, and chart a course for further development in the future. Bill does this through the lens of the fascinating story around how he came to do his own life review, in order to better get to know himself, by getting to know his father, who he was told growing up was killed in World War II, but, Bill would discover, in fact survived the war and led a more complex life than Bill could have imagined.</p>\n",
