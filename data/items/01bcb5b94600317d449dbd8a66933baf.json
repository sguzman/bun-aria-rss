  "description": "Brad Marchand contains multitudes. Sure, the Boston Bruins winger could be called the most hated man in hockey, back on the ice tonight after serving his latest suspension - his second of the season. But Marchand is also one of the top scorers in the NHL, integral to the Bruins’ offense. He’s known for cheap shots, punching opposing players, licking faces, and was once given the nickname “Little Ball of Hate” from former President Barack Obama. Greg Wyshynski joins us to discuss Marchand’s reputation, his impact on the Bruins, and how we’ll look back on his legacy.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
