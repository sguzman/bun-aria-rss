  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, people across America regardless of age, race, or genitalia despise the direction Joe Biden is taking the country, and are concerned over his capacity to serve as President. A NY Times poll shows that a growing number of Democrat voters want a different candidate than Biden in 2024. Why hasn't Mitch McConnell ever mentioned the 25th Amendment? Then, the imposition of the Marxists' ideology is how they plan to take over the country. They take control over the courts, congress, and other institutions to control you - We The People. The entire fury over Roe v. Wade is over their loss of power in the Supreme Court, not over their concocted ideas like 'privacy rights.' Later, Steve Bannon received a letter from former President Trump waiving executive privilege and allowing Bannon to testify before the Jan. 6 Committee. Judge Carl Nichols knows full well that the Jan. 6 Committee doesn't allow exculpatory evidence or contrary witnesses, and that they squelch information that doesn't benefit their political cause, yet this Judge is allowing injustice to occur. Afterward, Congresswoman Lauren Boebert calls in to discuss her new book \"My American Life.\" Boebert also discussed her re-election campaign for congress in Colorado. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
