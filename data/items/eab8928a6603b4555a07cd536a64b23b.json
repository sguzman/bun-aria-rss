  "description": "<p>On today's show, Triple H officially joins the show while Pat records from his hotel room in Orlando as the guys battle a couple of technical issues to get the everything up and running. They discuss everything Pat has done on his trip in Orlando so far including exploring Pandora at Universal Studios and Pat gives his overall assessment of Disney World as he spent the entire day there earlier this week. They also do a deep dive into all the chaos of NFL free agency so far including AB to Raiders and what Jon Gruden's thoughts on the entire matter are, Lev Bell landing in New York and whether or not that makes the Jets a contender at all, and OBJ being shipped from the Giants to Cleveland and how the Browns might finally be ready to take over the AFC North with all the acquisitions that they've made so far this offseason. To close out the show, lead commentator for Smackdown Live and all around electric human being, Tom Phillips, joins the show live from the WWE performance center. They discuss everything pertaining to the NFL draft as Tom is an NFL nut who enjoys the draft process. He gives out a couple of his picks for where he thinks certain players will wind up, and gives his thoughts on AQ Shipley, as well as the cult of Penn State football. Also included are some special appearances by Triple H and Michael Cole (1:22:59-1:56:38). It's a great one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
