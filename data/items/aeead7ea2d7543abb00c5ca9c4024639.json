  "description": "<p>Like so many technological innovations, the internet is something that burst on the scene and pervaded human life well before we had time to sit down and think through how something like that should work and how it should be organized. In multiple ways — as a blogger, activist, fiction writer, and more — Cory Doctorow has been thinking about how the internet is affecting our lives since the very beginning. He has been especially interested in legal issues surrounding copyright, publishing, and free speech, and recently his attention has turned to broader economic concerns. We talk about how the internet has become largely organized through just a small number of quasi-monopolistic portals, how this affects the ways in which we gather information and decide whether to trust outside sources, and where things might go from here.</p><p>Cory Doctorow is a science fiction writer, activist, journalist, and blogger. He is a co-editor of the website&nbsp;<em>Boing Boing</em>, and works as a special consultant for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He is the author of the nonfiction book&nbsp;<em>Information Doesn’t Want to Be Free</em>&nbsp;as well as science-fiction works such as&nbsp;<em>Walkaway</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Radicalized</em>.
