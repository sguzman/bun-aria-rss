  "description": "<p>It is shown that the Dirac equation with the Coulomb potential can be solved\nusing the algebra of the three spinor invariants of the Dirac equation without\nthe involvement of the methods of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The Dirac\nHamiltonian is invariant with respect to the rotation transformation, which\nindicates the dynamical (hidden) symmetry $ SU(2) $ of the Dirac equation. The\ntotal symmetry of the Dirac equation is the symmetry $ SO(3) \\otimes SU(2) $.\nThe generator of the $ SO(3) $ symmetry group is given by the total momentum\noperator, and the generator of $ SU(2) $ group is given by the rotation of the\nvector-states in the spinor space, determined by the Dirac, Johnson-Lippmann,\nand the new spinor invariants. It is shown that using algebraic approach to the\nDirac problem allows one to calculate the eigenstates and eigenenergies of the\nrelativistic hydrogen atom and reveals the fundamental role of the principal\nquantum number as an independent number, even though it is represented as the\ncombination of other quantum numbers.\n</p>",
