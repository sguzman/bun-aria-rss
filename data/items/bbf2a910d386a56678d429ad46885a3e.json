It activates fisheries coastal areas by establishing FishLog Quality Centers, an O2O hybrid platform that works with local cold storage partners. These centres provide local stakeholders, including fishermen, aggregators and traders, greater access to buyers by listing their inventory in the FishLog marketplace and digitising their operation.</p>\n<p>FishLog also enables fisheries businesses to maximise upstream-to-downstream operations through its four products: inventory handling, financing, B2B marketplace, and cold storage digitisation.</p>\n<p>The fresh funding will allow FishLog to improve this ecosystem of services further by providing existing players greater access to tools, operating models, and liquidity, and enhancing the industry&#8217;s ability to process products and SKUs.</p>\n<p>Bayu Anggara, CEO and Co-Founders of FishLog, said, &#8220;While there is massive global business potential for the Indonesian fisheries sector, it has long been plagued by inefficiencies and fragmentation. Our mission at FishLog is to unlock the selling potential and maximise the storage utility of Indonesia&#8217;s fragmented fishing industry, building the best and most affordable way to ensure product and labour sustainability in the industry.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://e27.co/efishery-secures-us32m-loan-from-dbs-indonesia-to-support-expansion-move-20221007/\">eFishery secures US$32M loan from DBS Indonesia to support expansion move</a></strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Through this funding, we will continue to build the cold chain ecosystem enabler and operating system for the fisheries in Indonesia.
