  "description": "Kane tried being in groups early on, but ultimately after meeting Mister Cee in high school, the two of them would become a duo, opening up for local shows. Kane soon learns about Biz Markie and seeks him out for a battle at the infamous Albee Square Mall.  But what started as a battle turned into a lifelong friendship with Biz taking Kane under his wing.  Once Biz became a recording artist with the newly formed Juice Crew, he made sure Kane was right there with him.  Their bond was so tight that at Biz Markie's Union Square show he announced that Kane was the newest member of the crew.  But not everybody in the Juice Crew agreed.\n\nAdditional commentary by AB. Money, Steve Brown, Mister Cee, Cutmaster Cool V, MC Serch, Chris Rock and Cliff Love.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
