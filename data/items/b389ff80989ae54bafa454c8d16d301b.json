For the most part, their anti-racist commitment started and ended there. At the same time, however, the initial meetings of <a href=\"https://www.dapcollective.com/\">Design As Protest</a> and <a href=\"https://darkmatteruniversity.org/\">Dark Matter University</a> began. In their words, “DAP is a collective of designers mobilizing strategy to dismantle the privilege and power structures that use architecture and design as tools of oppression”. Emerging from DAP’s demand to create anti-racist models of design education, Dark Matter University is “an anti-racist design justice school,” which has since its establishment in early July 2020 independently expanded its network and mission to “radically transform education and practice toward a just future” from both inside and outside of academia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this episode, we talk with DAP and Dark Matter core member Quilian Riano about design justice.
