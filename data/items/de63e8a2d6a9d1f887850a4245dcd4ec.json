Walton struggled in high school and spent a few years playing video games before his mom made him apply for a job at a local surveillance chain, where he worked from 2009-2011. He became interested in starting his own business after being exposed to <em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em>. In 2014, he went out on his own and started SpyGuy, his current business. He built the business to $1 million in revenue on his own, relying on what he learned in books and podcasts, and it now brings in seven-figure revenue with five employees.</p><p>The second person joining me is journalist <strong>Elaine Pofeldt</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elainepofeldt\" target=\"_blank\">@elainepofeldt</a>), an independent journalist and speaker who specializes in careers and entrepreneurship.
