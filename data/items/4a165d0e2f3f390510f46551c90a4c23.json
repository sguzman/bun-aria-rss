  "description": "Atheist activist and author Greta Christina appears on this episode of Rationally Speaking, to discuss her new book, \"Coming Out Atheist: How to Do It, How to Help Each Other, And Why.\" A spirited debate ensues, in which Greta, Julia and Massimo disagree over the boundaries of the \"atheist movement,\" and the role of social justice in it. Other topics include: The cognitive biases that can make it hard to get a clear picture of whether people regret \"coming out\" as atheists; Plus, Greta's argument for why atheist community-building shouldn't model itself after religious communities.",
