  "description": "<p>A spectacular episode this week with author, Kliph Nesterhoff. He wrote a book called The Comedians that examines the forgotten about history from the early 1900’s all the way up to modern day stand up comedy. Kliph also has a history with punk rock and hardcore and modeled his own stand up comedy after it. I am always excited to shine a light on the intersection of two things that might not be considered “connected” but this episode shows it in spades.- - Use our Amazon Affiliate Code to support the show!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
