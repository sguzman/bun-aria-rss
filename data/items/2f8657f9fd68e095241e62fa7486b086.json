  "description": "Our guest today is interior designer Jeremy Clark based out of Birmingham and Nashville. He is the founder of Jeremy D. Clark Studio; a full-service design studio specializing in luxury residential, commercial, and hospitality projects from coast to coast. His timeless style has been featured in Veranda, Southern Living, One Kings Lane, and a variety of lifestyle blogs and publications. We talk about his layered approach to colors and patterns, his love of painted floors, his tips for tablescapes, and more!\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nHow did Jeremy get started in design?\n\nWhich designers have influenced Jeremy?\n\nHow does Jeremy incorporate so many layers and colors while staying neutral?\n\nMore about Jeremy’s Birmingham Showhouse project.\n\nWhen is a good time for a canopy bed?\n\nJeremy walks us through the Nashville Condo project.\n\nFind ideas on Jeremy’s Shop section of his website.\n\nJeremy’s tablescapes work in Veranda and his tips for decorating.\n\nWhat colors does Jeremy gravitate to?\n\nAll about Jeremy’s use of trim, textures, and patterns.\n\nWhy Jeremy loves painted floors and how to use them right.\n\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Liza,\nFirst of all, we are so sorry for your loss. We are going to help make this space awesome for you.\nYou have great pieces and your space is so charming. You said the floors were beat up, but I think they fit the 1920s bungalow vibe. In terms of art, I think we should take away the petal motif above the already decorative mantle and add something simple instead. Let’s keep that circular mirror there and add the art above the sideboard. While the Zoe Table is wonderful, for your specific space I would recommend a sleek, nesting coffee table that can be multi-functional. I love mismatching chairs, personally, so I would scour Facebook Marketplace for something that’s patterned but still neutral so it doesn’t compete with what you have. You already have lots of warm tones and wood, but to make this space even cozier I would have sofa pillows with more contrast. If you wanted to add some woven wooden shades on the windows next to the fireplace that could be really cozy. A buffet lamp just when you walk in could also add a nice, warm glow. I would also add another piece of art above the art over the sideboard to draw the eye up. Lastly, if you’re in a good space to do this, some personal pictures could also be a nice way to showcase your memories.\nYou have already done such an amazing job…and on a budget! This space looks luxurious!\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\n\nJeremy D. Clark Studio\n\nJeremy Clark on Instagram\n\nAshley Whittaker\n\nJeffrey Bilhuber\n\nChris Pearson Floors",
