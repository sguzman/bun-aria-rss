  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our Trailblazer episodes continue this week with Jude Deveraux, an early historical romance author who broke several publishing barriers over her more than forty year career. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In this episode, we talk about her journey through the Wild West of romance in the late 1970s, her publishing career at Avon Books, Pocket Books and Ballantine. We talk about the judgement and misogyny that circles romance, the buying power of readers, and the way the genre and bookselling has changed. We also talk about her writing process, and what it’s like to be Jude Deveraux. This one is a real joy for us, as we wouldn’t be the readers or writers we are without Jude Deveraux. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This episode is sponsored by Avon Books, publisher of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wG7I7X\">Joanna Shupe’s <em>The Bride Goes Rogue</em></a>, and Amazon’s Kindle Vella, publisher of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3MH4sjq\">Eloisa James’s <em>The Seduction Series</em></a>. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our next read along is Virginia Henley’s <em>The Dragon and the Jewel</em>, a deep cut from Sarah’s childhood.
