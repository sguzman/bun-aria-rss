  "description": "<p>The guys are back after an eventful weekend. Mal treated his mom to the sake squirting bottle at Benihana and Rory went to Dave Chappelle’s midnight show. Meg the Stallion bodied her SNL hosting debut. The White King, Jack Harlow, will make his hosting debut next and we sure hope Rory is invited. Speaking of ongoing beef, Nicki and Lotto continue to trade insults at each other and Kanye chose Drink Champs (again) to take shots at the world. While they continue down a self-destructive path, Meek Mill finds himself befriending everyone again according to his timeline. Pleasing everyone can go too far (or just right) depending on who you’re asking. If you’re asking Congressional Candidate Mike Itkis, he’ll tell you the only logical solution is to upload your video to Pornhub to rally the vote. People keep leveling up the weirdness and our home, NYC, keeps getting dirtier. Rats are everywhere…and not just the subway ones. While rat behavior can lead to someone’s demise it can also lead to a bag. Jordan Poole signs a massive contract following the Draymond punch. LeBron and Bronny have no words for each other in a new Beats commercial and Kanye calls Meek a fed, + more!</p>\n",
