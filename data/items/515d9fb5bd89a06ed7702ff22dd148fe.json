    "media:description": "Hey everyone! it's been nearly a month since the eclipse and I'm FINALLY ready to publish my timelapse - you'll see why it took so long in this video... I set up two cameras and did an extremely crude high dynamic range stack that is able to resolve some detail on the sunlit moon, and some detail on the shadowed moon, simultaneously. I wish I'd taken 6 pictures at once, and that they were easy to align, so that I could have a full lograithmic-ish HDR picture, but for now, this is my best eclipse timelapse yet. I hope you like it!\n\nShort version:\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/yXhzfPT29es\n\nMusic in this video:\nI Dunno by grapes is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) http://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626",
