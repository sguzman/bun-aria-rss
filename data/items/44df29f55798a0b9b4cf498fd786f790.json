  "description": "In June of 1996, a 22-year-old college lacrosse player had a casual night out with friends at a bar in suburban Philadelphia. But on her way home, she disappeared. Shortly after leaving the bar, her car was found running with the driver's side door open on an Interstate, painting a violent attack. After an important tip came in from a local woman, a concrete suspect emerged, and it turns out, he had other victims.
