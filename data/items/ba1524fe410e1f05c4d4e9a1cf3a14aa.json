  "description": "<p>On today's show, perhaps the smartest man on earth, the most dominant Jeopardy! champion of all-time whose 29 day total has reached $2,254,938, the incomparable, James Holzhauer, joins the show for an incredible interview. They cover his strategy when it comes to Jeopardy and what he did to prepare before going into the show, what the taping process is like, how his career as a sports gambler has benefited him during his time on Jeopardy, whether or not his opponents respect his strategy or if he's gotten any blowback, what he considers some of his weaker categories, and ultimately, what comes next (2:25-35:32). Pat and the guys also talk more about one hit wonders and try to pin down what the actual last one hit wonder of all-time might be, and Pat recaps his trip to Fort Wayne for his speaking engagement at an event for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northeast Indiana, and how the evening had a bit of scary start to it, some of the memorable moments, and how his speech differed from some of the legends that have come before him at the event. Today's show is a great one, come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
