  "title": "Clara A. B. Joseph, \"Christianity in India: The Anti-Colonial Turn\" (Routledge, 2020)",
  "description": "By studying the history and sources of the Thomas Christians of India, a community of pre-colonial Christian heritage, this book revisits the assumption that Christianity is Western and colonial and that Christians in the non-West are products of colonial and post-colonial missionaries. Christians in the East have had a difficult time getting heard—let alone understood as anti-colonial. This is a problem, especially in studies on India, where the focus has typically been on North India and British colonialism and its impact in the era of globalization. A novel intervention, Clara A. B. Joseph's Christianity in India: The Anti-Colonial Turn (Routledge, 2020) takes up South India and the impact of Portuguese colonialism in both the early modern and contemporary period. It will be of interest to academics in the fields of Renaissance/Early Modern Studies, Postcolonial Studies, Religious Studies, Christianity, and South Asia.\nRaj Balkaran is a scholar, educator, consultant, and life coach.
