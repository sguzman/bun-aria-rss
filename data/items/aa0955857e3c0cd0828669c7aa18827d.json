  "description": "Sermon on The Mount: Chapter 15 - “What We Can Learn From Flowers & Fields.” Matthew 6:25-34. Holy moly. Let’s dig into worry and anxiety, shall we? Today we sit down with some critical responses to our last few episodes and discuss the balance between calling out certain things while celebrating others. Where is the line? \n\nThen we head back to the Mount, to pick up where we left off with Jesus’s sermon. Despite topical heading breaks the editors of the Bible unfortunately inserted, Jesus takes us into a conversation on worry that runs directly out of the last piece on treasures. What is he doing here? How has this section been grossly misinterpreted and taught over the years? How does worry connect to where our treasures lay? \n\nMany of us have been shamed in our depression and anxiety over the years, being told that we shouldn’t worry or fret, that it was sinful to be feeling the way we were. This is not what Jesus is doing here.  He is, again, helping us to reposture and to broaden our understanding. \n \nWe at VOX are committed to not only confronting all of this, first in ourselves, but also to wrestle with what Jesus would have for us in this time. We are committed to repentance and a pursuit of discernment.\n\nThis is the second section of the Sermon on the Mount. We’re excited to walk this road with you all.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram. \n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nVoxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
