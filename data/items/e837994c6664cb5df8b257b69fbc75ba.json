  "itunes:summary": "Both political parties are focusing on the two Senate runoffs in Georgia on January 5th.  Wyche Fowler, a Georgia Democrat elected to the Senate in 1986, nearly won re-election in 1992 but because he fell a tad below the required 50 percent, he was forced into a runoff three weeks later &#8230; and he lost.  Fowler is on the Political Junkie this week with memories of that time, and offers differences and similarities to what is happening today.<br />\nMusic in this week&#8217;s episode:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOLivyykLqk\">Particle Man by They Might Be Giants</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90WD_ats6eE\">The Times They Are A-Changin&#8217; by Bob Dylan</a><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<br />",
