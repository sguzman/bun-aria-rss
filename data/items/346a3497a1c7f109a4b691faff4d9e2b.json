  "description": "<p>In a massive week for Bored Ape Yacht Club studio Yuga Labs, they acquired CryptoPunks & Meebits from Larva Labs, as well as releasing their community token $APE.

What does this mean for Punks and Apes? What about intellectual property, ownership, and value? And lastly, are we seeing the dawn of a new age of digital monopolies?</p> <p>In this chaotic landscape, a rational and steady approach to understanding is always a winner. </p> <p>------<br /> 📣 ZERION | Trade Across 7 Networks and 500+ protocols<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Zerion\">https://bankless.cc/Zerion</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER:          <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/ </a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST:                 <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/ </a> </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS: </p> <p>👀 POLYGON | LAYER  2 DEFI<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Polygon\">https://bankless.cc/Polygon</a>  </p> <p>❎ ACROSS | BRIDGE TO LAYER 2<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Across\">https://bankless.cc/Across</a>  </p> <p>🦊 METAMASK | THE CRYPTO WALLET<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/metamask\">https://bankless.cc/metamask</a>  </p> <p>💳 LEDGER | THE CRYPTO LIFE CARD<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Ledger\">https://bankless.cc/Ledger</a>  </p> <p>🧙‍♂️ ALCHEMIX | SELF REPAYING LOANS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Alchemix\">https://bankless.cc/Alchemix</a>  </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 8:00 Panelists<br /> 12:03 What CryptoPunks Want<br /> 16:44 Brand Management<br /> 22:01 Applebees<br /> 26:52 Creative Commons License<br /> 32:00 Best Rights Strategies<br /> 40:00 ApeCoin Launch<br /> 46:20 Is $APE Overvalued?<br /> 54:58 Yuga Labs Deck<br /> 1:00:52 Financials vs Monopolies<br /> 1:04:31 $450 Million Raise<br /> 1:06:45 Panelist Projects<br /> 1:10:00 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Scott Lewis:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/scott_lew_is?s=20&t=kXCI6sgHk2MMkG_PZKekSQ\"> https://twitter.com/scott_lew_is?s=20&t=kXCI6sgHk2MMkG_PZKekSQ</a> <br />  Zeneca_33:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Zeneca_33?s=20&t=kXCI6sgHk2MMkG_PZKekSQ\">https://twitter.com/Zeneca_33?s=20&t=kXCI6sgHk2MMkG_PZKekSQ</a> <br />  Andy8052:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/andy8052?s=20&t=kXCI6sgHk2MMkG_PZKekSQ\">https://twitter.com/andy8052?s=20&t=kXCI6sgHk2MMkG_PZKekSQ</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
