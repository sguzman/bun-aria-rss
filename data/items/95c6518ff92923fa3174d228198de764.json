His name is Billy Baker and he's a journalist and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1982111089/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1982111089&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>We Need to Hang Out: A Memoir of Making Friends</em></a>. Billy and I begin our conversation with the problem of male loneliness in the modern age, and how it befell him in his own life. We then discuss how men and women do friendships differently, the way men do theirs shoulder to shoulder, what this means for what male friendships need to be built around, and why they require what he calls “velvet hooks.” Billy shares how he started his project, which experimented with different ways to recover and create connections, by rekindling his old friendships, but why that ultimately didn't scratch the friendship itch for him. Billy then describes what did: a kind of casual fraternity for middle-aged men he started, and how it was inspired by something called the \"men’s shed\" movement in Australia and its philosophy that men need \"somewhere to go, something to do, and someone to talk to.\" We end our conversation with Billy's takeaways for making friends in adulthood, including the need for embracing intentionality and social risk.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/makefriends\">aom.is/makefriends</a>.</p>\n",
