  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir Podcast we bring you behind the scenes on a conversation we’ve had for the past 3 years. When we left our stable jobs and starting chasing the dream of becoming filmmakers, we didn’t know what to expect, and to be honest, we never expected it to be as hard as it has proven to be. It’s not easy when you decide you want your own creativity becomes your source of income, and that’s what we explore today on the show. \nWe'd love to hear from you! Make sure to tweet at us and leave us a voice message on anchor, we'll include it in our next episode.",
