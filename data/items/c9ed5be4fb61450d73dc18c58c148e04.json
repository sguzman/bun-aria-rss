H. Lawrence \n \nAt the open door of the room I stand and look at the night,\t\nHold my hand to catch the raindrops, that slant into sight,\t\nArriving grey from the darkness above suddenly into the light of the room.\t\nI will escape from the hollow room, the box of light,\t\nAnd be out in the bewildering darkness, which is always fecund, which might\nMate my hungry soul with a germ of its womb.\t\n \nI will go out to the night, as a man goes down to the shore\t\nTo draw his net through the surf’s thin line, at the dawn before\t\nThe sun warms the sea, little, lonely and sad, sifting the sobbing tide.\t\nI will sift the surf that edges the night, with my net, the four\nStrands of my eyes and my lips and my hands and my feet, sifting the store\t\nOf flotsam until my soul is tired or satisfied.\t\n \nI will catch in my eyes’ quick net\t\nThe faces of all the women as they go past,\t\nBend over them with my soul, to cherish the wet\nCheeks and wet hair a moment, saying: “Is it you?”\t\nLooking earnestly under the dark umbrellas, held fast\t\nAgainst the wind; and if, where the lamplight blew\t\nIts rainy swill about us, she answered me\t\nWith a laugh and a merry wildness that it was she\t\nWho was seeking me, and had found me at last to free\t\nMe now from the stunting bonds of my chastity,\t\nHow glad I should be!\t\n \nMoving along in the mysterious ebb of the night\t\nPass the men whose eyes are shut like anemones in a dark pool;\nWhy don’t they open with vision and speak to me, what have they in sight?\t\nWhy do I wander aimless among them, desirous fool?\t\nI can always linger over the huddled books on the stalls,\t\nAlways gladden my amorous fingers with the touch of their leaves,\t\nAlways kneel in courtship to the shelves in the doorways, where falls\t\nThe shadow, always offer myself to one mistress, who always receives.\t\n \nBut oh, it is not enough, it is all no good.\t\nThere is something I want to feel in my running blood,\t\nSomething I want to touch; I must hold my face to the rain,\t\nI must hold my face to the wind, and let it explain\nMe its life as it hurries in secret.\t\nI will trail my hands again through the drenched, cold leaves\t\nTill my hands are full of the chillness and touch of leaves,\t\nTill at length they induce me to sleep, and to forget.",
