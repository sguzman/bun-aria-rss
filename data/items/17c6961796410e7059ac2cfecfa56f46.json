Yes, Mr. Gardiner probably paid Wickham off, and Mr. Bennet has no idea how to repay him, but they'll worry about that later. It's such great news that Mrs. Bennet is ready to leave her room, tell the world her joy, and of course order wedding clothes. In all of the excitement, Lizzy retreats to her room for a moment of quiet - the kind of quiet respite you will feel upon letting this week's episode help you fall into deep and restful sleep.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Welcome to the Jane Austen Bedtime Stories podcast! Each episode is a section of a classic Jane Austen novel, read in soothing tones and set to calming music to help you fall asleep.</p>\n<p>With everything that is going on in the world, we find comfort in the familiar. For so many of us, Jane Austen's works are like a warm hug. So snuggle up under the covers and let the comforting words of Jane Austen lull you into sleep.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Music [\"Reverie\"] by Scott Buckley – www.scottbuckley.com.au</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\n--- \n\nSupport this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/jabedtimepod/support\" rel=\"payment\">https://anchor.fm/jabedtimepod/support</a>",
