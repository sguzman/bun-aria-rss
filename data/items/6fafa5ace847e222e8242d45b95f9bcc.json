  "description": "<p>We need to transform our food system and address one of the biggest threats to our well-being: our lack of a coordinated and comprehensive food policy. The outside influence that industrial food and agriculture lobbyists have on our policies encourages a food system that engenders disease. Lobbying power in Washington is rarely in the best interest of the public, supporting food and agriculture policies that undermine public health, harm the environment and increase private profits for Big Food. Big Food and Big Ag spend millions of dollars in Washington every year for the power to block policies that hurt their bottom lines and promote policies that make them money, whether or not it’s harmful to our society or the environment.&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this week’s mini-episode, Dr. Mark Hyman talks about the dirty politics of Big Food, how that influences our government food policies, and why we need to change it. Learn more about these topics and the undeniable harm our food system is doing to human health and to the environment or climate in Dr. Hyman’s new book, Food Fix. <a href=\"https://foodfixbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">foodfixbook.com</a></p><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
