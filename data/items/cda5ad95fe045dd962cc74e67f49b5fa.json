  "description": "Happy New Year! It’s New Year’s Day, and yes, I’m doing a podcast for you. I don’t have a guest today, but I begin by recapping the best and worst performing sectors of 2019. I break down a lot of individual companies—both winners and losers—and give you some of my favorite ideas heading into 2020.  I also give you my thoughts on the winners and losers this holiday season, and explain why you need to pay attention to a massive rotation happening in stocks right now...  P.S. Next week, I’ll be heading to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
