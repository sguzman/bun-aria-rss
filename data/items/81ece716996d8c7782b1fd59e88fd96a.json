  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat is joined by a few incredible guests to chat about the NFL's return to play policy. First, Senior NFL writer at Yahoo Sports and friend of the program, Charles Robinson joins the show. Charles lays out for Pat what he is hearing to be the four main things that players want in order for them to return to training camp, his thoughts on the players #WeWantToPlay movement and what he thinks was the moment that they decided something had to be said, and if he ultimately thinks negotiations&nbsp;will get done on time (1:56-15:46). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss everything that's going on in the sports world with whether or not NFL teams will report to camp on time, if we're going to have football this year, why we need to remember that if Rob Manfred could get the baseball season to go off, then Roger Goodell should be able to get the NFL on track, how Pat is looking YOKED, Pat and AJ's thoughts on the anniversary of the moon landing, and why AJ's fingers are so messed up (15:48-1:29:21). Later, 5x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, member of the 2010's All-Decade Team, 2019 Walter Payton Man of the Year, and member of the NFLPA executive committee, Calais Campbell joins the program. Pat and Calais chat about him landing in Baltimore after thinking he might finish his career in Jacksonville, why he's excited about the opportunity to bring some veteran leadership to the locker room, if things were truly as bad in Jacksonville as some people like to make them out to be, and what he thinks about returning to play, how he thinks the negotiations between the NFL and NFLPA will go, and why he ultimately thinks that although it might get close to the deadline, a deal will get done (1:31:59-1:52:04). Lastly, 2x Super Bowl champion, Pittsburgh Steeler legend, and friend of the show, Ike Taylor joins the program. Pat and Ike discuss why Ike thinks some of the players are uneasy about going back to training camp, what he thinks needs to be done in order to put some of their minds at rest, why he doesn't think a lot of players will opt out, how he tried using his Madden ratings in negotiations, and an incredible story about how he used to listen to music on the field during games (1:53:46-2:08:08). Don't forget to send in a picture of where you're listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch. We appreciate you letting us penetrate your ears. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
