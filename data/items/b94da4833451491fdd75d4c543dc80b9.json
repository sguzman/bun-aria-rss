  "description": "When The West Wing was on the air, during the Clinton and Bush years, a lot of liberal viewers were pining for a Democratic president with a strong sense of right and wrong — someone like President Bartlet. His fictional administration made for great entertainment, an idealistic vision of what politics could be. But the show’s idealism was decidedly white — and mostly male. It also obscured a very real partisan divide.\nMusic credits: \nVoyage (a) by Jon Lorca and Peter James Quiney\nPrimetime Theme Music by Brandon McFarland \nA Most Quiet Season by Richard Bone\nHot Air Balloon by Jon Lorca and Peter James Quiney\nTwo Dollar Token by Warmbody (from Blue Dot Sessions)\nRue Montclare (a) by Joe Henson, Alexis Leon Smith, and Reinould Willem Rutger Ford\nSoothe by Bodytonic (from Blue Dot Sessions)\nConstructions (B) by John Devereaux\nNight Time Adventure by John Lorca and Peter James Quiney\nWhen in the West by Landsman Duets (from Blue Dot Sessions)\nLearn more about your ad choices.
