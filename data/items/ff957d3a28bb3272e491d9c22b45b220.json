  "description": "We’re back on ArtCurious with another great interview episode for you today. Today’s episode features a conversation about Picasso’s War, a recent book by journalist Hugh Eakin. Today we think of New York as the center of the twentieth century art world, but it took three determined men, two world wars, and one singular artist to secure the city’s cultural prominence. Pablo Picasso was the most influential and perplexing artist of his age, and the turning points of his career and salient facets of his private life have intrigued the world for decades. However, the tremendous feat of winning support for his art in the U.S. has long been overlooked—until now.\n In PICASSO’S WAR: How Modern Art Came to America, Eakin details the never-before-told story of how a single exhibition, years in the making, finally brought the 20th century’s most notorious artist U.S. acclaim, irrevocably changed American culture, and in doing so saved dozens of the twentieth century’s most enduring artworks from the Nazis.\n\nPlease SUBSCRIBE and REVIEW our show on Apple Podcasts and FOLLOW on Spotify\nInstagram / Facebook / YouTube\n\nBuy Picasso’s War here!\n\nSPONSORS:\nBetterHelp: Get 10% off your first month of counseling\nThe Barnes Foundation: For a limited time, get 10% off your first Barnes Class when you visit our link\nCanvasprints.com: Get 25% off of your entire order of canvas prints, canvas wall displays, metal prints, photo tiles, photo blankets and pillows, and much more when you use code ARTCURIOUS25\nLearn more about your ad choices.
