It has now been twenty years since the day that Jennifer’s mother reported her missing. 14 year old Jennifer Medernach left after an argument with her mother. She was spotted several times over the course of the next few days, still in the families’ neighborhood. But the story turned to tragedy when her body was found in a creek several days after being reported missing. This case is still very active and getting some justice for Jennifer is still very likely. Anyone with information should reach out to the Clay County Sheriff’s Office @ 904-264-6512.</p>\n<p>Beer of the Week - Hazy Jane New England IPA by BrewDog Garage Grade - 4 and a quarter bottle caps out of 5 </p>\n<p>Our show - True Crime Garage “Off the Record” is available only on Stitcher Premium.
