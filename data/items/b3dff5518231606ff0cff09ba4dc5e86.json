  "itunes:summary": "Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages? Across two nights, Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week present a program of electronic music genealogies, featuring artists whose works span the 1970s to today and represent multiple generations of Melbourne’s experimental scene.\n\nAlsi is a sound artist and musician drawing heavily from bass music continuums and occasionally drifting towards sound collage and ambient spaces. Ahead of her performance for Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week, Alsi discusses working with machines to create rhythmic dialogues, the differences in approaches and personas when making music in collaboration and solo, and the communities that allowed for her initial experimentations with noise. \n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/liquid-architecture-x-melbourne-music-week\n\nRitual Community Music \n10 - 11 December 2021\nMiscellania, Melbourne\nPresented by Liquid Architecture and MMW\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
