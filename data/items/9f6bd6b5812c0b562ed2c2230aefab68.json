  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, real journalists, not the fake news pontificators, are being killed and injured in Ukraine as they are taking fire from Putin’s forces. This program salutes the correspondents risking their lives for a free press. Even members of the Russian state-run media are speaking out against the war and Putin's war crimes. Putin is actively arresting dissenters and has jailed more than 10,000 anti-war protesters. Then, the national discussion this program engages in is critical. A free people cannot ignore Putin's aggression to go unchecked. It cannot be ignored when Putin attempts to declare what weapons can be used on the Ukrainian battlefield. History, experience, and reality cannot be ignored when the new axis of evil in Russia, Iran, and China take action which can eventually annihilate freedom, representative government, and unalienable rights. Later, Elon Musk says more domestic oil production is necessary because parts and minerals are difficult to find. Meanwhile anti-Russian hackers like Anonymous and Cyber Partisans who are hitting back at Putin with hacks of their own. Our government adjusts the rate of inflation to make it appear lower and the media spreads their propaganda. Inflation destroys an economic system and left unchecked will subsequently destroy a nation. Afterward, Congresswoman Lauren Boebert calls in with an update from Capitol Hill and reiterated how important the vision of our founders is in these tumultuous times.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
