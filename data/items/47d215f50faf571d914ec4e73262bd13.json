Sean-Paul had been unable to reach Kylen for a couple of days and this was not normal at all. In fact this sent the anxious father into a frenzy of activity. Sean-Paul lived in Montana and so he contacted everyone he could think of to try to help locate his daughter. He called the hospital, he called the jail and he called Kylen’s place of work frequently. No one had seen the girls since Friday the 13th. This was at Woody’s Tavern where the two ladies met with friends. During the visit Kylen and Crystal talked about some “creepy guy” that had spooked them at their campsite. Unfortunately on August 18, 2021 Kylen and Crystal were found dead and so began one of the most bizarre stories to come out of peaceful Moab, Utah. This case is still UNSOLVED and the Grand County Sheriff’s Office is still seeking information from the public. Please call the Sheriff’s office with any information at (435) 259-8115. </p><p>Beer of the Week - Run Jewelius Run from Tactical Brewing Company </p><p>Garage Grade - 5 out of 5 bottle caps</p><p>Recommended Reading - Trailed; One woman’s quest to solve the Shenandoah murders.
