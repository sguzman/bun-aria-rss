  "description": "<p>Joshua Guimond ////// 47 TrueCrimeGarage.com November 9, 2002 Joshua Guimond was at a party with friends. Some time between the hours of 11 o'clock and midnight he left. Some thought maybe to use the restroom others said maybe he went home to his apartment across the St. John's University campus but we may never know. He should have returned to the party or had he left he would have walked about three minutes to his apartment but he was never seen again. Joshua's father spent countless hours searching for his son and most of that on the 2700 acres that is the St. John's University campus. Tonight we ask ourselves what happened to Joshua?
