  "description": "<p><em><strong>Insulted - Part Two: Blasphemer</strong></em><strong>. </strong>We continue this week with a series that attempts to understand the human side of Jesus by way of the insults levied against Him. What is a blasphemer? How do we understand that now vs. then? What was the accusation? In what ways was Jesus accused of blaspheming, and what were the implications? How did He respond and what does His response teach us? What did it show the accusers at the time?? So much to unpack from simple Bible story verses we've all heard and likely gloss over.</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
