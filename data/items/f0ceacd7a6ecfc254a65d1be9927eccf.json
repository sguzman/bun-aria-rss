  "description": "<p>The Cecil Hotel in downtown Los Angeles is not a place where most people would want to rent a room.That might be why the Cecil Hotel was reported closed, but do not be fooled, the hotel just changed its name to Stay on Main and advertises itself as a hostel. Not only is it a budget hotel frequented by transients, but it has a creepy and murderous past that has caused it to be a source of numerous tales of haunting experiences. This infamous history includes suicides, disappearances, murders and serial killers. The hotel made news in 2013 when the funny tasting water coming out of the faucets was linked to a dead body in the water tower. A disturbing video related to this death has gone viral. You might want to turn on the lights for this episode as we explore the history and hauntings of the Cecil Hotel. The Moment in Oddity features the Dylatov Pass Incident and This Day in History features coffee planting in Hawaii.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes, videos and pictures can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/06/hgb-podcast-ep-52-cecil-hotel.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/06/hgb-podcast-ep-52-cecil-hotel.html</a></p>",
