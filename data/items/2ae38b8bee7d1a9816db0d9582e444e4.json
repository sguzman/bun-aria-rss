  "description": "<p>Let $M$ be a smooth, orientable, closed, connected $4$-manifold and suppose\nthat $H_1(M;\\mathbb{Z})$ is finitely generated and has no $2$-torsion. We give\na homotopy decomposition of the suspension of $M$ in terms of spheres, Moore\nspaces and $\\Sigma\\mathbb{C}P^{2}$. This is used to calculate any reduced\ngeneralized cohomology theory of $M$ as a group and to determine the homotopy\ntypes of certain current groups and gauge groups.\n</p>",
