  "description": "<p>Is energy medicine real? What about Ayurveda? What about Western/modern medicine, what’s right and not so right about it? Does the gender of a patient make a difference in how they’re treated, or in their health outcomes? What about the role of plants, herbs, and intuition? These are all questions that have come up in conversations over the years as I’ve had the incredible opportunity to sit down with women who are leading voices and often voices of change in various approaches to medicine and wellbeing. And, in today’s episode, we’ve curated key elements from four of those conversations to share and potentially pull back the curtain on so many myths, misunderstandings and confusion and plant some seeds to explore a different lens and maybe even some different modalities when it comes to exploring your own physical, mental, and energetic wellbeing.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode:</strong></p><p>You can find Jill at: <a href=\"https://www.yinovacenter.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jillblakeway/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>You can find Avanti at: <a href=\"https://www.avantikumarsingh.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/avantikumarsingh/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>You can find Aviva at: <a href=\"https://avivaromm.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dr.avivaromm/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>You can find Latham at: <a href=\"https://mamaglow.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/glowmaven/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My New Book </strong><a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a> | <strong>My New Podcast </strong><a href=\"https://pod.link/1610198312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SPARKED</a></li><li><strong>AquaTru:</strong> Countertop reverse osmosis water purifier that's certified to create bottled-quality water.
