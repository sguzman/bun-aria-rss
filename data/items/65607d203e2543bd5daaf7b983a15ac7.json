  "description": "Ransomware: the problem that everyone is talking about, yet somehow continues to get worse with each passing year. In 2021, the cost of ransomware to global businesses is estimated to reach a whopping $20B. The problem has reached such a critical mass that it can no longer be cast away as some unknowable IT problem–everyone from cyber insurance providers to the federal government have taken note. The CyberWire's Rick Howard speaks with Hash Table member Kevin Ford of Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), and ExtraHop's VP, GM of International and Global Security Programs, Mike Campfield, joins The CyberWire's Dave Bittner on this CyberWire-X for a retrospective on ransomware in 2021. Mike shares his predictions on how it will evolve in 2022 and beyond, and what controls enterprises can put into place to build their resilience to the growing threat.",
