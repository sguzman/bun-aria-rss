[14:31] Why he thinks it would suck to have a billion dollars (but a few million is okay) [16:37] His tips for travel and having an amazing transformation [20:45] Something that would surprise people about being rich [21:16] Why now is the most unique time in history and most people are wasting it [23:18] How he got through the big losses in his career and used this strategy to get back to where he was. [27:30] Why he’s grateful for all his losses and says that without them he wouldn’t be a complete person.
