  "description": "In this episode we talk about the common question, \"Does God Cause Suffering?\".  In recent weeks I have been in a discussion on Twitter regarding this topic in response to The Gospel Coalition video posted at the end of this summary, that suggests that God not only causes suffering but, ordains it.  We look at Jesus' account and encounters with evil and suffering to understand the reality of this view.  We take some time to go over this view of God in podcast form to give it the time and discussion it needs.  Enjoy! We're looking forward to your thoughts and comments below.\n\nView The Gospel Coalition's video that we hold in contention here:\nhttps://vimeo.com/71931147\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nLike Mike on Facebook www.facebook.com/officialmikeerre\n",
