  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, yesterday we said the President deserved criticism but that's not what he got from the media; he got 'Pearl Harbor'. 'Kristallnacht', and 'Treason'. Trump's critics have gone way further than anything Trump ever said. But if we look back at history, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sold us out in the Helsinki Accord and his closest advisor Vasili Mitrokhin was a Soviet spy, yet the Democrats love FDR. Ford and Carter also had embarrassing moments with the Kremlin as well. Professor Paul Kengor of Grove City College, weighs in on the historical perspective of the US and Russia. He explains how the Left has always been weak on Russia and sometimes cozy with its communist ideology during the time of the Soviet Union. Also, the Democrats are in no position to criticize Trump, and of course Trump’s actions on Russia stand head and shoulders above Barack Obama's efforts. He’s arming the Ukrainians, which Obama refused to do. The Poles and the Czechs are getting their defense equipment and Patriot missiles, which Obama pulled. Crimea wasn’t annexed when Trump was president. It was annexed when Obama was president. Finally, Fox News Host and Author Judge Jeanine Pirro discusses her new book \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
