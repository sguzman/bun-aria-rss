  "description": "<p>Over ten years ago, I read the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143126563/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143126563&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Getting Things Done</em></a> by David Allen. I've been using the tactics and strategies that he laid out in the book in managing tasks and, well, getting things done, ever since.

We begin our conversation discussing how David came up with the GTD system in the first place and how it differs from other time management systems out there. David then explains what the \"mind like water\" mantra is about and how the GTD system helps you clear your head. We then dig into the specific steps of getting things done, including capturing ideas, clarifying tasks into action, organizing those actions, reflecting on your action list, and, of course, taking action!</p><p>This is a time management system I can personally endorse, so if you're not familiar with it or have fallen off the GTD wagon, I recommend giving this show a listen.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/gtd\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/gtd</a>.</p>\n",
