  "description": "<p>Bonnie Raitt is many things—a Rock ‘n Roll Hall-of-Famer, an incredible blues guitarist, an underrated songwriter, and a fierce advocate for social justice. Bonnie was offered her first record deal as a college student in 1971 after a reporter saw her play an early gig in NYC, but it took almost two decades before she peaked commercially with her tenth album, <em>Nick Of Time</em>. Throughout her long career Bonnie has helped preserve American blues music by recording songs from little-known but classic songwriters.</p><p>On today’s episode Bruce Headlam talks to Bonnie Raitt about her meticulous song-selection process and the inspiration behind the tunes she wrote for her new album, <em>Just Like That</em>. Bonnie also talks about a somewhat awkward dinner she had with Prince. And how her slide guitar technique will forever be tied to giving her brother the bird.</p><p><br></p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord\">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Hear a playlist of all of our favorite Bonnie Raitt songs <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/488xEbvJZZUhI7QUMnKqxw?si=96d19d6b1ac94e1e\"><u>HERE.</u></a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
