  "description": "In this episode, Sharon talks with Donald Miller, entrepreneur, podcast host, and bestselling author, about the stories in our lives and how we live them. Our stories stink. When we fill our free time with passive consumption, we’re left with a narrative void that doesn’t enrich our lives. Donald’s new book, <em>Hero On A Mission: A Path to a Meaningful Life</em>, sets up readers to create meaning and nuance in the story of their lives. Sharon and Donald also talk about the two-party system in the U.S. and what it would take to have an alternative system, or add a third party. Spoiler alert: it’s an uphill battle, but perhaps not impossible!<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
