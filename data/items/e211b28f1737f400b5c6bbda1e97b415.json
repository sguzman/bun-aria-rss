  "title": "289 - The Wheat & The Weeds",
  "description": "The Wheat & The Weeds! Matthew 13:24. “Jesus told them another parable.” Mike had this parable sitting in the back of his brain poking at him, so we dove in. We are continuing to look closely at the Christian Nationalist vision and the bonds that have been made between Christianity and the world. This is Jesus answering the question of what we are to do with the evil in the world. What are the wheat and the weeds Jesus is referring to? How are we too relate and react to the weeds? How does Jesus tell us to exist amongst? Who is the enemy and what is their game? How do judgement and and the fires play into all of this? There is so much to look at in this short piece.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
