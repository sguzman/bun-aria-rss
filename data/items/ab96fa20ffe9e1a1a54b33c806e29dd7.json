  "description": "<p>This week on Let’s Eat In Cathy sits down with Erik Michielsen and Andrew Osborne of Capture Your Flag, a new kind of website that combines a video database with a sort of networking platform. Capture Your Flag’s goal is to put thinkers and do-ers in the spotlight, with a focus on those who are up-and-coming rather than at the top of their respective field. The premise is that people who are working to get their voice heard often have as much if not more to say than those who are already heard.
