  "description": "<p>Radhi and Jay Shetty sit down to talk about a very special project they have been working on together for the past 18 months, their ‘quarantine baby’ - Sama Tea!

Because, ultimately, a life in the present is a more balanced life, a more connected life, and a happier one too. </p>\n<p>Together they share how Sama was conceptualized, the different teams that worked together to help create the brand, the potions and ingredients that went through several stages and taste-testing to find the best blends, and how Sama is made to help anyone live in the moment and in-tune with their surroundings.</p>\n<p>Sama Tea is now available!
