  "description": "<p>On this week's episode of WD, the duo is joined by Adam22 of the No Jumper Podcast and his girlfriend, YouTuber & OnlyFans model Lena the Plug. The duo share their experience with being in sex work while expecting their first child and how they coordinate bringing others into the bedroom. Another twist yet successful non-monogamous relationship is the talk and how they communicate with one another.
