  "description": "<p>Frank Eybsen started online custom furniture platform <strong>Buildlane </strong>after working in a furniture factory himself and seeing firsthand how frustrating and opaque the experience could be for designers. He made it his mission to bring the process entirely online, and has built a network of factories and a digital platform that connects the trade to the craftsmen who build their furniture. In this episode of the show, Eybsen and COO Heather Zeilman talk about why makers have been slow to embrace change, what it’s like to pitch investors who may never have even <i>heard</i> of the interior design industry, and what Domino’s Pizza has to do with ordering a custom sofa online.  <i>This episode is sponsored by Rebecca Atwood Designs.</i></p>\n",
