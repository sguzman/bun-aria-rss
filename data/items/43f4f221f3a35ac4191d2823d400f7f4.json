  "description": "On the Best of Mark Levin, a tornado-ravaged Kentucky over the weekend is a reminder that life can be fleeting. Despite that, the blame game is disgusting, whether it's President Biden or FEMA they're both spinning this horrific event as a human-caused disaster rather than a natural disaster. Sadly, the media just allows these lies to go unchecked and promulgates this propaganda. The American Marxist elements in America, backed by the media and embraced by the Democrat party, have brought us the crime wave we are seeing across the country. The George Floyd riots in 2020 were seen as an opportunity for a war on cops, capitalism, and society. The Democrat party has the help from George Soros to destroy America from within. Until Soros and the Democrat Party are held to account this crime will continue. The philosophy of Americanism embraces things that are proven to have worked for the betterment of society. This was the difference between Trump and the Democrats, it was peace and common sense versus uncertainty and a radical leftist ideology. A federal appeals court decided that Biden will have the final say on former President Trump's executive privilege and will likely make its way to the Supreme Court. Democrats in the House want to obliterate executive privilege so they can have their political way. They don't care about the Constitution as long as they can stop Trump in the future. This happens because the Democrat Party controls all branches, packed the court during the Obama years, and is only interested in political power, not in the people. Then, corporate media's systemic corruption is much worse than anything Chris Cuomo did. The media has been complicit in covering up the crimes Marxists have exacted on the public for over a century.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
