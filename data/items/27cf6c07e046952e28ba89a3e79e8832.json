  "description": "You may know Tasia Alexis and Camo from Vine, IG and TikTok, but you may not know the people behind the music and funny videos. In this first episode, Tasia and Camo get into a self-therapy session by telling their backstories and catching you up to where they are today. Tasia discusses getting out of rehab and going to prison, her pregnancies and getting bullied in high school. Camo talks about growing with a serious illness, doing some petty theft, and her crippling anxiety.\nThey also tell the story of meeting being servers at the Top Dog restaurant, which Camo is now banned from, and being drunk at work during almost every shift (don't worry, the statute of limitations has passed on this one). Plus, Camo and Tasia answer some seriously deep fan questions ranging from their thoughts on religion, what they dislike about each other, and finding peace. So if you want to hear more insane stories and tracking their growth, keep tuning in to Unfazed and Unbothered.
