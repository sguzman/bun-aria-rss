  "content": "<p>Like the last several updates, this blog post will be fairly short, given only a single bug fix was added.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again to GitHub user <a href=\"https://github.com/leocwlau\">leocwlau</a> who <a href=\"https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/issues/232\">reported</a> that the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">GetReportSuiteGroups</code> function added an additional field AND provided the <a href=\"https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/pull/233\">solution</a>. No other bug fixes were made, nor was any additional functionality added.</p>\n\n<p>Version 1.4.14 of RSiteCatalyst was submitted to CRAN today and should be available for download in the coming days.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"community-contributions\">Community Contributions</h2>\n<p>As I’ve mentioned in many a blog post before this one, I encourage all users of the software to continue reporting bugs via <a href=\"https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/issues\">GitHub issues</a>, and especially if you can provide a working code example. Even better, a fix via pull request will ensure that your bug will be addressed in a timely manner and for the benefit to others in the community.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: Please don’t email directly via the email in the RSiteCatalyst package, it will not be returned. Having a valid email contact in the package is a requirement to have a package listed on CRAN so they can contact the package author, it is not meant to imply I can/will provide endless, personalized support for free.</em></p>"
