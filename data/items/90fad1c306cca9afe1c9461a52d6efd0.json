  "description": "<p>You’ve asked, you’ve begged, you’ve pleaded…and we finally succumbed to your requests - episode 20 features the one and only Waverly Hills Sanitorium (not Sanitarium, we checked) as well as a pretty terrible guy named Gregory Scott Hale. In this episode we ask the important questions: Is it more acceptable to eat people if they’ve been cooked? Where can I find Jesus the biggest? What’s so traumatizing about a torso?<br />Perhaps most importantly, we get our <strong>FIRST FAN MAIL</strong> but our excitement quickly devolves into concern when we can’t decode its mysterious symbols. (For real guys, if we go missing, blame this anonymous person in Utah.)<br />Christine also rescues a bug, but Em doesn’t approve of that segment. And that’s why we drink!</p>\n",
