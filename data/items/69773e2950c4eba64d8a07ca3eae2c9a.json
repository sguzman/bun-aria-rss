  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible version of ourselves.</p> <p>This week's episode is an On the Couch Episode all about Olivia Pope from the hit show Scandal. My special guest therapist is Leslie Garcia, LCSW, who has a private practice called Counseling Space in Forest Hills, New York. We discussed the multitude of traumas Olivia has experienced and what it might look like to help her work through trauma. We discussed Olivia's tendency to cope with red wine, and how her relationship with Fitz is very similar to the relationship she has with her father.</p> <p><strong>Resources Mentioned</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gifts-Imperfection-Think-Supposed-Embrace/dp/159285849X\">The Gifts of Imperfection</a> by Dr. Brene Brown</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Over-Mood-Second-Changing/dp/1462520421/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1496806298&sr=1-1&keywords=mind+over+mood\">Mind Over Mood</a> by Drs.
