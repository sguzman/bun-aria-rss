  "description": "<p>We continue our conversation with Jan Broberg, whose story of child sexual abuse and kidnapping at the hands of a close family friend is told in the Netflix documentary “Abducted in Plain Sight”. Laura and Jim explore how this offender was allowed to continue to target young girls even after he was caught. Lisa wonders if this offender is different from others we have covered in that he took Jan away from their community to another country rather than hiding in plan sight.</p><p>#hernameisJanBroberg </p><p>#netflix </p><p>#abductedinplainsight </p><p>#stoleninnocence </p><p>#CoerciveControl </p><p>#Grooming</p><p><br></p><p><strong>We are so grateful for our sponsors this week.
