  "description": "This woman and her husband had an agreement that when they started living together, there would be no locks on any doors in their house and that they'd never lock each other out of any room. Sounds weird, but hey, if it works for them, who is anyone else to judge, right?\n\nThe problem is that now, his brother - her brother-in-law - who is going through a divorce is staying with them...and he won't stop walking in on her in the bathroom.\n\nIt's not a mistake, because it never happens to her husband and it's happened to her...MULTIPLE times. He's even walked in on her in her BEDROOM - a place he has zero reason to be.\n\nShe's mentioned it to her husband, but he hasn't done anything about it. So, she warned him that next time it's happening, she's installing a lock on the bathroom door. Shocker, it happened again, so she installed the lock. When her husband found it, he blew up...AT HER?! \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
