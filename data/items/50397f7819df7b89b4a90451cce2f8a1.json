  "itunes:summary": "In all our relationships, listening is very important. As the philosopher and theologian, Paul Tillich put it, ‘The first duty of love is to listen’.\nSome people are very good at listening. General George Marshall said, ‘Formula for handling people:\n\nListen to the other person’s story.\nListen to the other person’s full story.\n\nListen to the other person’s full story first.’\n\nListening to God is one of the keys to your relationship with him. ‘To listen’, means to hear attentively, ‘to pay attention to’. Prayer means giving God your full attention.",
