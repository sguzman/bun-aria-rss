  "description": "In the wake of a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion indicating that Roe v. Wade will soon be a thing of the past, some states are rushing to fortify the right to an abortion within their borders. Nowhere has gone as far as Connecticut, though, which has expanded the field of people permitted to perform abortions and created legal protections for anyone who aids in the procedure. But will it make a difference when abortion will likely soon be outlawed in half the country? \n\nGuest: Matt Blumenthal, State Representative for Connecticut’s 147th District.\n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
