  "description": "<p>This podcast episode covers episodes 1 & 2 of the Netflix series.</p>\n\n\n<p>On the 30th anniversary of his Florida execution, CONVERSATIONS WITH A KILLER: THE TED BUNDY TAPES brings the infamously twisted mind of serial killer Ted Bundy into the light for the very first time in a fresh yet terrifying way through exclusive, never-before-heard interviews from the \"Jack the Ripper of the United States,\" himself. This unique and gripping doc series, focuses on the man whose personality, good looks and social graces defied the serial-killer stereotype, allowing him to hide in plain sight as he committed the brutal sex-crime slayings of more than 30 women before being caught in 1978.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed/posts\">Binge our 40+ bonus episodes via Patreon</a>!
