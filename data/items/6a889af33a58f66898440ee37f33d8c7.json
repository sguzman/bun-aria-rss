  "description": "John Lithgow can go from playing the sweetest characters you’ll ever see to truly deranged psychopaths, sometimes within the same movie. He’s good at playing kind and evil in equal measure partly because he developed his acting range at a young age growing up around his dad’s traveling Shakespeare festivals. John talks with Marc about his many memorable roles and how working on 3rd Rock from the Sun led him to creating children’s entertainment, from voice acting to songs to books to live concerts. John also explains what it’s like to put his own twist on historical characters, like Winston Churchill, Roger Ailes, and now Bill Clinton in the Broadway play Hillary and Clinton. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://squarespace.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Squarespace</a> and <a href=\"http://simplisafe.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SimpliSafe</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
