  "description": "Today’s guest is Packy McCormick of Not Boring, for Episode 3 of Season 6 of Angel. Packy turned his massive newsletter into a Not Boring Fund I in 2021, and has since invested $10M into startups. In this episode you will learn:\n\n1. How Packy raised his first fund from his readers. \n\n2. What regulations he needed to navigate to comply with the SEC. \n\n3. Which sectors he invested his first $10M into (in just 6 months) and some of his breakout startups. \n\n4. Why IRR can be hilariously large in the early stages of a small fund.\n\n5. How he manages a syndicate and a venture fund while still doing right by LPs. \n\nAs Packy signs off we check in with Producer Rachel who went down to Miami Hack Week and spoke to one of the organizers of Tap House.",
