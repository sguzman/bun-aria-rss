  "description": "<p>Minifans will be trekking across America from Madawaska to Cape Alava, Washington to raise money for a to be determined charity this fall (00:00:10). Justin has the worst pitch for a full time job ever, throwing himself a pity party while Cullinane makes the case for him (00:46:00).

Credit to Pardon My Take for bringing up Aaron Rodgerâ€™s vaccine status in an interview with the Green Bay Packer quarterback. The list of people Kirk would trade Justin for is endless, LIV has ruined the PGA for Dave, calls and more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
