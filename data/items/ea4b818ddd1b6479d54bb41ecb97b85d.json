  "description": "<div>On the evening of June 7, 2021, Alex Murdaugh, a member of one of the most powerful families in South Carolina, came home to a brutal scene: The bodies of his 21 year old son, Paul, and 52 year old wife, Maggie. Both of whom had been shot multiple times. Could this be connected to the death of Paul's friend Mallory, who had been thrown from a boat Paul had been driving while drunk? And as the authorities dig deeper, they find TWO OTHER murders connected to the family that remain unsolved. What is going on here? Why do people connected to this rich and powerful family keep dying?<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.truecrimeobsessed.com/see-us-live\">COME SEE US ON TOUR</a>!!
