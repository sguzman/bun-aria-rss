    "media:description": "Two simulations of the n-body problem. The forces between the masses in the simulation on the left are proportional to 1/r². The forces between the masses in the simulation on the right are proportional to sin(r). In both simulations, all twelve masses have the same starting positions and velocities.\n\nThe simulation on the right is basically nonsense - it's just for fun.\n\n- all masses equal\n- symmetric start\n- 25fps, 60s\n\n#Physics #PhysicsSimulations #NBodyProblem #Gravity",
