  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys recap yesterday's Wednesday Afternoon Football Game and why it more than likely won't happen again, how sloppy the play was, Mike Tomlin's comments after the game, and much more including BYU and Coastal Carolina agreeing to play this weekend, and Russell Westbrook and John Wall getting traded for one another. Also joining the program is the defending NFC Defensive Rookie of the Month, Carolina Panthers S/LB Jeremy Chinn. Pat and Jeremy chat about how he became a monster so quickly, going to Southern Illinois out of high school, what it's like playing for Matt Rhule, and much more (19:49-33:42). Next, 2001 AFC Offensive Player of the Year, Pro Bowler, former Pittsburgh Steeler great and friend of the program, Kordell \"Slash\" Stewart joins the show to talk about the Steelers/Ravens rivalry, what it was like being a QB in his position at that time in the NFL, Taysom Hill being in a similar situation, and much more (52:31-1:16:57). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk discuss yesterday's game, Tomlin's comments after the game, and they tell a few stories about their time in the locker room (1:19:33-1:46:51).
