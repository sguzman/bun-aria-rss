It's not trying to break away from Iraq or Syria. ISIS talks about Sykes–Picot and the conspiracy of it.\"\n\n\"People don't know what to call ISIS now. Calling it a 'state,' even if it dies and becomes a 'failed state,' is a political statement. But it's been there for three years, governing lives... you can travel from one end of the Islamic State to the other with a piece of paper that says, 'This person is allowed to transport agricultural goods. Those are state-like features, and it's survived for quite a long time.\"",
