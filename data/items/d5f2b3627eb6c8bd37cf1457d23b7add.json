  "description": "<p>President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden faced off last night in dueling network town halls. While Trump was grilled for sixty minutes about white supremacy, qanon, and retweets by a hostile Savannah Guthrie, Biden spun fables about his dad's progressive wisdom with George Stephanopoulos. Kirk and Steve react to both broadcasts and the continuing trickle of news from Hunter Biden's laptop. The VFW show is coming together and sales for raffle tickets will soon be open. (0:40:30). Plus: One lucky Minifan will get the opportunity to win a ticket by performing a simple chore. Steve is being blackmailed by an anonymous Minifan, so he tries to get out ahead of the news and release damning information from his high school year book on his own (0:57:00).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
