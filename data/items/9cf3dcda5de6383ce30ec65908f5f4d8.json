  "title": "Mary Ann Flynn - 483",
  "description": "<p>August 24, 1989. Cleveland, Ohio. At 10pm, one evening, Thirty-three year-old Mary Ann Flynn returned home. One neighbor said they heard her get out of her car and walk to the back door of the duplex. Other neighbors heard her front door close. Around midnight, neighbors heard a “loud bang or thud” from inside the house. The next morning, Christine, a concerned co-worker, called Mary's brother and together they gained entry. Inside they discovered Mary's lifeless body. Anthony Apanovitch was convicted twice for this crime andspent 30 years on Ohio’s death row before his conviction was overturned in 2015. But, just a few years later, he was sent back to death row on a legal technicality. Anthony is adamant that he is innocent, but prosecutors argue he is the only possible perpetrator. </p><p><br></p><p>Get bonus content from Generation Why at: patreon.com/generationwhy</p><p>Listen ad free with Wondery+.
