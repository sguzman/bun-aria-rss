  "description": "Joined by the long lost triplet from The Parent Trap, today Sofia welcomes Jackie Oshry! The red head beauty is 1/2 of The Morning Toast, a business woman, AND a new mom! Thanks to Jackie, Sofia is dipping her toes into something she typically knows nothing about - pop culture! Today the two are discussing hot topics such as Emily Ratajkowski’s recent divorce, and Leonardo DiCaprio FINALLY breaking his 25 and under rule. We love growth. Next, Jackie prepares Sofia for her future by explaining to her a day in the life as a new mom (while running a major podcast), AND gives some relationship tips on how to keep the relationship going once the honeymoon phase is over. Jackie brings a breath of fresh air to the otherwise chaotic Sloot Media offices, which we could always use around here! So whether you need the latest gossip, or need to know how to react to that terrible gift your boyfriend gave you, this duo has you covered, Sloots.\n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: \nhttps://sofiafranklyn.com/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
