  "content": "\n\n<p>Hello! A couple weeks ago I released a new zine called <a href=\"https://wizardzines.com/zines/dns/\">How DNS Works</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When I started writing that zine (in, uh, January 2021), I originally had in\nmind a broader zine on &ldquo;everything you need to know to own a domain&rdquo;. So it had\na bunch of pages on domain registration, TLS, and email.</p>\n\n<p>At the time I thought &ldquo;I can just explain DNS in like 5 pages, it&rsquo;s not\nthat complicated, there will be lots of space for other topics about domains&rdquo;.\nI was extremely wrong about that and it turned out I needed all 28 pages to\nexplain DNS. So I ended up deciding to just focus the zine on DNS and all those\nother topics didn&rsquo;t make it into the final zine.</p>\n\n<p>This morning it occurred to me that instead of letting all of the old draft\npages languish in purgatory on my hard drive, I could post those extra pages\nhere all together on my blog. So here they are!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"disclaimer-not-super-cohesive\">disclaimer: not super cohesive</h3>\n\n<p>I will say (as a disclaimer) that these pages aren&rsquo;t as cohesive as I usually\nlike my zines to be and they definitely do not tell you everything you need to\nneed to know to own a domain.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"domain-registration\">domain registration</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/buying-domain.png\">\n<img src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/registrar.png\">\n<img src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/domain-expiry.png\">\n<img src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/transfers.png\">\n<img src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/domain-privacy.png\">\n<img src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/tld.png\"></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"email\">email</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/receiving-email.png\">\n<img src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/sending-email.png\"></p>\n\n<p>I should say that these 2 pages don&rsquo;t really do email justice &ndash; email security\nis a HUGE topic that honestly I don&rsquo;t know a lot about.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tls\">TLS</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/why-tls-matters.png\">\n<img src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/domain-extras/tls-certificates.png\"></p>\n\n<p>These two pages also don&rsquo;t remotely cover TLS, it&rsquo;s possible I&rsquo;ll write more in\ndepth about TLS at some point. Who knows!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"that-s-all\">that&rsquo;s all!</h3>\n\n<p>though I will say: if you liked these, you might be interested in buying <a href=\"https://wizardzines.com/zines/dns/\">How DNS Works</a> :)</p>\n"
