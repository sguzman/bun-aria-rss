  "description": "<p>An amateur documentary filmmaker named Thierry is on a mission to track down and film the elusive and anonymous street artist named Banksy. When Thierry finds him, Banksy turns the camera on the filmmaker and hilarity, mystery, shenanigans, and some pretty frikking impressive art ensue.\n BUT SERIOUSLY YOU GUYS, ARE WE BEING PUNKED? Is the whole thing an elaborate piece of performance art? Is it real? And WHO is Banksy?Â \n We have lots of thoughts and opinions. We're flipping tables and taking the bait. Join us!</p>\n",
