Yet it reveals a truly puzzling world of micro-entities: entities that can be at two places at once, that can \"travel\" from here to the other side of Alpha Centauri in an instant without traversing the space in between, that behave like waves when unobserve but like particles when observed. John and Ken ask Jenann Ismael from the University of Arizona to help try to make philosophical sense of the strange world of quantum reality.",
