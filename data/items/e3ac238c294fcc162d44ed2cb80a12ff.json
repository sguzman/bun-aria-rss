  "description": "Hey HB's! This here is Part 1 of  Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold by Ellen O'Connell. We've got an interracial relationship which starts with a traumatic shotgun wedding, a slow-burn romance that pays off (in our next episode), and so much action and world-building we couldn't do it all justice.

There are depictions of assault, sexual assault, animal abuse, racism, and more. \n Bonus Content: Alaskan minigolf and a hibachi engagement, new time period thanks to HB Fanny - Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman Times!, Melody gets a visceral education about the word mongrel, cowboy leans, Erin has udder questions, Melody brings the club to the country with abs, abs, abs, DICK!, Melody decides that Hapa is an acceptable term to use for the hero, who is half Native American, half white, because that's the accepted and celebrated term she grew up with in Hawaii for mixed-race babies and what she calls her own children, hilarious practical jokes in Dr. Quinn Times, how we imagine Ann C. listens to the podcast, and so much more. \n Self-Love Recommendations: \n Erin: You can curl your hair with a skinny strightening iron! \n Melody: SPF - get it on your face. \n Episode Sponsor: \n https://www.bubblesandbooks.com/ (Bubbles and Books!)\n Use the offer code HEAVINGBOSOMS10 to get 10% off your first order!\n Facebook group, home of the monthly \"Bubbles Night\" \n Instagram\n Pintrest\n https://twitter.com/soakedromance (Twitter)\n Patreon Shout Out! \n Bethany M., you are smiled upon by Hi'iaka, the Hawaiian goddess of hula, chants, sorcery, and medicine.
