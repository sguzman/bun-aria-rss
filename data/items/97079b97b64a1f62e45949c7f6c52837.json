    "media:description": "How can you add vectors?  In this video, we look at the addition of numbers to find a way to define addition for vectors.  We also explore how to find the negative of a vector and how to subtract vectors.\n\nThis video is a part of \"From Zero to Geo\", a series where we formulate geometric algebra, an incredibly powerful branch of mathematics, from the ground up.
