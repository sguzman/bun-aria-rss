  "description": "This week, the gals put on their ermine robes and mink mantles to chat about some dastardly kings and queens. Topics include musical underwear, a tale of two cousins with an unnecessary number of spies, and a slightly more violent Romeo and Juliet saga. This episode is paired with Chronic Cellars 2016 Sofa King Bueno Red Blend, so pour some into your goblet (or your father-in-law's skull), assemble the court, and tune in for Royal Kerfuffles.",
