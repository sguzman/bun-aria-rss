  "description": "<p>Scot and Jeff discuss U2 with Stephen Miller.</p>\n<p><span><strong>Introducing the Band</strong></span>:</p>\n<p>Your hosts Scot Bertram (<u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScotBertram\">@ScotBertram</a></u>) and Jeff Blehar (<u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EsotericCD\">@EsotericCD</a></u>) with guest Stephen Miller. He is a contributor to National Review, Fox News, and a well known social media raconteur. Stephen is on Twitter at <u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/redsteeze\">@redsteeze</a></u> where he will calmly insult your music tastes, among other things.</p>\n<p><span><strong>Stephen’s Music Pick: U2</strong></span>:</p>\n<p>The gang gets its Irish up this week as we cover a small Hibernian band of little renown known to the world as U2. As Stephen jokes, they’re the biggest band in the world (still) and yet everyone pretends to hate them. In this epic installment of Political Beats we trace the story of Bono, The Edge, Larry Mullen, and that guy who Jeff used to mistake for a notorious New York City Congressman from their beginnings as a Dublin hooligan gang to world-saving musical superheroes. And in the telling we explain why, even though their most recent albums signal a seemingly permanent decline, you secretly love them too. You know it’s time to go, across the sleet and driving snow, across the fields of mourning light in the distance.</p>\n",
