  "description": "<p>For many different reasons, grassfed meats are all the rage at the moment.  While the incredible benefits are obvious, there seems to be one issue most people run into when preparing grassfed meats; if you’re not careful it can become extremely tough.  Don’t fret my friends, this simply means that grassfed meats tend to be much leaner due to more time in the pasture.  Listen today to learn best practices for defrosting, how to to season a good steak, how to use your grill and oven to cook a perfect steak, the art of the sear, and everything in between.  Beyond cooking tips, I explain why grassfed meats tend to cost more than grain finished products and why the method of finishing the meat can dramatically change the taste.  This episode is a must listen if you’ve ever had any interest in grassfed meat! </p><p>>> A BIG shout-out to our podcast sponsor this month— Lehman’s Hardware! <a href='https://bit.ly/PH-lehmans'>https://bit.ly/PH-lehmans</a></p><p>They are your one-stop homesteading shop for EVERYTHING you need for an old-fashioned lifestyle.
