  "title": "How to 'Feels' the Groove",
  "description": "How does a song with nonsense lyrics capture our attention, making us want to move? It is called the groove. Enter Calvin Harris' \"Feels\" (ft. Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams and Big Sean). Known for mainstreaming EDM, Harris throws out the software and picks up hardware instruments on this track. Upon first listen, this might seem like a sleeper hit, but as the loop repeats, you're going to want to move your feet. With intricate rhythmic interplay, the bass, drums, keys and guitar seem to talk to each other. Listen closely to hear how he does it. Also, we'll reveal why Katy Perry is so into going fishing.\nFeaturingCalvin Harris - Feels (ft.
