  "description": "We kick off this week with some Trials and Triumphs about architects, puzzles, and house plans. Then, our beloved partner and award-winning interior designer Suzanne Kasler joins the show. Suzanne updates us on how she is personally dealing with way more time at home than usual, and the cool products and pieces we can expect from her new line with Ballard in terms of colors, textures, and accessories.\nWhat You’ll Hear On This Episode:\n\nSome trials and triumphs on a new architecture endeavor, fancy house plans, puzzles, hoses, and a cool wardrobe idea for men.\n\nSuzanne collects what she likes as she travels and visits new places. We can pull our design from what inspires us and makes us feel the most connected to our home instead of having strict boundaries or rules.\n\nSuzanne explains why people are gravitating towards woven texture, and how to incorporate woven texture with other patterns and textiles in an elevated and timeless way.\n\nOur new summer collection with Suzanne features the classic and tried and true pieces, but also new fabrics, bright patterns, and items that will create a splash of fun and liveliness.\n\nFashion and interior design can be very much interwoven, and some of Suzanne’s plaid pieces are inspired by the shirts from Christmas.\n\nOf course, Suzanne is making the most of her stay at home time, and she gives us ideas on easy ways to make big changes while our resources may be limited.\n\nIdeas on how we would use a divider screen in our house.\n\nHow we can mix brown furniture in a light and bright room without making it feel heavy.\n\nSuzanne’s two favorite white paint colors, and how to know which one to choose for the specific function.\n\nA few of the new colors in the collection such as mandarin orange, and more about the cyclical timeless colors like blush.\n\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\nBallard - Suzanne Kasler Collection \nLink to Sweepstakes for $10k at Ballard and tour of Suzanne Kasler’s house \nOverstock.com\nMartha Stewart \nCharlotte Moss\nJohn Derian\nHermes \nBenjamin Moore White Dove \nBenjamin Moore Simply White \nDecorating Dilemma:\nYou have so much space and natural light already, so congrats on that! A few suggestions of ours would be to paint the brick white and buy a fireplace screen. If you don’t use the fireplace then adding some white birch logs could look great. If you wanted to add a divider screen that matches the linen on the bed, that could be a solution to your window/bed issue. The room could be a great place to relax and watch TV, so making it comfortable and functional would give you options for a retreat or just a temporary escape! In the fall, Suzanne will be expanding her Mathes collection, so check back in for some chaise options that would look great. Also, we love your wood floors!\n\nSuzanne recommends a neutral linen sofa, and you can add your color in through beautiful throws and pillows. That way you have a timeless couch, and you can change up your color scheme as you desire. The neutral linen sofa would also look great with the textures and tones in your room. We recommend moving the sofa so it is centered, and getting a bigger rug. Put the two end tables at each end of the sofa, and two lamps on them would bring an anchored feel to the room.",
