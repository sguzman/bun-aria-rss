For successful industry-wide 3D IC packaging, these models should be:</p> <ul> <li>Electronically readable for use in design workflows</li> <li>Leverage existing industry standards that are readily available</li> <li>Compatible across the industry, without regard for supply for an open ecosystem and supply chain</li> </ul>",
