For <a href=\"https://apple.news/ABOM0tG6MQqOWwwQxylcytg\"><em>Vox</em></a>, Cogan recently connected with survivors of other school shootings that took place in the 1990s. She spoke with <em>Apple News Today</em> host Shumita Basu about coming of age in a world wholly unprepared to deal with the aftermath of mass school shootings.</p>",
