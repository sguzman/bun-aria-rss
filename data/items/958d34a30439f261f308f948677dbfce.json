  "title": "Ep 123 | Why Is a Grammy-Nominated Artist BLACKBALLED by Music Industry? | John Ondrasik | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "John Ondrasik started playing piano when he was three. Thirty years later, as Five for Fighting, he found himself playing beside his musical heroes at Madison Square Garden after his song “Superman (It’s Not Easy)” became an anthem for the fallen heroes of 9/11. On this episode of the Glenn Beck Podcast, Ondrasik and Glenn chat about music, fame, songwriting, freedom, and the strange power of “Let’s Go Brandon.” He plays “Freedom Never Cries,” “100 Years,” and his latest single, “Blood on My Hands,” which is a protest song, a good one, about Joe Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. “Afghanistan is not a political cause,” Ondrasik tells Glenn. “It’s a moral cause.” Hollywood used to celebrate subversive protest music, so why is one of America's most celebrated ballad artists being ignored by the mainstream? \n\nSponsor: \n\nBuilt Bar - The makers of Built Bar understand that flavor comes first. And whether it’s the mint brownie flavor, salted caramel, cookies ’n' cream, or any of their other amazing flavors, you can rest assured that real chocolate and great taste came first.
