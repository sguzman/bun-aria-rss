  "description": "<p>In this 113th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p> </p><p>This week, we talk about Omicron, Covid, and how public policy has failed to change in light of this highly transmissible but far less dangerous variant. We discuss two excellent essays in Tablet, one by a rabbi in San Francisco, the other on scientific and medical “dissidents,” of which we are two. We discuss the powerful and immense truckers’ convoy in Canada, which is signaling resistance to vaccine mandates, among other authoritarian measures that the duplicitous Ken doll who leads that country has implemented. We show that the MSM in the US is not covering the truckers convoy at all. We discuss Spotify and Substack and Neil Young and Joe Rogan, and provide a simple rubric for one way that you can know if you are on the wrong side of history: you favor censorship.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p> </p><p>MDHearingAid.com: Use promo code DARKHORSE to receive a significant discount off your order of already inexpensive, high-quality hearing aids, plus receive a free extra charging case.
