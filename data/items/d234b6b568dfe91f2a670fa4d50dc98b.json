  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, America is getting a clear-eyed view of what it's like to partner with our enemies and weaken our own economy and turn America into an un-developing country! A look at what it's like to falsely use critical race theory disguised as diversity to breed American-hating, Jew-hating Marxists! The Democrat Party does nothing to stop the radicalization of their Party when their members of Congress compare America to the Taliban. They hold on to bigotry to promote their political agenda while resurrecting \"Jim Crow.\" Yet, Sen. Chuck Schumer, Kamala Harris, and Joe Biden say nothing to stop Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, or the other ‘birthing people of color’ because they are afraid of them. Then, $400 Billion have been ciphered from the U.S by unemployment fraud. But, Biden is parading through Europe saying that white supremacy is the greatest threat that America faces while the country faces inflation. From milk to cars Americans will spend five percent more. This is the fastest rise of goods since the Great Recession of 2008. Later, the media describes the dispute between the anti-Semite ‘birthing people’ and the Marxists concocting an entire nation of White supremacists that don't exist. American patriots are the counter-revolution in this culture war. While Nancy Pelosi calls federal police the old Nazi term \"Storm Troopers\" moms are attending school board meetings to tackle critical race theory because the Marxists will destroy this country Americans of all races. Afterward, more than 100,000 border crossers gained entry into the United States. Biden and Harris know what's happening at the border that's why they don't want to go to the border. FBI Director Christopher Wray says there's no question that drug cartels are pouring across the border.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
