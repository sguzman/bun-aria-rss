  "description": "During Black History month, <em>Book of the Day</em> is bringing you some interviews from the archives, including this one with author Octavia Butler. Butler wrote many sci-fi classics, like the <em>Parable</em> series and <em>Kindred</em>, so she's accustomed to imagining different worlds. NPR's Scott Simon asked her back in 2001 to imagine a world without racism. Butler believed that in racism's place we would have to have absolute empathy. But she told Simon that this would most certainly present its own challenges – and we would probably just find something else to fight about.",
