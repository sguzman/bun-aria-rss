Anna and Sim make sure that his first recording experience is a memorable one, complete with Unqualified-style relationship hypotheticals and, of course, a Tinder date improv with Anna. In Part 1, Johnny also explains why he gets excited about criticism, what advice Roseanne gave him upon getting his role on Big Bang Theory, and the surprising reason he got into a fistfight with his brother on Christmas morning. Later, Anna and Johnny contemplate male vs. female sexual insecurity, and Johnny shares a hilarious story about dating a woman who did voodoo.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
