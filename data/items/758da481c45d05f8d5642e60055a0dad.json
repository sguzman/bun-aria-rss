  "description": "Central banks around the world are at different stages of how they supposedly deal with the COVId-19 crisis. Most are implementing some form of QE, but many are now reducing their purchases, and some are even lifting interest rates. How can they all have a different monetary approach to dealing with the same crisis? And can any claim to have been operating independently, buying up the increasing amount of debt issued by their respective governments? With the big four central banks (the BoE, the ECB, the Fed and the BoJ) having amassed $24.5 trillion in government bonds, does anybody really expect they will ever get their balance sheets back down to zero? If not, have they really embarked on MMT but are afraid to admit it? Phil Dobbie talks to Prof Steve Keen.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
