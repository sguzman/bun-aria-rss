Then he’ll teach you the 3 P’s that stop procrastination.</p> <p>Once John is done with his lesson, Mark is joined again by Chris Goede as they discuss the ways in which they apply these principles to their own leadership within the Maxwell Leadership organization.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is “The Greatest Gap in Life Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
