  "title": "The Best Of Mark Levin - 10/15/22",
  "description": "This week on the Mark Levin Show, the media in America are more than corrupt and pathetic, they take the attention of the nation off things that matter. The best example is a young Youtuber who was beaten and killed in Iran for not wearing a hijab. Then her mother hung herself after seeing her daughter’s body. If you watch the mainstream media, they pay no attention to this. This is happening while Putin is killing and torturing Ukrainians and threatening America with nukes. How come the Squad doesn’t talk about the Palestinian tortured and killed after she was outed as gay? Instead, the media and Democrats tell us Herschel Walker is a threat to country. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and his stooges like Sen. Lisa Murkowski must be defeated because all he does is destroy the conservative candidates that get in his way such as his latest attack on Alaska's Kelly Tshibaka. Meanwhile, election interference from fraudulently changing laws by circumventing the US Constitution and the State's Constitution suffered a blow when the US Supreme Court vacated an Appellate Court decision to allow undated mail-in ballots to be counted. Barring any future decisions, SCOTUS rejected the undated ballots from being accepted in future elections.  The Democrats are a criminal's best friend. Looking at what they've done with our streets, with our border, and our government. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas lies about the border security of this country in order to do the dirty work of Biden's Officials Susan Rice, and Ron Klain. They didn't hesitate to conjure up a narrative about racism back when border agents were charged with whipping Haitian immigrants, but the photographer (an eyewitness) has revealed that Mayorkas knew the photos were being taken out of context hours before making his initial statements and spreading Biden's big lie anyway. Democrats are using their unconstitutional January 6th Committee to subpoena the former President just three weeks from the midterm elections. Meanwhile, the DOJ has leaked to the Washington Post that somehow moving documents from one part of Mar-A-Lago to another part of the residence is some sort of smoking gun. The January 6 hearings are merely a smoke screen because gasoline is up 58% from a year ago, inflation is still at 8%, while food costs are more than double that (15.57% since Biden took office).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
