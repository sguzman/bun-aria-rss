  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, the media is stoking the flames telling the nation to expect riots after the result of the Derek Chauvin trial, while Antifa and BLM are watching and acting on it. This is the new normal in Minneapolis and Portland, and coming to the rest of the country. Rep Maxine Waters went to Brooklyn Center over the weekend to encourage rioters and urge them to keep it up, demanding a guilty verdict for Chauvin. This is another case of Waters’ directly inciting violence, but she won’t be impeached like Donald Trump, who had to have his words twisted to frame him for incitement. Nancy Pelosi is defending Waters, lying and saying that she shouldn’t apologize and wasn’t inciting violence. Lost in all of this is the idea of the American justice system. The mob is in charge now, and justice is served only to stop the mob from burning the country down. Also, members of the “squad” spent thousands of dollars in private security, showing again how hypocritical progressive Democrats are. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Cori Bush push to defund the police so you can’t be protected, but at the same time hide behind their own guards. Later, Dr. Marc Seigel calls in to discuss the harm from pulling the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
