  "description": "Phil Robertson is NOT someone you want to get in a boat with, and Jay Stone and some corporate bigwigs have the near-drowning story to prove it. Martin and Stone talk about the perils of navigating the floodwaters during duck season. Si sports his new hat, and John-David can’t tell if we're seeing a raccoon tail or Si’s ponytail. The boys tip their hats to a group of dads who went ALL IN on getting local high school kids back on track. Stone rants about litter and road signs getting shot up. And when John-David leads the boys into a conversation about how to handle the death of a loved one, Martin and Si drop a whole lot of wisdom.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
