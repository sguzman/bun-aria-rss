  "description": "<p class=\"\">Tasha Harrison is joining us this week to talk about an old reliable trope — enemies to lovers! This is one of those that we return to again and again — and of course, since it’s a Pandemic, we have to ask…if you’re into enemies to lovers and you haven’t read Kresley Cole’s Immortals After Dark, what are you waiting for? Season 1 is here for you! Otherwise, we’re freewheeling with Tasha on everything from the best Chris to the real inspiration for The Wire, so strap in. It’s a ride!</p><p class=\"\">We love having you with us! — subscribe on your favorite podcasting platform and like/review the podcast, please!</p><p class=\"\">Next week, we’re reading <a href=\"https://sandrabrown.net/booklist/classic-romance/\">Sandra Brown</a>! Jen and Sarah will be reading <em>Texas! Chase</em>, but it’s dealers’ choice! Pick your favorite old Sandra Brown or ask us for a rec on Twitter or Instagram! Maybe you want <em>That Rana Look</em>? Or <em>Slow Heat in Heaven</em>? Or <em>French Silk</em>? You can find them wherever books are sold (but the Texas! series isn’t in ebook format yet, sadly) — and don’t forget your favorite indie!</p><p class=\"\">Also, if you love the music in this or any of our episodes, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6QWZy7vo4Dw9eS733PJj1U?si=W1voWFsHS5uPHHkw0WCHMw\">check out our Spotify playlist</a>, which includes it all!</p><p class=\"\">Show Notes</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/business/coronavirus-internet-traffic-speed.html\">The internet is so slow</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Remember that time when <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ElZYipV81QM\">Michelle from Destiny's Child fell</a>and then <a href=\"https://thegrio.com/2016/02/11/michelle-williams-responds-to-throwback-video-of-destinys-child-stage-fall/\">got right back up</a>?</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/chosen-one-of-the-day-fraggle-rock-marjory-the-trash-heap\">The Fraggle Rock Trash Heap</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/news-and-features/articles/physics-of-great-romance-fiction/\">Jen wrote about Enemies to Lovers</a> for Kirkus.</p><p class=\"\">Apparently, it's called a <a href=\"http://www.rinkworks.com/words/eponyms.shtml\">Proprietary Eponyms</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/smarter-living/how-a-brand-name-becomes-generic.html\">when a brand name becomes a verb or common noun</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://electricliterature.com/should-fiction-be-timeless-pop-culture-references-in-contemporary-novels/\">The question of whether or not fiction should be \"timeless\"</a> is one that authors deal with in different ways.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/robert-redford-hollywood-most-stylish-man\">Robert Redford was a snack</a>. <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/people/2018/07/26/kevin-costner-once-hailed-as-the-sexiest-man-alive-on-his-appeal-as-an-actor\">Kevin Costner</a> was named <a href=\"https://muscatinejournal.com/entertainment/here-s-a-look-at-every-sexiest-man-alive-since/collection_883addaf-71e2-51fb-b56c-827069746814.html#34\">The Sexiest Man Alive</a>, but Jen thinks the only time he was truly sexy was in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pWRCxdh4PTM\">Bull Durham.</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-decade-long-power-ranking-of-the-chrises\">Can there ever be a definitive ranking of the Chrises</a>?
