  "title": "Ryan T. Anderson and Alexandra DeSanctis, \"Tearing Us Apart: How Abortion Harms Everything and Solves Nothing\" (Regnery, 2022)",
  "description": "According to political philosopher Ryan T. Anderson and journalist Alexandra DeSantis, abortion harms everything it touches. It is an act of lethal violence against a child and leaves many women with lifelong regret and feelings of guilt and loss. Far from empowering women, abortion has reduced privileged women to serving as economic drudges to abortion-friendly corporations. “Pro-choice” culture pressures poor and minority women to regard abortion as liberating and presents childbearing as against their interests.\nThese are some of the arguments in Anderson and DeSanctis’ book, Tearing Us Apart: How Abortion Harms Everything and Solves Nothing (Regnery Publishing, 2022). \nThis is an unabashedly pro-life book. It portrays abortion—from what happens to the child and mother during an abortion to the way that the pro-abortion jurisprudence of the Roe Era of 1973-2022 led even supposedly conservative Supreme Court justices to misread the Constitution.\nThe authors argue that pro-abortion legal arguments have ranged from calling the child in the womb “a potential life” and treating abortion as a mostly medical issue and privacy matter (in Roe) and then an economic justice and gender equality issue (in Planned Parenthood v. Casey) to now a matter of convenience sans any moral discussion at all.\nThe book makes clear why millions of pro-life activists spent decades fighting to end Roe and how they are now gearing up to assist the mothers and children who will face life together in a post-Roe world. The authors call for the entire country to pull together to create a pro-life, pro-family society in which the laws governing abortion or outlawing it entirely have now been returned to the states and the people.\nToday we will talk to one of the co-authors of the book, Alexandra DeSanctis.\nGive a listen.\nHope J. Leman is a grants researcher.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices\nSupport our show by becoming a premium member! https://newbooksnetwork.supportingcast.fm/public-policy",
