  "description": "Today’s guest is Boston-based interior designer, Lindsay Atapattu, of LEB Interiors. Her spaces incorporate traditional elements in a clean, edited way. We talk about her love of traditional and where it meets modern, which elements are making a comeback, which elements are trending, designing with kids in mind, using color and chintz, and more.\n\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nTrials & Triumphs! Updates on Taryn’s house and waiting for the baby to arrive, a new bed and sofa from Ballard, empty nesting, innovative ways to hide cords and devices using an IR repeater, and missing curtains.\n\nHow Boston and Lindsay’s family background has affected her style.\n\nHow Lindsay decorates areas that are not considered “beautiful”.\n\nLindsay recommends decorating in layers and buying quality items that will last, but also looking for budget items.\n\nWhere should families with kids splurge, and save, their dollars?\n\nWhich traditional style elements are coming back?\n\nDecorating for kids’ rooms.\n\nWhat elements are trending?\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Jamie,\n\nThe first thing I want you to do is get in there and paint the walls. I always say paint it white if it’s a big room; you can always change it. Get two of the same rugs; one for the dining space and one for the living space. They can be different sizes, or really different designs if you want, but keep it cohesive.\n\nNext, let’s talk pendants; I would definitely pare from 4 pendants down to 2 or 3. Go for larger pendants and use painter’s tape to mark where you might want to place them. In terms of the lamps behind the sofa, that’s tough. You really have to have the outlets in the ground instead of coming out of the wall; especially with kids running around. Depending on the positioning you could have cords go under the rugs and plug into a wall if it’s close enough. The best thing to do would be to have an electrician come and if you have a basement, see if they can run a cord and drill up. If you’re having one come in to quote the pendants, you might as well get a quote for that too. Otherwise, I would say forego the lamps behind the sofa and add one on an end table closest to the outlet or even a floor lamp.\n\nNow the sofas; I think if you have a basement for the kids to go to that’s a perfect place for slipcovers. The space in the photo I think is a little more formal so I wouldn’t do the slipcover unless you’re going for more of a farmhouse look. Just be sure, to be honest with yourself about how often you’ll take the slipcover off; because it’s a pain! Ballard and others make really great performance fabrics these days, so I would opt for using that on a more formal piece in this room… especially if you have another place for the kids to hang out.\n\nFinally, we would all like to see you add some fabric or texture to add softness to your seating so it’s not all wooden (i.e. the stools and the dining room chairs). You have a good base here. Good luck, Jamie!\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nThe Schwartz House on Instagram\nBrie Channel Bed\nBallard Pleated Lampshades\nBissell Spot and Stain Cleaner\nLEB Interiors\nLEB Interiors on Instagram",
