  "description": "<p>EPISODE 79 - HARRY GRUYAERT - Still Photographer</p> <p>Team Deakins speaks with the acclaimed stills photographer Harry Gruyaert. What a great conversation! We learn that when he started, he directed and shot for Flemish TV and he explains why he changed his path and became a stills photographer. He shares the importance of intuition in his work and finding your own way of seeing and style. We love what he does with color so we speak a lot about color and how he uses it, and he speaks of when he would use B&W over color. He also goes into detail about his early work in Morocco and how he relates to the subjects of his photographs. He shares what he was thinking when shooting specific shots and tells a wonderful story about his photo with the Magritte painting. He’s an artist that works for his own pleasure without concerning himself about how people will react and we certainly love the results he achieves!</p>",
