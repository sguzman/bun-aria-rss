So as the education world adjusts to new changes, especially when it comes to virtual learning, our devices should too. Teachers need more powerful machines to help them plan and share lessons, manage student performance and teach both remotely and in person; IT teams need devices they can easily repair, repurpose and upgrade; and students need ones that keep their personal and school data safe, and can easily fit into a backpack.</p><p>So today, we’re introducing a new line of more secure and sustainable Chromebook devices — plus updated programs, resources and Chrome OS advances — built entirely for education.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Discover more device options</h3><p>We know there are many types of Chromebooks out there, and it can be hard to find the right match. On our new <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/products/chromebooks/find-a-chromebook\">Chromebook discovery page</a>, you can easily search for device capabilities like graphic design and lesson planning. You can also find which Chromebooks have features like LTE connectivity, improved video conferencing and camera-based document scanning.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 h-c-grid__col--offset-2\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"Gif of three enterprise grade Chromebooks rotating\" class=\"article-image--large\" src=\" https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Go-Chrome---OEM-Carousel.gif \" tabindex=\"0\"/></a></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>New teacher-inspired Chromebooks — like the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook and Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook — have improved stylus capabilities, design and performance. And with the same OS as their students, teachers can easily help them troubleshoot and navigate the latest updates. New student devices — including the HP Fortis 14 G10 Chromebook, ASUS Chromebook Flip CR1, Dell Chromebook 3110 and Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go — also have greater durability and updated connectivity capabilities. And like all Chromebooks, each one has a cloud-based operating system that keeps apps and documents securely backed up, even if devices are damaged or lost.</p><p>With these new, more powerful devices, schools can continue helping students plan their futures. <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_us/why-google/case-studies/chester-upland-school-district/\">Read</a> how the Chester Upland School District in Pennsylvania is using Chromebooks to deliver design software programs like Adobe to prepare their students for design and engineering jobs.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Repair, revive and future-proof your devices</h3><p>The best way for schools to drive sustainability while cutting costs is by extending the life spans of their devices. We <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/chromebook-repairs\">just announced</a> the <a href=\"http://edu.google.com/products/chromebooks/chromebook-repairability?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=crp\">Chromebook repair program</a>, where we’re working with partners like Acer and Lenovo to share more information about Chromebooks that schools can easily repair themselves with proper training. As part of the program, we’ve also introduced new resources and best practices like <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_us/why-google/case-studies/jenks-public-schools\">setting up a student-run IT shop</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 h-c-grid__col--offset-2\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"Animation showing tools , with text explaining the benefits of a student-led repair program — including faster and more cost-effective repairs.\" class=\"article-image--large\" src=\" https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/004-ESU-Chromebook_Repair_Program_Listicle-Animation-R2.gif \" tabindex=\"0\"/></a></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>For more about these updates, visit the revamped <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/a/?hl=en#topic=7679105\">Chrome Enterprise and Education Help Center</a>.
