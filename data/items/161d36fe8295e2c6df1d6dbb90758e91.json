[05:44]</p><p>How the Londolozi Game Reserve came to be, and what happened during Boyd’s childhood that instilled him with a “get on with it” attitude. [08:02]</p><p>Why did Boyd’s father and uncle insist on keeping the property that would become the Londolozi Game Reserve when, at the time, it was considered useless, overgrazed wasteland? [10:18]</p><p>Boyd shares what it was like growing up as a regular passenger/survivor of The White Knuckle Charter Company. [12:25]</p><p>How a man named Ken Tinley and the native Shangaan trackers helped a trio of teenagers transform their expanse of scrub-encroached land into a thriving safari business. [21:03]</p><p>On the ancient lineage of the Shangaan trackers, and how the local wildlife came to trust the human caretakers of Londolozi. [27:05]</p><p>Renias Mhlongo is supreme among world-class trackers — and sometimes the importance of the work outweighs the will of his clients. [32:21]</p><p>Which animals are hardest to track at Londolozi — even if you happen to be Richard Siwela? [37:53]</p><p>Because nature can be unpredictable, how do people protect themselves in Londolozi? [41:03]</p><p>“I don’t know where we’re going, but I know exactly how to get there.” —Renias Mhlongo [42:56]</p><p>How the tracking process has changed for Boyd over the years — from confident child to young adult traumatized by a home invasion and crocodile attack to competent grown-up thanks to people like Dr. Martha Beck and Solly Mhlongo. [45:00]</p><p>What is Ubuntu? [1:02:50]</p><p>Boyd talks about that time he lived 40 days and 40 nights up a tree — the questions he was trying to answer for himself by doing so, the primal fear he experienced while waiting out a storm, the pros and cons of extreme solitude, and if he’d do it again. [1:05:15]</p><p>Stories about bees, the birds who help humans rob them, and the power of the hive algorithm. [1:17:45]</p><p>The dos and don’ts of interacting with lions in the wild. [1:29:42]</p><p>On the eerie conversation of death, modern confirmation of ancient myths, and the inexplicable movements of beasts and men. [1:34:16]</p><p>How did Boyd’s own path toward healing after trauma differ from the way his mother and sister recovered from a trauma they experienced? [1:39:57]</p><p>What is ceremony work, and how can it help someone deal with trauma? [1:43:32]</p><p>What Boyd means when he says “an authentic life infused with meaning is a kind of activism.” [1:46:40]</p><p>How Boyd and I have both been affected by the Work of Byron Katie. [1:52:03]</p><p>Boyd’s first medicine encounter in an Arizona sweat lodge, and what he took away from the experience. [1:56:31]</p><p>Feelings. Nothing more than feelings. [2:02:49]</p><p>Kudus and nightjars and leopards in the fire (oh, my)! What a close encounter with a beautiful predator taught Boyd about Ubuntu. [2:04:14]</p><p>Examining the therapeutic value of spending time with animals. [2:13:05]</p><p>Laurens van der Post poetically described the sound of a lion’s roar. And, in a packed presentation hall at a major Silicon Valley company, Boyd did not. [2:17:57]</p><p>An invitation to visit Londolozi and other parting thoughts.

[10:18]\n\nBoyd shares what it was like growing up as a regular passenger/survivor of The White Knuckle Charter Company. [12:25]\n\nHow a man named Ken Tinley and the native Shangaan trackers helped a trio of teenagers transform their expanse of scrub-encroached land into a thriving safari business. [21:03]\n\nOn the ancient lineage of the Shangaan trackers, and how the local wildlife came to trust the human caretakers of Londolozi. [27:05]\n\nRenias Mhlongo is supreme among world-class trackers — and sometimes the importance of the work outweighs the will of his clients. [32:21]\n\nWhich animals are hardest to track at Londolozi — even if you happen to be Richard Siwela? [37:53]\n\nBecause nature can be unpredictable, how do people protect themselves in Londolozi? [41:03]\n\n“I don’t know where we’re going, but I know exactly how to get there.” —Renias Mhlongo [42:56]\n\nHow the tracking process has changed for Boyd over the years — from confident child to young adult traumatized by a home invasion and crocodile attack to competent grown-up thanks to people like Dr. Martha Beck and Solly Mhlongo. [45:00]\n\nWhat is Ubuntu? [1:02:50]\n\nBoyd talks about that time he lived 40 days and 40 nights up a tree — the questions he was trying to answer for himself by doing so, the primal fear he experienced while waiting out a storm, the pros and cons of extreme solitude, and if he’d do it again. [1:05:15]\n\nStories about bees, the birds who help humans rob them, and the power of the hive algorithm. [1:17:45]\n\nThe dos and don’ts of interacting with lions in the wild. [1:29:42]\n\nOn the eerie conversation of death, modern confirmation of ancient myths, and the inexplicable movements of beasts and men. [1:34:16]\n\nHow did Boyd’s own path toward healing after trauma differ from the way his mother and sister recovered from a trauma they experienced? [1:39:57]\n\nWhat is ceremony work, and how can it help someone deal with trauma? [1:43:32]\n\nWhat Boyd means when he says “an authentic life infused with meaning is a kind of activism.” [1:46:40]\n\nHow Boyd and I have both been affected by the Work of Byron Katie. [1:52:03]\n\nBoyd’s first medicine encounter in an Arizona sweat lodge, and what he took away from the experience. [1:56:31]\n\nFeelings. Nothing more than feelings. [2:02:49]\n\nKudus and nightjars and leopards in the fire (oh, my)! What a close encounter with a beautiful predator taught Boyd about Ubuntu. [2:04:14]\n\nExamining the therapeutic value of spending time with animals. [2:13:05]\n\nLaurens van der Post poetically described the sound of a lion’s roar. And, in a packed presentation hall at a major Silicon Valley company, Boyd did not. [2:17:57]\n\nAn invitation to visit Londolozi and other parting thoughts.
