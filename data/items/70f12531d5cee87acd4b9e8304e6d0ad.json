  "description": "<p>For thousands of years, the study of rhetoric was a fundamental part of a man's education. Though it ceased to be commonly taught in the 19th century, my guest today argues that it's an art well worth reviving in the modern day.</p>\n<p>His name is <a href=\"http://arguelab.com/\">Jay Heinrichs</a>, and he's an expert in language and persuasion and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593237382/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0593237382&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Thank You for Arguing: What Aristotle, Lincoln, and Homer Simpson Can Teach Us About the Art of Persuasion</em></a>. Jay and I begin our conversation with a description of what rhetoric is, why after being taught around the world for centuries it fell out of favor as a component of education, and why it's still essential for everyone, especially leaders, to learn. We then unpack the difference between fighting and arguing, and how it’s the latter that’s a lost art, especially in our digital age. From there we discuss each of Aristotle’s three tools of rhetoric -- ethos, pathos, and logos -- including a dive into how the way your audience sees your character is so important, and how you can even do an ethos analysis of your resume. We then delve into Cicero's five canons of rhetoric, and Jay shares a smart technique for memorizing a presentation, and thus delivering it more persuasively. We end our conversation with a fun game you can play to sharpen your rhetorical skills. </p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/rhetoric\">aom.is/rhetoric</a>.</p>\n",
