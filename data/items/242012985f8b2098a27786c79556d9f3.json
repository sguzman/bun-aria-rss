At the time the cowardly media lambasted this program as engaging in tinfoil hat conspiracy theories. Shame on them. Then, Special Counsel John Durham has filed a motion on a potential conflict of interest of Michael Sussman's attorneys indicating that Sussman's counsel may be representing someone else related to the case. Later, Hans Mahncke from the Epoch Times calls in to discuss the story he broke that Trump was spied on while he was President. The additional spying was aided by an executive from an internet company and did so at the behest of the Hillary Clinton campaign. Afterward, Mark Meckler the founder of the Convention of States movement joins the show with an update.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
