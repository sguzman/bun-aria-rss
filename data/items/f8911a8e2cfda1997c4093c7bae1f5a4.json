  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Lots of subtitles this time. This week on The First Run, Chris and Matt discuss the latest Pedro Almodóvar and Penelope Cruz team up, ‘Parallel Mothers’. Cruz plays a single mother trying to balance her career, life, and a terrible secret. Speaking of secrets, I was certain Matt “Once Bitten, Twice Shy” Howell was going to watch the Lawrence Fishburne, Stephen Baldwin classic ‘Fled’ instead, but thankfully here we are. It’s the Danish animated documentary tearing up the charts, ‘Flee’.&nbsp; A tale of survival and secrets from a child refugee of war-torn Afghanistan.&nbsp; To lighten things up, we’ll review the big releases on Physical Media featuring the Streaming and Straight to DVD Picks of the Week.&nbsp; Matt and Chris then close out the show with the first part of our 10 Favorite Films of 2021, Films 10-6.&nbsp; What’s making the cut?
