And then it got worse.”</p><p>Joseph Naus</p><br><p>Addiction is a common theme on this podcast.</p><p>But this week we sail into previously unchartered&nbsp;waters to tackle&nbsp;a dark and difficult subject:</p><p>Sex addiction.</p><p>Few taboos remain in our hyper-extroverted, selfie-fueled modern culture. But I think it's safe to say this remains one of them.</p><p>And yet 18 million – 24 million people in the U.S. alone&nbsp;suffer from this incredibly destructive&nbsp;affliction — that's 6-8% of the population. But because this particular topic is so taboo, most locked in the grip of this prurient form of addiction&nbsp;are too terrified to reach out for help and thus suffer in isolation, silence and profound shame.</p><p>Joseph Naus was one of them.</p><p>Raised in hardscrabble poverty by a young, single mom —&nbsp;a heroin addict turned shut-in depressive — Joseph was desperate to find a way out. On sheer determination he succeeds, graduating Pepperdine Law School to become a respected lawyer.</p><p>However, at age 32, his American Dream became a nightmare when his secret life as a sex addict collided with his not so secret alcoholism to destroy every aspect of his life with the explosive force of an atomic bomb.</p><p>Convicted of a felony and disbarred, Joseph has spent the last twelve years learning humility the hard way: making a living doing everything from picking up the trash on film sets to selling outdoor kitchens at home shows for a former client, all while cleaning up the wreckage of his past and building a new life.</p><p>Joseph's tale is one of darkness, desperation and demons. It's horrifying and it's cautionary. But it's also about redemption. Forgiveness. And the journey to find wholeness. A story laudably chronicled with distressing&nbsp;honesty and harrowing detail in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0986283398/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0986283398&linkCode=as2&tag=ricroloffweb-20&linkId=CSCQINKLOIJ3Y6MD\" target=\"_blank\">Straight Pepper Diet: A Memoir*.</a></p><p>I understand that some may cringe at the prospect of tuning in for this&nbsp;one. I get that. But on a personal level I feel a responsibility to tackle the subject.

I applaud that.
