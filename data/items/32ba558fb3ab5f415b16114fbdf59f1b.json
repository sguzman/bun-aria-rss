  "description": "BEYOND the DARKNESS has Bob Lazar: Area 51 & Flying Saucers with documentarian Jeremy Corbell!<br>\n<br>\nFormer Government physicist Bob Lazar made headlines world-wide in 1989 when he came forward with his account of reverse-engineering an alien spacecraft for the US Military. The reason the public even knows the name Area 51 is because Lazar talked about the work he did at the formerly secret military base.
