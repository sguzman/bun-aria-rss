  "description": "<p>Just in time for spooky season, it’s an episode all about superstitions! Do you avoid the number 13? Or maybe it’s your lucky number, like Taylor Swift? In this episode we’ll look at why we have such strong feelings toward 13, and we’ll hear about other unlucky and lucky numbers around the world. Plus, Marc and Sanden will explain why our brains latch on to superstitions in the first place. Oh, and our favorite talking skeleton, Mr. Bonejangles, is back with a spine-tingling quiz! All that and a Moment of Um that answers the question: do cockroaches have hearts?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by</p>\n<p>The <em>Who, When, Wow!</em> podcast  (<a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/who-when-wow/\" title=\"Who, When, Wow!\" class=\"default\">Who, When, Wow!</a>)</p>\n",
