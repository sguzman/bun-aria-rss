  "description": "Follow our newly launched ALL PARANORMAL podcast called 'Paranormal Fears'. Paranormal Fears is a new podcast that conducts in-depth interviews about true hauntings that have scared the living daylights out of those that have experienced them. People that experience hauntings, if not ready for it, will have their sanity tested to the fullest. Some are lucky enough to find help when facing the malevolent actions of a house or something that seems sentient and downright angry. Then you have others that can't find help and being too frighten to even sleep, become mentally fragile with nowhere to go. While spirits and entities are not on our plane of existence, some of them still claim our dwellings as their own. The only question is....are YOU in one?\nWebsite - Paranormal Fears\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
