  "description": "From the host of NPR's Planet Money, the deeply-investigated story of how one visionary, dogged investor changed American finance forever.\nBefore Bill Gross was known among investors as the Bond King, he was a gambler. In 1966, a fresh college grad, he went to Vegas armed with his net worth ($200) and a knack for counting cards. $10,000 and countless casino bans later, he was hooked: so he enrolled in business school.\nThe Bond King: How One Man Made a Market, Built an Empire, and Lost It All (Flatiron Books, 2021) is the story of how that whiz kid made American finance his casino. Over the course of decades, Bill Gross turned the sleepy bond market into a destabilized game of high risk, high reward; founded Pimco, one of today's most powerful, secretive, and cutthroat investment firms; helped to reshape our financial system in the aftermath of the Great Recession--to his own advantage; and gained legions of admirers, and enemies, along the way. Like every American antihero, his ambition would also be his undoing.\nTo understand the winners and losers of today's money game, journalist Mary Childs argues, is to understand the bond market--and to understand the bond market is to understand the Bond King.\nJohn Emrich has worked for decades in corporate finance, business valuation and fund management. He has a podcast about the investment advisory industry called Kick the Dogma.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
