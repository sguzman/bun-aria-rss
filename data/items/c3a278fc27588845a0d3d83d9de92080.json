  "description": "<p>In this episode, John reacts to the Steelers MNF win against the Giants in Big Ben's return, the Titans outlasting the Broncos despite 4 missed Stephen Gostowski field goals, and why Vic Fangio's horrendous late game management is inexcusable. He also explains why he's not bailing on Tom Brady in Tampa after a bad debut, gives his take on Aaron Rodgers reverting to his MVP form in week 1, why there are still legitimate questions about Carson Wentz and Jimmy Garoppolo after rough starts. He also runs through his week 1 hits and misses, why he doesn't think the NFL needs to worry about coaches wearing masks and answers listener questions in the Middlekauff Mailbag.
