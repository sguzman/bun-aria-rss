  "description": "<p>The Battle of the Somme began on July 1st 1916, one hundred years ago this month, and it lasted until the 18th of November. This was the defining battle of the first world war and the very first day of this clash was the bloodiest in the history of the British Army. Hundreds of thousands would lose their lives in the four months of fighting. This was a campaign fought between the German and British empires and the Battle of the Somme has been called the beginning of modern all-arms warfare. The bloodshed is similar to the Gettysburg and Antietam battles during the American Civil War and as we have found with the locations where these meetings took place, the Battle of the Somme battlefield is reputed to be incredibly haunted. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Battle of the Somme! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Brittany Cox and features Crybaby Bridge and This Day in History features the discovery of the Hale-Bopp Comet. Our location was suggested by and researched by Oddity Editor Bob Sherfield.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/07/hgb-ep-138-battle-of-somme.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/07/hgb-ep-138-battle-of-somme.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
