  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the Biden monarchy is an example of statism, not Americanism. It promotes sweeping anti-energy and race-equity plans without even passing a single law, without having a debate, or having a single deliberative hearing. Like a king, Biden took Obama's pen and turned it into Mussolini's pen by signing close to 40 executive orders without even attempting to go through Congress to pass any legislation. Later, Biden isn't eliminating jobs in government, he's crushing union jobs and small businesses too. Tyranny comes in many forms but it always attacks the founding of our country. Then, Sen. Ted Cruz joins the program and explains that the District of Columbia was carved out by the founders to be a territory that does not belong to any state. Cruz also discussed how China conducts espionage through technology and American higher education. Of particular concern is Biden's pick for US Ambassador who has made favorable remarks about China suggesting that the US should become more like the communist Chinese Party. Afterward, the Posse Comitatus act allows for the use of federal military troops to assist with law enforcement during an insurrection. While there is no insurrection in Washington, DC, there are still thousands of national guard troops there.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
