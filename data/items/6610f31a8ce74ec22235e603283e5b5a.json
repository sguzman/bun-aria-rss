There is the direct experience of the world itself, while we’re reading a book or seeing a play, especially for the first time. This experience is uncritical, or rather pre-critical, so it’s not infallible. If our experience is limited, we can be roused to enthusiasm or carried away by something that we can later see to have been second-rate or even phony. Then there is the conscious, critical response we make after we’ve finished reading or left the theatre, where we compare what we’ve experienced with other things of the same kind, and form a judgment of value and proportion on it. This critical response, with practice, gradually makes our pre-critical responses more sensitive and accurate, or improves our taste, as we say. But behind our responses to our literary experience as a whole, as a total possession.</p> <cite>Northrup Frye</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Reason thus with life:</p> <p>If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</p> <p>That none but fools would keep.</p> <cite>William Shakespeare</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>A boat will not answer to the rudder unless it is in motion; the poet can work upon us only as long as we are kept on the move.</p> <cite>C. S. Lewis</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>The wit of Jane Austen has for partner the perfection of her taste. Her fool is a fool, her snob is a snob, because he departs from the model of sanity and sense which she had in mind, and conveys to us unmistakably even while she makes us laugh. Never did any novelist make more use of an impeccable sense of human values. It is against the disc of an unerring heart, an unfailing good taste, an almost stern morality, that she shows up those deviations from kindness, truth, sincerity which are among the most delightful things on English literature.</p> <cite>Virginia Woolf</cite></blockquote> <h3>Selection from “Epistle to a Lady, Of the Characters of Women”</h3> <p><em>by Alexander Pope</em></p> <pre class=\"wp-block-verse\"> Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?
