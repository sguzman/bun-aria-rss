  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, Robert Mueller and Rod Rosenstein must comply with and enforce the rules, regulations, and procedures of the Department of Justice, which includes the official position of the DOJ that a sitting president cannot be indicted. If Mueller tries to indict Trump, he would be violating the orders of his superiors and create a constitutional crisis. If Democrats and the media were concerned about the constitution and separation of powers they would be raising these issues. Also, Michael Cohen should be disbarred for his secret recordings of President Trump, but that isn’t stopping CNN from propping him up despite being absolutely disreputable. There’s no obstruction of justice or campaign violations, yet Cohen’s recordings are being endlessly debated. Later, Mark recaps his interview with Lt. Col. Allen West on Life, Liberty, and Levin.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
