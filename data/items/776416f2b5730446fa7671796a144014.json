  "description": "<p>LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he and his guest go deep into the subject of mortality via cinema, and this week he is joined by ex-Hollyoaks regular and current Dr Who companion, MANDIP GILL!</p><br><p>You may have even caught Mandip on screen with Brett himself in a recent Dr Who episode! A lovely chat with the awesomely funny and always switched on and friendly Mandip, which will energise and invigorate you and surely encourage you to investigate her work further. While a great amount of cinema classics are delved into in usual Films To Be Buried With style and fashion, you can expect to hear so much more including more about Dr Who - what it was like on set and the importance of lightness and humour within the dynamic, how she gets recognized on the street more for Hollyoaks than anything else she’s been in, being the sixth kid of seven, intrusive thought syndrome and what it means for her daily life (and general thoughts on mortality), and on top of that you’ll also get some dry-land swimming lessons. Sound good? Of course it does!
