  "description": "<p>The esteemed author and poet Maya Angelou once said: “I have written eleven books, but each time I think, uh oh, they’re going to find out now. I’ve run a game on everybody , and they’re going to find me out.” Imposter Syndrome is when you feel like a phony, as if you are fooling others, and are afraid of being somehow exposed as someone who doesn’t really know what they are doing or talking about. Individuals with imposter syndrome have trouble attributing their success to their own achievement and are likely to procrastinate out of anxiety or overwork. Learn more about traits of those with Imposter Syndrome through my conversation with guest Lauren Todd. Lauren Todd, MS, is trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with a humanistic flair. She has worked with individuals across the life span at New York Presbyterian Hospital, McLean Hospital, and Integrated Care for the Underserved of Northeastern New Jersey. Lauren is in her fifth year of PhD studies of psychology at Fairleigh Dickinson University and her primary areas of interest are eating disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and life transitions, particularly among children and adolescents. To learn more about Imposter Syndrome begin with Sakulku and Alexander’s 2011 article in the International Journal of Behavioral Science entitled “The Imposter Phenomenon.” If you enjoyed this episode and others, there are a few ways that you can show your support:1) order a book from PsychologyAmerica.com where there is a selection of books I’ve personally chosen (your order will go seamlessly through to Amazon.com) 2), leave an awesome rating on iTunes or 3) press subscribe to continue to receive new episodes.

Consider the gift of my children’s book entitled: “There’s Always Hope: a Story About Overcoming.\" It can be found on PsychologyAmerica.com, Amazon.com or at Sparta Books. </p><a rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dralexandra\">Support the show</a><p>This show was created with love on my volunteer time.
