  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the left will subpoena all of Donald Trump's children, and anyone else they can to cover up for Speaker Pelosi's dereliction of duty to keep the Capitol building safe. They will pretend that Trump is the greatest threat since the Civil War, but it's the Democrat Party and Pelosi that is the greatest threat to democracy. This country has seen 4 presidents assassinated, it's seen Black people prevented from voting because of Democrat Jim Crow laws, and yet the Democrats will try and trick you into believing that whatever they say is the biggest threat to democracy. What the Democrats have done to the Constitution and the presidency during Trump's term is the biggest affront to this republic's history. Then, a radical group focused on the secession of Puerto Rico, opened fire inside the US Capitol Building shooting 4 US Congressmen in 1954. The Weather Underground set off a bomb at the Capitol in 1971. In May of 1972 leftwing terrorists set off a bomb outside the State Department. Democrats, however, will not call these attacks an insurrection or the biggest threat to democracy, will they? Afterward, Liz Cheney admitted on cable news that her purpose on the January 6th Committee is to make sure Donald Trump never gets near the White House again. Not as Pelosi says, to get to the bottom of what really happened. This, along with the attacks from the New York Attorney General on Trump and his family are the real threat to democracy. Later, why do you think that Democrats want non-citizens to vote? Why do Democrats resist voter ID laws? It's because they want to choose who can vote so they can make voting eligible for all, not only those legally qualified to vote.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
