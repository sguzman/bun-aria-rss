    "media:description": "A nature documentary deep dive into the aliens of No Man’s Sky. What sort of ecosystems will we discover in a procedurally generated universe?\n---\nCurious Archive Social Media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Curious_Archive\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/CuriousArchive\n\nAcross the infinite cosmos of the video game ‘No Man’s Sky,’ there are a similarly infinite number of alien lifeforms. Through the use of procedural generation, the game contains more than 18 quintillion planets to discover — many of which teem with extraordinary creatures. While No Man’s Sky had a rocky reception at launch, the developers have done persistent work making this virtual universe worth exploring.\n\nSo, for this entry into the archive, we’ll embark on a classic documentary-style expedition, exploring the lives of extraterrestrials on scorching worlds, frozen wastelands, and many others. I’ll also speculate on how the biology of each lifeform might feasibly work. I admit that there are a few too many total planets for this Archivist to document, so this documentary will focus on only the most interesting ones I’ve discovered.\n\nNow, let’s set off into the unknown, and see what awaits us among the stars…\n\n0:00 Biology of No Man’s Sky\n1:10 Planet Rhea\n5:58 Planet Boreas\n9:16 Planet Nereus\n13:59 Planet Helios\n18:16 Planet Erebus\n21:18 Goodbye to Infinity...\n\nCopyright Disclaimer: Under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education, and research.
