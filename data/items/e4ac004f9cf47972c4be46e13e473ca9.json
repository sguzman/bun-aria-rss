  "description": "<p>Brian Callen is a comedy genius and one of the funniest guys out there right now. He’s been making me laugh for years even back to his MAD TV days. His new comedy special is amazing and you MUST watch it immediately. It’s so good to hear him back on Rogan for a one on one conversation. It was fun to review.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p><a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</a></p>\n",
