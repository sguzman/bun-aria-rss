  "description": "<p>The Cigar Authority welcomes John Fazzi to the show as we celebrate Halloween on episode number 498. What surprises will be in store this week as the boys smoke the Kristoff Shade Grown from the Care Package. We will discuss the lines from Kristoff and John’s past experience as a Black Jack Dealer.</p>\n<p>We will also cross over to The Snack Authority as we discuss best selling and worst selling Halloween Candy with Ed Sullivan and ask if any of them pair well with cigars.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we smoke a brand that is synonymous with Halloween in Tatuaje but we light up the TAA 51th (no, that’s not our typo) from the Prime Care Package as we look at the history of the Tatuaje Monster Series.</p>\n<p>We will have this all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n",
