Her research documents a decline in media bias against women running for House seats. Despite that, Congress is still overwhelmingly male. Lawless authored a book with Danny Hayes called Women on the Run: Gender, Media, and Political Campaigns in a Polarized Era. \nFor the Spiel, Bob Dylan didn’t need a Nobel Prize to confirm his status as a great writer. Panoply Survey: \nWe want you to tell us about the podcasts you enjoy and how often you listen to them.
