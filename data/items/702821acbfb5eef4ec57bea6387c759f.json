  "description": "<p>Hello dear legends, and welcome back! And I&rsquo;m saying that to myself, as we are returning from a slight hiatus. Gotta get back out on the road! Vaxxed up, of course. This week&rsquo;s guest is an all around top-tier gentleman named Tanael Joachim. He&rsquo;s a comedian from Haiti now living here in NYC and is one of the true up-and-comers in the city and soon the country and then the world. He released his first hour special called <em>January 3rd </em>this year on Amazon. It&rsquo;s great! We have a conversation about the old adage that women are crazy, men are stupid, and every other gender should find different role models. Here are five words to describe this episode: your ass can save you.&nbsp;</p>",
