  "description": "Heads-up: I don’t have a guest this week — he needed to reschedule at the last minute. But don’t worry, I still have an exciting show for you today. I kick things off with a rant about COVID-19. Then, Daniel and I discuss the pent-up demand across the board as economies open back up and individuals are flush with stimulus cash.
