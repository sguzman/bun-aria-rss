  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, privacy rights aren't under attack, the Constitution is. This Supreme Court decision basically clarifies that what the U.S had done for 50 years was illegitimate and the court has decided to correct it. This gives power back to the people and legislatures in each state; abortion remains legal in most states. The modern argument for private property rights stems from a Planned Parenthood lawsuit in 1961. Their lawsuit was dismissed; however the dissenting opinion was the theoretical cornerstone for such right to privacy cases. Then, Joy Reid helps to spark hate when she and her demagogue guest’s spew half-truths. Reid suggests that women are required to ask their husbands before getting an abortion on their body ignoring that it took two people to make the baby (which isn't solely hers). Later, every single candidate that Trump endorsed in Ohio won. This is a big deal! Trump's economic and foreign policies propelled America forward. Trump's endorsement carried JD Vance through the finish line, but JD Vance is no Donald Trump. Afterward, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin joins the show to discuss her campaign for Congress in Alaska. Palin added that Alaska's energy-rich resources can help America lead in energy production and Biden's reluctance to do so must stop. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
