  "description": "How does a regular person with fears and doubts go from abject failure to breaking world records? Colin O’Brady suffered a critical injury so bad that a doctor told him he would probably never walk properly again. So, he climbed Mount Everest. And he became the first person to do what was thought impossible--cross Antarctica alone and unaided. On this week’s episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, watch as Colin O’Brady explains how he deals with fears, doubts, and competitiveness, and how he uses objectivity about it all to his advantage.
