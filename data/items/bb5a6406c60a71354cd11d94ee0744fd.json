  "description": "<p>You can't have your cake and eat it too.  But you can knock it over.  For the first time ever we're tackling The Great British Baking Show (aka the Great British Bake Off aka GBBO on the other side of the pond), and we're kicking off \"Collection 8\" on Netflix today with Cake Week!  The contestants must make Battenbergs, miniature upside-down pineapple cakes, and finally, sponges wrapped in fondant and shaped to be celebrities.  It's a disaster.  But a thoroughly polite one.</p>\n<p>Don't just listen to us, watch us too!
