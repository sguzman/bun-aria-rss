  "description": "“If you don’t see representation of someone who looks like you, it’s difficult to see yourself in that position,” said Emma Walker, the master blender responsible for Jane Walker by Johnnie Walker and a panelist at the Craftswomen event hosted by the spirits powerhouse Diageo earlier this year to celebrate the makers behind some of the world’s best spirits. We’re bringing you the panel, recorded live at the High Line Hotel in NYC earlier this year, as a special episode of Radio Cherry Bombe. The other spirits superstars you’ll hear from: Eboni Major, a whiskey blender and food scientist at Bulleit Frontier Whiskey; United States Bartenders Guild 2019 Bartender of the year Katie Renshaw; and Lynnette Marrero, co-founder of the Speed Rack bartending competition and a MasterClass instructor. Don’t miss this conversation about community, collaboration, and visibility.\n\nThank you to Jane Walker by Johnnie Walker for supporting our show.\n\nAnd find out why Bombesquad member Meaghan Dorman, bar director for Dear Irving and Raines Law Room in NYC, thinks Kellie Thorn, beverage director of Hugh Acheson Restaurants in Atlanta, is the Bombe!",
