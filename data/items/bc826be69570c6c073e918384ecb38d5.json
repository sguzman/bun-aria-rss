He also discusses Biophilia Records, a label he started as a way to gather like-minded musicians. His latest album, This Land Abounds With Life, was released as a “Biopholio,” which is Fabian’s green alternative to traditional physical media. \nAfter the interview, Isaac and co-host Karen Han talk about Fabian’s approach to inspiration and their own relationships to classical music. \nIn the exclusive Slate Plus segment, Isaac asks Fabian about his experience working with composer and Spike Lee collaborator Terence Blanchard. \nSend your questions about creativity and any other feedback to working@slate.com or give us a call at (304) 933-9675.\nPodcast production by Cameron Drews.\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
