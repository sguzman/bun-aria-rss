And we hear updates from some of the first season’s callers, including one caring for a special needs sibling, a big breakup that ended well, and an ex-codependent on his own Eat Pray Love journey.  </p><p><em>*</em></p><p><em>*</em></p><p><em>*</em></p><p><em>*</em></p><p><em>*</em></p><p><em>The views and opinions expressed are solely those of the Podcast author, or individuals participating in the Podcast, and do not represent the opinions of iHeartMedia or its employees.  This Podcast should not be used as medical advice, mental health advice, mental health counseling or therapy, or as imparting any health care recommendations at all.  Individuals are advised to seek independent medical, counseling advice and/or therapy from a competent health care professional with respect to any medical condition, mental health issues, health inquiry or matter, including matters discussed on this Podcast.
