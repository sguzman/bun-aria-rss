  "description": "<p>In March 2021, the Ever Given cargo ship got stuck in the Suez Canal and opened the world's eyes to the vulnerability of a system we rely on each and every day. In this episode we meet Jan Unander, a Swedish importer who had goods aboard the Ever Given and almost lost his business because of the delays. Jake Slinn, the owner of JS Global Cargo and Freight Disposal, takes us to the Port of Felixstowe to illuminate how much cargo went to waste as a result of the Ever Given stoppage, and the traffic jam of ships stuck behind it. Finally, we meet Port Chaplain Julian Wong, who visited the Ever Given when it docked in Felixstowe and deeply understands the stressful lives of the people who work on cargo ships.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>Disclaimers:</em></p><p><em>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
