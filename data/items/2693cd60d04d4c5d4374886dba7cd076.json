  "description": "<p><strong>Apologies are key to successful relationships. But are you doing them right?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>We all have moments when we say or do something we later regret. Then the time comes to make an apology. But a halfhearted “I’m sorry” rarely gets the job done. On this episode of The Science of Happiness, public defender Sam Dugan joins us for a second time to try science-backed tips for making an effective apology. First, she takes a moment to cultivate mindfulness through a mindful breathing practice. Next, Sam invites us in as she apologizes to her husband Nate. Sam reflects on how she took out her stress on Nate, what led her to lash out, and the importance of making a true, heartfelt apology — as opposed to the mindless ones many of us make on a near-daily basis. Then we hear from Sana Rizvi, a professor at the University of New Brunswick, about the science of how mindfulness can make us more apologetic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practice:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mindful Breathing</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Invite your body to relax into a comfortable position.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tune into the rhythm of your breath, and pay attention as you breathe in through your nose, hold your breath, and exhale through your mouth.</p></li>\n<li><p>Repeat as many times as you’d like.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Making an Effective Apology</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Acknowledge the offense by showing that you recognize who was responsible, who was harmed, and the nature of the offense.</p></li>\n<li><p>If helpful, provide an explanation, especially to convey that it was not intentional and that it will not happen again.</p></li>\n<li><p>Express remorse.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make amends.
