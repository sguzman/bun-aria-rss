  "description": "<p>In this 126th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p> </p><p>This week, we discuss science, Covid, vaccines, sunlight, and sophistry. New research suggests that adenovirus-vectored vaccines (e.g. J&J, AstraZeneca) reduce all-cause mortality, but that mRNA vaccines (e.g. Pfizer, Moderna) do not. What are the implications of this? What kinds of vaccines are recommended and effective, and how can someone not trained in thinking about these things know? We also discuss the role of vitamin D in Covid outcomes, as well as NIR (Near Infrared Radiation), which we primarily get from being outside. Since before the Industrial Revolution, our exposure to NIR has declined dramatically—we spend less time outdoors, and now even our lightbulbs and the glass in our windows limits how much NIR we receive, but it turns out that we need it. What else do we need that we don’t yet know about? Finally, we discuss the place for sophistry: in the classroom, where students can learn how to respond, so as to be better thinkers and citizens of the world.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p> </p><p>Seed: Start a new healthy habit today with Seed probiotics.
