  "description": "When you think of Coors, you are probably like me and you get the image of the silver bullet and the cold blue mountains on the side of the can. Or perhaps you know Molson-Coors as one of the top beverage brands in the world. But you most certainly didn't think of Coors as a whiskey company, until now. David Coors joins the show to talk about the family business and going from a just beer company into a full beverage enterprise. David has a deep connection with whiskey that spans back to his childhood and he is spearheading the next phase of company expansion by releasing their first ever collaboration whiskey, along with Bardstown Bourbon Co, called Five Trail. Listen to David's story and how Coors is learning what it's like to get into the whiskey business.\n\nShow Notes:\n\nAbove the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about answering questions on industry news vs people's thoughts\n\nTalk about your involvement with the family business and when you got into it\n\nHow has Molson-Coors grown over the recent decade?\n\nAt what point did you realize your name carries weight?\n\nWhen did Coors diversify away from Banquet into other beers?\n\nWhy did your dad try to kill Blue Moon?\n\nWhat internships did you have at the brewery?\n\nWhat made Coors Banquet go to the stubby bottle?\n\nWas Cobra Kai a paid placement or organic?\n\nWhat lessons is failed marketing that you can apply to today?\n\nDid you have a hand in the seltzer craze hit?\n\nSo what made you want to dive into whiskey?\n\nDid you have to sell your dad on venturing into whiskey?\n\nHow did you figure out what kind of whiskey to do?\n\nCan you scale and sustain the malt part of the blend?\n\nHow did you come to your proof point?\n\nWhat are those hard lessons you've learned by entering the whiskey business?\n\nCan your R&D team figure out how to make the barrel hoops blue when it's ready?\n\nDo you yourselves going even further into the whiskey category?\n\nWhat trends in the beverage alcohol space do you see happening?\n\nWhat is your cannabis strategy?\n\n@fivetrail @molsoncoors\n\nSupport this podcast on Patreon",
