  "description": "<p>For centuries Americans have valued their liberty, but a growing number of conservatives are now saying cherished values like the freedom of speech, religion, and the press have allowed progressive beliefs to destroy the culture. In response, some Republicans and conservative Christian thinkers argue it’s time to abandon these failed American ideals and copy the fascist, illiberal strategies of leaders like Hungary’s Victor Orban to stop immigration, fight wokism, and to ensure the government supports Christian beliefs.</p> <p>Then, a new article about the separation of families at the Southern border brings Phil to tears, and he pleads with evangelicals to not allow Trump near the presidency again. Skye interviews Dr. Richard Mouw about his new book, “How to Be a Patriotic Christian: Love of Country as Love of Neighbor.” They discuss godly versus idolatrous forms of patriotism, what the Bible says about the proper role of government, and debate whether churches should display flags and sing patriotic hymns. </p> <p>Bonus Patreon news story - <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.patreon.com/posts/70304989\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.patreon.com/posts/70304989\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.patreon.com/posts/70304989</a></p> <p><strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\">News Segment</strong><br /> 0:00 - Intro<br /> 3:38 - \"How the American Right Fell in Love with Hungary\"<br /> 39:22 - Trump administration's family separation policy</p> <p>54:24 - With God Daily<br /> <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://withgoddaily.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://withgoddaily.com/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://withgoddaily.com/</a></p> <p><strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Interview with Richard Mouw</strong><br /> \"How to Be a Patriotic Christian: Love of Country as Love of Neighbor\" - <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3QdVR9E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://amzn.to/3QdVR9E\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://amzn.to/3QdVR9E</a></p> <p>55:48 - Interview intro<br /> 57:10 - Talking with evangelicals about patriotism<br /> 59:27 - Defining Christian nationalism<br /> 01:01:07 - Healthy patriotism and familial language<br /> 1:04:26 - Romans 13 and governmental authority<br /> 1:17:49 - Patriotic symbols in worship services<br /> 1:30:59 - Credits</p> <p>Other articles/resources mentioned:\"How the American Right Fell in Love with Hungary\" (The NYT Magazine)-<a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/magazine/viktor-orban-rod-dreher.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/magazine/viktor-orban-rod-dreher.html\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/magazine/viktor-orban-rod-dreher.html</a>\"</p> <p>The Secret History of Family Separation\" (The Atlantic) - <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/09/trump-administration-family-separation-policy-immigration/670604/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/09/trump-administration-family-separation-policy-immigration/670604/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/09/trump-administration-family-separation-policy-immigration/670604/</a></p> <p>Holy Post website: <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.holypost.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.holypost.com/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.holypost.com/</a><br /> Holy Post Patreon: <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.patreon.com/holypost\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.patreon.com/holypost\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.patreon.com/holypost</a></p> <p><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">The Holy Post is supported by our listeners.
