  "itunes:summary": "English singer and guitarist Richard Dawson is a skewed troubadour at once charming and abrasive. His shambolically virtuosic guitar playing stumbles from music-hall tune-smithery to spidery swatches of noise-colour, swathed in amp static and teetering on the edge of feedback. His songs are both chucklesome and tragic, rooted in a febrile imagination that references worlds held dear and worlds unknown.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/ritual-community-music\n\nRitual Community Music\n27 September, 2015\nThe Tote, Collingwood\nPresented by Liquid Architecture\n\nAudio: Mara Schwerdtfeger\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
