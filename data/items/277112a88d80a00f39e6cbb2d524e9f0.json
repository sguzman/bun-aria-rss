    "media:description": "In this video, we explore the \"pattern\" to prime numbers. I go over the Euler product formula, the prime number theorem and the connection between the Riemann zeta function and primes.\n\nHere's a video on a similar topic by Numberphile if you're interested: https://youtu.be/uvMGZb0Suyc\n\nThere are a few mistakes in this video, so I clarified them in a pinned comment. Sorry about that!\n\nThis video adapted several concepts and ideas from this article: https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/the-riemann-hypothesis-explained-fa01c1f75d3f\n\nMore sources: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_lFWtsuPfWNq0VFAiqknsSeAOa-Oy2MDrmH6d-EOiBg/edit?usp=sharing\n\nRiemann Hypothesis by 3b1b: https://youtu.be/sD0NjbwqlYw\n\nComplex Exponents by 3b1b: https://youtu.be/v0YEaeIClKY\n\nHarmonic Series Divergence: https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/lg5/harmonic.pdf\n\nP-Series Convergence: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-series-new/bc-10-5/a/proof-of-p-series-convergence-criteria\n\nThis video was animated using manim: https://github.com/3b1b/manim\nSource code for the animations: https://github.com/vivek3141/videos\n\nFollow Me!\nhttps://instagram.com/vcubingx\nhttps://github.com/vivek3141\nhttps://twitter.com/vcubingx\n\nMusic by ChillHop\n\n#primes #zeta #math",
