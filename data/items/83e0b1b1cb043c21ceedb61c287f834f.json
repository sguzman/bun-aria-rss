  "description": "<p>In this 88th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>In this episode, we discuss a recent loss, and its interface with the on-line environment, before moving into the meat (and veg) of the episode: food! Beginning with an excerpt from chapter 5 of A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century—Food—we discuss the role of food in the lives of both modern and ancient humans. We discuss research that finds that the health and longevity of mid-Victorian era Britons was equal to or better than our own; and other research that addresses how not just food, but our microbiomes, are affected by the environments in which we live. We discuss the efffects of sterilizing our environments during Covid, and finally, how co-morbidities (“underlying conditions”) predict outcomes in Covid patients who are hospitalized.<br/><br/>Get your Goliath shirts right here: store.darkhorsepodcast.org<br/><br/>Support the sponsors of this show:<br/><br/>AllForm: Get 20% off any order (of a beautiful sofa) from Allform at https://allform.com/darkhorse.<br/><br/>ExpressVPN: VPNs keep you and your information safe.
