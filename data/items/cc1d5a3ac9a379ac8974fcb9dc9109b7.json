  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, President Trump makes live remarks on the Coronavirus in the United States. It must be understood that Trump’s words won’t be enough for the Democrats and the media. Democrats know Trump had a plan early on to address the coronavirus, they know he appointed a blue ribbon group to address it, but they want to use this opportunity to attack him. When democrats in congress was focused on a Trump coup, how much time did they spend on coronavirus hearings? How many press conferences were held by Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer warning us about the coronavirus? The congress has the authority to appropriate funds to address the coronavirus whether Trump likes it or not, but they haven’t.  Later, there was another victory for the President today as court ruled that the Trump administration can withhold funds to states with sanctuary cities. Finally, Martha MacCallum calls in to discuss her new book: Unknown Valor: A Story of Family, Courage, and Sacrifice from Pearl Harbor to Iwo Jima.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
