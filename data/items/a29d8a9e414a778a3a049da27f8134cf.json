  "description": "<p>In this 109th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>This week, we talk about many things Covid. Obesity is a well-established comorbidity for Covid, but the mainstream media often insists that stigma, rather than actual physiological reality, is what puts fat people at risk. Why do public health injunctions so rarely offer anything that individuals can actually do for themselves? Children are at very low risk from bad outcomes from Covid. What are we stealing from them that we have no right to steal—with masks, physical distancing, and other interventions? How can we go on an “ethical offense” against mandates and other top-down measures? And finally: observations from the ground in Australia. Also: research-based consumer reviews, and the many languages into which our book is being translated!<br/><br/>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is available from https://darvillsbookstore.indielite.org, (and everywhere books are sold), but they have sold out of signed copies.<br/><br/>Check out our store!
