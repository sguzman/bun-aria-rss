  "description": "<p>What does it mean to live a creative life? What does it take to achieve your dreams? And is that any different if you write for a living rather than making visual art? This week, Louise is joined by writer Jonathan Hall, whose first novel was recently published to critical and commercial acclaim. But this success was 59 years in the making and Jonathan has experienced his fair share of setbacks along the way. In this episode, we look at the importance of self-belief and the necessity of an unswerving commitment to our creative practice. Our discussion uncovers numerous similarities between the life of a writer and that of a painter, including the fear of a blank page or canvas; the impact of rejection; the need to \"paint over\" things you really like; and the importance of finding your own unique voice. It's refreshing to approach the topic of creativity from a different perspective and we know you'll enjoy Jonathan's wisdom and humour.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Jonathan's novel \"A Spoonful of Murder\" &nbsp;<a href=\"\">https://www.bookdepository.com/Spoonful-Murder-J-M-Hall/9780008509613</a></p>\n<p>Jonathan's BBC series \"Trust\"<a href=\"\"> https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000mb2k</a></p>\n<p>Jonathan's Instagram account <a href=\"\">https://www.instagram.com/jm_hall_writer/</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
