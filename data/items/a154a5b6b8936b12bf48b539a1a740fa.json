  "description": "“Neurodivergent” is an important term in the modern study of the human brain, referring to those whose minds function differently from what we would consider “normal”—people diagnosed with ADHD or autism might be considered neurodivergent, for example. But, just as the term is important, it, and what it represents, is also somewhat controversial. Today on the show, a civil debate between Devon Price and Freddie DeBoer, two experts in this field, about the social and medical approaches to neurodiversity. Also, is forgiving student debt fair? Depends on who you ask.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist\nLearn more about your ad choices.
