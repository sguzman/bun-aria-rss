  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear about how the Carbank cyber gang is getting trickier and more ambitious. In other cybercrime news, ransomware takes off after more databases. There's a new ransomware-as-a-service offering in the black market. Emily Wilson from Terbium Labs addresses perceptions of terrorists on the dark web. Simone Petrella from CyberVista provides her perspective on cyber security workforce issues. A new strain of Android ransomware hits Russian-speaking users. Locky's back, but in a feeble sort of way. Cybercriminals lock files at a cancer service not-for-profit. Russian policy wonks seem to suggest that we're not at the point in history where 2016 yielded to 2017. Instead—calling all Cold Warriors—1948 just ticked over into 1949.",
