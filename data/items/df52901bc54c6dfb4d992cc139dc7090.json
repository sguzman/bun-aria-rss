  "description": "We couldn't ignore an email that arrived asking our thoughts on why so many pastors commit affairs.  It seems odd that commonly when a pastor needs to step down, their is this immediate subconscious wonder; is there sexual scandal involved? This is not always the case, but is also not so rare.  We take some time to unload a couple ideas on how and why this might be commonplace.\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nInvest in and support the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Twitter www.twitter.com/thevoxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nLike Mike on Facebook www.facebook.com/officialmikeerre\n\nMike Erre participates as VOX Team Leader at VOX Community, a church expression of the VOX Podcast.
