  "description": "A former hedge fund manager says that Bitcoin could be worth well into the millions of dollars by the year 2031.\n\nAccording to Robert Breedlove, the deterioration of the US dollar (USD) will be the key factor in the king crypto (BTC) price explosion.\n\n“I have a public prediction that the US dollar is basically hyperinflated to zero, or close to it, by the year 2035…\n\nI’m going to stand by that prediction today. I know the DXY [US dollar index] is way up recently but I sort of expect this thing to get volatile before it breaks down. If that is the case, then I have a matching Bitcoin price prediction of $12.5 million US per Bitcoin by the year 2031.”\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
