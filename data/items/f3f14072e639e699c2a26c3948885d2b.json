  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat talks a little more about the massive fine that Zito is responsible for, and The Pub makes a PSA for all it’s members asking for help paying the fine (shirts available at <a href=\"http://store.patmcafeeshow.com/\">store.PatMcAfeeShow.com</a> with promo code “FreeZito”.) Pat and the guys also cover the whole MyBookie situation, and discuss Magic Johnson stepping down as President of Basketball Operations for the Lakers, and why he chose to do so on the same night that Dirk Nowitzki and Dwyane Wade retired. Pat also makes a big announcement regarding his upcoming golf outing, and answers a couple questions from Instagram for another edition of #ChatWithPat. Also joining the show is friend of the program, co-host of That’s Hockey Talk, and starting center for the Arizona Cardinals, AQ Shipley. They dive deep into the NHL playoffs and what AQ thinks about being in the podcast game. He also discusses what he expects from the Arizona Cardinals this year and how Kliff Kingsbury has been in the locker room so far, what it’s like being a dad, whether or not NFL players have the responsibility of getting their eventual replacements ready to play, and what he’s been doing to keep himself busy while waiting for the NFL season to start (1:00:06-1:39:07). Today is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
