  "description": "<p>In this 99th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>In this episode we discuss whether understanding science destroys our sense of awe. We ask how gazing out across the ocean, or into a vast and dark night sky, affect our sense of our own humanity, and what Roger Scruton had to say on the subject, in “Effing the Ineffable.” We follow this with discussions of necessity and sufficiency in scientific investigation; the fact that Tylenol is dangerous for pregnant women and children; why talking about pregnant people rather than women is disrespectful and suggestive of an anti-scientific worldview; Molnupiravir and its effects; and parenting in the modern era. Finally, we discuss the success and fate of our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, which is a best-seller despite being widely unavailable.<br/><br/>Get your Goliath shirts right here: store.darkhorsepodcast.org<br/><br/>Heather’s newsletter, Natural Selections (subscribe to get free weekly essays in your inbox): https://naturalselections.substack.com<br/><br/>Support the sponsors of this show:<br/><br/>Allform: Get 20% off any order (of a beautiful sofa) from Allform at https://allform.com/darkhorse.<br/><br/>Public Goods: Get $15 off your first order at Public Goods, your new everything store, at https://www.publicgoods.com/darkhorse or with code DARKHORSE at checkout.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is now available for at amazon. https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593086880/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_5BDTABYFKRJKZBT5GSQA<br/><br/>Heather’s newsletter, Natural Selections (subscribe to get free weekly essays in your inbox): https://naturalselections.substack.com<br/><br/>Find more from us on Bret’s website (https://bretweinstein.net) or Heather’s website (http://heatherheying.com).<br/><br/>Become a member of the DarkHorse LiveStreams, and get access to an additional Q&A livestream every month.
