  "description": "An actress brags that killing her child enabled her to have a career. But the fact that she traded in her child and her soul for a career on the D-list only shows how foolish and tragic the pro-abortion mentality is. Also, five headlines including the supposedly controversial execution of a man convicted of killing three police officers even though he didn't pull the trigger. And today I cancel MSNBC for what is perhaps the stupidest segment ever to be aired on cable news.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
