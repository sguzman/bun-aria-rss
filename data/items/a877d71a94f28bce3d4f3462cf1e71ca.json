  "description": "<p>Acquired teams up with the My First Million podcast for a “best of both worlds” crossover episode. First we go deep, “Acquired style”, on the wild story of MFM host Shaan Puri’s bought, sold, and then bought-again OG social networking site Bebo, and then we turn the tables and brainstorm startup ideas and investing themes “MFM style”. This episode was frankly a blast to do. We hope you have as much fun listening as we did recording!<br /> <br /></p> <p><strong>Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li>My First Million‘s website: <a href= \"https://thehustle.co/my-first-million-podcast/\">https://thehustle.co/my-first-million-podcast/</a></li> </ul>",
