  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, after two years Americans can now fly without wearing a mask. No more getting arrested or thrown off airplanes because your 3-year-old won't keep their mask on. Yet our federal government resisted letting go of this power until a judge struck it down. Now the judge is under attack for siding with the rule of law ruling that the CDC lacked the statutory authority to enact such a mandate. Then, the same Administration that is still holding January 6th prisoners, and used the DOJ against concerned parents, and attacks capitalism through the degrowth climate change movement is now enacting a self-imposed ban on defending ourselves against satellite weapons in space. Trump brilliantly launched the US Space Force to protect the country from China's and Russia's advancements with satellite warfare. Later, today is the 79th anniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprising. Both the Polish and the Ukrainians are honoring the event as they keep the Donbas in mind. Meanwhile the left continues their quest for critical racist and gender theory. Afterward, US Senate Candidate Dr. Oz joins the show to address President Biden's hampering of the U.S energy industry. Oz added that crime in Philadelphia is rampant because of Soros-funded D.A.'s lack of enforcement. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
