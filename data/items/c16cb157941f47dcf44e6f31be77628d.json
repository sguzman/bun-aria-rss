Burton argues that while younger generations are supposedly the most secular according to surveys, they’re actually notably religious—it’s just that they have adopted strange new religions. She claims today's Americans are embracing a kaleidoscopic panoply of spiritual traditions, rituals, and subcultures, from astrology and witchcraft to SoulCycle and the alt-right. In search of the deep and the real, they are finding meaning, purpose, ritual, and communities in ever-newer, ever-stranger ways.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>A listener asks, if religious faith is based on our response to the revealing God, how do we reconcile this with the plurality of religions?</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:separator --></p> <hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> <p><!-- /wp:separator --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do you like this podcast? <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/bishopbarron\">Become a patron</a> and get some great perks for helping, like free books, bonus content, and more.
