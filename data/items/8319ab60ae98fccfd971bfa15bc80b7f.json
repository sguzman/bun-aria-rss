  "description": "<p>We study the charmonium dissociation in the hot medium with finite baryon\nchemical potential $\\mu_B$. Charmonium bound states are dissociated in the\nmedium by the color screening effect and the random scatterings with thermal\npartons, which are included in the real and imaginary parts of the potential\nrespectively. $J/\\psi$ fraction in the $c\\bar c$ pair defined to be the quantum\noverlap between the wave package and the wave function of $J/\\psi$ eigenstate\ndecreases with time due to the complex potentials. When $\\mu_B$ is large\ncompared with the medium temperature, the Deybe mass is increased evidently. We\nconsider $\\mu_B$-dependent Deybe mass in both real and imaginary parts of the\npotential to calculate the $J/\\psi$ survival probability in the static medium\nand the Bjorken medium. $J/\\psi$ survival probability is reduced evidently by\nthe $\\mu_B$ effect at low temperatures available in the medium produced in Beam\nEnergy Scan experiments, while this effect becomes not apparent at high\ntemperatures.\n</p>",
