  "description": "<p>Empowered by large datasets, e.g., ImageNet, unsupervised learning on\nlarge-scale data has enabled significant advances for classification tasks.\nHowever, whether the large-scale unsupervised semantic segmentation can be\nachieved remains unknown. There are two major challenges: i) we need a\nlarge-scale benchmark for assessing algorithms; ii) we need to develop methods\nto simultaneously learn category and shape representation in an unsupervised\nmanner. In this work, we propose a new problem of large-scale unsupervised\nsemantic segmentation (LUSS) with a newly created benchmark dataset to help the\nresearch progress. Building on the ImageNet dataset, we propose the ImageNet-S\ndataset with 1.2 million training images and 50k high-quality semantic\nsegmentation annotations for evaluation. Our benchmark has a high data\ndiversity and a clear task objective. We also present a simple yet effective\nmethod that works surprisingly well for LUSS. In addition, we benchmark related\nun/weakly/fully supervised methods accordingly, identifying the challenges and\npossible directions of LUSS. The benchmark and source code is publicly\navailable at https://github.com/LUSSeg.\n</p>",
