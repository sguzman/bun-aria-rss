Millennials afraid of coronavirus, first generation of Americans who prefer to cower in fear, do nothing, be victims. COVID-19 is biggest cop-out ever for people who don't want to live their lives. Survey shows Millennials think their risk of death from COVID-19 is much higher than it really is. Florida hospitals admit mistakes, coronavirus numbers inflated. NYT editor resigns after bullying by colleagues. America didn't shut down during Spanish Flu, President Wilson never mentioned it, the country just dealt with it. Trump should make his campaign about the inspirational uplifting truth about who Americans are, who we have the responsibility to be. If you're unable to escape the prison of fear, you will never get close to maximize your potential. Millennials risked the virus to protest, because they listen to whatever the media tells them. If we can't reach Millennials then we must ignore them.</p><p><br></p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p><br></p><p>Blue state governors shutting down again. Victor Davis Hanson column on the Jacobins.
