  "title": "Mom & Dad: Sidelined By Negative Self-Talk",
  "description": "On this episode: Jamilah, Zak, and Elizabeth answer a question about a little boy who was super excited to start team sports. However, he has been really hard on himself and has slipped into some negative self-talk, including saying that he’s “the worst” and “will never get better.” They have some advice for making sure the kid enjoys his season, if he wants to continue. \nRecommendations: \nZak recommends Everything Naomi Loved by Katie Yamasaki and Ian Lendler. \nElizabeth recommends How To Keep House While Drowning by KC Davis. \nJamilah recommends Honk For Jesus. Save Your Soul. \nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
