  "description": "<p>Download my new and improved brain detox app here: https://neurocycle.app</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>SHOW DESCRIPTION: In this podcast I talk about managing intrusive thoughts. This podcast is part 6 of my series on the different parts of the mind and brain. <strong>Intrusive thinking</strong> is can be defined as uncontrollable, unwanted thoughts that we <em>feel unable</em> to resist. This kind of thinking is often a way of coping with an underlying, unresolved issue. It’s not always the most effective or sustainable way to deal with pain or trauma, but it’s a coping mechanism—a type of distraction you use to try to keep the source of your pain bearable, at least in the short term.</p>\n<p>Sign up to Patreon to get access to full AD-FREE epsiodes, exclusive downloads, live Q&As, and more: https://www.patreon.com/drcarolineleaf</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>OFFERS FROM OUR SPONSORS:</p>\n<p>-<strong>Athletic Greens: All you have to do is visit </strong><a href=\"https://athleticgreens.com/partner/d35ctoffer-nutrition/en?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=influencer&utm_campaign=drleaf_d35ct__a1248__o27&utm_term=cac__a1248__o27&utm_content=medical__a1248__o27\"><u><strong>athleticgreens.com/leaf</strong></u></a><strong> to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Chime: See for yourself why Chime is so loved at</strong> <a href=\"http://chime.com/drleaf\"><u><strong>chime.com/drleaf</strong></u></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Butcher Box: For a limited time, ButcherBox is offering my listeners Free New York strips and lobster, PLUS $10 off your first box.
