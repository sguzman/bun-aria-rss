    "media:description": "In Super Mario Bros. 3, after defeating a Koopa Kid, a wand is dropped that you need to pick up. This wand falls from above, so one would think that it's faster to jump early so you pick it up earlier. It's actually faster to not jump at all, and wait for the wand to drop to you on the ground. I remade this video to add a voiceover, and changed the video to fit the Shorts format.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SeedyZ_\n\n#supermario #speedrun",
