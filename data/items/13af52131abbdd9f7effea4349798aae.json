A&nbsp;lifeline for the desperate many that struggle in silence, I do this to underscore that there is always hope, no matter how far down you find yourself.</p><p>But what if you’re not an alcoholic? What if you, like millions of people, occasionally drink just a little too much? Even though it doesn't destroy your life, it leaves you feeling off. You're tired of the hangovers, the lethargy and the low grade depression it provokes. You'd prefer to stop. But because drinking is&nbsp;integral to your social or professional life, opting out seems impossible.&nbsp;What then?</p><p>This week's guest faced this very predicament, a relatable scenario for a vast number of people. The only difference? Andy Ramage&nbsp;decided to do something about it.</p><p>A former professional footballer (as they say in the UK), a career-ending injury prompted Andy to hang up the cleats and enter the world of finance. Channeling his work ethic, it didn't take long&nbsp;for him to become successful in the traditional sense, co-creating two&nbsp;multimillion-dollar city brokerages.</p><p>But doing well in banking ‘required' (or so he thought) drinking. Lots of drinking. Long Mad Men style booze-soaked client lunches. Countless happy hours, pub crawls, and cocktail soirées, followed by clubbing and the occasional after party.&nbsp;It's just what you gotta do to play the game.</p><p>Andy didn’t necessarily have a drinking ‘problem’. But the lifestyle left him drained. Listless. And&nbsp;looking for a change.</p><p>Bucking the unwritten rules of his professional environment, he decided to to take a break from alcohol and embarked instead on a quest for peak performance and well-being. It stuck. Not only did Andy feel markedly better, his work performance improved. His relationships became more meaningful. He fell back in love with the simple things that brought him joy as a young lad. Slowly, a new world of life opportunities began to emerge.</p><p>Transformed, Andy enthusiastically began sharing his experience, challenging friends and colleagues to quit the booze for 28, 90 or even 365-days.
