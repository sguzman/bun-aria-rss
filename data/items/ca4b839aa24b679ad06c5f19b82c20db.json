Although he's been making wine for most of his life in California, Oded is originally from Israel and has a global perspective on wine, winemaking, and wine business that's refreshing and fascinating.

We tap into some of that brain power when he discusses his philosophy on food and wine, and how it helps him makes wines of balance</li> <li>Since he is one of the few winemakers in California that does a full line of still wine and also makes a Methode Champenoise sparkling wine, he uses this unique experience to tell us the differences in mentality you need to make each type of wine (a very cool discussion). </li> <li>We chat about Syrah (Oded's is stunning!) and why it isn't as popular as it should be.</li> </ul> <p>All in all a fascinating conversation with a great winemaker, a guy with great perspective on the last 30 years in Sonoma, and an all around nice person!</p> <p>Go visit Longboard when you're in Healdsburg: <a href= \"https://www.longboardvineyards.com\">https://www.longboardvineyards.com </a></p> <p> </p>",
