It was a success when it came out, but in the 25 years since then, the influence of the album has only grown. <em>Complex</em> named it one of the 10 best rap albums of the 90s, and <em>Pitchfork</em> gave the album a rare perfect score, 10 out of 10. <em>The Washington Post</em> called it a “masterpiece” of hardcore rap, and in <em>Slate</em>, it was called one of the best albums of the ‘90s, and one of the best hip-hop albums ever made.</p>\n\n<p>Their biggest song from the album was “Shook Ones, Pt. II.” Havoc made the now-legendary beat that he and Prodigy rap over. To celebrate the 25th anniversary, Havoc told me the story of how the whole song came together. Prodigy passed away in 2017, from complications due to sickle-cell anemia, a debilitating disease he’d battled his entire life. But the legacy of Mobb Deep lives on.
