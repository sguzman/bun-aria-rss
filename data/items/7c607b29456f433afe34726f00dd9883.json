  "description": "<p>It is still largely unclear to what extent bettors update their prior\nassumptions about the strength and form of competing teams considering the\ndynamics during the match. This is of interest not only from the psychological\nperspective, but also as the pricing of live odds ideally should be driven both\nby the (objective) outcome probabilities and also the bettors' behaviour. Using\nstate-space models (SSMs) to account for the dynamically evolving latent\nsentiment of the betting market, we analyse a unique high-frequency data set on\nstakes placed during the match. We find that stakes in the live-betting market\nare driven both by perceived pre-game strength and by in-game strength, the\nlatter as measured by the Valuing Actions by Estimating Probabilities (VAEP)\napproach. Both effects vary over the course of the match.\n</p>",
