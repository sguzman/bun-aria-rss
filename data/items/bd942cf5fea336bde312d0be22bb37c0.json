  "description": "The Super Bowl awaits but amidst the conversation around the big game, there's plenty of quarterback drama around the league that doesn't involve Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes. On this episode, Will Brinson is joined by Brady Quinn to break down the futures of Aaron Rodgers (9:15), Matthew Stafford (23:00) and Deshaun Watson (34:15). Let's not rush to get Rodgers out of Green Bay. There are definitely lingering questions with the presence of 2020 1st-round pick Jordan Love, but the Packers probably aren't ready to hand over the team just yet. Brady also breaks down the timing of the Stafford split and how the organizational structure will play a role in his departure. And of course, we have to provide the latest updates with the Texans in the trade talks of the offseason that simply won't go away.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
