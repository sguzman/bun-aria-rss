That's what we're having a look into today. Cube World is one of those games that took the world by storm, yet struggled through an 8 year cycle that ended with a lot of annoyed customers.\n\nEdit: There's also a game called Veloren that is very similar to this. I'll keep an eye out for Veloren as it's free to play and seems to be made as a sign of hope for all the cube world fans. Veloren may just be the game that everyone wanted.\n\nRelevant links:\n- Cube World Alpha: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGY9OVcHNig&ab_channel=TimmyJTech \n- Cube World (steam): https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128000/Cube_World/\n- Cube World Better Progression Mod: https://www.nexusmods.com/cubeworld/mods/6",
