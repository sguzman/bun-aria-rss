  "description": "<p>On this unique episode of Battles & Banter, Avery goes solo on this one to complete a spur-of-the-moment episode on the 70th anniversary of the United States' first battle with North Korean troops during the Korean War: the Battle of Osan. On July 5th, 1950 an infantry battalion of the 21st U.S. Infantry Regiment and a howitzer battery of the 52nd U.S. Field Artillery Battalion took on nearly 5,000 North Korean troops & 34 tanks just outside the South Korean village of Osan, 25 miles south of Seoul. Avery discusses the groundwork that led to the conflict on the Korean Peninsula and eventually, Task Force Smith fighting for their lives outside of Osan. Since this is the first solo episode, we'll treat it like an experiment; if you like it, there will be more and if not...well that's not up to you! Enjoy!</p>",
