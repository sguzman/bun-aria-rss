  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">We go out on a limb this week, sharing a personal story on a  controversial topic. But after years of questions from moms and dads to be, it's finally time. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Rarely do women in the wine industry discuss their relationship to alcohol when they're pregnant and the decisions they make about drinking while nursing. But just because it's not discussed widely, doesn't mean it's not on people's minds. This one's for you, moms and dads. It's not advice (I'm no expert or doctor) nor is it meant to persuade you to do anything. It's just our story of what we did and the how and why behind it because someone needs to say it. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">So at the risk of everyone thinking I'm a terrible person, I admit that I did, in fact, drink in moderation during pregnancy. I talk about why I made the decision I did and what moderation actually meant to me (I actually tell you what I did in each trimester), M.C. Ice discusses his thoughts on it, and then we debate a bit. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Hope this helpful to some of you, and doesn't alienate others! </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"> </span></p>",
