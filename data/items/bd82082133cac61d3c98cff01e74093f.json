  "description": "Thank you for tuning into another episode of Tin Foil Hat With Sam Tripoli.  This episode we discuss the controversial QAnon.  Recently, a firestorm broke out when Alex Jones and Dr. Jerome Corsi stated that Q was not real.  However, the Praying Medic maintains his belief in QAnon, and since he was nice enough to come on the show and talk about Q, we have decided to release this episode.  So please enjoy and let us know what you think.",
