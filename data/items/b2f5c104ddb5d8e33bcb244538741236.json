  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Continuing our conversation about Bright Bananas on the Romance Tree — this week we’re reading an extreme oldie, Anne Stuart’s Tangled Lies, famous for being a story about a heroine falling for her brother…except he’s not really her brother! It’s a RIDE. We talk about just how odd romance could be back in the day, about how this book might be an ancestor to dark romance, and about how alpha alpha heroes could really get. And then we talk about modern contemporary romance and how things are changing in traditional publishing. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our next read along in some number of weeks (three? four?) is Kylie Scott’s <em>Lead</em>, one of our longtime favorites. Get it at Amazon, Apple Books, B&N, Kobo, or Bookshop.org! </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thank you, as always, for listening!

If you want this feeling without having relatives cool enough to leave them lying around, just order a big lot of random romances from eBay.
