  "description": "<p>Jalen Rose (NBA player, NY Times best-selling author, <i>NBA Countdown, Jalen & Jacoby, Get Up</i>) opens up about the brotherhood of the Fab 5, the impact of stress from playing professional basketball on his mental health, and his undying love for the city of Detroit. He describes his childhood growing up in the segregated city of Detroit during a drug epidemic, his partnership and close bond with his mom, and how his entrepreneurial spirit was influenced by never knowing his NBA star father, Jimmy Walker. Jalen details his rededication to the game and self-discipline after getting kicked out of school, why he started looking up to public figures with flaws, and the feelings of unworthiness he experienced as a member of the Fab 5. Mayim and Jalen bond over the similarities between being an athlete and performer, and Jalen educates Mayim and Jonathan with his Guide to Trash Talk. They discuss their admiration for Simone Biles & Naomi Osaka, the life skills and mental health coping mechanisms that can be learned from playing sports, and the United States’ history of valuing entertainment over education. After Jalen opens up about the role faith plays in his life especially after the failed assassination attempt on his life, Mayim considers the balance between science and religion in another installment of Ask Mayim Anything.</p><p>Jalen Rose Leadership Academy: <a href=\"www.JRLADetroit.com\">www.JRLADetroit.com</a></p><p>Jalen Rose Book: <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/233840/got-to-give-the-people-what-they-want-by-jalen-rose/\">https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/233840/got-to-give-the-people-what-they-want-by-jalen-rose/</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a><br /> </li></ul>\n",
