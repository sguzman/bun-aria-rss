  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, in the lead up the NCAA Women’s swimming championships, where a man named Lia Tomas is expected to dominate and break record, Sports Illustrated has run a fawning cover story hailing his courage and athletic prowess. I have a few thoughts to make, and also an announcement that you’re going to want to hear. Stick around for that. Also, the leftist meltdown at University of North Texas was even worse than we thought. More video and information has emerged. We’ll talk about it. Plus, some lawmakers in DC seem dead set on getting us involved in a world war. Some of them also desecrated an American flag to prove their loyalty to Ukraine. We’ll talk about that. And in some churches across the country, Ash Wednesday has been replaced with Glitter Ash Wednesday.
