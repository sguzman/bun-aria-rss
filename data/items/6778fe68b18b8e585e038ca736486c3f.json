  "description": "We are in the midst of an American cold war, where the forces of tyranny battle with forces of liberty using the legal system, public schools, the government, and the media to advance their agenda. The Constitution provides no authority to any President of the United States to unilaterally forgive any debt owed to the people without any legislation from congress. This move by Democrats to forgive student loan debt and appeal to their base will affect inflation just like any other spending bill. Jared Kushner discusses his new book \"Breaking History: A White House Memoir.\" Kushner walks us through what it was like inside the Trump White House during the chaotic siege of Mueller's Russia witch hunt. A President can classify and declassify at will and doesn’t need to follow any protocol - he is the executive branch. The question remains, was this FBI raid about January 6 and broader issues?  Did you ever think you would see the day when teachers in Virginia are trained to transition children's genders without parental approval? To figure out what’s going on we have to go back to Marx and Engels who argued that you had to destroy the family unit, and binary sex in order to establish a Marxist society. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
