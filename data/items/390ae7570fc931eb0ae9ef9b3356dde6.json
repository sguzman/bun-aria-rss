  "description": "The world is facing the greatest economic downturn of our time. In the US at least 15 million more people are unemployed than just a few months ago.

Phil Dobbie talks to Prof Steve Keen about what’s really driving share prices ever upwards.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
