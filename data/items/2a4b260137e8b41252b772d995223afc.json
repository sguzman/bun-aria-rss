  "description": "<p>Whoever left a vintage Barbie doll on the grave of a little girl raped and murdered in 1995 may have provided a key piece of evidence to solve the cold case: DNA. Utah investigators are asking for public help in identifying the person who placed the doll on the grave of Rosie Tapia, who was just six when she died. “Two possible persons of interest in the case have been identified who had some fixation with Barbies,” the Utah Cold Case Coalition said in a news release. “But before a costly analysis is performed on the DNA, the coalition is asking whether someone knows who placed the doll on Rosie’s grave.” She was abducted from the bedroom of her Salt Lake City home. Her remains were discovered “several hours later in a canal off the Jordan River.” Nancy Grace looks at the investigation with Cold Case Research Institute Director Sheryl McCollum, Atlanta criminal lawyer Darryl Cohen, psycho analyst Dr Bethany Marshall, and reporter John Lemley.</p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
