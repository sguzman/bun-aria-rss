  "description": "<p>This week, we're answering a listener question from Helen, who asked why we chose to represent ourselves rather than pursue the gallery route. Helen also asked: \"can a female artist be self-representing and still find her place in the history books - or is it important to have the testimonial from an established gallery?\" When thinking about galleries, we believe that it's important to know (a) where you want to go and (b) where you currently are. We also point out that the art world often catches up and \"discovers\" artists late in life (or after their death), and we debate whether galleries will continue to play an important role as we move forward. Of course, we also answer Helen's question and explain why we each decided not to market primarily through galleries. There's lots more in this conversation, so don't miss it!</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>\"Painting Abstract Landscapes\" by Gareth Edwards https://www.amazon.co.uk/Painting-Abstract-Landscapes-Gareth-Edwards/dp/1785009737/</p>\n<p>Soul Smile Event <a href=\"\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/613090909814919</a><br>\n<br>\nFind our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
