Plus, the White House unveils its National Gender Strategy, whatever the hell that’s supposed to mean. And in our Daily Cancellation, I once again find myself at the center of controversy and outrage, this time because I dared suggest that women should take their husband's last name. Shocking stuff. \nDaily Wire just signed ousted ESPN sportscaster Allison Williams who resisted Disney’s vaccine mandate for a new sports series.
