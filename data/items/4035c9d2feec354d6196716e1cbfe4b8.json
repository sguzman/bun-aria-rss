We look back at the event and what it means one year out from Tokyo 2020.

Reaching the World Cup semi final stage means that Team GB will now be able to field a women's team at the next Olympics.</p><br><p>And, the Commonwealth will gather again in 2022 in Birmingham. The budget for the next Commonwealth Games was released this week and we discuss the impact for the wider West Midland region. The re-development of the Alexander Stadium also means that the sport of athletics will be hosting their British Championships in Manchester between 2020 and 2022.  </p><br><p>Wimbledon is here again too.
