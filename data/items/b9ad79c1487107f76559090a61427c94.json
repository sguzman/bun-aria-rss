  "description": "<p>For the first deep dive of 2022, we&#8217;re going to space! OK, not really. But we&#8217;re talking about the most powerful space telescope ever. The James Webb Space Telescope cost $10 billion, a lot of tech went into developing it and we can&#8217;t stop obsessing over it. Neither can our guest.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I cannot contain my excitement. It&#8217;s been a wild roller coaster getting to this point. And to have this telescope now launched in space, it&#8217;s just so thrilling for astronomers everywhere,&#8221; said Caitlin Casey, professor of astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin, who will be leading the biggest project on the JWST.</p>\n<p>The telescope is expected to help researchers discover some of the most distant galaxies and study the atmosphere of planets outside our solar system to see if they&#8217;re habitable.</p>\n<p>On the show today: what the JWST tells us about the future of public and private investment in space exploration.</p>\n<p>Casey will also highlight the technological developments created by the JWST and its predecessor, Hubble, and how they&#8217;ve impacted industries from medical equipment to GPS technology.</p>\n<p>In the News Fix, some companies have stopped predicting when they&#8217;ll be back in the office. Plus, an in-depth investigation into the House and Senate members who enslaved Black people.
