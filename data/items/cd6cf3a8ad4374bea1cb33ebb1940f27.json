An embedded war correspondent covering everything from mass shootings and natural disasters to conflicts in Myanmar, Afghanistan and the Middle East, including six visits to war-torn Iraq, Dan's mental well-being began to suffer, his stress escalating with each overseas deployment. Depression, anxiety and PTSD ensued, followed by self-medicating with drugs like cocaine and ecstasy.&nbsp;Ultimately, these factors conspired to take a serious toll on Dan’s mental and physical health, culminating&nbsp;in a meltdown of epic proportions in 2004 when he suffered an on-air panic attack while delivering the news that was witnessed by 5 million people.</p><br><p>Although unsure as to the cause of his breakdown, it was a wake up call that led him to seek professional help.
