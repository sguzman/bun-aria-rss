  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, America has a spending problem. Mitch McConnell said we don’t lose votes by spending and this is unacceptable. We are sticking future generations with massive debt. The laws of economics are like the laws of physics — they don't change. Charles Reidell gets this right in his piece in National Review. Despite the Tea Party's 63 seat win in 2010 yet we still have an obsession with deficits and spending. President Obama's 2012 re-election slowed the Tea Party's momentum and spend-hearty Republicans returned to their old ways despite the spending cap bill. Today, just 15% of Republicans express any desire to spend less and we've seen this in the bloated budgets that they repeatedly send to President Trump. This is the most selfish generation in American history, and Thomas Jefferson warned us. This, combined with college for all, healthcare for all, and ever-increasing taxes on the highest income earners will only hurt America 50 years from now. Then, Democrats distract the electorate by picking at old scabs promising free everything, including reparations. Using race, gender, and income in the name of equality and compassion to divide the American people instead of uniting us around patriotism. The progressive left has no positive ideas for America, looking at their proposals it seems we have lost. Perhaps, if we had a legitimate press to serve as a check and balance we might hold the media accountable. This is why it's important to understand the teachings of Locke, Montesquieu, and the founders do that we can understand why we even have a press and what the purpose of hat press was intended to be. Lamentably our once patriotic press has evolved into a progressive press that's become the progeny of Marx and Hegel. Afterward, climate change progressives push for our economy to extract, which is why they promote degrowth all industries. the modern green movement is the old red movement as it seeks to destroy capitalism.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
