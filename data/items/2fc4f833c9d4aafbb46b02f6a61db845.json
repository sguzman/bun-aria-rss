  "description": "<p>As 2020 winds down, the Battles & Banter team dish out their final episodes of the year. Avery & Codie are joined by Patrick McGuire of the \"History Things Podcast\" and Rich Condon of \"Civil War Pittsburgh\" to talk about the climax of one of the most overlooked campaigns of the American Civil War: The Battle of Nashville. Part of the Franklin-Nashville Campaign of 1864, the fighting around the famous Tennessee city between December 15-16 signaled not only an end to the campaign, but the end of John Bell Hood's Confederate Army of Tennessee as an effective fighting force. It was perhaps the most devastating military defeat for the Confederacy during the entire Civil War, which is probably why it is one of the least preserved major Civil War battlefields in the country next to Franklin just a few miles away. The guys talk about the campaign and the lasting consequences of the Union victory that marked the beginning of the end for the Southern Confederacy. Enjoy!</p>",
