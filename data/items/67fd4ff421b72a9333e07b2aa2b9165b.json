Does nature require an intelligent designer? Śaṅkara (710 CE) and Vācaspati Miśra (960 CE), commenting on the <em>Brahma-sūtra</em> (ca. 200 CE) and <em>Nyāya-sūtra</em> (ca. 200 BCE), argue that it does against atheistic Buddhists, Sāṃkhya believers in a primordial matter that acts on its own, and the Mīmāṃsā conservatives who so venerated scripture that they ruled out a God who created it. But if we're all Brahman (God), just trying to discover that we are and so escape the cycle of rebirth, then where is there room for a particular deity who created us?</p> <p>Part two of this episode is only going to be available to you if you sign up at <a href=\"https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/support\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">partiallyexaminedlife.com/support</a>. <a href= \"https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/05/21/ep270-2-vedanta-nyaya-design-argument-citizen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get it now</a> or <a href= \"https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/05/24/preview-ep270-2-vedanta-nyaya-design-argument\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listen to a preview</a>.</p>",
