  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that the Lazarus Group is back, and now they're phishing in English. The Daily Stormer gets the boot, but companies and governments continue to struggle with developing appropriate responses to extremist content.

DJI drones get a peacemaking makeover. Justin Harvey from Accenture on prepping for destructive attacks. Jeff Schumann CEO of Wiretap on vulnerabilities in messaging technologies like Slack and Yammer. And one weird trick to recognizing that a call is a help desk scam.
