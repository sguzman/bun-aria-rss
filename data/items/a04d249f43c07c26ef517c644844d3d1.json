  "description": "<p>Well this started as a regular Listener Tale episode where we had a handful of great stories to tell you. What it turned into is an epic journey through one listener's truly harrowing experience in a very haunted home. Brad gets the spotlight today as he brings us through \"The happenings\" in an old house on a hill. There are deaths, demonic growls, entrapments, creatures hiding in the crawlspace and straight up teleportation (we think? Let us know, Pookie). ENJOY! This was a great tale and we are so thankful Brad shared it with all of us!</p><p> </p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
