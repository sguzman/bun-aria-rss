Kuso Douga.\n\nWe decided to make a Bonus Episode to keep you busy whilst you wait for our production team to stop crying and make Episode 5 ðŸ’œ\n\n(Remember this Anime is aimed at older audiences! So don't repeat what she says or we'll all be in trouble!)\n\nSupport us for more Animation \nâ–·https://tinyurl.com/eare9yzt\n\nHoodies & Goodies\nâ–·https://tinyurl.com/f27478tt\n\nOtachan\nâ–· https://twitter.com/ema_emaEX\n\nTwitter \nâ–· https://www.twitter.com/otakuvsâ€‹\n\nInstagram\nâ–· https://www.instagram.com/teamotakuvs/â€‹\n\nWelcome to our new series Otachan! Kuso Douga! We hope you enjoyed it! This won't be taking over the mainline Otachan! series and is more of a fun bit of world building we enjoyed doing whilst we worked on Episode 5! We hope this makes the wait a little less boring! Thank you for always being so patient and thank you so much for your support. \n\nWe're still working on Episode 5! Ganbatte!",
