  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down Fun Run. To kick off this two part episode we are joined by the hilarious, Kate Flannery. Kate shares her memories from this episode, her time on The Office, and gives us insight into what it was like to do most of her own stunts. Then, we answer fan questions about Pam's questionable internet search, the changes to her hair and wardrobe, and of course we chat about what is going on with Jim and Pam. Finally, Angela shares how she prepared for that emotional scene when her character learns about the death of Sprinkles, and Jenna tells us everything we need to know about rabies. We hope you love the unpredictable good times this podcast offers. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Support Philabundance here <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.philabundance.org_&d=DwMFaQ&c=aLv4kG3eFBuAUFgZFQ07JQ&r=tLr8qzvUqzBDOt-3tLBXNg&m=x2Tt0C68wJnX3M74F6bHMFvqcy4D5o5h-Uuj5x2geHY&s=us7e96oG3BPptE6gezOcIxAme5FzeqMqVMezWUtpgC4&e=\">https://www.philabundance.org/</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you have questions for upcoming Office Ladies episodes, go to <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__officeladies.com_&d=DwMFaQ&c=aLv4kG3eFBuAUFgZFQ07JQ&r=tLr8qzvUqzBDOt-3tLBXNg&m=x2Tt0C68wJnX3M74F6bHMFvqcy4D5o5h-Uuj5x2geHY&s=jcnQAsoploLKNjR0uasbq2_ASEtUNaW9BrIU2UPmXzo&e=\">officeladies.com</a>and file your questions there, or email <a href=\"mailto:officeladies@earwolf.com\">officeladies@earwolf.com</a> with the episode title in the subject line. </p>\n",
