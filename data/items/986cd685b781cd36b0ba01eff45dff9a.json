  "description": "We feature an episode from The Razor's Edge for this week's Marketplace Roundtable, featuring Marketplace author Akram's Razor as well as Seeking Alpha's Daniel Shvartsman.\nThe market has seemed to be on an up and to the right path, but underneath there's been a surprising amount of churn. Large-cap growth stocks especially have moved suddenly on unclear reasoning, moves that seem skittish amidst a bull market. This may just be a sign of late-cycle behavior, or it may be a source of opportunity for the nimbly patient investor. We discuss several tech stocks and provide examples of what is going on.\nTopics Covered\n\n2:30 minute mark - Setting the scene on this market\n\n11:15 - The whiplash effect and how this affects relative valuation\n\n13:45 - Is long term investing in trouble?\n\n18:00 - ZOOM, WORK, DBX as long-term examples of this phenomenon\n\n28:30 - Finding the right pair trade... harder in this market?\n\n35:30 - The general risk climate in the market\n\n49:30 - Apple (AAPL) and 5G\n\n54:45 - Given the issues, how are you going to trade for the year?\n\n1:00:30 - Streaming vs. SaaS in terms of valuation\n\n1:09:30 - Will there be a rush back into growth stocks in 2020?",
