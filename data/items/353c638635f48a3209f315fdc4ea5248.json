  "description": "<p>ROUND 1: A North Carolina woman passed away this week at the age of 90 thus ending a 155 year long pension from her father’s time in the Civil War… How is this possible? Well the ‘ol vet was 83 when she was born, go old man, go.\n\nROUND 2: One of the most cringe worthy military love texts led us to ask you about the worst love stories you ever witnessed in uniform. From a motorcycle wedding to Jody drama the answers did not disappoint. \n\nROUND 3: A Rifle-toting veteran was arrested this week after dressing up and blending in with a National Guard crowd control formation in Los Angeles. Stay tuned to hear what this has to do with Jurassic Park. Hold on to ya butts. \n\nROUND 4: Martha McSally, who was not a Sad Sack Sally when we interviewed her, joined us to talk about her book, life as an A-10 fighter pilot, and how she sued the bejesus out of Secretary Rumsfeld while she was just a lowly field grade officer. \n\nROUND 5: Call Sign Chaos caused a little chaos on social media. General Mattis blasted his former boss by saying that President Trump is a danger to the Constitution. That’s kinda big news right? That deserves its own round!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
