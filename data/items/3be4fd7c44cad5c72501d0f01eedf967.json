  "description": "Today, in a very special bonus episode, I bring you an interview it was an honour to record.<br /><br />Rob Delaney is a comedian, actor and writer, known to many of us as the star and co-creator of the hit Channel 4 sitcom, Catastrophe. But behind the public smile, he has dealt with unfathomable private tragedy. In 2018, Rob and his wife's beloved son Henry died at the age of two-and-a-half of a brain cancer. Delaney’s memoir of this time, A Heart That Works, is published today. It is an astonishing, honest account of the darkest possible human experience: the story of what happens when your child dies, and of everything you discover about life in the process.<br /><br />This is not an easy listen, but it is also an episode full of hope, insight and - yes - even humour.  Listen to understand a little more of what it is to be human. Listen to make Henry's acquaintance. Listen to hear a first-hand account of love at the extremity of experience.<br /><br />Rob: thank you so much for trusting me. Henry: this one's for you.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Rob Delaney's A Heart That Works is out today and available to buy here: <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/aheartthatworks\" rel=\"noopener\">https://linktr.ee/aheartthatworks</a><br /><br />--<br /><br />How To Fail With Elizabeth Day is hosted and produced by Elizabeth Day.
