  "description": "Discussions of punk tend to focus on groups, like the Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Clash, and the punk scenes of New York, London, and Los Angeles. Punk, however, was a broader musical cultural movement and sprung up in multiple locations.\n\nThe Dead Kennedys hailed from the San Francisco punk scene and were important punk and cultural icons through the 1980s. In his new book, Dead Kennedys: Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables: The Early Years (PM Press, 2014), Alex Ogg examines the genesis of this seminal album and captures both the tension between the band members and the beautiful marriage of witty lyrics and musical virtuosity. In the podcast, we explore the San Francisco punk scene, the innovative nature of the Dead Kennedys, and their legacy.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
