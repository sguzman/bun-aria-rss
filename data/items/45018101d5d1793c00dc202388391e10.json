  "description": "Malicious misdirection served up from unpatched WordPress sites. A big, big set of dating site records has been found exposed online--it’s in China, but the records seem to belong to anglophones. Many other files are exposed elsewhere, too, so it’s not a single problem. Turla’s back, and still after diplomats. The International Red Cross proposes rules for cyber conflict. And Baltimore City calculates the cost of not patching. It’s a lot higher than the cost of patching. Craig Williams from Cisco Talos with his take on a critical Microsoft vulnerability, CVE-2019-0708. Guest is Matt Aldridge from Webroot on the San Francisco facial recognition ban. Justin Harvey from Accenture on the dramatic increase in targeted ransomware. Guest is NSA’s Diane M. Janosek, celebrating the 20th year of their Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity program.",
