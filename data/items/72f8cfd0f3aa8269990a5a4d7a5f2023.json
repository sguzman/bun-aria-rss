It&#8217;s called the Music Industry Research Association, and they want you to come to their first conference, at UCLA, in August. Here&#8217;s their writeup:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Starting with <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Marshall\">Alfred Marshall</a></strong>’s &#8220;superstar model&#8221; and continuing with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease\"><strong>Baumol</strong>’s Disease</a>, a number of breakthroughs in economics have come from studying the music industry. The music business also provides a fun and easy way to engage students in economics. To promote cutting-edge research on the economics of music, a group of economists, including <strong><a href=\"https://krueger.princeton.edu/\">Alan Krueger</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/faculty/joel-waldfogel\">Joel Waldfogel</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/economics/faculty-and-staff/faculty-listing/julie-holland-mortimer.html\">Julie Mortimer</a></strong>, has formed the <a href=\"https://themira.org/\">Music Industry Research Association</a> (MIRA).</p>\n<p>The goal of MIRA is to provide a forum for economists and other researchers to interact with one another and music industry professionals to study trends, developments, and challenges facing the music industry, and to provide access to data. MIRA will hold its first conference of researchers, industry leaders, and musicians on August 10–11, 2017, at the <a href=\"http://luskinconferencecenter.ucla.edu/\">Luskin Conference Center</a> at the University of California, Los Angeles. You can register for the conference <a href=\"https://themira.org/conference\">here</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freakonomics.com/2017/06/mira-conference/\">Calling All Music-Industry Insiders and the Economists Who Love Them</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freakonomics.com\">Freakonomics</a>.</p>\n"
