  "description": "In booster shot news, CNN’s Dr. Jonathan Reiner argues that it’s time to move the goalposts on what it takes to be considered “fully vaccinated.” Next, confused about Non-Fungible Tokens? That might be because everyone who tries to define them does a terrible job. Luckily, Stephen Colbert is here to help with an AFT (an Actual F****** Thing) that perfectly explains how NFTs work. Andrew Garfield gets emotional when talking about the recent loss of his mother, and relates her life to the life of Jonathan Larson, the man he portrays in the new film, “Tick, Tick, Boom!” Then, our good friend Chef José Andrés stops by for a holiday cooking segment and gets the party started with a fancy pour of some fancy Spanish sherry.
