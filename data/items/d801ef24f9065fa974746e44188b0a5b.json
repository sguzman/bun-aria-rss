  "description": "It was late in the great halls of Asgard. The gods were sleeping...or at least, most of them were. Thor, God of Thunder, strongest warrior to ever walk on earth or in the heavens, was having an argument with Loki, god of fire, and cunning trickster. It had started off innocently enough, but Loki knew just how to get Thor angry. In fact, it was one of his favorite games. \n  “Sorry Thor, but you’re wrong. It is much better to be clever than it is strong.”\n\nSupport the show at Patreon.com/stories\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
