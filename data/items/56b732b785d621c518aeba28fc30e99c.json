  "description": "Our audiobook this week is THE BRATVAS HOSTAGE by Jagger Cole\n\nTaking her was only the beginning…\n\nA hit gone wrong. My partner, the future King of the Kashenko Bratva, bleeding out. There’s only one choice left for me:\n\nKidnap the daughter of the rival mob boss, and take her as my hostage.\n\nNow, she’s my temptingly innocent, beautifully forbidden bargaining chip.\n\nTalia is a pretty little bird, trapped all her life in a gilded cage. Too good for me. Too young for me, too. A softness I’ve never touched. A sweetness I’ve never tasted.\n\nWe’re trapped together, and time is running out.\n\nBut the solution might be just as forbidden as she is…\n\nThis extra-steamy novella is a *standalone* prequel to the Bratva’s Claim series. Absolutely no cheating, no cliffhanger, and a happy ever after.\n\nEnter Giveaway: https://bit.ly/31hR8zk\nBrutal King: https://amzn.to/3D5V0jZ\nCapturing Christmas: https://amzn.to/3G0r6PS\nMore Jagger Cole eBooks: https://amzn.to/31gCqbL\n\nOTHER MENTIONS\nLONER by Jamie Schlosser\nBABY GRAVY by Jisa Dean\nTHE WINTER GROOM by Alexa Riley\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
