  "description": "<p>When we are in fear, we tense up our root chakra, which is related to survival. We feel unsafe, anxious and disconnected from our bodies and Earth (hence the global rush for toilet paper.) In this episode, I talk about why it’s more important than ever before to get into your lower chakras through dance and how dance is the ultimate healer.</p> <p>I speak about the three lower chakras (root, sacral and solar plexus) and their associated dance forms. I also speak about why shaking and twerking is SO crucial for your well-being and why there is such shame around it.
