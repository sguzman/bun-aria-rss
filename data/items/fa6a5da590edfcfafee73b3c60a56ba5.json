    "media:description": "***The Day after I uploaded this video, Youtube censored it as 18 over. This has in effect killed all traffic too it. There is nothing in this video that could be consider 'adult' in nature. I have appealed the decision.***\n\n\n\n\n\nLouis Duxberry, 22, jailed for saying the wrong thing on Facebook. A frightening expose on Britain's thought police and our oppressive hate crime laws.\n\n\nIf you would like to support this channel, and the Crimebodge website then please consider making a donation, for which I would be most grateful:\nhttps://paypal.me/crimebodge\n\n\nYou can also donate directly from my website here:\nhttps://crimebodge.com/donate/\n\nOr to show your support, why not purchase one of my Eproducts: \nhttps://crimebodge.com/ebooks/\n\nOr just visit my website here:\nhttps://crimebodge.com",
