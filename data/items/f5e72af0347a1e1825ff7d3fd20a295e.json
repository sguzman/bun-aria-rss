  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the Supreme Court, the NRA, the second amendment, baby formula manufacturers, are the media's scapegoats. They create enemies instead of tackling the actual issues. So, when there's a school shooting, they blame guns, and the Constitution instead of the killer. When baby formula runs out because the government shuttered factories, they blame the company instead of the bureaucrats. It's all the fault of the white dominant culture. Society is withering because of their attack on the nuclear family and yet they will blame the definition of the family. Then, the left claims that conservatives deny that guns are the problem citing that no other industrialized nation has the amount of \"gun violence\" that the U.S has. But they fail to acknowledge that young people in the U.S have had rifles since the beginning of this nation. They fail to look at the actual issues that have spawned mass murderers who choose schools as targets. The left's inability to see outside of their own narrow political scope makes them insist on rejecting the culture as the culprit. That's why Chuck Schumer blocked a School Safety bill Republicans have been trying to pass since the Parkland Shooting which the bill is named after. Later, the Texas Department of Public Safety Director McCraw held a press conference and clarified that it was a mistake to treat the active shooter as a barricaded suspect which has drastically different protocols and left the shooter alone in the classroom for 40 minutes. Afterward, despite the January 6th Committee and the NY Attorney General's malicious pursuit of former President Trump, he remains steadfast and offers hope to the hurting in his remarks at the NRA convention. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
