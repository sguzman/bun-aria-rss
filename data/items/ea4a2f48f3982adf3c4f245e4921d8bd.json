  "description": "<p>Water coolers, office bagels, frigid spaces with fluorescent lighting. Today's episode is all about work. It’s how we pay the bills, but it’s also how many of us derive purpose, meaning and structure from our days. Whether you're unemployed, salaried, or your own boss, the world of work is changing. David Burkus sees this as an opportunity to think consciously about what to change when it comes to how, where, and when we work. David is an author, podcaster and associate professor of management at Oral Roberts University. His latest book, Leading From Anywhere: The Essential Guide to Managing Remote Teams, tackles the key challenges of this new era of remote work. Burkus is a regular contributor to Harvard Business Review and Inc. magazine. His work has been featured in Fast Company, the Financial Times, Bloomberg BusinessWeek and \"CBS This Morning.\" He's also the host of the award-winning podcast Radio Free Leader. David challenges the traditional and widely accepted principles of business management. David lives in Tulsa with his wife and their two boys.</p>",
