  "description": "Patricia Esparza. April 16, 1995. Irvine, California. A body is discovered on the side of a road wrapped in strips of blue towels. It will be reported to the authorities. The man had clearly been viciously attacked with something sharp. An autopsy revealed this weapon to likely be a meat cleaver. Investigators will establish a link between the dead man and an incident from hours earlier when a man named Gonzalo Ramirez was abducted by people driving a white van. Interviews with suspects will reveal the motive for the killing. In this case, the dead man was accused of raping a young woman who later told her boyfriend about it. Prosecutors will charge the woman, respected psychology professor Patricia Esparza, many years later with murder. Did she send her boyfriend to murder her rapist? Or did prosecutors go too far in charging her with murder?\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
