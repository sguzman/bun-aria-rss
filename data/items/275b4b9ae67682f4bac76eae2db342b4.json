  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, this program and many others got it wrong when questions were raised about President Trump having total authority to re-open the economy and it was never about the supremacy clause, the 10th Amendment, or federalism — it was about the interstate Commerce Clause. As President Trump has this authority to prevent state monopolies and no states police powers can nullify the Commerce Clause. It’s absurd to think that Governors can have all the power and none of the responsibility. Then, tyrannical politicians know exactly how to extract liberties via progressivism which seeks to control humanity, not progress it. Later, allowing the government to take food off of your table, and money out of your retirement, is not acceptable. Small business are currently set back in ways they might not recover from, but they're holding on. Afterward, the attack on the president is hypocritical and unreasonable. Their expectation for federalism has been hampered by their very own big--government \"new deal\" laws that eliminated certain state rights. While some were deemed unconstitutional others prevailed, so the left has themselves to thank for big-government running amok.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
