  "description": "<p>In this 97th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>In this episode, we discuss the epilogue of A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, which includes mention of the precautionary principle, not gaming good systems, the Golden Rule, society’s obligations to us, and more. We talk about Pegasus spyware. We discuss lessons learned and topics covered in recent media about the book: on not being cancellable, on the value of sometimes going it alone, on why we need to save Enlightenment values, but may not be able to save the current institutions of higher ed. And we talk about how our book is doing in the marketplace, and what it means about legacy media vs upstart media.<br/><br/>Get your Goliath shirts right here: store.darkhorsepodcast.org<br/><br/>Heather’s newsletter, Natural Selections (subscribe to get free weekly essays in your inbox): https://naturalselections.substack.com<br/><br/>Support the sponsors of this show:<br/><br/>MDHearingAid.com: Use promo code DARKHORSE to receive a significant discount off your order of already inexpensive, high-quality hearing aids, plus receive a free extra charging case.
