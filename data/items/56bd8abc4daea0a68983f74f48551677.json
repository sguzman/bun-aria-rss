  "description": "<p>It’s another week at The Cigar Authority, but it’s one of our favorite episodes as Mr. Jonathan is off dancing with men (no joke!). We welcome to the show two special guests, the first being from Kristoff Cigars, John Fazzi the local New England sales representative. We will smoke the Kristoff Connecticut Corona and talk the 2019 Firecracker with him.</p>\n<p>Also along for the ride is Sammy B, the brother of Mr. Jonathan and the contractor responsible for building the United Podcas Network set at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe. We will talk about Mr. Jonathan behind his back, and it’s guaranteed to be a lot of fun. How does Sammy feel, that his brother is off in North Carolina dancing cheek to cheek.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we will light up the 7 • 20 • 4 WK Series from Kurt Kendall and share our thoughts on this cigar that is named for his son who passed away.</p>\n<p>We will have the usual suspects such as Versus, Offer Of The Day, Asylum, Classic 3-Way and Cigar News on the number one downloaded cigar podcast in the world.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='http://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n",
