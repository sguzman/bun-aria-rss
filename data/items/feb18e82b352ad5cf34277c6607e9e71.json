  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys break down one of the most memorable Sunday's in recent memory as they look back on Tiger Woods winning his 5th Green Jacket at the Masters and discuss his greatness, how much more he has in the tank, and why things were different this time around when they've looked promising before. To chat a little bit more about Tiger, Pat welcomes on friend of the show, 2X Major Champion, and one of the most electric human beings to ever walk the planet, John Daly. They chat about his week in Augusta at Hooters and how it differed from last year, how Little John has been performing on the course as of late, what he thought about Tiger winning his 5th Green Jacket and whether or not he's going to make a run at Jack Nicklaus' major record, and if there are any young players right now that can challenge the greatness of Tiger's career (22:47-27:47). Pat and the guys also welcome recurring guest, regular panelist on \"Get Up,\" and 11 year NFL veteran, Dan Orlovsky, to chat about Russell Wilson giving the Seahawks a hard deadline for a new extension, and whether or not he could end up playing QB for the Giants. They also chat about which coaches from the Sean McVay mold will have successful season or if he is an anomaly, if Joe Flacco will resurrect his career in Denver, and Dan gives out a couple of his sleeper picks for the NFC and AFC next year (38:41-50:20). To close out the show, the guys discuss the premiere of Game of Thrones and try to convince Pat that getting on board with the show is worth his time, and Pat announces the upcoming live podcast tour which has 6 dates in 6 different cities this summer. It's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
