  "description": "<p>Ted Bundy, one of America's most notorious serial killers, was also a kidnapper, rapist, burglar, and necrophile who attacked dozens of young women and girls across the US in the 1970s. Bundy's killing spree was interrupted in 1977 when he was arrested for a Colorado murder, but he escaped while being transported to a court hearing. He was caught again in Florida in 1978, but only after a brutal raid on a Florida State University sorority house. Bundy confessed to 30 homicides, although it suspected his death toll was much higher. Bundy was executed by Florida in 1989.
