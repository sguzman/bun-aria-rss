  "description": "In this weeks episode, we are driving to the Grand Canyon to help out with The Jump. In case you missed it - Last week, Will Smith bungee jumped out of a helicopter because of our friends at Yes Theory. \nWhile we were driving from Pheonix to Flagstaff Arizona, we turned on our mics and recorded one of our most vulnerable conversations to date. We talked about fame and what it means in the modern world. We also talked about some early stage success we've had with our new show, The Breakdown, and how that has affected us. \nWe hope you enjoy the conversation and please let us know if you have feedback for the show by tweeting at us @colinandsamir.",
