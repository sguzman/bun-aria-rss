    "media:description": "Let's use the important cycle of fifths and the musical clock system based on the 12 tone chromatic scale to try to precisely create frequencies for a \"perfect\" scale. This attempt we know is doomed to failure, but it is instructive to see the same arithmetical issue encountered in the previous video manifesting itself in a different way.\n\nAlso the symmetrical role of the \"augment fourth\" or \"diminished fifth\" interval, which we now know is more properly described as a \"6-step\", becomes clearer, and the connection with the arithmetic conundrum around discussion of the non-existent \"square root of 2\" becomes clearer. \n\nIsn't it amazing that the Pythagorean essentially bumped into the same arithmetical problem, at least implicitly, in two quite different fashions? From one point of view it is the geometric relation between the side and diagonal of a square, while from another it is the musical relation between a note and the interval which is in some sense \"halfway\" to the octave. \n\nThe cycle of fourths also manifests itself here: going clockwise by steps of  7 is really the same as going counterclockwise by steps of 5. Those two numbers 7 and 5 really play a crucial role in a proper understanding of modern music built up from the even tempered scale, as well as forming the bedrock pattern on which much of classical music, jazz, pop and rock'n roll are based.\n\nA big shout out of thanks to all my Patreon supporters: your contributions are very much appreciated!\n\n***********************\nScreenshot PDFs for my videos are available at the website http://wildegg.com. These give you a concise overview of the contents of the lectures for various Playlists: great for review, study and summary.\n\nMy research papers can be found at my Research Gate page, at https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Norman_Wildberger\n\nMy blog is at http://njwildberger.com/, where I will discuss lots of foundational issues, along with other things.\n\nOnline courses will be developed at openlearning.com. The first one, already underway is Algebraic Calculus One at https://www.openlearning.com/courses/algebraic-calculus-one/ Please join us for an exciting new approach to one of mathematics' most important subjects!\n\nIf you would like to support these new initiatives for mathematics education and research, please consider becoming a Patron of this Channel at https://www.patreon.com/njwildberger Your support would be much appreciated! :)\n\n***********************\nHere are all the Insights into Mathematics Playlists:\n\nElementary Mathematics (K-6) Explained: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?\nlist=PL8403C2F0C89B1333\nYear 9 Maths:   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CcGpZpO542YLPeDIf1jqXK\nAncient Mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85Aqe2b4FBWUGJdYROT6-o4e\nWild West Banking: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85DB7CzoFWvA920NES3g8tJH\nSociology and Pure Mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85A-qCypcmZqRvaS1pGXpTua\nOld Babylonian Mathematics (with Daniel Mansfield): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?\nlist=PLIljB45xT85CdeBmQZ2QiCEnPQn5KQ6ov\nMath History: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55C7C83781CF4316\nWild Trig: Intro to Rational Trigonometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3C58498718451C47\nMathFoundations: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5A714C94D40392AB\nWild Linear Algebra: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85BhzJ-oWNug1YtUjfWp1qAp\nFamous Math Problems: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85Bfc-S4WHvTIM7E-ir3nAOf\nProbability and Statistics: An Introduction: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85AMigTyprOuf__daeklnLse\nBoole's Logic and Circuit Analysis: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CnIGIWb7tH1F_S2PyOC8rb\nUniversal Hyperbolic Geometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CN9oJ4gYkuSQQhAtpIucuI\nDifferential Geometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85DWUiFYYGqJVtfnkUFWkKtP\nAlgebraic Topology: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6763F57A61FE6FE8\nMath Seminars: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBF39AFBBC3FB30AF\n************************\n\nAnd here are the Wild Egg Maths Playlists:\n\nTriangle Centres: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLBGXDSUohM&list=PLzdiPTrEWyz6VcJQ5xcuqY6g4DWjvpmjM\nSix: An elementary course in pure mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz4KD007Ge10dfrDVc4YwlYS\nAlgebraic Calculus One: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz4rKFN541wFKvKPSg5Ea6XB\nAlgebraic Calculus Two: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz5VLVr-0LPPgm4T1mtU_DG-\n–º",
