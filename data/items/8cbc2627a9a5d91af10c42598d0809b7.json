  "description": "<p>Wendy Wein wanted her ex-husband dead, and she thought the “Rent-A-Hitman” website would help her out. It helped her into a jail cell. The site is fake and there's all kinds of red flags on the web page pointing it out. The Michigan woman originally used a pseudonym as she placed her inquiry, but gave her real contact information when she made a “service request.” The website owner contacted Michigan State Police with the information. An undercover detective contacted Wein, posing as a representative of the website, then met with her at a cafe.That's where Wein told the detective she wanted her former husband killed. Wein handed over her ex's home and work addresses, and his work schedule. Wein said she’d pay $5,000 for the hit and at a second meeting made a $200 down payment. Wein pled guilt to solicitation of murder and using a computer to commit a crime.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Joining Nancy Grace today:</p><ul>\n<li>Troy Slaten - Los Angeles Criminal Defense Attorney, Slaten Lawyers, APC, Twitter @TroySlaten </li>\n<li>Dr. Shari Schwartz - Forensic Psychologist (specializing in Capital Mitigation and Victim Advocacy), www.panthermitigation.com, Twitter: https://twitter.com/TrialDoc, Author: \"Criminal Behavior\" and \"Where Law and Psychology Intersect: Issues in Legal Psychology\"</li>\n<li>Joe Scott Morgan - Professor of Forensics: Jacksonville State University, Author, \"Blood Beneath My Feet\", Host: \"Body Bags with Joseph Scott Morgan\"</li>\n<li>Jessica Dupnack - Reporter, FOX 2 News, WBJK (Detroit), Instagram: @JessicaDupnack, Twitter @JDupnackFOX2</li>\n</ul><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
