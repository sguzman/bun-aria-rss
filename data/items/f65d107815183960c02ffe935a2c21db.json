  "description": "<p>Due to the effectiveness of using machine learning in physics, it has been\nwidely received increased attention in the literature. However, the notion of\napplying physics in machine learning has not been given much awareness to. This\nwork is a hybrid of physics and machine learning where concepts of physics are\nused in machine learning. We propose the supervised Gravitational\nDimensionality Reduction (GDR) algorithm where the data points of every class\nare moved to each other for reduction of intra-class variances and better\nseparation of classes. For every data point, the other points are considered to\nbe gravitational particles, such as stars, where the point is attracted to the\npoints of its class by gravity. The data points are first projected onto a\nspacetime manifold using principal component analysis. We propose two variants\nof GDR -- one with the Newtonian gravity and one with the Einstein's general\nrelativity. The former uses Newtonian gravity in a straight line between points\nbut the latter moves data points along the geodesics of spacetime manifold. For\nGDR with relativity gravitation, we use both Schwarzschild and Minkowski metric\ntensors to cover both general relativity and special relativity. Our\nsimulations show the effectiveness of GDR in discrimination of classes.\n</p>",
