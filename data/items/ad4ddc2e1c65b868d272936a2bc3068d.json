  "description": "<p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzb7EzleL2q6J-IuGpW9_Ag\">Kevin</a> is one of the smartest, most thoughtful people you’ve never met. His 15 minutes of fame came when he and his daughter were featured on a TV show, focusing on his technique of helping her overcome fear by balancing on his hand. Formerly a leader in the world of Techno Optimism, being a dad has led him to rethink some of his previous positions. We talk about everything from God to AI to drugs to the importance of podcasting.</p> <p class=\"\">This episode sponsored by <a href=\"http://sunbasket.com/ts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SunBasket</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">Find me on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\">Instagram</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\">Twitter</a>.</p> <p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/tangentiallyspeaking\">Please consider supporting this podcast on Patreon.</a></p> <p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</a></p> <p class=\"\"><br/> Music: “Brightside of the Sun,” by <a href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\">Basin and Range</a>; “Studebaker,” by Jordan Zevon; “Smoke Alarm,” by <a href=\"https://www.carsieblanton.com/\">Carsie Blanton</a>.</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
