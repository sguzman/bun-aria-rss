  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week, we’re talking about one of our favorite historical romances, Jeannie Lin’s <em>Butterfly Swords</em>. This is one we’ve mentioned on previous episodes, and discussed at length during Jeannie’s Trailblazer episode, as it is the first own voices Asian-set historical romance. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Aside from setting the standard for adventure romance, it’s also a near-perfect road trip romance with one of the hottest slow burns you’ll ever read. We talk about all of it, including the absolutely devastating first kiss—one that should go down in romance history.
