  "description": "<p>In this 85th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p>In this episode, Bret begins with a monologue on YouTube, Google, the allegory of the cave, David and Goliath, and more, before we switch off YouTube and stream solely from Odysee. We then discuss what counts as a positive Covid test from the CDC’s perspective, and why their answer differs depending on whether you’ve been vaccinated or not. How will we know how many vaccine breakthrough cases are happening given how the data are being handled? We discuss OSHA’s move to obscure data on breakthrough cases as well. We discuss a new paper (Walach et al 2021) that finds that, in a field study out of Israel, the mass vaccination campaign saved three lives for every two people who died from vaccinations. We discuss PEG (polyethylene glycol), which is an ingredient in far too many things, including the mRNA vaccines, and turns out to be toxic to tadpoles. And we briefly discuss the spike protein crossing the blood-brain barrier, before finally talking a bit about chapter 2 of our forthcoming book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, and reading an excerpt on the origin of primates.</p><p>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is now available for pre-sale at amazon.
