  "description": "<p>What's your attitude when you go through tough times? Do you think, \"this isn't fair\" or \"I wish this wasn't happening to me\"? To the average person, struggle is something to be avoided. But elite achievers find benefits in being knocked around by life. In fact...far from being averse or ashamed of struggle, they embrace it. They take pride in it. They think of it as a privilege. And that's why they always power through. How can you develop this mindset? That's what I talk about in this episode.</p>",
