John and Julia discuss why Twitter makes disagreement so hard; whether there's anything to learn from postmodernism; John's \"signal and corrective\" model that explains why disagreement persists even when people agree on the key facts; and how the concept of \"decoupling\" helps explains Sam Harris and Ezra Klein's debate last year about IQ.",
