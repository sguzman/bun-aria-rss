  "description": "<p>If you’ve fallen in love with an interior design book over the past twenty years, chances are <strong>Jill Cohen</strong> had something to do with it. A veteran publishing executive who started Conde Nast’s book program, she’s now an independent advisor who helps designers package their work—and themselves—for publication. Cohen’s client list reads like a hall of fame induction roster: she’s shepherded everyone from <strong>Bunny Williams</strong>, <strong>Ellie Cullman</strong> and <strong>Stephen Sills</strong> to <strong>Bobby McAlpine</strong>, <strong>Gil Schafer</strong> and <strong>Aerin Lauder </strong>through the process of creating a compelling book. On this episode of the <i>Business of Home</i> podcast, Cohen tells host <strong>Dennis Scully</strong> about the surprising economics behind design book publishing, how the rise of celebrity culture changed the industry, and all the ways that Instagram can be a trap for designers. <i>This episode is sponsored by High Point Market and Paintzen. </i></p>\n",
