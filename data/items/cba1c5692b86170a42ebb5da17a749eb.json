  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Trailblazer series continues this week with Elda Minger—author of contemporary and historical romances, including <em>Untamed Heart</em>, which is the first contemporary romance to feature condom use on the page. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Elda talks about writing for Vivian Stephens, about writing about women’s bodies, about reproductive choice and about the way romance made space for women during the 70s and 80s. She shares a collection of gorgeous stories about her life as a reader and writer (and a particularly wonderful detour as a bookseller). About the boom of category and contemporary romance in the 1980s, and about the way writing made her who she is.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We are thrilled to have found Elda, and that she took time to speak with us and share her wonderful perspective on the genre with us.
