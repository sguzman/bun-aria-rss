  "description": "Andy Weir, the author of the hit science fiction novel \"The Martian,\" talks with Recode's Edmund Lee about his new book, \"Artemis.\" Set in a city on Earth's Moon in the late 2080s, \"Artemis\" is a crime caper that centers on a smuggler named Jazz, a young woman who moved to the Moon from Saudi Arabia. Weir explains how \"The Martian\" became an accidental hit thanks to Amazon's Kindle platform, but also why crowdfunding isn't the future of all media — he wrote \"Artemis\" with a traditional print publisher already on board. Plus: How Weir writes diverse characters, why he never visited the set of \"The Martian\" movie and when humans will live on the Moon.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
