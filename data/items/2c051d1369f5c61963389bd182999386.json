  "description": "<p class=\"\">Kaytee and Meredith are back and chatting about all the books this week. We’ve got surgery updates and silliness and everything in between.</p> <p class=\"\">You’ll hear a “bookish moment of the week” from each host. We’re virtually joining in on a trip to a local booklover’s heaven, and sitting on the couch binging books together.</p> <p class=\"\">Next, we discuss our current reads for the week. Romance, and mystery, non-fiction, and YA. We’re chatting about all that we’ve been reading lately, even if it doesn’t jive with previous opinions on the show!</p> <p class=\"\">Our Slow But Steady check in is going to move to every once in a while instead of every week. You can still check in on Instagram or Facebook, but this is an “off” week for this segment.</p> <p class=\"\">For our deep dive this week, we are excited to talk about what makes us skip or DNF (do not finish) a book. Some of these might be obvious to long-time listeners of the show, but some surprised us as well as each other, so let us know what you think and what you discover about your OWN reading tendencies here. We are SO interested to hear it!</p> <p class=\"\">Finally, this week, we are Pressing Books into Your Hands: first, a small “bonus press” to add some hilarity to your December, and then a tribute to a recently deceased author, and something to press into the young adults’ hands in your life.</p> <p class=\"\">As per usual, time-stamped show notes are below with references to every book and resource we mentioned in this episode. If you’d like to listen first and not spoil the surprise, don’t scroll down! </p> <p class=\"\">*Please note that all book titles linked above are Amazon affiliate links.
