  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. This week I bring back CEO and Chief Investment Officer of U.S. Global Investors - Frank Holmes. On the show, Frank introduces listeners to yet another ETF he plans on launching at the end of this month. The timing couldn't of been better... Especially when you consider, as we'll talk about, the recent rebalancing of the GDXJ - a very popular junior mining Exchange Traded Fund that has recently caused a seismic shock through out the mining sector. Just like Frank's first ETF (NYSE: JETS), which was introduced two years ago and covers the airliner industry, this fund is being launched in the middle of an out-of-favor down cycle... Leaving the public a chance to invest in a basket of stocks with very limited down-side risk. Tune in as Frank breaks down US Global's latest venture... and how his smart data, \"moneyball\" approach can be an industry game-changer. Good Investing, Frank Curzio",
