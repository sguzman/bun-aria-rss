  "description": "<p>This week on <em>Eat Your Words</em>, host Cathy Erway kicks off the new radio season welcoming Jaime Joyce, author of Moonshine: A Cultural History of America’s Infamous Liquor, to the program. Talking about the history, alternative nick-names, legality, and what exactly constitutes the drink, Cathy and Jaime clear up the misnomers that have surrounded moonshine throughout the years. Jaime goes on to explain the details behind the grain content that is vital to a quality moonshine, and how many distilleries are turning to their local farmers to provide ingredients, which in turn sets one moonshine’s taste apart from another. After the break, Jaime tells an interesting tale of the “Moonshine Conspiracy Trial of 1935” that truly proves how moonshine has implemented itself into the history of the United States. Tune in for an info-packed episode and to find out the future of moonshine!
