The real heroes are the ones that are out there defending the innocent, the voiceless…”</p><p>Timothy Shieff</p><br><p>When the question turns to living your truth, this first line from Timothy Shieff's <a href=\"http://www.spiritoftim.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">self-authored bio</a> says it all:</p><p>I'm a Human practicing Being.</p><p>Widely considered one of the world’s best Freerunners (more commonly referred to as parkour),&nbsp;Timothy — aka Livewire —&nbsp;specializes in a death and gravity defying skill set that leaves mere mortals agape. Scaling buildings and leaping off rooftops with effortless grace, Tim is a perfect physical manifestation of focus, coordination,&nbsp;strength, agility and fearlessness.</p><br><p>Indeed,&nbsp;this proper and polite young English lad can do things you can’t. And yet his expression is fueled not by competitive drive, but by something deeper. Tim's particular brand of parkour is subversive. Reframing the inanimate building, rooftop, curb or railing, Tim inverts the human relationship between human and object. Truly a social and political performance artist, Tim leaves me inspired to live more harmoniously with our ever-changing environment.</p><p>Despite captaining Team Europe to a world championship on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFmRbYlfwqg\" target=\"_blank\">American Ninja Warrior</a> (and setting records along the way), Tim's athleticism runs a distant second to his passion for advocacy. A powerful young voice in the vegan movement, Tim wakes up every morning enthusiastic to not only expand his own horizons, but inspire others to do the same.</p><p>But more than any of this, it's Tim's spirit that moves me, and why I'm so proud to introduce his return to the RRP. In case you missed it, be sure to check out my first conversation with Tim — <a href=\"http://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-86-freerunning-world-champion-timothy-shieff-eat-concrete-not-meat/\" target=\"_blank\">RRP #86.</a></p><p>Intelligent and articulate beyond his years, my hope is that this conversation leaves you with a new mindfulness and perspective on your path and priorities; pondering the impact of our consumer choices on the planet; and questioning culturally entrenched assumptions&nbsp;about the relationship between nutrition and extraordinary athletic performance.</p><p>I genuinely hope you enjoy the conversation.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><br><p>P.S. – Tim recently completed his first 26.2 at the London Marathon in 3:04.
