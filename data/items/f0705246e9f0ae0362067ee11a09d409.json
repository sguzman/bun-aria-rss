  "description": "We’ve talked a lot on the Debunking Economics podcast about how energy is the only real driver of an economy, so the performance of an economy is driven by the availability of the resource and how efficiently it is captured. Phil Dobbie asks Professor Steve Keen if that means countries with the most energy resources should be the most effective producers of goods, with a healthy trade surplus. If that’s the case, why doesn’t Saudi Arabia make very much? And could nations embracing renewable energy efficiently become net exporters if their governments invested wisely?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
