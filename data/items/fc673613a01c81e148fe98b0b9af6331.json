  "description": "It's not easy making a living as a rock band in Canada...\n\nThis is afterall the second largest country in the world. And when you consider that the Trans-Canada Highway is over 7600 kilometers long, and there is nearly 10 million square kilomters of land spead out over 6 time zones, well...it's a little daunting to say the least.\n\n And even though 77% of Canada's 36 million people live in big cities, bands still have to work really really hard to reach everyone.  \n\nIt's even harder when you factor in that we live right next door to the largest exporter of pop-culture in the universe. \n\nGeography has chewed up the domestic careers of countless bands...but some have it figured out. They've got the routine and fanbase all figured out. They may not be rich, but they are making a solid and respectable living as rock stars in Canada.\n\nSloan is one of those bands. They've been around since 1991and have become somewhat of a Canadian institution. \n\nThis is Sloan in Their Own Words...Part 2.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
