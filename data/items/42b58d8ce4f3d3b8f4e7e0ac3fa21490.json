  "description": "<p>The Felt Mansion was meant to be a beautiful and spacious place of escape during the summer for the Felt family. It was a representation of a successful life set on the shores of Lake Michigan. Death doesn’t care about family or success. It comes when we least expect it and at cruel times. And that is what happened to the Felt family. Now it would seem that family spirits have chosen to stay here in the afterlife. But there is something else here. Something eerie. Those mysterious shadow people have also made this their home. And on top of that, an urban legend has arisen from the mansion as well. Join us as we explore the history, legends and hauntings of the Felt Mansion! The Moment in Oddity is by Bob Sherfield and features the Crystal Palace Pneumatic Railway and This Day in History is by Jessica Bell and features King Henry VII giving John Cabot permission to explore unknown lands.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/03/hgb-ep-110-felt-mansion.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/03/hgb-ep-110-felt-mansion.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
