  "title": "PMS 2.0 200 - Show Is Absolutely Packed. Shams Charania, Darren Woodson, David Akers, Neal Brown, & Legend, AJ Hawk Stop By. Let's Go.",
  "description": "Today’s show is highlighted by a couple of incredible interviews. First, NBA Insider for the Athletic, the man who knows things you don’t, friend of the show Shams Charania joins the program to discuss when the NBA may potentially be coming back, if he knows which host city they’re going to land on, what was said on the conference call with some of the owners and top players in the league, and what exactly has to happen for the NBA to return and salvage their season (1:59-14:12). Next is another edition of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ dive into everything going on in the sports world, and AJ tells the story about riding around with the Blue Angels and having to fill his pockets with throw up while Pat and the boys wait for the Angels to fly over the office (15:54-1:13:52). Next, 6x Pro Bowler, 6x All-Pro, member of the NFL 2000’s All-Decade Team, and member of the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame, David Akers joins the program. Pat and David chat about the current state of The Brand in the NFL, his most fond memories of being an Eagle, how his career ended, bouncing back from a Ponzi scheme that he was a victim of, and what it’s like to kick through a lot of pain (1:13:54-1:32:35). Also joining the show is 3x Super Bowl Champion, 5x Pro Bowler, 4x All-Pro, and member of the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor, Darren Woodson. Pat and Darren chat about his relationship with Jerry Jones and what he's really like, whether or not he thinks the Dak Prescott deal is going to get done soon, how his real estate office overlooks the Cowboys practice facility, the tough years of Dallas not having a quarterback, why he decided to leave ESPN, and what he is up to now (1:32:37-1:45:04). Lastly, current Head Coach of the West Virginia Mountaineers football team, Neal Brown, joins the show. Pat and Neal talking about how he’s building the culture at WVU, how they have tried to adapt to teaching everything via zoom, the idea behind bringing a brand coach into the program, what he’s been doing to stay active during the quarantine, and what his favorite parts about Morgantown have been thus far (1:45:06-2:05:46). Don’t forget to send in a picture of where you’re listening to the show with #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch, we appreciate you rocking with us. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
