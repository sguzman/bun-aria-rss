  "description": "<p>He was implicated in a case of missing money from a courthouse evidence vault. He was facing allegations of misconduct and illegal handling of a witness in a major drug trafficking trial, which lead to the judge ordering a federal investigation.</p>\n\n\n<p>One way to stop that federal investigation would be to come up with a quick plea deal to end the case. One problem, there was no way to do the plea deal without violating federal law.</p>\n\n\n<p>And unfortunately, for US assistant attorney Jonathan Luna things were about to get worse. Much, much worse.</p>\n\n\n<p>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-09-jonathan-luna/\"><strong><a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-09-jonathan-luna\">casefilepodcast.com/case-09-jonathan-luna</a></strong></a></p>\n",
