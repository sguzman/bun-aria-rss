  "description": "On today's show, Pat is joined by 3x All-Star, member of the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame, 12 year MLB veteran, and Pittsburgh native, \"The Mayor\" Sean Casey. Pat and Sean discuss everything going on in the baseball world, including who he thinks the 60 game season will benefit the most, why he thinks this season will test managers more than usual, how long it'll take pitchers and hitters to get back in the groove of things, why the Pirates perpetually stink, and Sean tells a couple of hilarious stories about his time being teammates with Ken Griffey Jr. in Cincinnati (1:08-28:39). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ shoot the breeze about everything going on in the sports world currently, AJ has some big breaking news regarding his AFL allegiances, they chat about what their plans are for the long weekend, AJ heading up to Lake Tahoe for the Celebrity Pro-Am golf tournament up there, and everything else to send you into the holiday weekend (30:34-2:21:10). Lastly, NBA Champion, NCAA Champion, 2009 NBA 6th Man of the Year, and current assistant basketball coach at his alma mater the University of Arizona, Jason \"The Jet\" Terry joins the program. Pat and Jet chat about if he ever wishes he played in this era with how much teams rely on the three pointer, who the best three point shooter he's ever seen is, what he expects the NBA bubble situation to be like, how much different it is being a college coach having to deal with all the different compliance rules, and when he thinks he'll get a head coaching gig (2:23:58-2:36:41). Don't forget to send in a picture of where you're listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch.
