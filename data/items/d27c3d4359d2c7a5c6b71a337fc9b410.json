  "description": "<p>In 1992, after years of teaching workshops on creative unblocking, Julia Cameron self-published<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LDEWj1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em>The Artist's Way</em></a>, which became a global phenomenon that sold millions of copies, was translated into 40 languages, and anchors companion workshops that have brought creativity into the mainstream conversation. Along the way, Julia has authored more than 40 books, plays and screenplays, written for <em>Rolling Stone, The Washington Post</em> and <em>The New York Times</em>, and collaborated with legends of television and movies, including Martin Scorsese, who would, for a time, become her partner in life as well.&nbsp;</p><p>A few years back, I had a great opportunity to sit down with Julia in her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico for a beautifully honest and open, deep-dive conversation that ranged from her upbringing to her entrée into the writing life, her years-long struggle with addiction and awakening from it, her time in Hollywood, swept up in the world of movies, and her fierce commitment to her craft and to helping others find their creative voices and let them out.
