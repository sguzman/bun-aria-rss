  "description": "<p>If you had told Matt and Bowen when they were arguing years ago at the Emmys about \"who was the Busy and who was the Michelle\" that one day Busy would be on their gay little podcast, they would have eaten their hats! Well yum yum yum I hope the boys have a hankering for their own damn caps because Busy Philipps is here on Las Cultch! Talking about everything! Becoming a goddamn math teacher during the pandemic, raising brilliant gen-z children, how Blake Shelton actually has \"the sparkle\" in person, the impact of People Magazine culture, what happened when Busy's grandmother came through during a session with a medium, the bangers on the Girls5Eva soundtrack, when entertainment media crosses the line, \"freak numbers\", Dua Lipa, and the state of produce in New York City. Are you an adult that has had strep throat? What do you think of the name \"Mac Rogers\"? Are YOU the Busy or the Michelle of your best friendship? Just some questions based on a *thunderously joyful* episode of LC with a true icon: Busy! Listen to the podcast Busy Philipps Is Doing Her Best, watch Girls5Eva on Peacock and have a great fucking day!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
