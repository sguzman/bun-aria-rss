  "description": "The President is returning from Asia.  He says it was the greatest trip there since Marco Polo.  His defenders note that he didn't start screwing up too badly until a few days in.  But then again, once he started screwing up...he really went to work flip flopping on trade with China, kissing up to Putin, insulting Kim Jong Un, making nice with the murderer who currently runs the Philippines, insulting the US intelligence community, watching as the nations of the region did TPP without the US and so much more.  Our panel of experts, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Kori Schake of Stanford and David Sanger of the New York Times discuss...and also take a deep dive into Sanger's recent reporting on the crisis at the National Security Agency.
