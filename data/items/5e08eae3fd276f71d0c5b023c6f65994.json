  "description": "<p>Hi Slight Changers -- We'll be back with fresh episodes for you on Feb 28th!! In the meantime, I wanted to share a new audiobook from Pushkin, the company behind A Slight Change of Plans. It’s called Heartbreak and it’s written and read by Florence Williams. Florence is a science journalist, and when her husband of 25 years broke up with her, she set out to understand what was happening to her, emotionally and physically, after the divorce. The result is an immersive listening experience that's geared at changing the way we think about loneliness, health, and what it means to fall in and out of love. </p><p>You can order the Heartbreak audiobook now at pushkin.fm/heartbreak</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
