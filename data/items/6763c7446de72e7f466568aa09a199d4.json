We find out from Louis how we went from a tiny town in rural Victoria to competing on the biggest stage in world sport.

Added to this we find out more about his Youth Olympic success in a different sport in 2016 and just why he wants to win a certain ski race in Finland for an amazing prize it brings. It's a great chat that you won't want to miss!</p>",
