  "description": "<p>Embodied Awareness - Embracing Unlived Life - Part 1 (2016-03-09)</p>\n<p>When we disconnect from the aliveness of our body, we are in a trance that prevents us from living and loving fully. These two talks examine our habits of dissociation, and the suffering of “unlived life” that this creates. We then look at how practices of mindfulness and compassion, guided by the acronym RAIN, enable us to re-enter our bodies, and discover the creativity, love and wisdom that naturally flow from embodied awareness.</p>\n<p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http://www.tarabrach.com/donate.html\" target=\"_blank\">www.tarabrach.com/donation/</a></span>.</p>\n<p>With thanks and love, Tara</p>",
