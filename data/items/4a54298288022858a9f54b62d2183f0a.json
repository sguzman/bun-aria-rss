  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, while the establishment claims that Republican candidates are running on the unconstitutional raid at Mar-a-Lago it simply isn't true. Despite much talk about it, candidates must run on their records and against President Biden's. Lamentably, there is no establishment media for the conservative movement so 'We The People' must fight like we're behind, in order to win seats in Congress this November. Then, the media portrays the midterm elections as a national election but not a single candidate will represent the nation. Instead, they will represent individual congressional districts so one should view much of this data as skewed and be skeptical of it. Later, despite the FBI's prior delays they have now reviewed all of Donald Trump's documents in record speed before the court could appoint an independent special master to protect privileged information. This program believes that the Judge should request the names of anyone that reviewed any documents, and their chain of custody, after it was announced on Saturday that the Court was leaning toward appointing a special master. Afterward, the FBI Agent that led the investigation into former President Trump, Tim Thibault, has been escorted from the office. Reports suggest he may have resigned for misleading Merrick Garland and FBI director Christopher Wray regarding the raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago home. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
