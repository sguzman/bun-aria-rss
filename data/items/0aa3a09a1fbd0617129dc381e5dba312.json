  "description": "Commodities are known for epic boom-and-bust cycles… like the one uranium experienced from 2005–2007. But Amir Adnani, CEO of Uranium Energy Corp. and a long-time personal friend, believes we’re seeing something entirely different with the current uranium bull market. For one thing, there’s been a huge shift in focus from fossil fuels to clean energy in recent years… For another, the government has completely changed its attitude—and approach—towards uranium. [44:53] Then, Daniel and I discuss how continued lockdown measures across certain countries could impact the global economy… why Netflix is trading lower despite its solid earnings report… and the bidding war for Kansas City Southern.
