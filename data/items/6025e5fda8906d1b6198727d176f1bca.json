  "description": "<div class=\"libsyn-item-release-date\"><strong>There are some things a senior pastor just can't delegate.</strong></div> <div class=\"libsyn-item-body\"> <p>Leaders are often told they're trying to do too much—and it's usually true. But if you succeed at empowering and developing other leaders, where does that leave you? What are the things <em>only the senior pastor can and should do</em>?</p> <p>In this episode series, Tony and Amy dig deeper into <strong>the most popular topic of all time on this podcast</strong>: the roles a senior pastor just can't delegate.</p> <p>We'll unpack the four areas where senior pastors need to focus their time and energy, especially as they grow their churches beyond 1,000.</p> <p>Part 4 is all about <em>Culture</em>. It really does start at the top of the organization. It is the senior pastor’s responsibility to set the tone for their team and lead the church by example. When done right, not only do you shape the culture of the team, but of the entire church.</p> <p>For the full episode transcript, links mentioned during the show, and to download the Leader Conversation Guide, visit this episode's <a href= \"https://tonymorganlive.com/2019/06/05/culture-champion-church-leadership-episode-96/\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></a> at <strong>theunstuckgroup.com/episode96</strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Join the Live Conversation on Social Media</strong></em></p> <p>If you're listening on Wednesday, when the episode first releases, join the live conversation The Unstuck Group's team will be having on social media about this week's topic.
