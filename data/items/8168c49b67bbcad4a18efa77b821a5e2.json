  "title": "Halee Fischer-Wright, “Back to Balance: The Art, Science, and Business of Medicine” (Disruption Books, 2017)",
  "description": "In this highly engaging, thoroughly persuasive book, Dr. Halee Fischer-Wright presents a unique prescription for fixing America’s health care woes, based on her thirty years of experience as a physician and industry leader. The problem, Fischer-Wright asserts, is that we have lost our focus on strengthening the one thing that has always been at the heart of effective health care: namely, strong relationships between patients and physicians, informed by smart science and enabled by good business, that create the trust necessary to achieve the outcomes we all want. Drawing from personal stories and examples from popular culture, supported by scientific studies and rock-solid logic, Back to Balance: The Art, Science, and Business of Medicine (Disruption Books, 2017) shows how the business and science of medicine are combining to strangle the creative, compassionate, human side of medicine—what Dr. Fischer-Wright calls the “art of medicine.” She then details the three questions necessary to guide us toward true solutions and the five paradigm shifts crucial to bring the art, science, and business of medicine back to balance. . . before it’s too late. Irreverent and funny, steeped in storytelling but allergic to policy-speak, this is a wholly new brand of health care book—one that makes common sense transformational and that will appeal to anyone who has experienced the tribulations and indignities of American health care.\n\n\n\nJeremy Corr is the co-host of the hit Fixing Healthcare podcast along with industry thought leader Dr. Robert Pearl. A University of Iowa history alumnus, Jeremy is curious and passionate about all things healthcare, which means he’s always up for a good discussion!
