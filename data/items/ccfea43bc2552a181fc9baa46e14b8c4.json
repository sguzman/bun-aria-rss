  "description": "<p>ROUND 1: An Iraq war Veteran with Purple Heart tags had his truck stolen right outside his house yesterday and he’ll be joining us to talk about the ordeal because, ope, it was me. While we’re on the topic, ZBT listeners told us what they’ve had stolen from them and we’ll share the best ones with you!\n\nROUND 2: Try as we might, we can’t escape Coronavirus scuttlebutt as it’s had a massive effect on all the branches. Earlier this week SecNav Modly resigned after major d-rama on the USS Roosevelt.\n\nROUND 3: CAREER DAY - Marine welder turned law school student\n\nROUND 4: Steve Carrell has a new show coming out about the Space Force. Will it actually be good or will we have to go into full-out The Code mode on their asses?\n\nROUND 5: Dan Crenshaw\n\nROUND 6: No more brass, trash, or saved rounds, ma’am… The Army & Marine Corps are finally on the verge of dumping brass cased ammo. What will this mean for our beloved police calls??.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
