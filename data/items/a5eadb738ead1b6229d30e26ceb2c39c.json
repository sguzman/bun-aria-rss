  "description": "<p>Some friends gather and smoke at a doorway in a city. There’s Malik, and Johnny Cash, and Lefty, and Jësus. And the poet, Major Jackson. They’ve known each other their whole lives, and they wonder who they’ll turn out to be. In a moment of disclosure, Major tells his friends he wants to be a poet, astonishing them, and himself too it seems. In friendship and ribbing, in desire and teasing, this poem wonders who a person is, and what it means to hope.</p><p>Major Jackson is the author of five books of poetry, including <i>The Absurd Man</i> (2020), <i>Roll Deep</i> (2015), <i>Holding Company</i> (2010), <i>Hoops</i> (2006) and <i>Leaving Saturn</i> (2002), which won the Cave Canem Poetry Prize for a first book of poems. Major Jackson lives in Nashville, Tennessee where he is the Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Chair in the Humanities at Vanderbilt University.
