  "description": "<p>The idea of \"<a href=\"https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/\" target=\"_blank\">1000 true fans</a>\" -- first proposed by Kevin Kelly in 2008 and <a href=\"https://toolsoftitans.com/\" target=\"_blank\">later updated for</a> <i>Tools of Titans </i>-- argued that to be a successful creator, you don’t need millions of customers or clients, but need only thousands of true fans. Such a true, diehard fan \"will buy anything you produce\", and as such, creators can make a living from them as long as they: (1) create enough each year to earn profit from each fan, plus it's easier and better to give existing fans more; (2) have <i>a direct relationship</i> with those fans, which the internet (and long tail) now make possible.</p><p>But patronage models have been around forever; what's new there? How <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/12/19/future-of-web/\" target=\"_blank\">has the web evolved</a>; and <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/01/26/writers-readers-publishers-newsletters-creators-online-thebrowser-substack/\" target=\"_blank\">how are media, and audiences/voices finding and subscribing to each other</a> changing as a result? If the 1000-true-fans concept is also more broadly \"useful to anyone making things, or making things happen\" -- then what nuances do people often miss about it? For instance: That there are also regular fans in the next concentric circle around true fans, and that the most obscure node is only one click away from the most popular node.</p><p>Finally -- when you combine this big idea with another idea Kelly proposed in his most recent book <i>The Inevitable </i>(covered previously on <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/06/07/kevin-kelly-inevitable/\" target=\"_blank\">this episode</a>) on inverting attention economies so audiences monetize their attention vs. the other way around, how do we connect the dots between them and some novel thought experiments? In this hallway-style episode of the a16z Podcast, which Sonal Chokshi recorded with Kevin in our pop-up podcast booth at our <a href=\"https://a16z.com/tag/summit-2019/\" target=\"_blank\">most recent a16z Summit</a>, we discuss all this and more. Because on average, we all currently surrender our attention (whether to TV, books, or whatever) for about $3 an hour. Whoa?!</p><p> </p><p><i>image: </i><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/whatleydude/16260251573/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>whatleydude</i></a><i>/</i><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Flickr</i></a></p>\n",
