  "description": "Frank Holmes, CEO and chief investment officer of U.S. Global Investors (and fan-favorite guest), joins me to discuss everything from travel… to retail investors… to the “central banking cartel” and more... As travel begins to get somewhat back to normal, Frank explains why he’s bullish on airlines. [0:55] We also discuss how the internet has helped retail investors outperform Wall Street... [4:55] Turning to cryptos… Frank gives his take on rumors of more government regulation… and why the “central banking cartel” is attacking crypto and gold. [7:36] Frank is executive chairman and interim CEO of Hive Blockchain, a crypto mining company. He explains why the company is a perfect fit for the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) movement. [11:32] He also shares why, despite government resistance, he believes cryptos are here to stay. [17:41] It’s a perfect environment for higher gold and silver prices. Central banks are printing endless amounts of paper money... inflation continues to rise… and silver is needed to satisfy clean energy demand. Frank explains how shady players can manipulate gold and silver prices… and what gold producers should do to boost their share prices. [19:47] Finally, Frank shares one country he’s bullish on that may surprise you… and a fund that offers an easy way to gain exposure. [25:40] Enjoyed this episode?
