  "description": "<p>Anthony and Gregg are together again to talk about how Gregg is too old to sleep over at a party and Anthony's getting back into standup. Anthony asks how Gregg totally fumbled Mother's Day and gives some advice as to how he should have handled it. Anthony talks about reading and writing comics before getting into some light, airy headlines like a boy hit to death over a cheesecake, a youtube video about Euthanizing a dog going viral, and a woman running over graves and trying to hit people with her car at an ex boyfriend's funeral. Choo choo!</p>",
