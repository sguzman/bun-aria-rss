  "description": "<div>In this week’s Book Club podcast, Sam Leith's guest is the historian Jane Ridley, talking about her new book <em>George V: Never A Dull Moment</em>. She tells him there’s so much more to the 'boring' monarch than shooting grouse and collecting stamps. Hear how he navigated some of the worst constitutional crises in memory, saved the British monarchy as the grand dynasties of Europe started toppling… and then inadvertently imperilled it again by his treatment of his son and heir.</div>\n",
