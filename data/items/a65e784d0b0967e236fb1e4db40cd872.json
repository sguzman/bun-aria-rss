  "description": "<p>January 4, 1989. Emory, Texas. At 12:34 p.m., Debbie Loveless makes a desperate call to 911. Her four-year-old daughter, April Tucker, has a gaping wound in her thigh and a severed femoral artery. April is rushed to the hospital but dies on the operating table. Both Debbie and her common-law husband John Miller tell the sheriff’s office the same thing April told them: The dogs did it. However, investigators think the dogs are harmless and suspect that John and Debbie are in fact responsible for April’s death. What happened to April Tucker? Was she the victim of a rare and vicious dog attack? Or did her stepfather and mother concoct the story to get away with murder?</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
