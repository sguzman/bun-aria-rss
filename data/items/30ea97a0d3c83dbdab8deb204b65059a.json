  "description": "<p>This week, I'm speaking with Mark Weaver and Darrell Wilson of Mark Weaver Associates.</p> <p>Mark Weaver Associates is a full-service design firm based in Los Angeles that was founded in 1970. Since then, they have built an impressive portfolio of work with residential installations, they worked on private aircraft, yachts, and even private island retreats in a vast array of locations from Los Angeles to New York City to London, and also in Italy.</p> <p>Mark has been recognized by a breadth of national and international publications and has earned himself a loyal following of clients from around the world. He regularly lectures at UCLA and is a founding member of both the LA Museum of Contemporary Art and the Institute of Classical Architecture and Art.</p> <p>Darrell is the Principal Designer at Mark Weaver Associates, and they've been working together for the best part of 20 years. His approach to design has been shaped by a wide range of influences from mid-century Italian and French furniture to classical architecture. Darrell's perspective is from very much an architectural background.</p> <p>In this episode, we discuss how Mark and Darrell create long-lasting client relationships that bring regular projects into their business and that last for decades. We also talk about how to navigate the time-based pricing versus value-based pricing conundrum that many architects and designers face in their businesses.
