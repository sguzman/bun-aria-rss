  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, if America isn't careful, we will lose the country to the self-aggrandizing elites that use democracy to destroy democracy and use the law to destroy the law. Our ally Israel is a democracy yet their law enforcement and judicial systems have been politicized to go after political rivals. Israeli police used spyware called Pegasus to spy on Benjamin Netanyahu's family, government colleagues, and journalists covering him before any investigations were even launched. This threat to the civil society is the greatest threat facing us today. Then, the left within the media has embraced Mike Pence for saying that he disagreed with President Trump that he could send the electoral ballots back to the states. The media has inaccurately portrayed this as Pence picking the next president - it's not. It was simply Pence's interpretation of his authority under the Constitution over whether he even had such authority. Later, Convention of States CEO Mark Meckler calls in to discuss a big upcoming vote in South Dakota that needs our support but could be blocked by Republicans that don't want to lose power. Meckler underscored the need for strong leadership to secure the 18 votes needed for a convention of states. Afterward, former Ambassador David Freidman joins the show to discuss his new book, \"Sledgehammer: How Breaking with the Past Brought Peace to the Middle East\". Friedman recalled the antisemitism he faced during his tenure and the uphill battle to bring peace to the middle east region.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
