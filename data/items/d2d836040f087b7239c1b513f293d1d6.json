This week, Sam Adams is joined by Slate’s Television Critic Willa Paskin to spoil Netflix’s hit documentary series Tiger King. The hit series is an increasingly sordid tale of wild characters conning each other out of zoos.

He has a long time feud with Carole Baskin, who runs the nonprofit Big Cat Rescue and is actively trying to shut private zoos down. Will Carole succeed? What happens when Joe tries to hire someone to murder Carole? And when will anyone focus on the questionable conditions forced on the big cats?\n\nYou can read Sam Adams’ review here and his story about the artists behind Joe Exotic’s music here. \n\nYou can read Willa Paskin’s piece about Carole Baskin here. \n\nNote: As the title indicates, this podcast contains spoilers galore.\n\nSlate Plus members get ad-free podcasts and access to exclusive shows like Dana Stevens’ classic movies podcast Flashback.
