    "media:description": "A discussion of grammatical gender in the context of the Romance (Latin-descended) languages, with a specific focus on Italian and Romanian. I also go into the origin of some unusual (within the European context) gender features in these languages.\n\nI'm sorry for my pronunciation, especially of Romanian. I tried with the exact amount of effort required to neither be considered lazy nor be scolded for trying too hard and still failing.\n\n\nSources:\n\nBateman, Nicoleta; Polinsky, Maria. \"Romanian as a Two-Gender Language\"\n\nPetrucci, Peter R. 1993. Slavic features in the history of Romanian. Doctoral dissertation, USC.\n\nRosetti, Alexandru. 1965. Linguistica. The Hague: Mouton.\n\n\nThe film is \"Life of Brian\" by Monty Python. And yes, I'm aware that the clip I showed is technically about conjugations and I was technically talking about declensions: don't bully me, it's a funny *reference*.\n\nWritten and Created by Me\nArt by kvd102\nSpecial thanks to I.M. for all their help with the Romanian and Italian in this video :)\n\n00:00 - L'italiano\n00:20 - Grammatical Gender\n03:00 - Romanian Grammatical Gender\n04:59 - Heterogeneity\n05:53 - Latin Grammar Time\n06:49 - Conclusion\n\nTranslations:\nIcaro Vega - Spanish\npalpatinezw - Standard Mandarin\nLeeuwe van den Heuvel - Dutch",
