  "description": "<p>September 14, 2006. Buchans Junction,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Mark Harshbarger was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed hunting and fishing. He thought he hit the jackpot when he met Mary Beth Kintner. She was also into the outdoors and could shoot better than most men. Their first date was spent fishing, they shot guns at their wedding a year later, then had 2 beautiful children together. Their last family hunting trip would end in horror; Mark was killed. Did Mary Beth shoot him on purpose, or did she really think he was a bear? </p><p>For bonus episodes and outtakes visit: patreon.com/generationwhy</p><p>...Listen ad free with Wondery+.
