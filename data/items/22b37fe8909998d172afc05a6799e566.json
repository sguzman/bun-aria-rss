Usually it&#8217;s done by minimization on manifold &#8211; locally presenting rotation parameter space as linear subspace. The problem with that approach is that initial approximation should be good enough and minimization goes by small steps pojecting/reprojecting on manifold (SO(3) in the case) which can stuck in local minimum. Where to start if the is no initial approximation? Usually it&#8217;s just brute-forced with several initialization attempt. Here in the paper approach is different &#8211; no initial approximation needed, solution is straightforward and minimum is global. The idea is instead of minimizing rotation on the sphere minimize it inside the ball. In fact it&#8217;s a classical <b>convexification</b> approach &#8211; increase dimentionality of the problem to make it convex. The pay is a lot higher computational cost of cause<br />\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3700\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3700</a></p>\n<p><i>A Sparse Outliers Iterative Removal Algorithm to Model the Background in the Video Sequences</i><br />\nBackground removal without nuclear norm.
