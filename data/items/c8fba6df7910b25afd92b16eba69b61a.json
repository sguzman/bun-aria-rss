  "description": "<p>Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including two big pieces of financial news about the XFL -- the cost of season tickets and the average player salary. The country's latest professional football league, which launches in February, is setting its ticket prices on the low end, hoping $20 tickets will lure in new fans. The average player will be paid $55,000 for the season, well below the NFL's $495,000 minimum salary. Also discussed is Nike's decision to shutter the Nike Oregon Project, the exclusive running team operated out of its Oregon headquarters, after coach Alberto Salazar was banned four years for drug violations. Also talked about is the possibility that NFL owners will drastically increase the amount of debt new owners are allowed to take on, expanding the pool of people who can afford teams and possibly creating more bidding wars for franchises in the future. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
