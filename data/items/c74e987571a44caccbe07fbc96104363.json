  "title": "Ep. 898 - Democrats Virtue Signal While The World Burns",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, with war raging in Europe, our leaders here at home are focused on the important things. Namely, outlawing lynching. But isn’t that already illegal? Why does it need to be illegal again? And why are they worried about this? Why now of all times? We’ll sort through that today. Also, there’s so much propaganda flying around about the war in Ukraine that it can be hard to keep things straight or know exactly what’s going on. It’s probably no surprise, though, that the people pushing the propaganda are also the people who want to push our country into a direct armed conflict with Russia. We’ll discuss. And, Democrats try and fail to pass a federal law permanently enshrining Roe, regardless of the Supreme Court’s decision. Plus, Kamala Harris goes off script, Joe Biden can barely walk, and John Oliver makes the case for decriminalizing prostitution across the country. I’ll explain why he’s wrong, and why he’s canceled.  \nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.
