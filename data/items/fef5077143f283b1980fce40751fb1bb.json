  "title": "Myisha Cherry, \"The Case for Rage: Why Anger Is Essential to Anti-Racist Struggle\" (Oxford UP, 2021)",
  "description": "According to a broad consensus among philosophers across the ages, anger is regrettable, counterproductive, and bad. It is something to be overcome or suppressed, something that involves an immoral drive for revenge or a naïve commitment to cosmic justice. Anger is said to involve a corruption of the person – it “eats away” at them, or plunges them into madness.\nMaybe anger has been under-appreciated. Perhaps we have failed to make the right distinctions between different varieties of anger – thereby overlooking kinds that are productive and appropriate. In The Case for Rage: Why Anger is Essential to Anti-Racist Struggle (Oxford University Press 2021), Myisha Cherry argues that we need to give anger a chance. After identifying distinct forms of anger, she defends a kind of anger she calls Lordean Rage, which she argues is central to antiracist social progress.\nRobert Talisse is the W. Alton Jones Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt University.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
