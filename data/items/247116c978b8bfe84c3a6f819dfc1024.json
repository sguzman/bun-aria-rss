  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Mr. Call Screener and ‘This Is America’ podcast host, Rich Valdes fills in for Mark Levin. The competition of good versus evil is more evident today than ever before, and not necessarily Democrat versus Republican. Ronald Reagan and Paul Harvey fought against evil and predicted the problems we face today. Our children and grandchildren are immersed in it, and we need to keep fighting for them and their future. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the radical left are always 10 steps ahead, getting to our children earlier and earlier, making it harder to fight the fire of socialism. Also, the media propaganda can’t even cover for President Biden anymore despite how hard they’ve propped him up. More Americans than ever believe the media’s primary goal is to push their own agenda instead of just telling the news. Mainstream media knows people aren’t accepting their lies anymore and are panicking, like CNN firing hosts and producers to save their image. Democrats always use us as pawns to get to where they want us to go. Later, while our open southern border allows fentanyl to pour into our countries and destroy our communities, Biden and Anthony Fauci are preaching fear and death for the unvaccinated from COVID and the Omicron variant. The only problem is the math isn’t adding up. NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and others want to impede your pursuit of happiness, cutting you out of society unless you obey their mandates.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
