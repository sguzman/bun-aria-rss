  "description": "<p class=\"\">It’s a Jen week this week! We’re reading Bet Me this week, the book many people put right on the top of Best Contemporary Romance lists — one of Jen’s favorite books and a book Sarah liked to tell people she loved but has now discovered she’d never actually read. Minerva and Cal are absolutely terrific, as is this book, and we’re having a rollicking conversation about fat rep, about friendships in romance, about food (Sarah’s love language), about shoes, and about why grown people at little league games are a weird thing.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\">We're big fans of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlylane\">Carly Lane-Perry</a> from <a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/tags/fangrrls\">SyFy Fangirls</a>. We especially like her newsletter, Kissing Books--<a href=\"https://kissingbooks.substack.com/p/its-our-first-installment-of-kissing\">Jen wrote about grandmothers in romance</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Is it criticism if it's all positive?</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2020/05/baby-foot-peel-sold-out.html\">Baby Foot is sold out</a>, but there are lots of <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2020/05/9803818/foot-peel-products\">other terrifying alternatives</a> you can try.</p><p class=\"\">Janet Dailey is famous for <a href=\"https://groundhog-apricot-gbcy.squarespace.com/episodes/2020/5/12/plagiarize\">plagiarizing Nora Roberts</a>. Before that happened, she wrote <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Americana-50-Book/dp/B00WTJNIW2\">the Americana series</a>, with one book set in every state. The one set in Ohio was called <a href=\"https://amzn.to/360ylXl\">The Widow and the Wastrel</a>, and Jen's twitter thread about the book unearthed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1260168185434845184\">several early covers for the book</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Sarah asked if Jenny Crusie is from Ohio? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Crusie\">She is</a>.</p><p class=\"\">This was Sarah's first time reading Bet Me, just like it was Jen's first time reading <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/10/7/s025-gentle-rogue\">Gentle Rogue</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva\">Minerva</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)\">Diana</a> probably wish they weren't named after Roman goddesses.</p><p class=\"\">So: you want to be an <a href=\"https://www.beanactuary.org/what/do/?fa=what-do-we-do\">actuary</a>.
