  "description": "<p>A massive interview coming your way today on Off The Podium as we bring back one of our favourite guests in Canadian ski jumper Ale Loutitt and also welcome her Beijing teammate Matthew Soukup to the show for the first time to chat about their history making bronze medal win at the 2022 Olympics and everything else in between! We find out from both Ale and Matt just how they have recovered since their history making medal win in February and how the reaction has been for both of them since returning home. We also find out all of the emotions and feelings that came from winning the medal and how they were able to deal with all the attention they received afterwards. Added to this we also find out what the future will bring for them both, what free things they have managed to score with their new jewellery and what one thing that came from their bronze that was even better than winning an Olympic medal. It's a flying good time that you won't want to miss!</p>",
