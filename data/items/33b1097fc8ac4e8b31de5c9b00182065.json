  "description": "<p>Avery, Codie & Tony, along with a brief cameo by Jake Wynn of \"Pennsylvania in the Civil War\" & the Clara Barton Missing Soldiers Office, pick up with the second installment of the Spotsylvania Court House trilogy. On this episode, the guys talk about the horrendous scene of combat that took place at the \"Mule Shoe\" Salient at the center of the Confederate line. Between May 12-13, 1864, the Union Army of the Potomac & Confederate Army of Northern Virginia engaged in 22 hours of sustained hand-to-hand combat in the pouring down rain! The guys try to make sense of such a harrowing display of carnage on the battlefield, while keeping calm and carrying on. Enjoy!</p>",
