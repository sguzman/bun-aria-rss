Watch The Full Performance: https://youtu.be/3VB24LYsE60\n\nLyrics\n\nMonday night\nLoud in the road outside\nI saw the gate coming down\nAnd smoke all around\nThe south hill\nThese last days\nCon-men controlled my fate\nNo one is holding the whip\nAnd the oil won't stick\nBut I will\n\nNow that a light is on\nNow that the water runs\nAnd the heartless are nearly gone\nNo time to get it wrong\n\nSunday end\nAche for the sight of friends\nThough I've been safe in the thought\nThat the line we walk\nIs the same one\n\nNow that a light is on\nNow that the water runs\nAnd the heartless are nearly gone\nNo time to get it wrong\n\nSometimes it comes to this, no it's true\nThis time, what comes of it, call it due\nI do\nI do, I do, I do\n\nNow that a light is on\nNow that the water runs\nAnd the heartless are nearly gone\nNo time to get it wrong\n\n\n▶ Official Site: https://fleetfoxes.co\n▶ Facebook: https://facebook.com/FleetFoxes\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/fleetfoxes\n▶ Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3IEvCpy\n▶ Apple: https://apple.co/3dAI4s0\n▶ Store: https://fleetfoxes.ffm.to/officialstore\n\n#fleetfoxes #averylonelysolstice #antirecords",
