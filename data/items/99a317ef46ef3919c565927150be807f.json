  "description": "<p>The last time Kim Jones showed in his hometown was 2003, the year after he graduated from Central Saint Martins. London didn’t really host many menswear presentations in those days. Besides, Kim already had his eye on the bigger picture, so he hightailed to Paris. His homecoming on Thursday, with the launch of his Pre-Fall 2022 collection for Dior Men at the Olympia Exhibition Centre, was, in one way, an appropriately spectacular reflection of everything that’s happened to him since. But it also illuminated the way Jones has managed to weave his own story into the brands — from Dunhill through Louis Vuitton to Dior and Fendi — that he has shaped.    </p> <p>His latest Dior collection is infused with the spirit of the Beat Generation, especially Jack Kerouac and his watershed <em>On the Road</em>. Over the past few years, Jones has been building an extraordinary library of rare books and literary ephemera, and Kerouac features strongly. This boho prince might seem unlikely in the context of a French couture house, but Kerouac was writing while Christian Dior was still working. And the rebel spirit of the Beats inspired the Left Bank of Paris, which sparked Yves Saint Laurent who succeeded Dior at the house. So, it wasn’t so tricky for Jones to winkle out a connection. His ability to do so reminds me of Karl Lagerfeld’s knack for joining the dots between eras, people and places.  </p> <p class=\"p1\"><em>Join</em> <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&int_campaign=podcast-description\"> <em>BoF Professional</em></a><em> for the analysis and advice you need. </em><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial\"><em>Get 30 days for just $1</em></a><em> or </em><a style= \"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?int_campaign=podcast-description&int_content=trial\"><em>explore group subscriptions</em></a><em> for your business.</em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
