  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys record live from 4 World Trade Center in New York City. They break down everything that happened this past weekend and all the marquee games including what it means for the Packers after getting absolutely mollywhopped by the 49ers and what they have to do to get back on the correct course, and why the 49ers might be the scariest team in football. They also break down the Cowboys rough game against the Patriots and why it might have spelled the end of Jason Garrett’s tenure after Jerry Jones’ comments. They also chat about how the Pats might not need to get their offense right in order to win a Super Bowl. Later, Super Bowl Champion, 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, and friend of the show, Josh Sitton’s joins to recap everything that happened this weekend. He breaks down the Packers/49ers game and why he still thinks the NFC championship might go through Green Bay, what teams need to do in order to stop the 49ers pass rush, the best way to neutralize Lamar Jackson and why he would be so fun to block for, and gives his keys for the Packers getting back on the right track (38:27-52:43). Pat and the boys also break down the rest of the NFL slate including Dwayne Haskins winning his first NFL game and missing the final snap to take selfies with fans, the Seahawks potentially being the best team in the NFC, the Saints and Panthers debacle that may have been a direct shot at Sean Payton from Al Riveron and everything else that happened over a crazy NFL weekend. Also, Wednesday night at midnight, EVERYTHING at <a href=\"http://store.patmcafeeshow.com/\">store.patmcafeeshow.com</a> will be 20% off for our Black Friday Sale. Today’s episode is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
