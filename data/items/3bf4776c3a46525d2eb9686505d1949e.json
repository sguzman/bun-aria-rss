If that’s the case the media should do as they say and reveal any and all of their potential conflicts of interest. Finally, former FBI special agent, Terry Albury, pled guilty to leaking classified national defense information. How come James Comey is on a book tour for leaking but Albury is going to prison?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
