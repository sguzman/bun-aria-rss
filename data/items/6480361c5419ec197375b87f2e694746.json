  "title": "Perturbed Gaussian copula: introducing the skew effect in co-dependence",
  "description": "Gaussian copula models are often used in the industry when single-asset information is quoted but little is known about their joint relation. These models may arise from correlated stochastic Brownian processes with deterministic volatility and correlation. If stochastic volatility is introduced, skewness and fat tails can be included in the co-dependence but analytic tractability is lost. Alberto Elices and Jean-Pierre Fouque show how this analytic tractability is preserved through another copula derived from an asymptotic expansion of the correlated processes with stochastic volatility around the Gaussian copula case",
