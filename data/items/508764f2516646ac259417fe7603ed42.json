  "description": "Education has always mattered to Black people. Our enslaved ancestors risked their lives to learn what white oppressors withheld. Because those oppressors understood the important role knowledge of ones history, one's world, and oneself plays in Black liberation. Hundreds of years have gone by, and throughout them all, white supremacy has continued the work of suppressing Black education. So what can we do about it? We're sitting down with Dr. Ivory Toldson to find out. Dr. Toldson is the national director of education, innovation and research for the NAACP and has worked as a professor at Howard University for 16 years. Learning is the path forward -- we first have to challenge those barriers block us from it.\nBHY is produced by PushBlack, the nation's largest non-profit Black media company - hit us up at BlackHistoryYear.com and share this with your people!\nPushBlack exists because we saw we had to take this into our own hands.
