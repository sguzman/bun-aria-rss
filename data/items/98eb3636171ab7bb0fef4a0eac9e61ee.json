  "description": "<p>Monday 6/26 – Today on the show we went straight to what everyone was talking about on social media, and that was the Meek Mill and Safari fight. Moreover, what made it bazar is that now they are both exes to Nicki so why the beef? So we opened up the phone lines to hear if any of our listeners still had beef with their exes ex. Also, it's Monday so it was time for one of our listeners to “Shoot Your Shot” to a crush, and this time Brandon was trying to shoot his shot at a stripper. Also, Charlamagne gave Donkey of the Day to rapper Uglygod because he pulled the \"you don't know who I am\" to a cop. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
