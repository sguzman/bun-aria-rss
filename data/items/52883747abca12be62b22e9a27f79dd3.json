  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing the recent trouble that Adam got into with his YouTube account being suspended over comments made about Covid. They explore the fact that while YouTube's standard is to match the WHO hardline and examine the times that the WHO has been wrong or moved the goalposts on what they consider to be fact at the time. They also discuss Stanford professor Jay Bhattacharya and his struggles to attempt to get information out during the Covid pandemic while being stymied by public health officials at every turn - and Adam harkens back to his very early pandemic obsession with ages. They also discuss the extremes that people go to when discussing subjects like Covid and how insane it makes people appear.\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nLifelock.com Promo Code ADAM\nTrueBill.com/ADS\nAltoIRA.com/ADS\nBlindsGalore.com\nSimpliSafe.com/Adam2",
