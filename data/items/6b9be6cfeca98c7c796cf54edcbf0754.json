  "description": "<p>On another jam-packed episode of <em>Radio Cherry Bombe</em>, Julia Turshen is joined by the couple behind Gordy’s Pickle Jar and the sister-duo behind The New Potato. Since launching Gordy’s in 2011, Sarah Gordon and Sheila Fain & their award winning pickle company have been featured in Esquire, People Magazine, Southern Living, Martha Stewart Living and other notable magazines and blogs. You can find them at Whole Foods Market, Harris Teeter, Mom’s Organic Market, The Fresh Market, West Elm Market and speciality stores across the mid-Atlantic. The New Potato is a food and lifestyle site founded by sisters Danielle & Laura Kosann. The site deals with food and the experience of food in a different way, by broadening the scope of how we see it. From profiling the top restaurateurs of the culinary industry, to featuring the arbiters of other industries and their roadmap to the world of food and style, this breakout site covers a newer, far more extensive palate of tastes and trends.
