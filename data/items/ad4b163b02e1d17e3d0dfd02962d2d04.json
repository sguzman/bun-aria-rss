Watch The Full Performance: https://youtu.be/3VB24LYsE60\n\nLyrics\n\nAll this time I've been hanging on\nTo an edge I caught when we both were young\nThat the world I won wasn't near enough\nAlways distant, always all\nIn all that war, I'd forgotten how\nMany men might die for what I'd renounced\nI was staging life as a battleground\nNo, I let that grasping fall\n\nMay the last long year be forgiven\nAll that war left within it\nI couldn't, though I'm beginning to\nAnd we've only made it together\nFeel some change in the weather\nI couldn't, though I'm beginning to\n\nAnd though it's all so uncertain, cold\nAll the rafters cracked, all the copper sold\nThere's a ration back in a manifold\nIf you need it or forgot\n\nMay the last long year be forgiven\nAll that war left within it\nI couldn't, though I'm beginning to\nAnd we've only made it together\nFeel some change in the weather\nI couldn't, though I'm beginning to\n\nAnd somehow I see\nIt's free\n\nAnd with love and hate in the balance\nOne last way past the malice\nOne warm day's all I really need\nAnd with love and hate in the balance\nOne last way past the malice\nOne warm day is all I really need\n\n▶ Official Site: https://fleetfoxes.co\n▶ Facebook: https://facebook.com/FleetFoxes\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/fleetfoxes\n▶ Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3IEvCpy\n▶ Apple: https://apple.co/3dAI4s0\n▶ Store: https://fleetfoxes.ffm.to/officialstore\n\n#fleetfoxes #averylonelysolstice #antirecords",
