  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrat party has a permanent mob that is available to them on-demand. Now, a group of protesters known as \"Ruth Sent Us\" is offering to pay for protesters to go and protest outside the homes of six US Supreme Court Justices. Democrats have embraced violence and intimidation since their inception. In 1927, French essayist Julien Benda wrote \"The Treason of the Intellectuals\" (The Great Betrayal) and denounced those who betray truth and justice for racial and political considerations as moral traitors. Whether it's attacking police officers, Trump supporters, or now-Supreme Court Justices, this is what Democrats are doing to America today. Then, Nancy Pelosi says Republicans are doing violence against women's rights but in fact, the violence is being done to the baby in the womb. Interestingly Democrats won't stop discussing women now when just a few weeks ago they refused to even define what a woman even was. Yet Republicans are defending female athletes from trans men taking their opportunities and fighting to keep women out of the military draft. Later, immigration and bad economic policy debased the US Dollar while hundreds of millions in federal covid spending have gone to Democrat states and our country is dwindling as a result - is that what America wants? Crime is on the rise and violence abounds - is this what America wants? Democrats are centralizing and nationalizing elections by eliminating voter ID will ensure fraud - is this what the American people want? Afterward, author Bill O'Reilly calls in to discuss his new book \"Killing the Killers: The Secret War Against Terrorists\" which focuses on the elimination of evil across the globe. \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Killing-Killers-Against-Terrorists-OReillys/dp/1250279259/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1651691996&refinements=p_27%3ABill+O%27Reilly&s=books&sr=1-1\nLearn more about your ad choices.
