  "description": "In today's podcast we learn about the FBIs' arrest of an NSA contract worker—classified material was found in his home and vehicle. TalkTalk gets a record fine—£400,000, which comes to a hundred thousand hackerweight—for its 2015 data breach. Yahoo! email surveillance allegations amount to a story that's still murky and anonymously sourced. The Johns Hopkins University's Joe Carrigan stops by to discuss local vs cloud storage. Peder Muller from Novetta previews his upcoming presentation on Bitcoin and Blockchain. And the AUSA Meeting and Exposition closed yesterday with a look at 2030, warnings of Russian information operations, and considerations of how the US Government can keep pace with industry innovation.",
