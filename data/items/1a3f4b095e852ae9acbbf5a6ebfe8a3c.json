  "description": "Thank you so much for tuning in for another episode of Tin Foil Hat with Sam Tripoli.  This episode we welcome UFC Hall Of Famer and Soil Conservationist Pat Miletich to the show to discuss his crusade to save our soil, to help people learn the importance of proper nutrition, we also discuss cultural marxism, the mainstream media and how change comes from within. Then after we let Pat go we decide to call up James Duryea to the show to discuss a creepy twitter thread about Jim Carrey.  This was a banger of an episode. <br /><br />Want To See Sam Tripoli Live?
