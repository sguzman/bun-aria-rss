    "media:description": "You are looking at the Burning Ship fractal, except it is very very stretched, skewed and rotated.  Stretching certain areas of the Burning Ship reveals interesting Mandelbrot like features that have been hidden.  I've also used a bit of noise-based creative colouring in this one.  This video is full of Earth colours.\n\nThis video is running at half the usual speed because otherwise YouTube compression would destroy it. It is kind of relaxing this way though.  Put this one on your TV and let it roll away in the background.\n\nIf you like this kind of thing, then let me know.  \n\nThank-you to my supporters on Patreon.  I'll have the high quality downloads available for you shortly.\n\nThis video will be available for Patreons to download in the coming days, which will have a higher bitrate.  You can also use these visuals on your own channel if you are a member of my Patreon page. https://www.patreon.com/mathstown\n\n/********************************************************************************\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/mathstown (Support, Downloads & Usage Rights)\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MathsTown\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/YphYVt787v (Drop by and say hello)\nGrab a T-Shirt: https://amzn.to/3eIfqmX\nWebsite: https://www.maths.town\n********************************************************************************/\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/ekoiev/\n\n#BurningShip #fractal #mathstown #fractals",
