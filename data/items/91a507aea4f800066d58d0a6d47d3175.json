Traditionally some of the\nsuccessful methods have been derived based on a careful consideration\nof the particular imaging modality and task, or on an adhoc basis by\nimage processing practitioners. More recently statistical machine\nlearning models have been proposed for tasks such as denoising,\ndeblurring, inpainting, etc., often leading to significant gains in\nimage quality. Machine learning methods require training data to learn\nabout the image statistics and the task, and challenges arise in how\nthis data should be collected and how ground truth is obtained.</p>\n<p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from the\nimage processing and machine learning community to discuss all issues\nrelated to machine learning models for image processing applications.</p>\n<p>We invite submission of papers on relevant topics including, but not\nlimited to the following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Statistical modelling of image processing tasks</li>\n<li>Runtime and data efficiency</li>\n<li>Tractable estimation</li>\n<li>Deep learning for image processing applications</li>\n<li>Procedures to obtain ground truth data sets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In all aspects the ICCV community has been at the forefront of developing\nnew ideas and we hope to continue this development through this workshop.</p>\n<h3>Keynote Speakers</h3>\n<p>Join us for an exciting program including invited talks by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~milanfar/\">Peyman Milanfar</a>, Google</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/vi_people/sroth/sroth.en.jsp\">Stefan Roth</a>, TU Darmstadt</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Important Dates</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Submission deadline: Friday, September 25th, 2015</li>\n<li>Author Notification: Friday, October 16th, 2015</li>\n<li>Final version of submission: Friday, October 23rd, 2015</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Papers should be in ICCV style</li>\n<li>Maximum paper length is 6 pages</li>\n<li>Papers will be reviewed in a double blind process</li>\n<li>Accepted papers are not published as part of IEEE Proceedings but\n  inofficially on the workshop website</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accepted papers will be presented at the poster session with an\nadditional poster spotlight presentation. One author of every accepted\npaper has to attend the workshop to present poster and spotlight talk.</p>\n<h3>Organizers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sebastian Nowozin, Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK</li>\n<li>Michael Hirsch, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Germany</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please find further details at the <a href=\"http://ml4ip-iccv2015.is.tuebingen.mpg.de\">workshop\nwebsite</a> or send me an email in\ncase you have any questions.</p>",
