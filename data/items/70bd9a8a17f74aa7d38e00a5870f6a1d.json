Yusko is a seasoned investor in both traditional and crypto finance, and is the managing partner of Morgan Creek Capital. Notably, he is also an avid fan of Pokemon Go. In this episode, Mark provides a deep and logical basis for a sound decision matrix in the world of investing. He emphasizes broad narrative context, addressing themes reminiscent of our episode with historian Joshua Rosenthal on 'The Crypto Renaissance.'</p> <p>Mark explores the speculative frenzy in the markets and how it is indicative of a fiat-based financial system that has run its course. Continuous printing has gameified the economy, and crony capitalism has created an environment where you are either in or you're out. If you're in, then you're an incumbent who is incentivized to maintain the status quo. The centralization of power makes progress hard and proper equity even harder.</p> <p>As a long-term investor who prioritizes values & principles, Mark discusses money as a shared illusion, and notes that value is relative. He presents salient takes on crypto's role in the broad shifts driven by the inevitable failing of incumbent institutions. His worldview feels compatible with the Bankless narrative, and towards the end of the episode, we discuss how Ethereum fits into all of this.</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Mark on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/MarkYusko?s=20\">https://twitter.com/MarkYusko?s=20</a> </p> <p>Morgan Creek Capital:<br /> <a href= \"https://www.morgancreekcap.com/\">https://www.morgancreekcap.com/</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
