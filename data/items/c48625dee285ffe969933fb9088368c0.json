  "description": "<p>Newport, Rhode Island has been the summer playground for Presidents like Eisenhower and Kennedy and also for the rich, which is evident in the many mansions that dot the seaside town. Some of these mansions date back to the Colonial Era. The Cliffside Inn is one of the mansions here and today it serves as a bed and breakfast. The most notable family to live at the Cliffside Inn is the Turner Family and they have an unusual and interesting history. Although the Turner Family is long gone, it would seem that their spirits have remained with the home that was so much a part of their life. Today, we are joined by our listener Suzy Duhme to get her first hand account of the Cliffside Inn and some of the spooky experiences she and her friends have had! The Moment in Oddity is by Lisa Nielsen and features the Wooden Doll of Egeskov and This Day in History is by April Rogers-Krick and features Amelia Earhart crossing the North Atlantic.</p> <p>Check out thwe website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/06/hgb-ep-131-cliffside-inn.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/06/hgb-ep-131-cliffside-inn.html</a></p> <p>Become and Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
