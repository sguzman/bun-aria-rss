  "description": "<p>Apologies for my weak voice today! Remnant of a second bout with Covid. Had to drink several cups of hot tea and honey, and take numerous breaks to at least sound somewhat understandable. <br /><br />Today, we look into how Germany dealt with the Holocaust once it was over. And how occupying powers, including the US and the Soviet Union, dealt with it as well. Who do you punish when millions have been complicit in some way(s) in committing one of the greatest atrocities in human history? We also look at holocaust denial. What evidence can deniers possibly point to to prove their claims that the holocaust either never happened, or didn't happen to the degree that mainstream (actual) historian's claim? <br /><br /><strong>Bad Magic Productions Monthly Patreon Donation</strong>:  The Bad Magic Charity for May is the HALO Dental Network.
