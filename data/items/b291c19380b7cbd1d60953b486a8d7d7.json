  "description": "The cost of borrowing U.S. dollars through foreign exchange (FX) swap markets increased \nsignificantly at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in February 2020, indicated by \nlarger deviations from covered interest rate parity (CIP). CIP deviations narrowed again when \nthe Federal Reserve expanded its swap lines to support U.S. dollar liquidity globally—\nby enhancing and extending its swap facility with foreign central banks and introducing the \nnew temporary Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) repurchase agreement \nfacility for foreign and international monetary authorities. Recent research by Meisenzahl, \nNiepmann, and Schmidt-Eisenlohr (2020) shows how wider CIP deviations result in higher \nborrowing costs for U.S. corporations in the leveraged loan market. In this article, we discuss \nthis finding, which suggests that, besides other channels, the Federal Reserve’s initiatives \nto provide global U.S. dollar liquidity contributed to easier financial conditions for U.S. \ncorporate borrowers.",
