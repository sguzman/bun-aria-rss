  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, The New York Times exposed a secret cabal of FBI agents who used flimsy information to investigate President Trump’s campaign in 2016, code-named Crossfire Hurricane. The Obama administration started their coup attempt against President Trump months before the election as a failsafe in case Trump won. The FBI would never conduct a secret investigation of a Democrat candidate, yet Loretta Lynch’s Department of Justice and James Comey’s FBI engaged in Soviet-style surveillance tactics of Trump and his campaign with no hard evidence. This is a scandal the likes of which this nation has never seen before, and it’s constantly being obstructed by Democrats and covered up by the media. Also, the official position of the Department of Justice is that you cannot indict a sitting president. Robert Mueller’s investigation has been about impeaching Trump since day one, serving the interests of the Democrat party while renegade Republicans protect Mueller. The Constitution is Trump’s best friend, and he needs to wrap himself in it to protect the office of the President. Finally, Mark speaks with Bret Baier about his new book, Three Days in Moscow: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of the Soviet Empire.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
