  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever heard of a 30-day self-sufficiency challenge? On today's podcast, I'm talking with Carl who, for 30 days, ate only foods he could either grow or source from his own property, or locally to where he lives. This included everything from beverages, fats, seasonings, and more! He even traveled to the ocean to harvest his own sea salt for the challenge! If you’ve wanted to rely less on the grocery store, this is an interview to listen to! For all of the show notes and links, visit https://melissaknorris.com/341</span></p>",
