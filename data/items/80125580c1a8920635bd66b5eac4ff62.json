  "description": "<p>We were joined by guest Tommy Pappas of the TKOK Podcast network to discuss the whereabouts of: Blackfyre, Dark Sister, Brightroar, the crown of Aegon the Conqueror and quite a few others. We'll also discuss how and why they might return to the fold... and the pages of ASOIAF.<br>\n<br>\nAs Euron and Melisandre are wont to tell us, power itself flows from the trappings of power, and there's really nothing like carrying Valyrian steel at your hip (or on your head). Just ask Tywin Lannister, it took him some 30 plus years to get his hands on some, and he didn't exactly play fair.
