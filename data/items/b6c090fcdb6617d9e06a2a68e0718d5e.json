  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Jussie Smollett’s attacker has been sentenced to jail time. But the sentence was still too light, as Smollett’s insane behavior in the courtroom demonstrated. Also, our Big Tech overlords have gotten together and decided that actually it’s okay for you to call for the murder of certain people, depending on their nationality and ethnicity. Nothing troubling about that. Plus, Kaepernick compared the NFL to slavery a few months ago, and now he says he still wants to play in the NFL. And Rihanna is pregnant and speaking eloquently about the beauty of pregnancy and the preciousness of unborn life, which seems to contradict her previous pro-abortion activism. This is pretty common with pro-abortion celebrities. And a new poll says that Americans are under an “unprecedented” level of stress. Is that true? Are we more stressed out than anyone else in history? Is life that hard? Or do we just see it that way?\nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.
