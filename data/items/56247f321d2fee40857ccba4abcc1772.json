  "description": "Angkarn Kallayanapong (1926-2012) was arguably Thailand’s most famous poet of the modern period. His career spanned the era from the 1940s to the 1980s when Thai society was fundamentally transformed by rapid economic development and the process of globalization. His poetry is a testament to the massive disruption, dislocation, and alienation caused by these changes, and a lament for cultural loss. As Arnika Fuhrmann argues in her new book, Teardrops of Time: Buddhist Aesthetics in the Poetry of Angkarn Kallayanapong (SUNY Press, 2020), Angkarn employed a distinctly Buddhist aesthetics to express these ideas. But Angkarn also has a claim to being a poet of global significance. The famous American “beat poet”, Allen Ginsberg - whose poetry was also influenced by Buddhism - once met Angkarn and translated and published three of his poems.\nPatrick Jory teaches Southeast Asian History in the School of Historical and Philosophical Inquiry at the University of Queensland.
