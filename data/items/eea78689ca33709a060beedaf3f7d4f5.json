  "title": "Lessons Learned (with Nicholas Wilton) [53]",
  "description": "<p>This week American artist Nicholas Wilton returns to discuss the question: \"what do you wish you had known 10 years ago?\" Our discussion ranges from materials and brushes, to deeper more personal realisations, including tough lessons about authenticity, the need to find your own process, and the importance of relaxing into who are you really are.</p>\n<p>We also discuss our experiences as teachers and the lessons we have watched our students learn and Nick shares a particularly challenging experience he had as an emerging artist. It is always inspiring to discover that all artists experience the same highs and lows and that we make many of the same mistakes. As you listen to this conversation, it will become apparent that you are never alone ... your struggles are the same as ours, your triumphs feel the same as ours ... we are all on the same path and we can all offer a helping hand to anyone who is behind us.</p>\n<p>Finally, we share our plans to do just that by building a supportive community in a Facebook pop-up group. You won't want to miss this!</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Art2Life free workshop: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/art2life2020\">https://bit.ly/art2life2020</a></p>\n<p>Juiced Up Workshop Buddies 2020 (Facebook group): <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/juicedupbuddies/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/juicedupbuddies/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>or Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><em><br>\n\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
