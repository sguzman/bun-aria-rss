  "title": "Remaining Offseason Priorities: Raiders should keep the phone lines open while Jaguars should find a real tight end (Football 6/10)",
  "description": "Teams have been making moves since the season ended and while most situations look set, priorities remain for each organization. On this episode, Will Brinson is joined by Tyler Sullivan to break down some of those priorities. The Raiders basically need to keep their options open and be ready to attract stars that might become available to Vegas. The Patriots made their presence known in free agency and selected a quarterback in the first round of the draft. Now, they just have to get Mac Jones ready for action. Sure, the Jaguars added Tim Tebow to much fanfare, but how about targeting someone who has actually played the tight end position? Brinson and Sully also discuss quarterback priorities for the Saints, Ravens and Bills. For New Orleans, it's all about figuring out a starter. For Baltimore and Buffalo it's about solidifying extensions for their franchise guys. \n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
