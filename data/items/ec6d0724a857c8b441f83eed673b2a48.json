Pessoa wrote in his own name but mainly in the names of characters he created, each with a distinctive voice and biography, which he called heteronyms rather than pseudonyms, notably Ricardo Reis, Alberto Caeiro, Álvaro de Campos and one who was closer to Pessoa's own identity, Bernardo Soares. Most of Pessoa's works were unpublished at his death, discovered in a trunk; as more and more was printed and translated, his fame and status grew.\n\nWith\n\nCláudia Pazos-Alonso\nProfessor of Portuguese and Gender Studies and Senior Research Fellow at Wadham College, University of Oxford\n\nJuliet Perkins\nVisiting Senior Research Fellow in Portuguese Studies at King’s College London\n\nAnd\n\nPaulo de Medeiros\nProfessor of English and Comparative Literary Studies at the University of Warwick\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
