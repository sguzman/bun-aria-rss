They literally had black classrooms and white classrooms. Plus, Larry Elder is running for governor of California. He’s a reliable conservative, very outspoken, which is why his answer about trans bathrooms was surprising. And the health chief down in Australia has warned the people of that country that they must avoid all conversation in public, because conversation can be deadly. I hate small talk as much as the next guy, but this seems to be overboard. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
