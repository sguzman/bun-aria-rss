  "description": "<p>LiDAR sensors provide rich 3D information about their surrounding and are\nbecoming increasingly important for autonomous vehicles tasks, such as semantic\nsegmentation, object detection, and tracking. Simulating a LiDAR sensor\naccelerates the testing, validation, and deployment of autonomous vehicles,\nwhile reducing the cost and eliminating the risks of testing in real-world\nscenarios. We address the problem of high-fidelity LiDAR simulation and present\na pipeline that leverages real-world point clouds acquired by mobile mapping\nsystems. Point-based geometry representations, more specifically splats, have\nproven their ability to accurately model the underlying surface in very large\npoint clouds. We introduce an adaptive splats generation method that accurately\nmodels the underlying 3D geometry, especially for thin structures. Moreover, we\nintroduce a physics-based, faster-than-real-time LiDAR simulator, in the\nsplatted model, leveraging the GPU parallel architecture with an acceleration\nstructure, while focusing on efficiently handling large point clouds. We test\nour LiDAR simulation in real-world conditions, showing qualitative and\nquantitative results compared to basic splatting and meshing techniques,\ndemonstrating the interest of our modeling technique.\n</p>",
