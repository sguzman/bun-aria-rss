  "title": "Treat yourself: Arty gift ideas to brighten your holiday [143]",
  "description": "<p>With only 6 weeks until Christmas, we're talking gifts. But we're not focusing on what you can sell - we're interested in what you can ask for. So we spent some time thinking and came up with a suggested Christmas list to help you drop heavy hints this year. Our list includes small surprises such as new paint colours or a special brush, all the way to high-price courses or artworks. But we also suggest some ideas you may not have considered - including ways in which your family and friends could give you the gift of time. Along the way, you'll get a sneak peek into our own Christmases, including Alice's frugal approach to gifts and Louise's tendency to ask for books she ever reads. We hope this episode inspires you to brighten your own Christmas by asking for something that will inspire you - and maybe even jumpstart a new phase of your art.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>\"Unquiet Landscape,\" Christopher Never <a href=\"\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Unquiet-Landscape-20th-Century-British-Painting/dp/0500295476/</a></p>\n<p>\"Why Your Five Year Old Could NOT Have Done That,\" Susie Hodge <a href=\"\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Your-Five-Year-Could-Have/dp/0500290474</a></p>\n<p>Kyle Cease on Youtube <a href=\"\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLCjITkn87w</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/gift/\"><u>https://alicesheridan.com/gift/</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"\"><u>https://www.louisefletcherart.com/shop/gift-certificates</u></a></p>\n<p>Alice's Connected Artist Waiting List <a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/artists/\"><u>https://alicesheridan.com/artists/</u></a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
