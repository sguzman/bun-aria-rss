  "description": "<p>r/AmITheA**hole In today's episode, OP is in a truly sticky situation. Her parents stole her identity and used it to open credit cards and accounts in her name, but then never paid off any of the bills. Her credit is completely ruined, and now a company filed a lawsuit against her because they think that she owes them money.
