  "description": "The S&P 500 is off to its worst start in history.   Oil prices are near 12-year lows, the biotech sector is in freefall, and market leading stocks like Netflix, Facebook and Google are breaking down. The global markets are also falling. \nFor investors, there is no shortage of negative news right now.  Most of this is \"noise\" being created by financial media outlets.  And this noise leads to fear and sometimes irrational decisions by investors. \nThat's why host Frank Curzio created this special \"survival guide\" podcast. During this show, Frank will tell you where he thinks the markets are headed.   He will also provide ways for investors to hedge their portfolios against a further pullback in stocks.\nMore important, Frank explains how investors can take advantage of this market weakness.  This includes a list of sectors and stocks to buy on a further pullback in the markets. This is a must listened-to Podcast for anyone who owns stocks - or plans to own stocks in the future.",
