  "description": "<p>A listener writes “Hi Wes, I’ll admit I feel awkward sending this e-mail as the people I’ve told have mocked me.</p> <p>Anyway here goes. I grew up on a farm in southern Maryland and we had over a hundred of acres of mostly wooded land. Our property was adjacent to other large swaths of heavily wooded acreage.<br /> To cut to the chase, I was an avid hunter growing up. So much that during my teens I’d go squirrel hunting daily after getting home from school.</p> <p>One afternoon in October I went out alone. I was 16. However this time I decided to go further into the woods. As I hiked along my mind was somewhere else until I noticed I was in a part of the woods I’d never been to. I was surrounded by old growth trees and the terrain was rolling hills. I looked down into the bottom of this hollow and saw large grove of laurel. I slowly made my way down and suddenly was overcome with a heavy feeling of dread and that I was being watched. So much that I froze and began to look around expecting to see another person but didn’t.</p> <p>This fear kept growing to the point that I felt terror for lack of a better word. Without notice I saw movement in the laurel. Footfalls and branch snapping.</p> <p>I called out that I wasn’t alone hoping that whoever was in there would stop trying to scare me.<br /> The footfalls stopped but my fear was still high. I was armed with a Ruger 77/22 bolt action rifle. I leveled the rifle at the laurel and again called out for whoever was in there to know I wasn’t alone.<br /> Then a chattering almost laughter came from the laurel bushes. It was so weird, it sounded like a cackle. Filled with fear I fired my rifle above the laurel.</p> <p>Then all hell broke lose. The laughter became a growl. And the laurel was crashing. I could see that from the top of the bushes that it was coming towards me.</p> <p>I again called out and again fired. It didn’t stop.</p> <p>I turned and ran up the slope. Now I should mention that it was dusk, the light was going fast and by how far I’d gone I wouldn’t get back to my house until after dark.</p> <p>When I crested the top of the hill I looked back and saw something hairy step out of the laurel and look up at me. Now as I write this I’m getting a chill up my spine.</p> <p>I can still see it looking at me.</p> <p>I cycled the bolt on the rifle and fired at it. I missed as it didn’t respond, it stepped fully out and stood up. Whatever it was wasn’t huge it was about five to six feet tall. I know, it doesn’t sound like a Bigfoot but it had wide shoulders, long arms and covered in hair.</p> <p>I took off as fast as I could, I was in a panic, I kept falling down and tripping. I was getting shredded by branches hitting my face but I didn’t care. I could hear whatever it was chasing me. It was barreling through the woods but not directing behind me. What’s odd is it seemed to be running parallel to me.<br /> After 15 minutes I could see the lights of my house through the trees and this thing was still running near me. The issue I had was that if I turned right to head to the trail to go to my house I’d encounter this thing, so I passed the trail and headed around the trail and out into the field.<br /> When I was in the field, I was screaming for my family, I turned and cycled the bolt and fired into the woods again. It was dark now completely.</p> <p>I listened but heard nothing but I could sense it was still there. I ran to the house and went inside.<br /> When I encountered my mom I was crying and covered in blood from all the cuts and slashes in my face.<br /> My older brother grabbed a shotgun and went out, I followed him with a fully loaded rifle. And it should be said this was against my mother’s wishes.</p> <p>We both fired into the woods, and yelled at whatever it was.</p> <p>I never encountered it again and I didn’t go hunting by myself ever again.</p> <p>My mother didn’t believe me, she thought it was probably a black bear and my other siblings made fun of me. However my grandmother who lived in a house on the farm for 55 years told me she’d seen stuff years before and even had seen lights above the forest years back.</p> <p>Even if I never talk to you, it feels good to get this off my chest.”</p>",
