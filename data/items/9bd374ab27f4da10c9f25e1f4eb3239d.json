  "description": "<p>In the 15th episode, the gents finally land a current NHL player as a guest and he ain't no pigeon. Dot Rat Kevin Hayes of the New York Rangers pops by and shows us his inner Masshole with some hilarious Super Bowl thoughts. He also gives his candid thoughts on life in NYC, recruiting his boy Jimmy Vesey to Manhattan, and whether Auntie JoAnne has caused any scenes at MSG yet. Great stuff from Hayesy. The fellas also discuss the Marchand slew foot, the All-Star game, mid-season awards, and answer #AlrightHamilton questions from listeners. Rear Ad also chimes in with a couple of things he's watching.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
