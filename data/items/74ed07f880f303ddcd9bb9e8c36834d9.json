  "description": "<p>Being located at the tip of one point of the Bermuda Triangle, it's not surprising that Puerto Rico has some strange legends, disappearances and hauntings. The island is today a United States territory, but for years it was under Spanish rule. This is a place with a vibrant culture mixing Afro-Caribbean, Spanish and American influences. On this episode we explore the history of the island and several of the haunted locations on Puerto Rico. The Moment in Oddity features talking mushrooms and This Month in History features James Smithson establishing the Smithsonian Institute. Our location was suggested by Kelly Crews.</p> <p>This episode sponsored by Best Fiends!
