  "description": "<p>With a bustling interior design business, a popular Dallas showroom, and a product line sold all over the country, <strong>Jan Showers</strong> wears many hats. She’s also a champion of the Texas design scene—this year she co-chaired the second annual Kips Bay Showhouse in Dallas, which just wrapped last month. Recently Showers made a big decision—to pull her line out of showrooms and go direct to designers. On this episode of the show, she talks with host Dennis Scully about what that change says about the industry, why Texas is a first-tier market now, and how she learned never to try and sell something she doesn’t love herself.  </p><p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"www.bensoleimani.com\">Ben Soleimani</a> and <a href=\"www.onsidedoor.com\">SideDoor</a></p><p>LINKS<br /><a href=\"www.janshowers.com\">Jan Showers</a><br /><a href=\"www.instagram.com/dennisscully\">Dennis Scully</a><br /><a href=\"www.businessofhome.com\">Business of Home</a></p><p> </p>\n",
