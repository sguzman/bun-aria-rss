  "description": "<p>What do we know about this week? We know that this week, we are breaking down Grief Counseling. We start this episode with some real life bird trouble, and we get some special audio treats from Mindy Kaling and the episode writer herself, Jen Celotta. Then we dig into chip rankings, we clear up a fan theory around Ed Trucks death, and we find out who's been moving the conference table. Finally, we get a writer's room deep dive on Dwights absorbed twin speech, and Jenna learns to not touch melons in France. Amen!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Audio excerpt courtesy Penguin Random House Audio from Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?
