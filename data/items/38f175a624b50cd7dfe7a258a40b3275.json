  "description": "<p>What do psychologists really think about your <strong>dreams</strong> – <strong>do they have meaning</strong>? In this episode I talk about what psychologists think today about dreams. You probably know that Freud thought that dreams had a <strong>manifest content</strong> (the people and things that happened in the dream that you remember) and a <strong>latent content</strong> (the unconscious meaning of the dream). Do we still think this? Also: can you look up in a book or online to find out what your dreams meant? If you dream about a cat for example – what does this mean? In this episode I explore these questions with author and psychoanalyst <strong>Kerry Malawista</strong>. She and her colleagues discuss this topic in their book, <strong>Wearing My Tutu To Analysis</strong>. I’ll talk to her and include my own thoughts about whether or not dreams have meaning and whether you should be taking the time to analyze them.</p>",
