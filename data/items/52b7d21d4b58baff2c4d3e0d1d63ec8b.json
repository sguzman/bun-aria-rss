  "title": "NFL Divisional Round Sunday Recap: Bucs beat Saints, Chiefs top Browns to advance to conference championship (Football 1/18)",
  "description": "The final four in the NFL is set. Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson and John Breech to recap the action from Sunday as we potentially saw the final game from a legend and another star QB forced to leave the game due to concussion protocol. First, the guys analyze and react to the Bucs 30-20 victory over the Saints (4:45). Drew Brees likely will retire and unfortunately for him, his career will end on a sour note. It was a disappointing effort from Brees who was outplayed by Jameis Winston (who we got just 1 dose of). On the flip side, Tom Brady is somehow back in a championship game, but for the first time in the NFC. The Pick Six Superfriends break down how Tampa got here and discuss their chances vs. the Packers next weekend. Then, a game filled with interesting calls. The Chiefs topped the Browns 22-17 despite not having Patrick Mahomes for a decent portion of the second half (27:15). Chad Henne stepped in in relief and made a huge mistake, but made up for it with a few plays to ice the game. But before we got to that point, there were several controversial moments that deserve our attention. Brinson, Wilson and Breech debate the fumble resulting in a touchback from Rashard Higgins and the hit that preceded it from Daniel Sorensen. Should targeting have been called? How silly is the touchback rule? Get ready for some intense back-and-forth on the subject. The crew proceeds to the end of the game, where Kevin Stefanski's decision to punt with under 5 minutes is called into question, but Andy Reid's decisions are not. All the credit to Reid for designing an excellent play and the Kansas City offense for executing it. We offer a brief lookahead to Bills-Chiefs before dishing out winners & losers from Sunday. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
