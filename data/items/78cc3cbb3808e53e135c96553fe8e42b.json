  "description": "<p>Good morning and welcome to the ride! Steve gives a special thank you to all in The State of Georgia that registered and voted!!! It was seen that Capitol Police led domestic terrorists into the Capitol building. Selfies and weed smoking apparently was permitted. Our boy from California calls in and shows his recovery skills. A group of angry Trump supporters attacked a Black woman in Downtown Los Angeles and police did not do enough. Trump made it back to Twitter and clearly displayed that he suffers from Pinocchio syndrome. Junior was sad to report that Assistant Coach Chris Malone from University of Tennessee at Chattanooga made some abhorrent remarks about Stacey Abrams. \"The Juice\" shares his opinion about the domestic terror attack on the capitol. Our very own Shirley Strawberry wishes her husband a Happy Birthday and a huge congratulations goes out to them as a couple for their 6th wedding anniversary. Today in Closing Remarks, Steve reminds Black men to take better care of our Black women. Have a great weekend!!!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
