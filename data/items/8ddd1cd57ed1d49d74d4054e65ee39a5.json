  "description": "<p>The Good Morning Football Podcast begins examining which quarterbacks are the most under pressure in 2022. Hosts Rachel Bonnetta, Tom Pelissero, Darius Butler and Adam Rank explain why they think Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Tua Tagovailoa and Zach Wilson are under the most pressure and then they discuss if Davante Adams or Tyreek Hill will have the better fantasy season. Later, Adam Rank provides a 3-step plan for the Arizona Cardinals to take a leap in the NFC West, Tom Pelissero shares how the Los Angeles Rams can prevent a Super Bowl hangover, Darius Butler gives his insights on how the San Francisco 49ers can fix their problems and Rachel Bonnetta makes three suggestions to the Seattle Seahawks, which includes winning in week-1.
