  "description": "<p>YOU TEACH OTHERS HOW TO TREAT YOU. Often, we don’t like how people talk to us. Whether it’s at home, at work, or with our friends, there are many times where we don’t get the respect we desire. It feels terrible. But how much ownership do we take of those situations? Here’s the truth- you get what you put up with. Unless you’re willing to set boundaries and tell people what’s not ok, you’ll end up being walked over. If you keep showing up, people will assume that it isn’t that bad. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about what it takes to stand up for the things you believe with an actor-turned-activist: Sophia Bush. Sophia Bush starred as Brooke Davis in The WB/CW drama series One Tree Hill and as Det. Erin Lindsay in the NBC police procedural drama series Chicago P.D. Sophia consistently uses her platform for activism and fundraising and has a new podcast called Work in Progress. Sophia stood up for herself before the Me Too Movement began by quitting a television show where she was being mistreated. She shares her struggle to admit that something was wrong and the tricks her mind played on her in the process. So get ready to learn how to have the courage to demand change on Episode 851.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhat’s missing in your toolkit?
