  "description": "<p>Decision-making methods very often use the technique of comparing\nalternatives in pairs. In this approach, experts are asked to compare different\noptions, and then a quantitative ranking is created from the results obtained.\nIt is commonly believed that experts (decision-makers) are honest in their\njudgments. In our work, we consider a scenario in which experts are vulnerable\nto bribery. For this purpose, we define a framework that allows us to determine\nthe intended manipulation and present three algorithms for achieving the\nintended goal. Analyzing these algorithms may provide clues to help defend\nagainst such attacks.\n</p>",
