A <a href=\"http://lisafischermusic.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mesmerizing vocalist</a>, Fischer spent decades touring and recording with The Rolling Stones, Luther Vandross, Sting, Tina Turner, Nine Inch Nails, Bruce Springsteen, and many others. That earthshaking voice you hear alongside Jagger on the live version of Gimme Shelter, that's Lisa.

Music was her refuge. She eventually studied opera, then took a turn into R&B, found herself touring with Luther Vandross and other mega-acts, vaulted onto some of the biggest stages in the world. In the midst of this phenomenal success, Lisa wrestled with her own worthiness, and issues of identity, purpose, power, fame, and everything the stage and music industry can bring. We dive into all of this, along with Lisa's take on life, her lens on wonder and possibility, harmony and elevation, alter-egos and true self, and living with one eye on the finality inherent in every moment.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
