As many will know, that book seeks to expose Critical Race Theory and follows a series of lectures Lindsay gave in Tampa, Florida, in July of 2021 (https://newdiscourses.com/tag/resisting-critical-race-theory-workshop/). Since the book is so broad and has so much to expose, there's even more to say about the specific claim in the title, that Critical Race Theory is Race Marxism. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, Lindsay goes into tremendous detail linking Marx's Theory of Communism directly to Critical Race Theory, showing in clear detail how Critical Race Theory reproduces those ideas in a new form that replaces economic class with race. For those seeking to understand Critical Race Theory, this episode of the New Discourses Podcast is therefore indispensable. Join James to fully understand how Critical Race Theory is, in fact, Race Marxism in the deepest possible way.\n\nSupport New Discourses:\npaypal.me/newdiscourses\nnewdiscourses.locals.com/support\npatreon.com/newdiscourses\nsubscribestar.com/newdiscourses\nyoutube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://newdiscourses.com\n\nFollow:\nfacebook.com/newdiscourses\ntwitter.com/NewDiscourses\ninstagram.com/newdiscourses\nhttps://newdiscourses.locals.com\npinterest.com/newdiscourses\nlinkedin.com/company/newdiscourses\nminds.com/newdiscourses\nreddit.com/r/NewDiscourses\n\nPodcast:\n@newdiscourses\npodcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-…es/id1499880546\nbit.ly/NDGooglePodcasts\nopen.spotify.com/show/0HfzDaXI5L4LnJQStFWgZp\nstitcher.com/podcast/new-discourses\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
