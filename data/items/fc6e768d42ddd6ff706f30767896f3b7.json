  "description": "<p><strong>Brian McCarthy</strong> began his career with a bang—right out of design school he was hired on at the legendary firm Parish Hadley, where he worked alongside future luminaries of the profession like Bunny Williams and David Kleinberg. When he left in 1992, it was the beginning of a sparkling solo career: McCarthy’s inspired interiors have won him a spot on the Elle Decor A-List and the AD100, and in 2020 he received the Albert Hadley Lifetime Achievement award from the New York School of Interior Design—an accolade fittingly named for his first mentor.  In this episode of the podcast, he speaks with host Dennis Scully about what it was like to start his career at the best firm in the world, how he vets clients, and the secret to building a great design team. </p><p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.crypton.com\">Crypton Home Fabrics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hookerfurniture.com\">Hooker Furniture</a>. </p><p><i><strong>LINKS</strong></i></p><p><a href=\"https://bjminc.com/\">Brian McCarthy</a><br /><a href=\"www.instagram.com/dennisscully\">Dennis Scully</a><br /><a href=\"www.businessofhome.com\">Business of Home</a></p><p> </p>\n",
