  "description": "Matt Daniels, editor of the publication The Pudding, wanted to find out what songs from his youth would last into the future. So he designed a study that would test if Gen-Z had a grip on 90s culture. Hundreds of thousands of participants provided over 3 million data points. Daniels parsed through the data for insights. Sadly, the majority of his most beloved songs have not survived even one generation. Though most had been forgotten, he found that just a few songs had staying power across generations — what he defined as the emerging 90s music canon. Find out what songs make it and which have fallen to the wayside. \nMORE\nThe Pudding’s study on Defining the 90s Canon\nTake The Pudding’s quiz yourself\nSONGS DISCUSSED\nSpice Girls - Wannabe \nMariah Carey - Fantasy!\nLou Bega - Mambo #5\nLos Del Rio - Macarena\nBoys II Men - Motown Philly\nWhitney Houston - I Will Always Love You\nSavage Garden - I Want You\nThe Barenaked Ladies - One Week\nJewel - You Were Meant For Me\nJennifer Lopez - If You Had My Love\nCeline Dion - My Heart Will Go On\nBritney Spears - Baby One More Time\nSmash Mouth - All Star\nNirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit\nLearn more about your ad choices.
