  "description": "<p>There are various trajectory planners for mobile manipulators. It is often\nchallenging to compare their performance under similar circumstances due to\ndifferences in hardware, dissimilarity of tasks and objectives, as well as\nuncertainties in measurements and operating environments. In this paper, we\npropose a simulation framework to evaluate the performance of the local\ntrajectory planners to generate smooth, and dynamically and kinematically\nfeasible trajectories for mobile manipulators in the same environment. We focus\non local planners as they are key components that provide smooth trajectories\nwhile carrying a load, react to dynamic obstacles, and avoid collisions. We\nevaluate two prominent local trajectory planners, Dynamic-Window Approach (DWA)\nand Time Elastic Band (TEB) using the metrics that we introduce. Moreover, our\nsoftware solution is applicable to any other local planners used in the Robot\nOperating System (ROS) framework, without additional programming effort.\n</p>",
