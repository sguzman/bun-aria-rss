  "title": "Contextual Movie Recommendations on an iPhone based on Expert Collaborative Filtering",
  "content": "If you follow this blog, you probably have already read about Expert Collaborative Filtering and <a href=\"http://technocalifornia.blogspot.com/2009/05/wisdom-of-few.html\">The Wisdom of the Few</a>. Maybe you also read about our recent implementation of the approach to <a href=\"http://technocalifornia.blogspot.com/2010/07/music-recommendation-through-expert.html\">recommend music</a>. Well if you are around in <a href=\"http://recsys.acm.org/2010\">Recsys 2010 conference</a> next week you will get to see a demo of yet another prototype on Monday's Demo Session.<br /><br />We are presenting an iPhone application based on the Expert Collaborative Filtering approach. The application is the result of Josep Bach's undergrad final thesis and you can read the full-blown description of the project in <a href=\"http://xavier.amatriain.net/pubs/GeolocatedRecommendations.pdf\">his dissertation</a>. The application, however, is much more than yet another implementation of Expert CF. The main highlights for me is that (a) you can offer personalized recommendations on a phone with 100% privacy guarantees, and (b) you can run a recommendation algorithm on the device, with minimum intervention from the server-side.<br /><br />Both these issues can be explained by the client-server architecture depicted below. The server is in charge of compiling all the public information available on the web by crawling critic websites like Rottentomatoes. It also gathers information about local cinemas and their schedules. All this information, which again is public,  is stored in a SQL database and shared through a RESTful API with devices.<br /><br />The device, in this case an iPhone but could be anything else, connects to the server and syncs a local database through the RESTful API. Once this is done, all needed information is local on the device. Plus... all the personal information about the user (i.e. ratings on movies in this case). The recommendation algorithm can then run locally and return results in a reasonable time because the set of experts is limited.<br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xAtUP4Gu6Zk/TJvdIQTB95I/AAAAAAAAAJI/w4twxI-9vYY/s1600/Architechture.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 585px; height: 364px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xAtUP4Gu6Zk/TJvdIQTB95I/AAAAAAAAAJI/w4twxI-9vYY/s320/Architechture.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5520248902156154770\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />Another important addition to the application is that we have added contextual features. The recommendations you will get on the app depend on your location and the time of the day. Therefore, it will recommend things that match your taste according to the expert-based prediction but also are playing in a cinema nearby now.<br /><br />We haven't done a full user evaluation yet, but informal results are very encouraging. We hope you can come and test it in Recsys and give us your feedback. We will soon post a video. But for now, here are some screenshots of the main app screens.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xAtUP4Gu6Zk/TJvc9gpXREI/AAAAAAAAAJA/Nx35djvpU-M/s1600/Recommendation.png\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 284px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xAtUP4Gu6Zk/TJvc9gpXREI/AAAAAAAAAJA/Nx35djvpU-M/s320/Recommendation.png\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5520248717566231618\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">List of Recommendations given your preferences, critics ratings but also your location</span><br /><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xAtUP4Gu6Zk/TJvc1bWrkqI/AAAAAAAAAI4/_11FodZyXzk/s1600/MovieInfo.png\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 294px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xAtUP4Gu6Zk/TJvc1bWrkqI/AAAAAAAAAI4/_11FodZyXzk/s320/MovieInfo.png\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5520248578706739874\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Information on a movie, including critics ratings, your ratings, and also closest cinema that is playing with next show times<br /></span></div><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xAtUP4Gu6Zk/TJvcplCtTUI/AAAAAAAAAIw/15B9f-dQ8V8/s1600/CinemaScreen.png\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 310px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xAtUP4Gu6Zk/TJvcplCtTUI/AAAAAAAAAIw/15B9f-dQ8V8/s320/CinemaScreen.png\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5520248375148891458\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Screen showing cinemas near your current location (in blue)<br /><br /></span></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xAtUP4Gu6Zk/TJvch9EGiYI/AAAAAAAAAIo/6uqb5n3-kcE/s1600/CinemaInfo.png\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xAtUP4Gu6Zk/TJvch9EGiYI/AAAAAAAAAIo/6uqb5n3-kcE/s320/CinemaInfo.png\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5520248244158237058\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Information on the closest cinema near you<br /></span></div>",
