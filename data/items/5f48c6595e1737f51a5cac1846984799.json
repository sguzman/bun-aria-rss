  "title": "MNF Recaps: Chiefs top Cam Newton-less Patriots while Rodgers, Packers dominate Falcons (Football 10/6)",
  "description": "We had the luxury of two Monday Night Football games all the way in Week 4 and the Pick Six Superfriends are here to break down both of them. First, the Chiefs managed to improve to 4-0 with a 26-10 victory over the Patriots, despite Patrick Mahomes not having a great game. Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech heavily focus on New England's quarterback play in the absence of Cam Newton and when we might see their regular starter back in action. Next up, it's analysis of the Packers 30-16 win over the Falcons. Now that Bill O'Brien has been fired, how much longer does Dan Quinn have left. And can Aaron Rodgers pose a legitimate threat to Russell Wilson in the MVP race? Those answers and more on this edition of the Pick Six podcast.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @johnbreech, @EdwardsCBS, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
