Next, NFL Network Insider and friend of the progrum, Ian Rapoport stops by after his week long vacation to chat about what is going to happen in the draft as we get closer and closer, if Kyler Murray is going to be anywhere other than Arizona, and what we should be expecting him to break next (1:08:44-1:30:40). Later, WWE Superstar Elias' younger brother, Ezekiel, joins the show to chat about the disappearance of Elias, his upcoming lie detector test on tonight's episode of Monday Night Raw, why Pat and Nick have never met Ezekiel when they know Elias so well, and what his relationship with his brother is like (2:00:36-2:09:13).
