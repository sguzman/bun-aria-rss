  "description": "In the late spring of 1989, a woman and her two daughters left their farm in Ohio for a girls trip down in Florida that was supposed to be filled with laughter and adventure. But when 3 bodies turned up in the Tampa Bay a couple weeks after they left, their family feared for the worst. Investigators fought hard to figure out what had happened to this poor family, and who the monster behind it was. And eventually, they received an important tip about a suspicious neighbor… This is the story of Joan, Michelle, and Christie Rogers. Also known as the Tampa Bay Murders and the Rogers Family Murders.\n\nPATREON BONUS EPISODES\npatreon.com/goingwestpodcast\n\nCASE SOURCES\nhttps://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Joan,_Michelle,_and_Christe_Rogers\n\nhttps://projects.tampabay.com/projects/classics/angels-and-demons/chapter-2-haunted/\n\nhttps://www.tampabay.com/narratives/2019/06/05/from-2011-theres-never-going-to-be-justice-hal-rogers-watches-his-familys-killer-meet-his-fate/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/322478418\n\nhttp://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/chandler1275.htm\n\nhttps://forensictales.com/the-rogers-family-murders/\n\nhttps://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1993-09-26-9309221029-story.html\n\nhttps://www.talkmurderwithme.com/blog/2020/11/27/oba-chandler-rogers-family\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14143204/michelle-lee-rogers\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14143195/joan-mae-rogers\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14143213/christe-eugenia-rogers\nLearn more about your ad choices.
