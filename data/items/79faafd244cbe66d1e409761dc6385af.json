  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, when a textual originalist judge is nominated to the Supreme Court of the U.S, their new first name becomes \"controversial\" but when a radical judge is nominated their first name becomes \"historic.\" Yet Ketanji Brown-Jackson will now serve on the court and her ideology rejects the founding documents of our country. Then, President Biden's brother James Biden is being investigated by congressional Republicans. The U.S Attorney's probe into Hunter Biden continues as more details reveal Joe Biden intermingling with Hunter's business associates - something Joe Biden had denied. This program maintains that a special counsel is needed to specifically look into these matters. Afterward, David Bossie joins the show to discuss his new film \"Rigged 2020\" which outlines how Barack Obama's campaign manager took Mark Zuckerberg's $300 Million in non-profit funds to politically organize under the guise of non-partisanship.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
