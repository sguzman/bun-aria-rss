  "description": "<p>This week, Louise is joined by brand strategist and web designer Mariana Durst. Mariana specialises in working with artists to develop their brands, create compelling copy and graphics, and build effective websites. Having worked with all kinds of artists she has a unique perspective on the challenges and rewards of a strong brand. In this conversation, we discuss what it means to have a brand (and why we all have one even if we don't know it). We also dive into the questions you can ask yourself to identify and refine your own artist brand, and Mariana shares some of the &nbsp;mistakes she sees artists make. If you would like more people to see and/or buy your art, you won't want to miss this episode.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mentioned</p>\n<p>Mariana's website: <a href=\"\">https://www.deskanddesign.com/</a> (scroll down for the free branding masterclass)</p>\n<p>Essentialism <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/books/essentialism-the-disciplined-pursuit-of-less/9780753558690?gclid=Cj0KCQiA-qGNBhD3ARIsAO_o7ykRhTiAhzJJRGX8Yk3C9kt_y49oMEqu7CsBHJymG7D4zpJacX_oLQ4aAn9pEALw_wcB\"><u>https://uk.bookshop.org/books/essentialism-the-disciplined-pursuit-of-less/9780753558690?gclid=Cj0KCQiA-qGNBhD3ARIsAO_o7ykRhTiAhzJJRGX8Yk3C9kt_y49oMEqu7CsBHJymG7D4zpJacX_oLQ4aAn9pEALw_wcB</u></a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
