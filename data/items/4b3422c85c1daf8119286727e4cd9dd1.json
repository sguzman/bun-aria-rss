  "description": "<p>Everyday the vast majority of your body's energy is used to digest, assimilate, and eliminate the resources you consume. The resources I'm speaking of are the foods you eat, the liquids you drink, and the air that you breathe.</p> <p>Today, we only experience a fraction of our body's true potential energy. So much of our energy is being tied up in digesting food that our bodies are unable to do the deeper house cleaning that we truly need.</p> <p>Your body's first priority is to handle the food that's coming into it because that's your cellular frontline. What comes in your mouth can take you out of this life fast, so your immune system and other support must be present in your gut and on guard at all times.</p> <p>Add to that the fact that today we have endless meals being thrown in there and we've got a serious energy siphoning happening.</p> <p>Most of us don't know the art and science of eating lightly or fasting for even a short time period. For many of us, breakfast is being pushed through by lunch, is pushed through by dinner, is pushed through by dessert, is pushed through by breakfast... and on and on and on.</p> <p>Our bodies never get a break.</p> <p>Our internal organs are constantly processing food and the resulting metabolic waste products.</p> <p>Can your body handle this burden? Well, yes (in the short-term.) Was it designed to deal with the toxicity of our modern world? In the immortal words on the philosopher Bart Simpson, \"No way man!\"</p> <p>Being exposed to abnormal amounts of dangerous compounds is now common in our world today. Even if you're eating organic, radioactive fallout has been seen in our water, air, and soil, so truly, no food chain is free of contamination.
