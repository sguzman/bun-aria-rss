What would happen if the troops stay, and what would happen if they leave? Vox’s Alex Ward is here to discuss. He’s a White House reporter and a co-host of the Worldly podcast. \nLearn more: \nAlex recently talked to two experts who argued both sides of the decision. You can read those arguments here: staying in Afghanistan or leaving Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nEnjoyed this episode? Rate Vox Quick Hits ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ and leave a review on Apple Podcasts.\n\n\nSubscribe for free.
