  "description": "<p>Returning with another solo installment of the Korean War 70th Anniversary Series, Avery discusses another battle during the \"Attrition Period\" of the conflict that followed the fighting on Bloody Ridge: the more renowned Battle of Heartbreak Ridge. After a month of fighting on a 7-mile long mass of hills that towered over the Mundung-ni & Sat'ae-ri Valleys of Gangwon Province, South Korea, the United Nations forces were successful in destroying the North Korean and Chinese defenses at the cost of 3,700 men killed, wounded, captured or missing. Avery walks us through the battle and points out some of the reasons why the ridge earned it's ominous nickname. Enjoy!</p>",
