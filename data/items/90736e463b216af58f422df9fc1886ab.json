  "description": "<p>Once a year, I read <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cV0jYK\"><i>The Road</i> </a>by Cormac McCarthy. It's a cathartic annual ritual for me. What is it about this novel that has such an impact on my soul and those of other readers? Who is the man who wrote it, and what was he trying to do with this story of a father and son struggling to survive in a post-apocalyptic landscape?</p><p>For answers to these questions, I decided to talk to a foremost expert on McCarthy's work, as well as the literature of the American West in general. His name is Steven Frye and he's a professor of English, a novelist in his own right, and the author and editor of several books about the reclusive, philosophical author, including <a href=\"https://amzn.to/31iFoMA\"><i>Understanding Cormac McCarthy</i></a>. We begin our conversation with some background on McCarthy and a discussion of his distinctive style and themes, and why he avoids the limelight and prefers to hang out with scientists over fellow artists. We then dive into <i>The Road</i>, and Steve unpacks what inspired it, as well as the authors and books that influenced it. We then dig into the big themes of <i>The Road</i>, and how it can be read as a biblical allegory that wrestles with the existence of God. We delve into the tension which exists between the father and son in the book, and what it means to \"carry the fire.\" We end our conversation with why reading <i>The Road</i> makes you feel both depressed and hopeful at the same time.</p><p>A spoiler alert here: If you haven't read <i>The Road</i> yet, we do reveal some of the plot points in this discussion.
