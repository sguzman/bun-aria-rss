  "description": "Kim McGuinness If you've been desperate to hear from a leading non-Westminster politician (and even if you haven't), you're in for a massive treat. Kim McGuinness is the Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria and the first Police and Crime Commissioner to feature on the show. She tells Matt all about the job of the Commissioner, the huge impact they can have, the limits on them and the political aspects of such a unique role. It's also a timely reminder that some of our brightest and best politicians aren't in Westminster...
