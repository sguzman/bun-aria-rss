  "description": "<div>On this week's podcast:<br>\n<br>\nWe have a new prime minister, but is Rishi Sunak ready to take on the numerous problems that James Forsyth outlines in his cover piece for <em>The Spectator</em> this week? James is joined by writer and pollster Matt Goodwin to debate whether the Conservatives can turn it around in time for 2024 (00:50). <br>\n<br>\nAlso this week:<br>\n<br>\nIs the future of feminism conservative?<br>\n<br>\nLouise Perry writes for the magazine this week that there has been a rightward shift in feminist thought, spearheaded by mothers coalescing online. She is joined by Victoria Smith, author of <em>Hags: The Demonisation of Middle-Aged Women</em> (15:30).<br>\n<br>\nAnd finally:<br>\n<br>\n<em>The Spectator's</em> diary editor James Heale and the <em>Sun's</em> political editor Harry Cole, are the authors of the new book <em>Out of the Blue: The Unexpected Rise and Rapid Fall of Liz Truss</em>. Now immortalised as a Twitter meme, they discuss the agony of rewrites and trying to keep pace with Truss's doomed premiership (28:09). <br>\n<br>\nHosted by William Moore. <br>\n<br>\nProduced by Oscar Edmondson.</div>\n",
