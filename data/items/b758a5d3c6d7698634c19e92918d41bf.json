  "description": "A supergroup featuring the leaders of three largely likeminded bands — Dawes' Taylor Goldsmith, Deer Tick's John McCauley and Delta Spirit's Matthew Vasquez — Middle Brother naturally takes on many incarnations: moodily brooding folk-pop, boozily spirited rock, spotlight-sharing roots music. Altogether, it adds up to roughly the sum of its parts. Hear the band perform live as part of a SXSW showcase at Auditorium Shores in Austin, Texas, on March 19, 2011.",
