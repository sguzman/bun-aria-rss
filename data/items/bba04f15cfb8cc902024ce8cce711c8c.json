We also talk about Brenda Jackson’s legendary families — the Westmorelands, the Steeles, the Madarises and the Grangers — about her relationship to readers, about her writing, about covers, about why 36 is a magic age in romance, and about keeping romance alive beyond the pages.  </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We are thrilled to share this incredible conversation with all of you, and we are so grateful to Brenda Jackson for taking time to talk with us.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thanks to Blair Babylon, author of Blair Babylon, author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3NLP19a\"><em>Once Upon a Time</em></a>, and Lumi Labs, creators of Microdose Gummies, for sponsoring the episode.
