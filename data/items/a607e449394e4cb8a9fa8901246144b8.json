  "description": "What if you had the opportunity to become a vampire, irreversibly -- and everyone you knew who had become one said \"It's utterly indescribable.\" Would you take the leap, not knowing what it would feel like, or how it would change your personality and values? That's an example of what philosopher L. A. Paul calls a \"transformative experience,\" one that's especially hard to choose (or forgo) rationally, because of how unknowable it is and how it changes your very preferences. In this episode, she and Julia discuss real life examples of transformative experiences -- such as having children -- and debate how to deal with them.",
