Your latest big win in your job, getting invited to that event, or if your kids are behaving well today?<br> <br> When being loved or approved rises and falls based on others, it's easy to forget our true source of love and approval already comes from Jesus. Today our friend and author, Lynn Cowell, reminds us that Jesus pours His love out on us, and shares how we can live with love and approval from Christ, not for love and approval from others.
