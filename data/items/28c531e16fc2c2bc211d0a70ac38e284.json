  "description": "<p><p>The Bruins won SCF Game 1 if anyone was still wondering how Tuesday's episode ended (2:27 - 5:39). 5 Star recruit RJ Hampton picked the New Zealand Breakers (the team we own) over all the other colleges and we're now big time recruiters (5:39 -  12:54). The Lakers are a dumpster fire and Kobe is getting dinner with ghosts (12:54 - 18:10). Hot Seat/Cool Throne (18:10 - 32:18). Zac Efron joins the show and we have a wide ranging conversation about Hollywood, his career, growing up a Giants fan, and how he should star in Boner Dogs (32:18 - 77:27). 5 Star Recruit RJ Hampton joined Big Cat on radio to talk about his decision to sign with the New Zealand Breakers (77:27 - 89:36). Segments include bachelorette talk for guys that dont watch the bachelorette, just stop talking Giants, Locker Room talk for Will Muschamp, and guys on chicks. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
