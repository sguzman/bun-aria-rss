  "description": "<p>In 1975, the Lutz family moved into the old house at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amittyville, New York. The house was beautiful, nestled in the heart of an affluent neighborhood, it had a pool and a dock, and best of all, the family had gotten it at a staggeringly low price. <strong>The only catch—a family of five had been brutally murdered there the year before.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>According to the Lutz family, for the 28 days they lived in the home, they were tormented by ghosts and possessed by demons. They were thrown up the stairs, terrorized by mysterious creatures, and were levitated 13 feet into the air.</p>\n\n\n<p>In “My Amittyville Horror,” Daniel Lutz, who was 9 at the time, tells his version of the terrifying story for the first time. And you guys, this bro is intense.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Check out our bonus episodes on Patreon!</a> We covered <strong>\"Serial\"</strong> episode-by-episode and capped the series off with an interview with <strong>Rabia Chaudry</strong>--Adnan's friend who brought his story to Sarah Koenig AND with <strong>Asia Mcclain</strong>--Adnan's alibi witness!
