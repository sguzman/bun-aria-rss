  "description": "<p>Who has read any marketing books?</p>\n<p>I finished reading the ‘22 Immutable Laws of Marketing’ today. It was not a long book at all (132 pages) but gave a good indication about what makes a good marketing strategy. 📈</p>\n<p>As someone who doesn’t know much about marketing theory is proved to be an insightful book. The 22 laws seemed reasonable given the book was written 27 years ago, the principles seem to be relevant today on face value. 📚</p>\n<p>This book would be good for someone who doesn’t know much about marketing (like me) as an introductory read. But would also be good for anyone who knows the current market and wants to use it as a comparison. 👍📚</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Thank you for listening.
