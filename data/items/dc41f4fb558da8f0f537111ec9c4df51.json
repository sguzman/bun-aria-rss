I am thrilled to share a brand new story with you after months of hibernating...er, daydreaming and writing. The Mistake Artist is my very first two-part story and I think you will love it. It features a little girl who is a bit of a perfectionist about her art, and a magical being who takes the girl's \"mistakes\" and showcases them as things of beauty in her faraway realm of magical beings. Tune in next time for part two of this story and hear how Em learns to reframe her mistakes as opportunities.\nIf your tiny person wants to share a story they've written, please send photos or recordings of it to rhea@littlestoriestinypeople.com. I LOVE to see their artwork, stories, and anything else they'd like to share.\nBIG THANKS to the listeners who provided sound effects used in the story: AYDA, NORA, EMMA, LILY, CHARLIE, GABE, GEMMA, and ZACH!\nYou can send me your very own sound effect! Just use the voice memo app on your phone, record your tiny people making a (recognizable) sound, and email it to rhea@littlestoriestinypeople.com!
