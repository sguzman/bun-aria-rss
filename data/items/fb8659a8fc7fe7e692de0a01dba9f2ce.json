  "title": "Bert Kreischer, Social Distancing Hobbies, and the Return of Doming",
  "description": "<p>KFC and Feits are getting scared of coronavirus and have quarantined (or social distanced) themselves at their apartments. We discuss bringing back doming to trap all the people who are still going out into crowded areas. We give tips on how to keep yourself occupied while social distancing (not just porn). The White Stripes were into some weird stuff. Voicemails include: Is she too old for me?, Movie Remake Perspective, and Hardest Thing to Do Once.\n\nBert Kreischer (50:50) returns to the show. We talk about how great beer is, several times he almost died while filming tv shows, how Joe Rogan and Bill Burr changed his life, pushing himself as a stand up comedian, his Mickey Mantle gene, what he wants to do for next Sober October, and much, much more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
