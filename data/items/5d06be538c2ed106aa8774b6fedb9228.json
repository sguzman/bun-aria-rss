  "description": "Earlier this year, I gave a talk titled A Day in the Life of a Remote Data Scientist at the Data Science Sydney meetup. The talk covered similar ground to a post I published on remote data science work, with additional details on my daily schedule and projects, some gifs and Sydney jokes, heckling by the audience, and a Q&amp;A session. I managed to watch it a few months ago without cringing too much, so it&rsquo;s about time to post it here."
