  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Speaker Nancy Pelosi refuses to pass a bill to protect Supreme Court Justice’s the same way that Congress is protected. Even though the National Guard is on call this won't ensure protection for the Justices. Democrats have no problem stripping the Court of its independence by packing it to change its makeup. Also, Pelosi's January 6 committee is an abomination; this is the first time in U.S history that a committee is hand-picked by the speaker of the House with no opposition. The tyranny of the majority and the tyranny of the legislature was serious concerns to our founders and Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats reject these concepts and shred our tradition and our republic. At the end of this committee hearing, the American people still won't know why Nancy Pelosi rejected President Trump's offer for the National Guard or why the Capitol Police failed to secure the building including waving people inside on January 6th. Then, a candidate running for the US presidency has every right to challenge the results of an election. Any President can seek legal advice and take an election to court. Al Gore challenged in 2000. The Florida legislature was set to intervene with a special session and name a slate of presidential electors, however, then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist took the case and didn't sit on his hands as Chief Justice Roberts did in 2020. The Republican legislatures in the battleground states that were in question had every right to name their electors if they felt that their authority under Article II of the Constitution was seized. Later does the VP have the power to choose electors as a remedial step if he believes it violates the Constitution? The VP has a duty to the Constitutional Oath he's taken. The law is untested and obscure in this regard. However, this committee will not have this discussion or have this debate. Afterward, Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik calls in to explain that Americans are smart and won't fall for the disinformation that Democrats are spreading to protect Pelosi from any liability for her security failures on January 6. The Speakers office refused to provide documents and failed to accept the intelligence warnings prior to January 6th. Finally, AZ Senate candidate Adam Laxalt calls in to discuss what is driving the Democrats' agenda. Laxalt explained that all Nevadans including Hispanics see through the lies being told by the democrats as they pay more money for less stuff. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
