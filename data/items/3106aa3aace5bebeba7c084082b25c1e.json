  "title": "Introducing Story of the Week with Joel Stein: The Toad Doctor",
  "description": "Here’s a preview of a new podcast, Story of the Week. \n\n\n\nEach week, journalist Joel Stein chooses an article that fascinates him, convinces the writer to tell him about it, and then interrupts a good conversation by talking about himself. Sometimes the story will be the one everyone is talking about, like the New Yorker article on smoking hallucinogenic toads. Other times we’ll find a story you might have missed, like the one in the Verge about the rock groupie turned hacker who had huge corporations at her mercy. These are stories you’ll tell your friends about. Stories that stick with you long after you forget whatever headline you just doom-scrolled through. \n\n\n\nHear the full episode, and more from Story of the Week, here.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
