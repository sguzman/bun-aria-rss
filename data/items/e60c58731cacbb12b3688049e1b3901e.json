  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, Rich Zeoli of WPHT fills in for Mark. CNN is out to get President Trump. Now, saying that Trump extracted a top spy from Russia in 2017, but they got it wrong. CNN was subsequently corrected by the New York Times which pointed out that all of this occurred during President Obama's time in office. The spy was put in danger by the gossip amongst Obama-era intelligence officials who leaked his identity to the media, yet these facts are omitted by CNN's reporting. Then, Elizabeth Warren is creeping into the front-runner spot for the Democratic nomination and she said she would simply tell utility companies that she's willing to impose a fossil fuel ban. Later, new reports suggest that exculpatory evidence may have been withheld from former National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn forcing him into a plea deal on a flimsy charge. Afterward, Beto O'Rourke wouldn’t rule out police going door to door for a gun \"buy-back.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
