  "description": "<p>Sheila Kelley is a moment, a mantra, and the founder of S-Factor: a feminine movement practice that offers classes in strip, pole dance, and erotic dance. “We live from the armpits up, and get trapped away from our bodies,” Sheila says. So <em>her</em> passion is to free people through movement, so they can return to their bodies, and have more energy to move towards what they want. This is a gem-filled conversation that you’re going to want to pause several times, so you can take in Sheila’s explosive wisdom...and apply it immediately to your daily life.</p><br><p>Plus, I take your questions! We’re all venturing into brave new worlds today, and need advice. What to do when you’re dating as a grown woman, with kids in their 20s - but the men you’re matching with are young adults too? Is that a problem? We discuss. Next: is it possible to get “orgasm addicted” to porn? I talk you through it. And finally, beginnings and endings: how do you begin your anal sex journey? How do you end a marriage as you knew it? As Sheila says, it’s all an incremental journey of self-investment and growth -- and by the end of this episode, you’ll have done a bit of both.</p><br><p><strong>Find more about Sheila Kelley here:</strong></p><ul><li>Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/theSheilaKelley\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@theSheilaKelley</a></li><li>Instagram: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/sheilakelleys/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@SheilaKelleyS</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sfactor.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sfactor.com</a></li><li>Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/s.factor.official/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@s.factor</a></li><li>Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skelleysfactor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@skelleysfactor</a></li></ul><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
