  "description": "Emma tells Eddie that Clarrie’s upset he was only pretending to be offended about her teenage kiss with Kenton.  When Eddie can’t understand why, Emma points out he wasn’t defending Clarrie, he was just trying to scam Kenton.  Emma says Clarrie’s upset at how dismissive Jolene was when she didn’t feel threatened by Clarrie.  It made Clarrie feel really unattractive.  When Eddie says he still fancies Clarrie, Emma wonders if he’s told her that, and suggests he make a romantic gesture.  \nTracy tells Susan she’s glad Chelsea’s agreed to see a midwife as Chelsea’s running out of time.  Susan observes Tracy’s looking tired and wonders if Chelsea has any idea of the strain she’s putting Tracy under.  Susan offers to have a word with Chelsea, but Tracy doesn’t want her put  under any pressure.  They discuss Chelsea’s options, with Tracy making it clear that it has to be Chelsea’s decision.\nAlan tells Jim he’s concerned that Jean Harvey, who’s on the PCC, is in favour of Peggy’s stained glass window.  Jim’s on Alan’s side saying it’s inappropriate for the church.  Alan thought the PCC would see sense at tomorrow’s meeting, but with Jean’s opposition that seems unlikely.  Eddie tells them he’s buying chocolates for Clarrie because Emma’s thinks he’s been neglecting her.  Alan and Jim make suggestions for further gestures, including wine and a romantic film.  Emma overhears the stained glass window conversation and agrees with Alan. Although Alan’s not keen on lobbying, Emma says that as Neil’s on the PCC, she’s going to have a word with him.",
