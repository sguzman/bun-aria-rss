  "description": "<p>It was such a divine honor to interview one of the most influential spiritual teachers in the world, Sadhguru, on the podcast. In this episode, I asked him your questions (and ones he’s never been asked before!) We were actually LAUGHING the whole time! We discuss overcoming overwhelm with the state of the world, his take on the term “spiritual bypass”, whether there even are “good” or “bad” people/ forces, the role of technology and how it affects consciousness, what you need to know if you want to live in community and so much more. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with him and his light, humorous energy, despite tackling some of the world’s most major problems and I know you will enjoy witnessing this side of him too.
