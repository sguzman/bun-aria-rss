  "description": "<p>Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs have connected farms to consumers and made people more in tune with where their food comes from, but still leave many stumped beyond the conventional uses for their produce. This week on <em>Eat Your Words</em>, host Cathy Erway is chatting with Linda Ly, author of “The CSA Cookbook” to try and shed some light on this problem. According to Linda, her book seeks to help you cook your way through a CSA box (or farmers’ market or backyard bounty) with 105 seasonal recipes that utilize every edible part of the plant, from leaves and flowers to stems and seeds. Think of it as a nose-to-tail approachâ€”for vegetables!<br />\nHighlights include tomatoes and peppers, leafy greens, peas and beans, bulbs and stems, roots and tubers, melons and gourds, and flowers and herbs. Tune in and look at your veggies in a whole new way!
