  "description": "Today’s episode is all about entryways and entrances to your home. We give you advice and solutions for entry spaces of all shapes and sizes. We recommend useful and inviting items like a tall pedestal console table, a mirror, a lamp, or a piece of artwork for small entryways. We talk about the importance of making your home inviting to your guests with your entryway, prioritizing accommodating needs such as removing shoes or coat. We recommend adding sculpted or organic shapes for entryways with stairs to interrupt the straight lines that stairs present. For larger entries, we give tips on the choice, placement, and decoration of center hall tables. We also discuss balancing both walls as well as the color, knob, and knocker of your door. We talk about common mistakes like hanging family portraits in the entry (TMI for salesmen, not enough visibility for those who live in the house), having rugs that are too small, and using boob lights. For all entryways, we invite you to create a positive first impression to your home by involving more senses with diffusers, lighting, and jewelry.<br /><br />Small or \"Nonexistent\" Entryways 0:54<br />Larger Entries -- Start With The Center Hall Table 15:11<br />Additional Tips: Mirrors and Opposite Wall Reflections, Front Door   24:02<br />Common Design Mistakes in Entries 28:00<br /><br />“Also accommodate for that. If that’s what you require, then put a little ottoman tucked under that console, so that they could sit down on it and untie shoes if they have shoes they can’t just slip off easily, and then they can just park their purse and you can take their coat.” 12:48<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a>",
