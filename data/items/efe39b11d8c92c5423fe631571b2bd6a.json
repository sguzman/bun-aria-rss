  "description": "<p>To celebrate the release of Tom Petty's <em>Wildflowers & All The Rest box set, </em>Rick Rubin connected with Heartbreakers keyboardist, Benmont Tench for a conversation. Benmont started playing with Tom back in Florida with a band called Mudcrutch. He stayed with Tom as they became the Heartbreakers, moved to LA, created some of the most memorable music of all time and was ultimately with him all the way until the last Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performance at the Hollywood Bowl in 2017. Benmont is a massive talent who's also done plenty of work as a sideman for Bob Dylan, Stevie Nicks, U2, Johnny Cash and a ton of others. Rick and Benmont talk about all of this and share memories of their time in the studio together.</p><p><br></p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record's YouTube channel to hear old and new interviews, often with bonus content: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\">https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here: <a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\">https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
