  "description": "On today's show, the guys discuss what they did over the weekend, and look forward to some of their Thanksgiving plans. They also discuss what's going on in the world including a rise in people who claim Wiccan as their religion, England letting just about anyone become a psychiatrist, a Jets fan getting pulled over while drunk and high and blaming it on his misery over the Jets, and teens in Indonesia getting drunk off tampons. Todd wants to know what conspiracy theories the guys all believe in, they play some fact or fiction, do a Thanksgiving version of vitamin thoughts, and bring back a special Maraldo's mad libs for the holiday. It's a fun one, come and enjoy it with us, and have a happy and safe Thanksgiving.\n\nThis episode features @toddmccomas, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @VivalaZito, and @baileymccomas and closes out with \"The Thanksgiving Song\" by Adam Sandler.\n",
