  "description": "<p>With a history that stretches back perhaps 9,000 years to 7,000 B.C., Lebanon contains some of the original winemaking areas. In spite of political turmoil, violence, and opposition to wine (and all alcohol) and winemaking, this country has always found a way to keep production alive. Its unlikely location and small size may seem, at first glance, to be an impossibility for quality wine but the geography and the fortitude of the people here have created a unique and enduring wine culture.</p> <p> </p> <p>In the show we discuss the long history of Lebanon in wine -- from the Phoenicians, to the Greeks and Romans, monks, and then to the French, who had such a huge influence in their 30 year tie to this region between World War I and World War II.</p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/0000064a8-lebanon_map.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"298\" height=\"297\" /></p> <p>Below are some notes on the climate, the spellings of the regions, and the producers we mention:</p> <ul> <li>Lebanon is only about 150 miles long and 60 wide but it is extremely varied in terms of altitude and topography -- with beaches, hills, and high, snow-capped mountains all contained within.  <ul> <li>It is at 33.5˚N latitude, about the same as Margaret River in Australia, and within the traditional grape growing band of 30˚-50˚ latitude (north or south)</li> <li>There are four main geographic regions: the coastal plain, the Mount Lebanon range (altitudes of nearly 10,000 feet), the Bekaa Valley, and the Anti-Lebanon Range</li> <li>Most wine producers are in the western Bekaa but some are experimenting with new terroir in Batroun and  areas in the Eastern Bekaa</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>The key to good wine in Lebanon is altitude</strong>: The Bekaa Valley has altitude of around 1,000m/3,820ft. This is a plateau but there is a moderating influence of Mount Lebanon and the area has snowmelt and rain runoff from the mountain to provide ample water for grapes</li> <li><strong>The soils</strong> are colluvial (runoff from mountains) so they are divers and contain limestone, clay/loam, stones, gravel and some red terra rossa soil similar to Coonawarra in South Australia</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li><strong>Climate</strong> is Mediterranean, with long, dry and often very hot summers. The mountains and valley get very cold at night and the diurnal temperature swings are so dramatic that grapes can maintain acidity if grown in the right places </li> <li> <p><strong>The Wines:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Only about 2,000 ha/4,942 acres are cultivated and yields are extremely low</p> </li> <li> <p>The main reds are: Cabernet Sauvignon, Cinsault (the grape with the longest heritage), Carignan, Grenache, with Merlot, Syrah, Mourvèdre, Tempranillo and Pinot Noir</p> </li> <li> <p>The main whites are: Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon, Viognier, Muscat, Clairette, and Riesling along with indigenous grapes Merwah and Obaideh</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"> <ul> <li>The wines have always been known for excellent fragrance, spice, and a sweet aroma (but not flavor)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"> <ul> <li>French influence is everywhere in these wines-- some of the top wine producers from France consult for wineries in Lebanon and help craft the wines of the top producers</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Top Producers are:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://chateauksara.com/?age-verified=a1859e7076\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Château Ksara</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.chateaukefraya.com/en/kefraya\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Château Kefraya</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.domainedestourelles.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Domaine des Tourelles</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://chateaumusar.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Château Musar</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.massaya.com/english/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Massaya</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://ixsir.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Ixsir</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.domainewardy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Domaine Wardy</a></li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /> <em>Above: Ixsir</em></p> <p>Most of these wines are around USD$20!
