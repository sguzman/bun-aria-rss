  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the life and ideas of Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958), whose Exclusion Principle is one of the key ideas in quantum mechanics. A brilliant physicist, at 21 Pauli wrote a review of Einstein's theory of general relativity and that review is still a standard work of reference today. The Pauli Exclusion Principle proposes that no two electrons in an atom can be at the same time in the same state or configuration, and it helps explain a wide range of phenomena such as the electron shell structure of atoms. Pauli went on to postulate the existence of the neutrino, which was confirmed in his lifetime. Following further development of his exclusion principle, Pauli was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1945 for his 'decisive contribution through his discovery of a new law of Nature'. He also had a long correspondence with Jung, and a reputation for accidentally breaking experimental equipment which was dubbed The Pauli Effect.\n\nWith \n\nFrank Close\nFellow Emeritus at Exeter College, University of Oxford\n\nMichela Massimi\nProfessor of Philosophy of Science at the University of Edinburgh\n\nand\n\nGraham Farmelo\nBye-Fellow of Churchill College, University of Cambridge\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
