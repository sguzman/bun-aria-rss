Harmon, Making All Things New: Inaugurated Eschatology for the Life of the Church (Baker Academic, 2016) which investigates the interface between eschatology (the study of last things) and pastoral ministry, and demonstrates how biblical theology applies to the church. During the interview we also talk about the biblical theology and influence of Greg K. Beale, who writes the introductory chapter to Making All Things New.\n\n\n\nMichael Morales is Professor of Biblical Studies at Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the author of The Tabernacle Pre-Figured: Cosmic Mountain Ideology in Genesis and Exodus (Peeters, 2012), and Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord?: A Biblical Theology of Leviticus (IVP Academic, 2015).
