  "description": "<p>As we step into 2019, Professor Eddie Glaude, Jr. and Associate Professor Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor discuss and review the political climate of America. Prof. Taylor points out the importance of continuing to organize and mobilize social activism, like Black Lives Matter, with the understanding that a single objective is more significant than the different political views. Dr. Glaude highlights the deep fear and \"Shock and Awe\" around President Trump's current administration and policies. Professor Taylor warns of the dangers of moving forward as a nation with an \"anything but Trump\" perspective; how it lowers the expectations for parties and continues to perpetuate similar issues.  Agree or disagree? Listen, share and let us know what you think.</p>",
