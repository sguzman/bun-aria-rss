  "description": "<p>The Knights Templar fought their last stand in the Holy Land (their last proper stand) in Acre in 1291 and shit was epic. They went down, but, they didn't go down easy. And then, less than two decades later, a corrupt French King forced a weak Pope into ending the long reign of the Knights Templar. And by 1312, according to historians, the Order of the Knights of the Temple had been completely dissolved. Or were they!?! Conspiracy theorists say no. They say the Knights have done all kinds of shit since then, like take the Holy Grail to Scotland, or maybe Oak Island. And they joined forces with the Freemasons to help take down humanity through the New World Order. And so much more.
