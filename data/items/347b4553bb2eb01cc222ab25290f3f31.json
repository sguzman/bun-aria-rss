  "description": "<p>Annapolis, Maryland has hundreds of years of history behind it. First settled by Puritans in the mid-1600s, it grew into an important coastal city of historical significance and is today the capital of the state of Maryland. The city has more 18th century structures still standing than any other city in the United States. Some of those structures are taverns and several of those are said to be haunted. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the taverns of Annapolis! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Bill Richardson and features Wojtek the Bear and This Month in History features the first test tube baby being born.
