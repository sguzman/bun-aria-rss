Some might be at the beginning of their journey with AdSense, while others are seasoned industry leads. Our transparency efforts are based on your feedback and requests for educational content; you are the reason why we participate in policy webinars, write blog posts, improve our Help Center articles, collaborate with online media and create video content.</p><p>Be sure to keep an eye out for more policy video guides on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/InsideAdSense/featured\">Google AdSense YouTube channel</a>.
