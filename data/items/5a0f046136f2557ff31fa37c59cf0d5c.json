  "description": "<p>Round 1: Coronavirus lockdowns are in full effect. It’s only been one weekend and boredom is already starting to set in. We are gonna teach you the ancient military method of hurry up and waiting!\n\nRound 2: Magnets… How do they work? Not only that, but other stuff is weird too. We are gonna hop right into something not coronavirus related. \n\nRound 3: For round number three, we had longtime Stoolie Boris come in to read the round. You’ll remember Boris as the gentleman who shaved my beard in New York a few months ago. He’s been helping us with graphics so take it away Boris. \n\nUs pesky Russians are back in the news. Coronavirus be damned. We head to Alaska to check out your most beautiful state. Did we get caught? You’ll have to wait until round three to find out. \n\nRound 4: Everything in America is changing which includes military stuff too. Boot camp is delayed. All PCS and TDY moves are halted until May 11th. Some of those spots are worse than others. We took to the zbt platoon to remind us about the worst places you could be on lockdown..</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
