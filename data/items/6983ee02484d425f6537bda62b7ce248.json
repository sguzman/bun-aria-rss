  "description": "In Legible Sovereignties: Rhetoric, Representations, and Native American Museums (Oregon State University Press, 2017), Lisa King explores the ways in which rhetoric is used to represent Indigenous sovereignty and explore difficult histories related to colonialism and self-determination in museums and cultural centers. Her long-term, interdisciplinary study examines how exhibits related to these issues have evolved over a ten-year period at three different institutions: the Ziibiwing Center in Michigan, which is owned and operated by the Saginaw Chippewa tribe; the Haskell Indian Nation University’s Cultural Center and Museum, and the National Museum of the American Indian, which is part of the Smithsonian structure. Dr. King underscores the difficulties inherent in communicating these issues to diverse public audiences, as well as the need for consistent evaluation and reevaluation by these institutions to ensure both audience engagement and Indigenous self-representation.\n\n\n\nSamantha M. Williams is a PhD candidate in History at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She is currently writing her dissertation, which examines the history of the Stewart Indian School in Carson City, Nevada through the lenses of settler colonialism and public history.
