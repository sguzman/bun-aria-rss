  "description": "IN THIS EPISODE:\nUnderstanding Adolescent Self-Consciousness From A Brain-Wise Perspective\nShow Notes\nListening to a teenager obsess about the pimple on their cheek or other body part that doesn’t look right and that in their mind is glowing neon can be hard to empathize with. The extreme level of adolescent self-consciousness seems oddly self-absorbed from an adult vantage point. In this episode, we discuss the science behind what makes this experience so universal for this developmental age period. We will also help distinguish between what types of adolescent self-consciousness to expect and which types to keep an eye on if a bit too excessive. Finally, we give the listeners concrete recommendations on how to help parents and adolescents cope with this period in their lives, especially when you become the subject of their embarrassment.\nRESOURCES:\nAdditional resources for this episode:\n\n \tLeah H.
