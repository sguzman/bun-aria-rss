  "title": "EP 123: FEELINGS (GACK!), THERAPY AND MOVING ON FROM MORMONISM",
  "description": "<p>This week I reflect on Paul Gilmartin's podcast, Mental Illness Happy Hour Episode 330. He has a therapist on and they discuss co-dependency and the importance of feelings. How do parents mess you up by not letting you have feelings? You're about to find out! Also how do you learn to have feelings after you've spent years accommodating others? Could this be the importance of therapy? How we see reality thru our own perception goggles and living in the past vs now.  I answer emails from a woman who wonders if she has to teach her kid to swim even though he's terrified of water. A woman is in a sexless relationship. Jena calls in and we discuss her Mormon upbringing and how she escaped! </p>\n",
