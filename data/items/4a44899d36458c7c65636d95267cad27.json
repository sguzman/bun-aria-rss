    "media:description": "Safehold by David Weber is a series of science fiction books dealing with themes such as, the use of religion or ideology to manipulate the masses, the inherent conflict between dogma, and innovation and progress, and the corrupting effect that power has on those who possess it. This series begins in the 24th century, at a time where human kind has colonized multiple star systems. In this era humanity is very technologically advanced and it seems the universe is theirs to uncover. That is until they discover that a nearby civilization has been devastated and by some other alien race. Humanity understood that this was a hostile race of beings, they knew this conflict would come for them eventually so they prepared well for it. 10 years later the attack comes. Humanity assumed that their technology and fighting force could fend off the invading aliens, but they were wrong.\n\nThis video has some spoilers for the series.\n\nCheckout my new graphic novel: https://www.quinnhoward.net/theliebehindthestar\n\nGet This book! https://amzn.to/3RldPa8\n\nArt: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NCq9-I2BRgPbWdQlyNi3mwS-Knm4ZW7cD6b1kU55uhM/edit?usp=sharing\nMusic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63UR4xLiUNo\n\nFOLLOW QUINN ON TWITTER: Twitter: https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRE\n\nThree-Body Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXGGVBzHLUfIzEhovpQJ2ENiNvJoOD2A\nH.P.
