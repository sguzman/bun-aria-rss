  "description": "<p>Tonight I will be speaking to Zach who had an encounter in Lake County, Michigan. He did not believe in Sasquatch and came face to face with the creature just a few years ago. The hunter says “It was about 4:30pm and was starting to get dark, I was on top of this hill when I saw what I thought was a bear coming up the hill. The creature was on two legs and walking like a man. Immediately I knew it was not a bear. This creature was HUGE and was built like a bodybuilder. The creature made it up to the top of where I was at in like 6-8 steps and he smelled horrible. The creature started sniffing the air and we made eye contact, he looked right at me. He did not have any whites to his eyes it was more yellow almost like you would see in someone who has jaundice. The creature then turned and walked off in the opposite direction. My heart was pounding and I waited several minutes to make sure he was gone and I started to make my way back to my vehicle and that is when I heard a scream off in the distance. I have never heard anything like that before in my life. I got to my vehicle and started throwing up.”</p>",
