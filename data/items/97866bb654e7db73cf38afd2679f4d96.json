  "description": "<p>Security video shows a 2-year old boy being physically restrained by his nanny and force-fed. The little boy can be heard saying 'NO\" as well as crying and screaming for his daddy. Parent Max and Laura Oglesby turned in their home security feed to the horrifying situation. The couple, working about 45 minutes away, immediately headed home, calling the boy's grandmother to go get him immediately. When the Oglesby couple checked more of their footage they found the ordeal lasted more than two hours. Nanny Lauren Rowe can be seen holding 2-year-old Declan's arms behind his back as she jams pot pie into his mouth. She then holds the boy's mouth shut. Rowe was arrested for misdemeanor child abuse, then released on a $2,500 bond. The trial begins on March 8, 2022.</p><p><br></p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Laura Oglesby - Victim's Mother</li>\n<li>Tom Patire - America’s Leading Personal Safety Expert, Author: \"The Personal Protection Handbook, www.TomPatire.com, Instagram: @OfficialTomPatire</li>\n<li>Doug Burns - Former Federal Prosecutor, LinkedIn: \"Douglas T.
