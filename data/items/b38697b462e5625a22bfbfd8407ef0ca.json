The Clergy Consultation Service, an underground network of ministers and rabbis who wanted to help people access safe abortions in a time before it was legal. We first aired our conversations with some of them in 2017. And after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade earlier this year, we decided to call some of them back.\nTake our survey: vox.com/podsurvey\nSay hello on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Sign up for our occasional newsletter, The Accomplice.
