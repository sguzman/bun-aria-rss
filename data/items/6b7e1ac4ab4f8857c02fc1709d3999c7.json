  "description": "Hello! My name is Anna and I'd like to welcome you to One Minute Catalan from the Radio Lingua Network. In this podcast I'm going to be teaching you the basics of Catalan. The great thing about this language course is that you'll be learning all you need to know in just 60 seconds - or thereabouts! Each one minute language lesson will equip you with just enough Catalan to help you get by in lots of situations, either on holiday, or on a business trip to a Catalan-speaking area, or just to impress your Catalan-speaking friends or colleagues. Our course will be starting very soon. In the meantime, visit our website on http://www.oneminutelanguages.com",
