    "media:description": "The ATS family of aluminum vapor chambers are the largest and broadest set of off-the-shelf vapor chambers available today. From 25x25mm (1x1in) to 250x250mm (9.8x9.8in). Made in the USA, the vapor chambers are also available in Copper and Titanium.\nThe Role of Vapor Chamber (VC) Substrate-level thermal transport whether metallic or synthetic diamond substrates that have been used for their superior conduction heat transfer, are displaying inadequacies in spreading the heat for effective device cooling. \n\nLearn more about ATS custom vapor chambers - https://www.qats.com/Products/Vapor-Chambers\n\nhttps://www.qats.com&#13;\nAdvanced Thermal Solutions, Inc.&#13;\nA leading-edge engineering and manufacturing company focused on the thermal management of electronics.&#13;\n&#13;\nService, Products and Training&#13;\n• Cooling Solutions – From Chip to System&#13;\n• Mechanical Packaging and Design&#13;\n• Design Services&#13;\n• Air and Liquid Cooling Solutions&#13;\n• Rapid Prototyping&#13;\n• Custom Heat Sink Design&#13;\n• Research Grade Thermal Instruments&#13;\n• Engineering Training&#13;\n• State-of-the-art Experimental Laboratories&#13;\n• Qpedia Thermal eMagazine",
