  "description": "<p>Gabby Petito's parents say Christopher and Roberta Laundrie knew their son, Brian, murdered his girlfriend. Petito and Laundrie were on a cross-country road trip last year when Gabby went missing. Her body was later found in Wyoming, and her death ruled homicide by strangulation. Laundrie returned to his parents' Florida home, alone, driving a van owned by Petito. The FBI says Laundrie confessed to killing Petito in a notebook found with his belongings. The Petito family accuse the Laundries of concealing information a bout their daughter's death and, say the Laundries also tried to hide their son from law enforcement. Brian Laundrie committed suicide in a nature reserve in Florida. </p><p><br></p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Wendy Patrick - California prosecutor, author “Red Flags” www.wendypatrickphd.com 'Today with Dr. Wendy' on KCBQ in San Diego, Twitter: @WendyPatrickPHD</li>\n<li>Caryn Stark - NYC Psychologist, www.carynstark.com, Twitter: @carynpsych, Facebook: \"Caryn Stark\" </li>\n<li>Sheryl McCollum - Forensic Expert & Cold Case Investigative Research Institute Founder, ColdCaseCrimes.org, Twitter: @ColdCaseTips</li>\n<li>Joe Scott Morgan - Professor of Forensics: Jacksonville State University, Author, \"Blood Beneath My Feet\", Host: \"Body Bags with Joseph Scott Morgan\"</li>\n<li>Laura Ingle - Senior Correspondent, Fox News Channel, Twitter: @lauraingle, Instagram: @lauraingletv</li>\n</ul><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
