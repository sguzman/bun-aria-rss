My guest on today’s episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, the one and only Matthew McConaughey, shares how challenging events (redlights) can provide us with the opportunity for growth and success (greenlights), which is the focus of his new book <em>Greenlights</em>.</p><br><p>Academy Award–winning actor Matthew McConaughey is a husband, father of three children, and a loyal son and brother.

In 2009, Matthew and his wife, Camila, founded the just keep livin Foundation, which helps at-risk high school students make healthier mind, body, and spirit choices. In 2019, McConaughey became a professor of practice at the University of Texas at Austin, as well as Minister of Culture/M.O.C. for the University of Texas and the City of Austin.
