  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including top-seeded Duke's one-point victory over the University of Central Florida in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. UCF had two chances to win the game in the final seconds but couldn't convert a shot or rebound put-back. The ending was welcomed by Duke's sizable following on Wall Street, where a number of alums -- including private equity mogul David Rubenstein -- are already planning their trips to the Final Four. Also discussed is Roger Goodell saying the NFL's Sunday Ticket package of out-of-town games may have finally outgrown its quarter-century exclusive with AT&T's DirecTV. And also touched on is a court ruling that says retired NBA player David West won't receive $1.4 million from BP for damages resulting from the company's Deepwater Horizon disaster. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-WilliamsProducer: Colin Tipton</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
