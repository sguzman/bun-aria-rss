Plus, Taya and Sadie reminisce about their favorite LO Sister Conference moments. Taya encourages us to always remember this: If you can't be fully who you are in front of the Lord, then where CAN you be yourself in this world? Taya challenges us to live not just for the mountaintop moments but to honor God even in the mundane, everyday moments of our lives. And Sadie and Taya both reveal why \"honey\" is such an important word to them. Taya's debut album, \"TAYA,\" is available now.\n\nhttps://liberty.edu/Sadie — Get your application fee WAIVED when you start your future with Liberty University today!\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
