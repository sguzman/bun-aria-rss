  "description": "<p>This week we're shaking things up and revisiting Casino Night! We're answering more fan questions and covering things we missed from that episode like, Mindy's hair extensions, why some actors share their characters' names, and we clear up the My Buddy - Kid Sister debacle. We're also joined by Casino Night director and early The Office visionary himself, Ken Kwapis. Ken gives us his The Office origin story, chats about his favorite moments from the show, and helps us dig a little deeper into Casino Night. We hope you...you know what, go ahead. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can find Ken's book, But What I Really Want To Do Is Direct, here <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__us.macmillan.com_books_9781250260123&d=DwMFaQ&c=aLv4kG3eFBuAUFgZFQ07JQ&r=tLr8qzvUqzBDOt-3tLBXNg&m=N5sxLR3hX4Ur_nfp40x0ImLNBvS5CBYmlxT8Lg0MNe0&s=kXvwnXEVUZLlFZq-18ufw7Gl9X_OD-Ntn7A68pLkdKA&e=\">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250260123</a> and here <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.amazon.com_But-2DWhat-2DReally-2DWant-2DDirect_dp_1250260124&d=DwMFaQ&c=aLv4kG3eFBuAUFgZFQ07JQ&r=tLr8qzvUqzBDOt-3tLBXNg&m=N5sxLR3hX4Ur_nfp40x0ImLNBvS5CBYmlxT8Lg0MNe0&s=2oVFPXmPHfBx3hwV7d1RGOHJhwqG2aoJ__kpvFmMHbM&e=\">https://www.amazon.com/But-What-Really-Want-Direct/dp/1250260124</a></p>\n",
