  "description": "<p>Cey Adams, a New York City native, emerged from the legendary downtown street art movement to eventually exhibit alongside fellow artists Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, and others in galleries, private collections and museums around the world. Along the way, Adams served as Creative Director for Def Jam Recordings, where he co-founded the Drawing Board, the label’s in-house design agency, creating visual identities, album covers, logos, and advertising campaigns for Run DMC, Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, Public Enemy, Notorious B.I.G., Maroon 5, and Jay-Z. Adams draws inspiration from 60’s pop art, vintage sign painting and comics. His work focuses on themes including pop culture, brand identity, cultural and community issues.</p><p>You can find Cey Adams at: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ceyadams/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"http://ceyadams.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ceyadams62\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
