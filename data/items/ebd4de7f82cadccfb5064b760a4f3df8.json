  "description": "<p>The Wendigo. Tales of a perpetually starving monster roaming the woods of Eastern North America. The Wendigo originates in the lore of tribes like the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Algonquin. Its name roughly translates to \"the evil spirit that devours mankind\". And the Wendigo isn't the only monster we're looking into today. From the well known Skinwalkers to Thunderbirds, to the lesser known Flying Heads and Stone giants, we’re diving into a handful of legends. We’re also gonna dig a bit into the diversity of American Indian peoples, give a little lay of the land to help understand where all of these stories come from. Stories that seem to revolve mostly around cannibalism. Seriously. It's a weird, fun episode. Hope you enjoy hearing it as much as I enjoyed recording it.
