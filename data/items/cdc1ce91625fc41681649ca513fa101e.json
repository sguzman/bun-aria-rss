  "description": "The Mueller indictment charging 13 Russians for their efforts to illegally influence America's 2016 presidential election rocked Washington and sent shockwaves worldwide. The President of the U.S. tried to frame it as vindication because it did not point to his own personal collusion with the Russians (or that of any other U.S. individual).  But...as our experts Evelyn Farkas, Kori Schake and Ed Luce point out...we're just in the early days of this investigation and many more indictments are yet to come.  Where will that leave the U.S.-Russia relationship?  American standing?  Trump?
