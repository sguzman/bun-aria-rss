  "description": "<p> We got a special one for you today, mommy! We start off with just the main mommies and we get through A LOT! The cool girl raving about NRE has a boyfriend who heard YMH talking about them, and turns out, he likes it a lot! Also, Tom has officially decided he's done with his wack Adidas phase, and is back on the Nike train! Then, Christina reveals a super hot dream she had about Tom. Do you dream about your significant other? We then find a cool guy who wishes he had a girlfriend who let him... do certain things. He likes that he likes that he liiiiiiikes THAT! And what better way to pay tribute to FedSmoker than to keep feathering videos from his very deep vault? This time he's hanging out with Native Americans!</p> <p> Then, we got Moshe Kasher and Natasha Leggero coming in to Studio Jeans! We Moshe loves to argue with people on the internet almost as much as he loves Burning Man! We run them through a BUNCH of cool guys, including a clip from Cobra Tate about how faithfulness is a one way street! So cool! We debut the next episode of Pissspots to Moshe and Natasha, and they're certain HBO will pick it up for a full run!</p> <p> Speaking of HBO, we have Brian Lazarte and James Lee Hernandez, the creators/directors of HBO's McMillions, joining us! The docuseries reveals how McDonald's Monopoly game was rigged for a LONG time by the mob. They tell us all about how they got involved in the project and what it's like to work with Mark Wah-Wah-Wahlburg. It also turns out that Brian is Tom's cousin, so they reminisce what it was like to grow up with each other.</p>\n",
