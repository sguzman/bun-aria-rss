  "title": "NFL Championship Sunday + Baron Davis",
  "description": "<p><p>An absolutely unreal Championship Sunday. Fastest 2 minutes with special guest Hank (2:27 - 4:59). Recapping the AFC and NFC Championship. Tom Brady defies all logic, the Chiefs couldn't stop anything, Tony Romo was on fire and Dee Ford will forever be the goat (4:59 - 20:50). The Saints got screwed, Sean Payton loves Taysom Hill too much, and Sean McVay owes us a suite at the Super Bowl (20:50 - 37:07). Who's back of the week including Drake and Soulja Boy (37:07 - 44:44). Former NBA All Star Baron Davis joins the show to talk about his career, the time Derrick Coleman almost killed him for letting Steve Kerr hit threes, and why Big Cat should stop saying Ball Is Life (44:44 - 72:05). Segments include Stay Classy Greg Hardy, Petty Wars NBA, Kings Stay Kings Skip Bayless, and Monday Reading \"I love my wife but she openly sleeps with other men and says my penis is too small to please her\".Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
