  "description": "<p>“CREATING BOUNDARIES IS NOT ABOUT CREATING A WALL, IT'S CREATING AN AGREEMENT.”<br />\nThere’s a lot going on in this world lately, with relationships being violated. We’re seeing it daily with the #MeToo movement, and so many people in Hollywood coming forward.<br />\nProblems aren’t just occurring in intimate relationships, but in business, family, friendships, and so on. Almost all of this stems from boundaries being crossed.<br />\nBoundaries are something that we all need to create and stand by. But we can’t just create them, we need to communicate them. We need to make sure the people in our lives are clear about our boundaries, and express ourselves the moment that they are crossed.<br />\nYou are a beautiful person, and worth the best - so make sure others are aware of that.<br />\nI know it’s hard, and that you probably worry about being fired or losing someone close to you. You can’t be, because that job or that relationship isn’t make you happy. Losing it will open you up to new possibilities.<br />\nThe worst-case scenario about expressing and honouring your barriers is that things will get better - even if it means moving on.<br />\nOn this episode, we are joined again by the amazing Chris Lee. Chris has been on my show more than anyone else, a total of 13 times since episode 36.<br />\nEach time we have him on the air he gives amazing insights, and he has been by my side through some amazing transformations. He’s helped me come out about my past, and build better and stronger relationships in all aspects of my live.<br />\nChris is a man on a mission committed to transforming the world one heart at a time. Chris Lee has spent over 25 years of his life transforming the lives of thousands of people worldwide through his workshops, coaching, and participation in all media, teaching people how to live an abundant prosperous life.<br />\nHe joins us today to give insights on how to increase yourself worth, learn to set boundaries, and how to build the most important relationship - with yourself on Episode 580.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nHow do we take responsibility for the relationships we want? (12:34)<br />\nWhat are things people can do to develop self-worth? (14:51)<br />\nShould we write down our relationship goals? (19:10)<br />\nWhat if you’re in a relationship with a bully or a decision maker? (23:34)<br />\nWould you say someone who does not create boundaries is saying they don’t value their self-worth? (29:23)<br />\nWhy is it such a big fear for us to lose someone? (37:32)<br />\nWhy are we so afraid to be alone? (45:05)<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nThe importance of boundaries in a relationship (10:07)<br />\nHow to tell if a boundary is being crosses (12:02)<br />\nWhy you need a vision about your self-worth (18:28)<br />\nHow to make the requests you need to make (20:03)<br />\nThe reasons you should listen to other’s requests (23:11)<br />\nThe kind of relationships you should be working towards (27:00)<br />\nHow the environment affects self worth (31:30)<br />\nWhy you need to learn to forgive (41:20)</p>\n",
