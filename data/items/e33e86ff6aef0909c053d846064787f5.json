  "description": "Could one American diplomat have prevented the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor? The answer might be yes. America’s ambassador to Japan in 1941, Joseph Grew, certainly thought so.  He saw the writing on the wall—economic sanctions were crippling Japan, rice was rationed, consumer goods were limited, and oil was scarce as America’s noose tightened around Japan’s neck. Japan and the U.S. were locked in a battle of wills, yet Japan refused to yield to American demands. <br /><br />In this episode, I speak with Lew Paper, author of \"In the Cauldron: Terror, Tension, and the American Ambassador’s Struggle to Avoid Pearl Harbor.\" He describes how the United States and Japan were locked in a cauldron of boiling tensions and of one man’s desperate effort to prevent the Pearl Harbor attacks before they happened.<br /><br />Through \"In the Cauldron,\" Paper reveals new information—mined from Grew’s diaries, letters, official papers, the diplomatic archives, and interviews with Grew’s family and the families of his staff—to present a compelling narrative of how the militaristic policies of Imperial Japan collided with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s determination to punish Japanese aggression in the Far East.<br /><br />We look at Pearl Harbor attack inside the ambassador’s perspective through Paper’s revelation of:<br />    • Grew’s personal diaries detailing the events leading up to the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor<br />    • Personal interviews with Grew’s family and staff, giving the inside look into Grew’s struggle to prevent the attacks<br />    • Detailed accounts of the correspondence between Grew and other State Department officials about the warning signs leading up to the Pearl Harbor attacks<br />    • An in-depth look into the fast-depreciating lives of the Japanese people and how their struggles and cultural ideology contributed to the fatal attacks",
