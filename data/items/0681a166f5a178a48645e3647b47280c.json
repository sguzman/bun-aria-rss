  "description": "Leopard print has a long history, as Jo Weldon shares in her new book, Fierce: The History of Leopard Print (Harper Design, 2018). In her illustrated text, Weldon chronicles the history of leopard print, situating it throughout popular culture. Starting in the early 1900s, Weldon examines the mass production of textiles and changes in the fashion industry to bring about the use of prints, colors, and patterns giving women more opportunities to use daring styles. In addition to fashion, Weldon explores influential individuals who changed popular culture with their choices in couture. Weldon’s book combines historical information about fashion, distinguishing features of large cats and large cat prints, and full color images of the compelling textile and its wearers. She argues that leopard print has been a powerful statement for women throughout history, adapting and changing to different fashion trends and technological advancements. Weldon’s book is a vivid illustration of a fashion statement that has not gone out of style.\n\n\n\nRebekah Buchanan is an Associate Professor of English at Western Illinois University.
