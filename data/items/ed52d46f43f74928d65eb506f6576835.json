  "description": "<p>JESS-ter, you have done it again! After addressing some cultural items up top (Katharine McPhee is QUAKING), Matt and Bowen welcome the dog grooming sensation Jess Rona on Las Cultch! They reminisce on Jess's early days as a groomer before becoming the industry expert on the new reality competition program \"Haute Dog\"—premiering September 24th on HBO Max. There's plenty of talk about Jess's transition from working out of her wood-paneled garage to soft-opening her new digs in Los Angeles, and how the vibrant grooming community is wonderfully represented on the new show. The new Paris Hilton doc and The Vow are also discussed as things lead into Jess's culture, which is a three-parter that tracks her progression from a ska-head/rude girl to a raver to an improviser. Wild antics from the halcyon days of Del Close Marathon come into the mix, of course, and the three friends close out the episode with more-fiery-than-usual IDTSHs. Listen, love, and absolutely watch \"Haute Dog\" on HBO Max starting this week!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
