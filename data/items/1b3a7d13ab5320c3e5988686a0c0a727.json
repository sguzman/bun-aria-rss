  "title": "Spring Cloud Function SpEL Injection (CVE-2022-22963) Exploited in the Wild",
  "description": "Although Spring Cloud Functions are not as widespread as the Log4j library, and should provide a good separation from the hosting server, some draw the line between the two, due to the ease of exploitation over HTTP/s. This new vulnerability will definitely result in many threat actors launching campaigns for crypto-mining, ddos, ransomware, and as a golden ticket to break into organizations for the next years to come.",
