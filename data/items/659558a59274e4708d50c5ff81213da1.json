  "title": "Anastasia Karandinou, “No Matter: Theories and Practices of the Ephemeral in Architecture” (Ashgate, 2013)",
  "description": "The intersection of empirical research and critical theory is the basis for Anastasia Karandinou‘s new book  No Matter: Theories and Practices of the Ephemeral in Architecture (Ashgate, 2013).  The book takes as its starting point the growth of interest in ephemeral aspects of architecture, for example sound or time, which has arisen during the era of social and digital media. The two developments are interconnected across the book’s attempt to disrupt the traditional binary hierarchies dominant in architectural theory. Drawing on Derrida, Benjamin and Deluze, alongside a range of architects and architectural theorists,  No Matter  raises questions about the dominance of the visual over the non-visual; the formal over the material; and the physical over the digital. The range of empirical case studies used to illustrate the instability of the theoretical divisions ranges from audio projects in Edinburgh, Scotland to performative mapping in Shanghai, China. As a result of both its theoretical basis and its use of case study material,  No Matter will interest anyone who wants to know more about the intersection of the built environment around us and the digital world that we use to live our lives.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
