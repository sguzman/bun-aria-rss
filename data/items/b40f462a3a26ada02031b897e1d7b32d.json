  "description": "Interior Designer Rachel Cannon is a self described Loudmouth Introvert, hence why this is the title of her new podcast. She returns to the show to discuss exactly what a loudmouth introvert is, the importance of having a quiet room or space in the house, and why introverts need a space like this for their rest and rejuvenation. Rachel gives some tips on setting up a quiet space and how we can begin right away with our schedules now being pointed more towards home.\nWhat You’ll Hear On This Episode\n\nWhat a “Loudmouth Introvert” means to Rachel, and why our assumptions about introvert and extrovert aren’t always right.\n\nHow the Loudmouth Introvert podcast was born, and the epiphany she had that the more she designed her show for introverts like herself, the more traction the episodes got.\n\nThe importance of introverts being able to have a quiet room and space to recharge themselves and take care of their mental health.\n\nThere are no design rules when it comes to a quiet room, just a separate space that is soothing and comforting.\n\nWhat features Rachel designed in her quiet room that serve to provide relaxation and deep focus.\n\nTips for setting up a successful work from home space, which we all need as we stay home for the next several months.\n\nYes, we do have a “Zen Den” at Ballard where employees can go in and have a quiet moment themselves.\n\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\nRachel Cannon\nLoudmouth Introvert\n@rclinteriors\nSaturday Style with Karen Profita\nMyers Carpet\n\nDecorating Dilemma:\nWhat a beautiful room! It’s really about filling it up with texture and getting the right proportion down. We feel as though getting some decorative Birch logs in there would look beautiful and add some raw texture to fill up the room. Since the room is so large, you could probably keep the rug and get a big natural fiber rug underneath it, and when you are ready, get a larger couch. Some drapes and a bigger rug would also help fill up the room. Thank you and be sure to send us the after photos!",
