  "description": "ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood says she views Bitcoin as a “disruptive innovation” in line with corporate giants like Amazon, Apple and Tesla and explains how she gets a BTC price prediction of $700,000 per coin.\n\n\"We think emerging markets are a huge use case here,\" Wood said. \"That use case alone will account for $100,000 to $200,000\" of an increase in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nNow let's do the math.\n\nThe current Bitcoin price of about $60,000 is the base. Wood sees institutional investors adding $500,000 to that and emerging market adoption adding $100,000 to $200,000 more.\n\nSo Wood's five-year Bitcoin price target is actually a range between $660,000 and $760,000, with $700,000 falling just below the middle of the range.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
