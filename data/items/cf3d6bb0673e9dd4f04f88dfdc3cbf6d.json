Two episodes are waiting for you at http://apple.fictional.fm, http://google.fictional.fm, http://stitcher.fictional.fm, or wherever you get your podcasts** ----- Wrapping up the story of Perseus, we'll see that fated confrontation with the eternally cosmetologically-challenged monster, Medusa, as well as fall in love. Turns out it's really easy to meet people when they are imprisoned beneath you. I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. The creature this time is the gargoyle, which ages phenomenally...because it's in indestructible dragon head. Unlike the monsters from that 90s cartoon that was awesome at the time but which did not age well at all... Sponsors! Spotify is a great place to find your podcasts.
