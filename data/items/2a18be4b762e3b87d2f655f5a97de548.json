  "description": "<p>Explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of gravitational\ntheories can be obtained, using a Riemann-Hilbert approach, from an appropriate\nfactorization of certain matrix functions. Here we study a class of solutions,\nwhich we call diagonal canonical solutions, obtained via Wiener-Hopf\nfactorization of diagonal matrices. This class comprises, among others, the\nSchwarzschild, Kasner, Einstein-Rosen and gravitational pulse wave solutions.\nWe show that new solutions can be obtained by a method of meromorphic\ndeformation of the diagonal canonical solutions and that we can define Abelian\ngroups of such solutions indexed by a curve in the complex plane.\n</p>",
