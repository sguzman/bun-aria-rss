  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony conclude their Overland Campaign series by discussing the final battle before the transition to the Petersburg Campaign: the Battle of Cold Harbor. Perhaps the most misunderstood battle of the campaign, popular history has heralded Cold Harbor as Robert E. Lee's last great battlefield victory and the clash that gave Ulysses S. Grant the moniker of \"BUTCHER\" in both southern and northern newspapers alike. The guys take a stab at these myths while also dissecting this crucial engagement and it's larger importance in context with the Civil War. Also, Codie has perhaps the greatest introduction in BnB history...so far...so strap in for an awesome ride. Enjoy!</p>",
