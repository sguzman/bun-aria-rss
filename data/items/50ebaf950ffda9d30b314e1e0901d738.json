  "description": "<p>We dive into ALL the spiritual topics in this flowing conversation. So many of us want to connect to our star family or astral project but haven’t yet practiced grounding. In this conversation, we speak about the weaving of ascension and descension and how both poles are necessary for spiritual growth. We then dive into connecting with your spirit guides, past lives and the deities (goddesses + gods) that are most resonant for you. We share our own stories and techniques of how we began remembering ours, as well as our Atlantean + Lemurian connections. Axel then dives into each color of our auras and what they mean on a balanced and imbalanced level.
