  "title": "NFL Super Wild Card Sunday Recap: Browns stun Steelers, Lamar Jackson gets over playoff hump, Saints slime Bears (Football 1/11)",
  "description": "We had streaks broken, narratives reversed and Spongebob Squarepants all on one Super Wild Card Sunday! On this episode, Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson and John Breech to break down all the action starting with the Browns shocking defeat of the Steelers (3:00). Wilson is in rare form as he reacts to the loss and specifically a really bad decision by Mike Tomlin. Will this be Ben Roethlisberger's final game in a Pittsburgh uniform? And can Cleveland keep it close vs. the Chiefs? All that and more coming off the last game of the night. The Pick Six Superfriends also focus on the Ravens topping the Titans in the first game of the day (30:15). Lamar Jackson wasn't perfect, but he was able to secure his first playoff victory with a good amount of help from the Baltimore defense. Another blatantly bad call in this game from Mike Vrabel, but was it worse than Tomlin's choice to punt? The guys lookahead to the Ravens matchup with the Bills in the Divisional Round before moving onto the Saints surging past the Bears (49:30). The Nickelodeon broadcast was the big winner here as New Orleans advanced and sent Chicago into an offseason in which they'll have a decision to make on Mitch Trubisky. As they always do, Will, Ryan and John close this recap with winners & losers from all the Sunday action.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
