  "title": "Falling pound, the Queen’s funeral and is 0.5 on the Richter scale a big number?",
  "description": "The value of the pound against other currencies has been incredibly volatile ever since the Chancellor’s ‘mini-budget’. We ask how much we should worry and look at how much taxes will really fall. Also did 4.1 billion people really watch the Queen’s funeral? Gas prices are falling – so why aren’t energy bills? There are early signs that new covid variants could cause another spike in cases over the winter. And with the government lifting a moratorium on fracking, we ask how seismic a number the current limit of 0.5 on the Richter scale actually is.\n\nPresenter: Tim Harford\nSeries Producer: Jon Bithrey\nReporters: Charlotte McDonald, Nathan Gower\nProduction Coordinator: Jacqui Johnson\nSound Engineer: James Beard",
