My life was unstable, but at least I wasn’t alone. That all changed when my mother was murdered.\n I ran from the unknown creatures she’d always feared. Until the day I stopped being afraid. That was my first mistake.\n Cashel Blackthorne took me as his captive, but more than that, he opened my eyes to the terrible truth of the world. Vampires exist, and I am the key to their salvation.\n The Blackthorne vampires need my blood but their prince desires more—me.\n There’s something between us neither of us can deny. He is my captor, but I’ll be his ruin.\n  \n PATREON SHOUT OUT! \n Michele K, you are a Goofus Bird, a backwards-flying taloned bird of prey that flies backwards and builds your nest upside down. You have a turkey-like head, long green neck with silver scales, a black right wing and a pink left wing, which sounds kind of nuts, but trust us, you’re working it. The Goofus marches to the beat of its own drum. The Goofus is often perceived as silly and aimless, but underestimating you is a big mistake. You know exactly where you’re going and what you’re doing. That’s why you don’t even need to look. Maybe your nest is upside down, or maybe your nest is the only one that’s right-side up.\n  \n We're doubling and donating all new and increased Patreon pledges in June and July to the Yellowhammer Fund, so if you're on the fence, now is the time! https://www.patreon.com/heavingbosomspodcast\n  \n Indie Podcast Promo: \n There Will Be Porn with Cait and Murda! \n Vintage Porn recapped by millennial women who are mostly ok with butt stuff.\n Instagram\n https://twitter.com/therewillbeprn (Twitter)\nMentioned in this episode:\nPreorder Naima Simone X Friends Book Boyfriend Box!!\nThis box has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a book boyfriend from Tessa Bailey, Avery Flynn, Farrah Rochon, Jayci Lee, Kennedy Ryan, Adriana Herrera, and Naima Simone.\nYou can look forward to paperbacks, signed book plates, limited edition book boyfriend mugs, the book boyfriend pajamas/loungewear, bookmarks and more!\nTiers include:\n- Cinnamon Roll - $114.99\n- The Alpha - - $169.99 \nEnter the promo code BONKERS10 at checkout to receive $10 off!!! \nONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT 10, 2022!\nIf you have any questions, email orders@honeymagnolia.co.\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/nsbookboyfriends (Naima's Book Boyfriends)",
