  "description": "<p>Nobody ever wants to be called cheap- it’s an insult and brings all sorts of negative connotations with it. However, being frugal is a badge of honor and something worth striving towards. There is a temptation to become cheap when you are looking to get your finances in order, but instead we would encourage frugality over being a cheapskate. In this episode we break down the differences between the two as well as share some stories from when we’ve attempted to be frugal but it ended with us being cheap! In our lives, we’ve found it’s pretty dang hard to label something as cheap vs. frugal because one person’s ‘cheap’ is another’s ‘frugal’. That’s why we discuss our 5 principles or guidelines that will help you determine: are you frugal or are you cheap?</p><p>And during this episode we enjoyed a Stiegl Grapefruit Radler which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
