  "description": "<p>Is there a place for love in business? &nbsp;We have been conditioned to believe that love does not have a place in business. Love is reserved solely for our personal relationships. But why can this not be extended into the business world? This is what ‘Love Is Just Damn Good Business’ by @steve.farber examines. &nbsp;&nbsp;Using Steve’s LEAP framework (Love, Energy, Audacity and Proof) we are better able to understand why love rules above the rest. The book is full of practical examples about how we can increase our self-awareness of not only how we define love but also how to create this for ourselves. The book makes us recondition how we define love in the business world. To care for your staff, customers and the community is to love your business as well as value its ability to make money. For the individual it is asking how they want to fulfil their potential. It starts with asking the right questions. Rather than asking, “What’s my passion?” ask “What gives me purpose?”. This slight change in phraseology has a huge impact on our ability to cultivate our passion. &nbsp;&nbsp;Why I like this book is because it affirms a pre-existing idea that I subscribe to. That idea is that passions aren’t found they are created. Only through diligent and persistent action can you cultivate a passion that lasts. Most people sit back and wait for their passions to find them, however often it is due to a lack of action that they cannot find it. &nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the ideal reader for this book is a business leader or an ambitious employee. Whether you run a large corporate organisation, a small start-up or you just entered the job market, having an awareness of how love ( I prefer the use of kindness) determines the longevity of business is crucial. This book also has similarities to ‘The Thank You Economy’ by @garyvee, so I would definitely check out that book as well if you’re interested in this topic. &nbsp;Comment below if you believe love has a place in the business world? &nbsp;Thank you for watching this video.
