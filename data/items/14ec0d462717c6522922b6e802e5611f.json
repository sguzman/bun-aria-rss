  "description": "How do we project imagined worlds? After all, why do we find ourselves mesmerized by imagined worlds? A collection edited by Anindita Banerjee, Science Fiction Circuits of the South and East (Peter Lang Ltd, 2018), delves into the intricate developments of science fiction while asking the reader to speculate about the nature of internalized worlds which in a myriad of ways engage with externalized dimensions. This collection stimulates the further blurring of boundaries not only in terms of genre interactions, but also in terms of oncological and epistemological frameworks spanning a wide terrain of geographical, aesthetic, ideological, and political matters. Science Fiction Circuits of the South and East conceptualizes science fiction in both local and global contexts and invites us to think about science fiction as an artistic phenomenon that translates diverse modifications that emerge as a result of multiple interactions and events, understood in the broadest sense. As a mode of ontological negotiations, science fiction advances the understanding of literature in terms of effect and affect, which provides space for further theorizing literary developments in the globalized context.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
