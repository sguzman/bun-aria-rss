We read reviews of arcades, arcade bars, and dueling piano bars (for some reason) in Nashville, TN. Then Alex lives up to his challenge, reading negative reviews of kitchen products that weren't used as intended. Hopefully we don't ruin your entire decade with another exploration of awful reviews and the people who write them.</p>\n<p>Support us on Patreon at <a href=\"http://patreon.com/beachtoosandy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">patreon.com/beachtoosandy</a> for a monthly livestream Q&A!<br>\nGo watch our latest YouTube video to see us reveal the man behind the intro: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/l8Qzn-kW2wY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">youtu.be/l8Qzn-kW2wY</a></p>\n<p>Buy our merch! <a href=\"https://store.dftba.com/collections/beach-too-sandy-water-too-wet\">https://store.dftba.com/collections/beach-too-sandy-water-too-wet</a><br>\n</p>\n<p>Logo by Courtney DeKorte.
