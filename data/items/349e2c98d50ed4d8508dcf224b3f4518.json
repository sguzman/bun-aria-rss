  "description": "There is only one truly bipartisan issue in the United States Congress these days: increasing military spending. Every year it passes, and every year we spend trillions of dollars on weapons and soldiers. Money that could be spent on education, homelessness, and infrastructure all goes to the war chest.\nThe Nation’s Katrina vanden Heuvel joins the Useful Idiots to warn of the dangers of the US escalating tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\nIt’s not about helping Ukraine, she explains. It’s about money and power.\nWe’re at war to show that NATO matters. We’re at war to save Biden’s sinking poll ratings. We’re at war so politicians, lobbyists, and pundits can make money.\n“That is not a good reason for a soldier to be away from his family. They’re being used for symbolic fodder.”\nAnd while anti-war groups are speaking up to stop this, mainstream media is a lot louder. CNN, Fox News, and the New York Times are helping shape the propagandist narrative that a Russian invasion is imminent and US troops and weapons are needed to stop it.\nSo don’t listen to them. Let’s find the facts and figure out for ourselves: are there peaceful solutions?\nPlus, attempted cancellations of Joe Rogan and Whoopi Goldberg, Trump’s biggest protest this country has ever seen, and please, don’t inject stuff into your penis.\nIt’s all this, and more, on this week’s episode of Useful Idiots. Check it out.\nAnd stay tuned for the full interview with Katrina vanden Heuvel on Monday at 7am.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
