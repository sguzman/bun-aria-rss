  "title": "Ep 255 | Phil Uses a Fake Name, Baptizes a Preacher, and Makes Off with Jase's King Cake",
  "description": "Phil gives a fake name to two women who got lost and ended up at his church building on Easter, and Jase can't quite figure out why. Phil just seems to attract unusual people to his unusual church plant, including a preacher who wants to be baptized. The guys get into what the Bible says about dressing up for church services, the kickoff of crawfish season, and weird preacher fashion trends. And Jase eats the greatest king cake he's ever had, but it disappears. It looks like Phil is the culprit, but that's not the only mystery surrounding this dessert.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
