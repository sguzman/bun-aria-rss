  "description": "<p>Friday 4/6 - Our girl Cardi B dropped her album today, so you know we had to talk about it. We opened up the phone lines to see if our listeners were feeling the album or not, but you know there are always some haters . Moreover, after a video was released of Conner McGregor attacking a bus of UFC fighters, Charlamagne gave him \"Donkey of the Day\". Speaking of fights we also had UFC Welterweight Champ Tyron Woodley stop by the show and he even gave us some bars, but we will let you be the judge of that. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
