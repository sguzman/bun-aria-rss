  "description": "<p>We’ve been in celebration mode all week as the Book Review’s podcast turns 15 years old. Pamela Paul shared <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/books/book-review-podcast-favorite-episodes.html\" target=\"_blank\">15 of her favorite episodes</a> since she began hosting in 2013. We chose <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/books/review/10-great-interviews-book-review-podcast.html\" target=\"_blank\">10 other memorable conversations</a> from the show’s full archives, and did a bit of digging to tell the story of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/insider/book-review-podcast-anniversary.html\" target=\"_blank\">podcast’s earliest days</a>.</p><p>Now, appropriately, we cap things off with a new episode dedicated to the milestone. This week, Paul speaks with Sam Tanenahus, her predecessor and the founding host, and Dwight Garner, now a critic for The Times who came up with the idea to do the podcast when he was the senior editor at the Book Review. Jocelyn Gonzales, a former producer of the show, and Pedro Rosado, its current maestro, talk about their favorite and unusual memories from over the years. (Did one guest really call in from a submarine? It’s uncertain.) And Paul answers questions about what it’s been like to host the show, sharing a few clips of Robert Caro and others discussing their work.</p><p>We also conduct some business as usual this week, with Tina Jordan looking back at Book Review history during this year of its 125th anniversary and Alexandra Alter discussing news from the publishing world.</p>\n",
