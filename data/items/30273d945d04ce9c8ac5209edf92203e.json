Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying are two Evolutionary Biologists that give you the facts, discoveries and observations as they see it. Tom reads a direct quote from their latest book that says, “We are headed for collapse. Civilization is becoming incoherent around us.” Bret and Heather break down fundamental ideas behind what humans have learned from evolution for thousands of years, how corrupt the science community has become, and how to parent your children with the goal of mitigating risks while they are younger. These biologists are incredibly fascinating with novel ideas of what adaptation would look like for humans if we are careful and intentional.   SHOW NOTES:   0:00 | Introduction to Bret & Heather 0:30 | Headed for a Collapse 3:02 | Learning From Evolution 6:43 | How Are Humans Fish? 13:18 | Solving Novel Problems 18:37 | Redefining Language & Jargon 27:03 | Defining What Science Is 34:14 | Corrupted Science Incentives 39:50 | Break Down Of Society 44:04 | Evolutionary Toolkit 48:27 | Recover from Helicopter Parents 55:34 | Prepare Children for Risks 1:04:41 | Rite of Passage 1:07:05 | The Fourth Frontier 1:15:22 | Steady State Craftsmanship 1:20:59 | Value of Liberty   QUOTES:   “Some things about what we are, are very difficult to change, some things are actually trivial, easily changed, and knowing which is which is a matter of sorting out where the information is housed.” Bret Weinstein [6:24]   “If you use your intuitive, honed instincts, in order to sort through novel problems, you will constantly up and yourself because those instincts aren't built with those problems in mind.” Bret Weinstein [13:23]   “Let's figure out how to use language that we can all agree on and understand and know, for the purposes of communication, as opposed to for the purposes of displaying group membership.” Heather Heying [23:31]   “Teaching undergraduates means exposing yourself and the thinking that you are presenting to naive minds who will throw curveballs at you, and some of those curveballs are going to be nuisances, and maybe they'll waste your time, but some of them are likely to reveal to you the frailty in your own thinking or in the thinking of the field.” Heather Heying [26:05]   “Being courageous about actually acknowledging what you don't know, often leads to the best conversations” Bret Weinstein [26:52]   “We need science where things are sufficiently difficult to observe or counterintuitive.” Bret Weinstein [29:53]   “wherever perception is the mediator of success, you have deception as an important evolutionary force” Bret Weinstein [32:19]   “back away from that which is novel, and untested, and in the direction of that, which is time tested. And it will result in a decrease in anxiety and increase in your control over your own life.” Bret Weinstein [50:49]   “Our brains are anti fragile, and our bones are anti fragile, and they become stronger with stressors.” Heather Heying [1:01:00]   “The very thing that made us so successful as a species is now setting us up for disaster.” Bret Weinstein [1:25]   “Some things about what we are, are very difficult to change, some things are actually trivial, easily changed, and knowing which is which is a matter of sorting out where the information is housed.” Bret Weinstein [6:24]   “If you use your intuitive, honed instincts, in order to sort through novel problems, you will constantly up and yourself because those instincts aren't built with those problems in mind.” Bret Weinstein [13:23]   Follow Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying: Website: <a href=\"https://bretweinstein.net/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bretweinstein.net/</a> Darkhorse Podcast:  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAWCKUrmvK5F_ynBY_CMlIA\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAWCKUrmvK5F_ynBY_CMlIA</a> Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/official.bretweinstein/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/official.bretweinstein/</a> Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bret.weinstein/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/bret.weinstein/</a> Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bretweinstein\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/bretweinstein</a>   Follow Heather Heying: Website: <a href=\"https://naturalselections.substack.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://naturalselections.substack.com/</a> Facebook:  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100069090715633\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100069090715633</a> Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying</a>",
