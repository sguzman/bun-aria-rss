  "description": "<p>Jim and Laura continue their analysis on this shocking, many layered case. We follow the framework of the Topic docu-series “The Missing Children” of Tuam, Ireland. More is revealed about exactly where some of these vulnerable children ended up after being ripped from their destitute mothers. Someone once said “follow the money” and in this case, it is incredibly revealing who profited from the plight of young mothers and their children. This is a human rights violation. Will anyone ever be brought to justice?
