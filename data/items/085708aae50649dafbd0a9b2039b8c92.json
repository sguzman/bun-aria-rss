    "media:description": "Full interview with ex-deputy mayor of Ottawa: https://www.patreon.com/posts/questions-asked-73617390\n\nSpecial thanks to Brody from TV Broadcasting at Algonquin College for getting some of the best footage of the Spectacle!\n\nHttps://www.Instagram.com/greg.guevara\nHttps://www.twitter.com/mc_swm\n\nMISSION STATEMENT FOR PRESS: Mainstream journalists viewing this video may be confused as to the motivation of our supporters (which number in the thousands in this city and the hundreds of thousands across the world). The theme of this event was “Common Ground,” an opportunity for both mayoral candidates to come together and respectfully debate each other’s positions. My movement does not support politics being run in this manner; the only people delighted by the two mayoral options really being friends, going for drinks after, sharing a beaver tail, really only disagreeing over one percent or two percent increases are people with no fundamental stakes in the system we live in. Radical change and big ideas are needed, and they’re needed now; THAT is why we are doing what we are doing.\n\nWell, okay, mostly it was because we were bored. I don’t really know about any of that other stuff I said. Have you tried living in Ottawa Ontario? Not a lot goes on around here",
