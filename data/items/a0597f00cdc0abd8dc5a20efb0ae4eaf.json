  "description": "Nearly 1 in 10 younger U.S. children got a coronavirus shot in the first two weeks of eligibility, and the right wing media is still up in arms that Big Bird encouraged children to get shots in their arms. Meanwhile, a Pod Show exclusive Sesame Street story from A to Z! And Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh's pants caught on fire during a football game. Kevin Hart sits down with Stephen and explains why his new project is intentionally darker and less comedic than the work he’s been known for to date. “True Story” is streaming now on Netflix. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
