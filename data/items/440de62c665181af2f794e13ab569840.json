It has an older history, however. Listeners to the New Discourses Podcast will have heard earlier episodes in which James Lindsay articulates how intersectionality arose from the Critical Marxist Theory of Herbert Marcuse in the late 1960s, but there's another link in the middle of the twenty-five year span between 1964, when Marcuse wrote One-Dimensional Man (https://amzn.to/3pXrjhK), and 1989. That link can be found in the Black Feminist organization known as the Combahee River Collective, which published a manifesto-like statement in 1977 that lays out intersectionality 12 years before Crenshaw ever wrote about it. In the Combahee River Collective Statement of 1977 (https://www.workers.org/wp-content/uploads/CombaheeRiverCollectiveStatement1977.pdf), then, we can find the first articulation of what intersectionality is really about and see unambiguously its deep Marxist roots, cementing the claim that it is, in fact, Identity Marxism.
