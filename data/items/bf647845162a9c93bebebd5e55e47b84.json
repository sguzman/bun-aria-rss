  "description": "A lot has changed since the last time Glenn sat down with “Dirty Jobs” host Mike Rowe. Over the last two years of pandemic, Glenn and Mike agree that many Americans have gotten way too afraid of taking risks. As the government insists that compliance with “The Science” will protect us, Mike tells the truth about the dangers of a “safety first” mentality and why he much prefers putting “safety third.” And he explains why Canada’s Freedom Convoy and the Let’s Go Brandon movement are signs that people are growing tired of being scared into submission. Glenn and Mike also discuss Mike’s biggest lessons from decades in the TV business, why he’s so determined to offer “Work Ethic Scholarships,” and how close he got to hosting \"The Daily Show.\" And Glenn gives Mike a new \"dirty job\" involving CNN …\n\nSponsors:\n\nThe ministry of Pre-Born and Blaze Media are partnering to help rescue babies from abortion in 2022.
