  "description": "Daniel Jeremiah, Bucky Brooks and Rhett Lewis look back at the weekend and pick ten storylines that stood out from Week 12 of the NFL season. To start off, the guys discuss how Jets' QB Sam Darnold is dangerous when he's protected as he had an impressive performance against the Raiders (:29). Next, the trio look how the Patriots keep winning ugly and they dive into their Week 12 matchup vs. the Cowboys (5:14). Then, the guys analyze how Buccaneers' QB Jameis Winston has the best short-term memory in the league (11:11). Later, they talk about why the Saints will win the division, but not necessarily the NFC (22:39). After, the trio look at how the Browns are surging as the team had a dominant offensive performance in Week 12 (29:46). Towards the end of the episode, the guys go into detail on how good 49ers' tight end George Kittle is after he went off against the Packers (33:55). All that and more in this packed episode.<p>Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
