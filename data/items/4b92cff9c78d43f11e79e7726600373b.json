  "description": "<p>This week we’re breaking down Baby Shower. Michael has the Party Planning Committee throw a baby shower for Jan, while Jan has already had her baby and just didn’t tell Michael about it. Jenna does a deep dive on the history of baby showers, the ladies explore the song Son of A Preacher Man, and Angela shares what Phil Shea gifted her after shooting this episode. So you can put this episode to the test, just like Dwight did with Jan’s stroller, but we guarantee it’s a very good, indestructible episode.</p>\n",
