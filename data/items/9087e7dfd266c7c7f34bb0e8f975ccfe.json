  "description": "Sermon On The Mount: Part 4. Anger. This week, we dive into the section where Jesus begins some of His ‘light & heavy' teaching. How is it that we should process anger? How do we show it? What does Jesus have to say about anger and its links to violence? How are we to conduct ourselves as Christians when we vehemently disagree with someone or something? These are are some of the foundational pieces of the Kingdom at hand, the now and not yet. \n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
