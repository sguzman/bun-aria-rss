  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, two-time Attorney General William Barr has given his resignation letter to President Trump. He fought for the law, and the president and was no Jeff Sessions. Barr was prevented by rule 6.e which prevents the Attorney General from releasing information about ongoing grand jury investigations, which included Hunter Biden. Barr was an excellent Attorney General, a real class-act and this program salutes him. Then, on January 6th, 2021 the Archivist of the United States will transfer the electoral votes to a joint session of the US Congress. In 1960 Hawaii challenged the electoral votes in the race between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. The fraud was evident but Nixon chose not to rock the boat, per se. Finding the 2020 election fraud is like a game to the media and Democrats akin to hide-and-seek. Later, the founders feared two kinds of tyranny -- the mob (pure democracy) and the monarchy (the central government)! The Democrats are systemically destroying the Constitution on a state by state basis since they don't have the momentum to get a constitutional amendment passed in Congress. So they have used unconstitutional means like lawsuits and judicial activism to circumvent the rules and now there isn't a court in America with enough courage to stand up for the Constitution because so many of them have been compromised.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
