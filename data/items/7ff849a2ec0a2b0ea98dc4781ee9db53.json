  "description": "<p>Dr. Yungang Bao is a professor at the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the deputy director of ICT-CAS. Prof. Bao founded the China RISC-V Alliance (CRVA) and serves as the secretary-general of CRVA. His research interests include open-source hardware and agile chip design, datacenter architecture and memory systems. Prof. Bao’s contributions include developing the PARSEC 3.0 benchmark suite which has been adopted by leading industry players in China (like Alibaba and Huawei), the labeled von Neumann paradigm to enable a software-defined cloud, Hybrid Memory Trace Tool (HMTT), and Partition-Based DMA Cache. He was awarded the CCF-Intel Young Faculty Award, was the winner of CCF-IEEE CS Young Computer Scientist Award, and received China’s National Honor for Youth under 40.</p>\n",
