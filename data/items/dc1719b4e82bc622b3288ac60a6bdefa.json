  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, there have been 50 terrorists caught at the southern border since October compared with only 2 in 2016. We must assume that terrorists see that we have a weak porous border and take advantage of it. Democrats have steadily followed through with their plans to defund the police and abolish ICE, this defies the 'Take Care' clause of the Constitution. This clause requires the staff of the President to follow the law whether they agree with it or not because it is the sole responsibility of the executive branch to enforce laws, not congress, and not the courts. By not supporting the overwhelmed border patrol, Biden, the Democrats, and their partners in the media are allowing fentanyl and sex trafficking to go on unchecked. Then, Rep. Ro Khanna claims oil companies are lying about global warming 50 years ago with the inception of OPEC. Khanna fails to realize that the left was crying about global cooling back then, not global warming. Democrats think they have all the answers and want to control everything. Later, communist China is a grave threat to this country both economically and militarily. China just launched a new generation carrier ship equipped with the latest technology and weaponry.
