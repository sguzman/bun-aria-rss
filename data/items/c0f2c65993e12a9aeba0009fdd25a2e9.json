  "description": "Another NFL punishment has been doled out just a day after QB Deshaun Watson’s suspension: the Miami Dolphins were stripped of two draft picks, their owner Stephen Ross was suspended until October, and fined $1.5 million. The discipline came as a result of the league investigators finding tampering violations of “unprecedented scope and severity.” The allegations first surfaced from former head coach Brian Flores’ lawsuit against the NFL and the Dolphins, which suggested the team tampered with an unnamed QB, later revealed to be Tom Brady. The league also found that Dolphins improperly contacted former Saints head coach Sean Payton about joining the team. Jeff Darlington explains the origins of the investigation, what it means for the Dolphins, and what happens next.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
