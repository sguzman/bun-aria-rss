  "description": "<p>Kirk's not exactly pleased with a certainly height-challenged Minifan who hosts a show on the Youtube channel, but that doesn't mean he's going to censor is crappy show. After listening to Howard Stern's full interview with Tom Brady, Kirk revises his initial review (0:27:00). Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has dropped out of the presidential race (but not before letting all his Wisconsin voters catch coronavirus while voting), meaning Joe Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee (0:37:40). Steve offers a rare movie recommendation and this one might not be awful (0:51:40). Linda Tripp has passed away, Bill O'Reilly is still getting booked on radio shows, and Kirk blesses a young child's testicles. Plus: Some Wilbur show news.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
