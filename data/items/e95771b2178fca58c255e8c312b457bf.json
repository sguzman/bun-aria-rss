  "description": "What is the geopolitical significance of Putin's torso?  What do his exposed nipples say about Russia and its people.  Why is it absolutely vital that the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, never ever ever never sees Putin's fondness for exposing his naked chest as he did recently on a fishing expedition to Siberia as a challenge?  Why must America never see the First Torso?

These other issues may also lead you to lose your appetite...but in a different way.
