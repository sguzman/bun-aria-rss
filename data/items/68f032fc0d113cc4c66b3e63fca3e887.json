  "title": "#118: How Philosophy Can Change Your Life, Alain de Botton",
  "description": "<p>Alain de Botton (@alaindebotton) is many things, but I think of him as a rare breed of practical philosopher. In 1997, he turned away from writing novels and instead wrote an extended essay titled How Proust Can Change Your Life, which became an unlikely blockbuster. His subsequent books have been described as a ‘philosophy of everyday life’ and subjects include&nbsp;love, travel, architecture, religion and work. His other bestsellers include Essays In Love, Status Anxiety, and The Architecture Of Happiness. More recent works include The News: A User’s Manual, which looks&nbsp;at the impact our obsession with checking news has on our minds, and Art as Therapy, co-written with the art historian John Armstrong. In 2008, de Botton helped start The School of Life in London, a social enterprise determined to make learning and therapy relevant in today's uptight culture. His goal is (through any of his mediums) to help clients learn \"how to live wisely and well.\" In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover many things, including: Real-world versus academic philosophy The value of rituals and tribes Practical pessimism \"Ordinary genius\" The magic of pomegranates Lesser-known modern thinkers Why \"mean\" is often simply \"anxious\" His favorite Japanese pens And much more!
