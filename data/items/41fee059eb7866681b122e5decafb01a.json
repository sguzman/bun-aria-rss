  "description": "<p>The pressure tensor (equivalent to the negative stress tensor) at both\nmicroscopic and macroscopic levels is fundamental to many aspects of\nengineering and science, including fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, biophysics,\nand thermodynamics. In this perspective paper, we review methods to calculate\nthe microscopic pressure tensor. Connections between different pressure forms\nfor equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems are established. We also point out\nseveral challenges in the field, including the historical controversies over\nthe definition of the microscopic pressure tensor; the difficulties with\nmany-body and long-range potentials; the insufficiency of software and\ncomputational tools; and the lack of experimental routes to probe the pressure\ntensor at the nanoscale. Possible future directions are suggested.\n</p>",
