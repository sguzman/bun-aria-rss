    "media:description": "The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture is a millennium prize problem, one of the famed seven placed by the Clay Mathematical Institute in the year 2000. As the only number-theoretic problem in the list apart from the Riemann Hypothesis, the BSD Conjecture has been haunting mathematicians ever since its conception in the mid-20th century, and relates to several different concepts and applications, including Elliptic Curve Cryptography.\n\nThe BSD Conjecture is essentially an attempt to determine rational solutions of elliptic curves through a variety of different approaches, including but not limited to L-functions, statistics, complex analysis and rank determination. In this video I attempt to explain the BSD Conjecture in layman terms without shying away from the inner beauty of the equations.\n\nSlight error at 14:14, the equation should be y^3, not y^2.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMusic Credits:\n\nSpecial thanks to E7VN (https://open.spotify.com/artist/6erp85MigVPLLohx5xPxwT) for creating some great original soundtracks.\n\nInspired by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3918-inspired/\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nWind Of The Rainforest Preview by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5729-wind-of-the-rainforest-preview\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nMusic: https://www.purple-planet.com\n\nhttp://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSources and Citations:\n\n1) Gunter Harder and Don Zagier, 'The Conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer' (https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/zagier/files/tex/BSDwHarder/fulltext.pdf)\n\n2) Popular Talk by Manjul Bhargava in the Clay Mathematics Institute, 2016 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gbQWIzb6Dg)\n\n3) Notes on Bhargava's talk (https://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/bhargava.pdf)\n\n4) Wikipedia contributors, \"Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture&oldid=948783592\n\n5) Stewart, Ian, 'Visions of Infinity: The Great Mathematical Problems' (Basic Books, 05-Mar-2013)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChapters\n0:00 Introduction to Elliptic Curves\n1:40 Intro\n1:50 What is Number Theory?\n3:27 Types of Diophantine Equations\n6:22 Solutions to Elliptic Curves\n11:50 Clock Arithmetic\n13:13 Analyzing Solutions using Modular Arithmetic\n15:45 The Conjecture\n17:45 What's been done?\n19:03 Conclusion",
