  "description": "On this holiday, we bring you a Pick Six special. No surprise Will Brinson is out, but that gives John Breech the opportunity to conduct an interview with one of the most fascinating yet unheralded players in recent NFL memory. Lee Johnson was a punter that had a winding path that took him from being college roommates with Steve Young to the Super Bowl and ultimately to being teammates with Tom Brady. And while Brady wore #10 at Michigan, Johnson was donning that number when the GOAT was selected by the Patriots, hence the reason he wears #12 now.
