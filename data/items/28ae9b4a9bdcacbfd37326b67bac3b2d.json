  "description": "“Pop pop pop pop musik” -M\n\nJonathyne Briggs‘ new book, Sounds French: Globalization, Cultural Communities, and Pop Music, 1958-1980(Oxford University Press, 2015) makes music the historical focus of the Fifth Republic’s first two decades. What made certain sounds “French,” and how did different cultural communities come together, expressing themselves in a variety of musical forms? From Francoise Hardy to Serge Gainsbourg, to the sounds of free jazz, Brittany folk, and punk, the book considers French musical production and consumption in global cultural context. Exploring the relationship between audio and national identities and communities, Briggs tracks both the influences from outside France on a range of scenes in and beyond Paris, and the reach of “French” sounds beyond the nation’s borders.\n\nSounds French  is a book that examines the contributions of artists and listeners, reading “the noise” of (and surrounding) the music treated in its pages. The book also includes links to some of the songs that Briggs writes about (see the companion website developed by OUP). Fans of yÃ©-yÃ©, Johnny Hallyday, chanson, Jean-Michel Jarre, Alain Stivell, Metal Urbain, and/or Daft Punk will all find much to learn and enjoy here.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
