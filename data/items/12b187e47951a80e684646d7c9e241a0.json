  "description": "<div><!--block-->Jessa invites author Bruce Benderson onto the show to discuss the disappearance of the spinster/grandma in film and how women’s roles have changed with the rise of feminism. In film and in real life, why are all women now supposed to have it all? Why do they have to be sexually, financially, & romantically fulfilled? Why is the romantic love the end-all-be-all of a women’s story line? How does that storyline hijack our imagination of how we are supposed to live our lives? And most essentially, has the range of women’s roles actually decreased with the rise of feminism?</div>",
