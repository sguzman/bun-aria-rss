  "description": "The president of the United States, always searching for lower lows, has done profound damage to the military, our system of justice and America's standing in the world by pardoning war criminals from our own military. The risk at which this puts soldiers and civilians in the future is only matched by that which it poses to our entire nation as leaders without values or standards seek to institutionalize their corruption. Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Kori Schake of IISS and Ed Luce of the Financial Times discuss the moral crisis that may both underpin and exceed in danger the Constitutional Crisis that is garnering most of the headlines. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
