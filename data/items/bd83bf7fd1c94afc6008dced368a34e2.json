  "description": "Jalen & Jacoby talk Draymond Green and how he toes the line between getting t’d up and possibly thrown out of a game and getting into his opponents’ heads and getting them out of their game. AND – the Celtics spoke publicly about their issues with the officiating in Game 2, but does public criticism of officiating actually have an impact down the road in any series? The guys chop that up. PLUS – Darvin Ham publicly supported Russell Westbrook during his introductory press conference…Jalen reads between the lines and tells you what Ham was REALLY saying. ALSO – don’t miss a very open and HONEST interview with the legendary Grant Hill. Jalen and Grant discuss their past differences and how they moved beyond them to a place of understanding, friendship, and mutual respect.   \nLearn more about your ad choices.
