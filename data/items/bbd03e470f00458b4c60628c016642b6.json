  "description": "<p>In part two of this series, John Maxwell focuses on the second key to growth, which states that growth means change. To reach for something new requires us to let go of something old. We must learn to embrace the process of learning, unlearning, and relearning if we want to make the most of our tomorrows.</p> <p>At 72 years old, John continues to live out this concept of growth as change. His example of getting rid of his treasure trove of notes and adopting new technology will inspire you to think through where you might need to let go of something you rely on so you can move towards something you want.</p> <p>Mark Cole (CEO of The John Maxwell Enterprise) and Richard Chancy share examples of how intentional change has resulted in significant growth in their lives. They also provide a series of questions to help you assess where you might need to change in order to grow.</p> <p>We have a special BONUS resource for this series: The Four Keys to Growth is a keynote address John did for the Live2Lead event. He provides more great content than we can share on the podcast, so we’re providing you with a video of the entire keynote. You can access the video by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Live2Lead and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.” </p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.johnmaxwellacademy.com/live2lead-2019-live-event-registration\"> Live2Lead 2019 Registration</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/15-Invaluable-Laws-of-Growth--Hardcover_p_2871.html\"> <em>The 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth</em> by John C.
