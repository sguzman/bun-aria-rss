  "description": "The CEO of global investment manager VanEck, Jan van Eck, is reportedly expressing optimism that the Bitcoin price will rise to stratospheric heights.\n\nThe VanEck CEO says that Bitcoin could rally by around 732% from current levels to reach $250,000 per coin, according to a report by business publication Barron’s.\n\n“Investors see it as a complement to gold. That’s the short version. Bitcoin has limited supply; the supply is visible. And it’s very hard, almost impossible, to change that.
