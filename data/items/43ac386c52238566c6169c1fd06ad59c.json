  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, we have a shadow government working under Joe Biden, and the media and democrat party have put us here. Democrats have put us in a position where we have a mentally ill President of the United States that should be removed via the 25th amendment, but his successors are Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi. This is similar to when Woodrow Wilson had a stroke and his wife became the defacto acting president. Then, Democrats are for climate change so the media is for climate change. This is how they push their economy-killing, degrowth agenda. Later, Fox News Media Correspondent Joe Concha joins the show to discuss his new book \"Come On, Man!: The Truth About Joe Biden's Terrible, Horrible, No-Good, Very Bad Presidency.\" Concha predicts that President Biden will not run for re-election.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
