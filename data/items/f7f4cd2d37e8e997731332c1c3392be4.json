  "description": "<p>This week we bring you an eye witness who shares her scary encounter with Sasquatch-.A listener wrote into the show - \"I have had two experiences. One sighting and one crazy night of noises, both occurred in the northern part of the southern peninsula of Michigan. It is SO hard to explain to someone how the sound these guys make, just goes right THROUGH you, literally. And people just can't comprehend the body mass on these guys. When I had my sighting, I was in my car and I really thought this thing might try to cut me off and do....who knows what. It is a VERY scary feeling. This creature was so fast, it was mind boggling. It changes you.\"</p>",
