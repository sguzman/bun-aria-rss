Getting there is only the beginning! For the first time, Randy is sharing his secrets to how he has been able to maintain his success, improve his quality of life, and SUSTAIN his successes.</p> <p>We dive deep into HOW he continually reinvents himself and how he has used \"NO\" as a gift to accomplish even more!</p> <p>A driving factor for Randy, after his Faith, is his humility and his compassion. He gets candid about the fear, anxiety, and depression we all come across at times but how these emotions can be used to course CORRECT and come back into alignment with our higher calling and purpose.</p> <p>He reminded me of something essential, especially during these times of COVID-19, we look at the most SUCCESSFUL people in life today, and we FORGET that they came from the same place we did... we forget at one point they were just a kid with a DREAM, just like US!</p> <p>We cover a lot of topics in this interview including health, the advice Randy received at 20 years old that he’ll never forget, and how these times may be an OPPORTUNITY of a lifetime to build your BIGGEST dream yet.</p> <p>Remember this, SOMEONE else out there NEEDS exactly what has been put in your heart to create and this interview will help you unlock that dream and bring it to fruition.</p> <p> </p>\n",
