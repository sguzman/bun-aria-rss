  "description": "<div>Today on another episode of real ghost stories online that has been reviewed by the motion picture association of America, and deemed to be suitable for all audiences, except stray dogs named lucky. <br>\n<br>\nThat’s right, heed this warning if you own a stray dog named lucky. Listening to this show in his presence could cause violent outbursts, including but not limited to, lucky attacking and eating near by cats, gerbils and at times a stray possum. It may also cause the dog to speak in tongues and take on the persona of Jeffery Dahmer. Hiding in your home, sneaking out at night, luring young men back to your home, and turning them in to stir-fry. <br>\n<br>\nWhen a paranormal investigator comes face to face with something paranormal in his own home, he soon realizes how dangerous and malevolent some forces can be. As some of these forces, come very close to not only haunting him, but possibly, taking over his mind.<br>\n<br>\nThat’s story, and much more, today on Real Ghost Stories Online. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>If you have a real ghost story or supernatural event to report, please write into our show or call 1-855-853-4802!</strong><br>\nIf you like the show, please help keep us on the air and support the show by becoming an EPP (Extra Podcast Person).
