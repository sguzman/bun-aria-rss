  "description": "<p>Fayetteville, North Carolina was settled nearly 240 years ago and has witnessed much history in that time. The city has deep Scottish roots with pioneers immigrating from the Scottish Highlands. There are quite a few spirits here and we are going to take you along as we visit a few of them on our 2022 Road Trip.  We also discuss a few of the highlights of that road trip through 10 states with our ultimate destination being Salem, Massachusetts. And did we bring something home with us? We share about a little possible ghostly visit in our home! The Moment in Oddity features Siphonophores and This Month in History features the launch of MTV.</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br />  <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2022/08/hgb-ep-448-haunted-fayetteville-north.html<br />    <br /> Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>Music used in this episode: </p> <p>Main Theme: Lurking in the Dark by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>(Moment in Oddity) Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4578-vanishing<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>(This Month in History) In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3906-in-your-arms<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>Outro Music: Happy Fun Punk by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>Music: Farm [full version] by Alexander Nakarada<br /> Free download: https://filmmusic.io/song/8206-farm-full-version<br /> License (CC BY 4.0): https://filmmusic.io/standard-license<br /> Artist website: https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com/</p>",
