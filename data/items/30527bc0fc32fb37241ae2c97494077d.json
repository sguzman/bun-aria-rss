Cheap, charismatic and virtually indestructible, it was many Brazilians' first car and is affectionately known as the Fusca. \n\nThe Fusca played a key role in the development of Brazil's economically and politically vital national car industry. \n\nIn 2014, Candace Piette spoke to two Fusca superfans, Silio Boccanera and Edivaldo Fernandes.  \n\n(Photo: A Fusca in the colonial town of Paraty.
