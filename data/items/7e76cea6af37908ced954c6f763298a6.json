  "title": "Quarter-Season NFL Awards: Russell Wilson and Aaron Rodgers in 2-man race for MVP? (Football 10/6)",
  "description": "Cue the now very real sound effects. It's Wednesday and it's the Brady Quinn Football Show in your podcast feeds! This week, Will and BQ discuss Bill Belichick's scheme on Monday vs. the Chiefs (7:00) before further analyzing the firing of one of the members of his coaching tree, Bill O'Brien (11:45). What are the next steps in Houston? Brady offers his insight. We're 4 weeks into the season, so it's only appropriate for the guys to hand out quarter-season NFL awards (32:00). Russell Wilson and Aaron Rodgers are atop the MVP conversation, but there are some other names you shouldn't count out just yet. Defensive Player of the Year is a wide open race, but Will and Brady keep their picks within the AFC North. They stay there for Offensive Rookie of the Year as Joe Burrow has proven to be the obvious selection early on, but if Justin Herbert keeps his job, he could be a threat. Defensive Rookie of the Year and Coach of the Year picks are made to round out our quarter-season choices. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @Brady_Quinn, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
