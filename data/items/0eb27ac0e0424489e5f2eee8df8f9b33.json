  "description": "<p>Team Minihane emerges TRIUMPHANT from the much anticipated The Dozens Trivia battle with Team Nightmare. Kirk, Jared, and Steve recap an awe-inspiring performance by the team's captain and an unexpected clutch play by the producer. Kayce Smith of Team Nightmare joins the show to put to rest some rumors about her anger at Kirk, and to agree that she was ahead of her skis when she \"guaranteed\" a victory (0:16:30). Jared has resignation on his mind, but Kirk reminds him that only the Saugus Rocket can help the team navigate WWE questions in future matches. Kirk tries to lift Jared's spirits with a little hitting the post (1:26:00). Steve seeks to settle the score with a Minifan who admits to wanting to cancel him with Murchison-style tactics (1:56:00).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
