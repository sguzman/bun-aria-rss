  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alpha Underdog Empowerment has hit 350 episodes, a huge milestone. Starting the podcast 4 years ago, Zach was broke and clueless, but he was determined. Since then, the brand has grown into something truly incredible. With a successful first live event this year, pulled together in just 45 days, Zach was feeling ambitious. Even though he was maxed out after that event, he decided to host another just 50 days later. The goal was to do a smaller event every 90 days, leading up to the one big yearly event. The second event, the Alpha Dog Pound, took place recently and was a learning experience. Zach decided one big event every year is good. So, with a full 10 months to plan his next big event, Zach is ready to knock it out of the park. He already has one guest speaker confirmed. It’s a big name that he’ll be dropping in the next couple months. However, if you’re looking to network and grow with a group that’s aligned with you and your core values, the Alpha Dog Pound may be a good fit. It’s a group that Zach is growing slow and methodical. With only about 10 more spots opening up next year, you can get on the waiting list at</span> <a href=\"http://www.alphadogpound.com\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">alphadogpound.com</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the last 6 months or so, Zach has been wanting to get away from internet marketing. With everyone always posting their highlight reel, it’s become so fake. There are so many influencers out there that act like they’re better than others in an attempt to cover up their own flaws. Wouldn’t it be better if influencers stopped talking crap on others, and instead pointed out their own flaws and how they’re working on them? That’s the approach Zach has been trying to take. He feels like it’s more relatable and sets an example that, yes you can go to work on your own personal, dark demons. You can start slaying them instead of running away from them. That’s the only way to truly build the life you want. So many of us feel like we have to always be building and collecting wins, only to feel good for a short time before asking what’s next. If you want to find fulfillment, you have to deal with your issues. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zach struggled with never feeling good enough growing up. That manifested into the mindset of proving everyone wrong. That tactic was great for a time, it was necessary to survive what he’d gone through. But, after doing everything they said he’d never do, Zach still didn’t feel good enough. It was time to go from surviving to thriving. It was time to deal with his demons head on and that’s often not compatible with internet marketing. People are too busy trying to position themselves like they’re perfect and have it all going on and figured out. While it is a means to feed his family, what really keeps Zach around is the messages he receives from people saying his content has helped them. He hopes to get going in real estate so he doesn’t need to make money online anymore, because 99% of it is just trash. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He’s more interested in focusing his passion on the Alpha Dog Pound, and Alpha Underdog Empowerment. He reminds everyone that next time you’re going through a rough path, to remember to zoom out and look at where you were 5 years ago. 5 years ago Zach was just dreaming of the home he lives in now. He couldn't even imagine back then that he’d be into homesteading now. He’s started a garden and is about to get chickens. It’s a life skill that’s therapeutic, gives his family the best food to consume, and saves money. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How to achieve fulfillment. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest mistake influencers make.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What Zach’s real estate investment plans are.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">And much more!</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Developing character and skill is a never-ending process.” -Zach Babcock</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get podcasting help</span> <a href=\"https://podcastpowertrain.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to grow your business</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><br /> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!
