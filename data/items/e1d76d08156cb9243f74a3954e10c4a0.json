  "description": "If you are even remotely interested in Russian cuisine, you probably have an oil-stained, batter-spattered copy of the 1983 classic cookbook, A Taste of Russia, by Darra Goldstein lurking on your shelves. You might also have Goldstein's award-winning Fire + Ice, her masterful exploration of Nordic cuisine, or the authoritative The Georgian Feast, which introduced readers to the marvelous flavors of the Caucuses. Make room for Goldstein’s latest triumph: Beyond the North Wind: Russia in Recipes and Lore (Random House, 2020)\nNot content to rest on her considerable laurels, Goldstein set out on a challenging but ultimately rewarding journey to discover the \"quintessential flavors of Russia.\" Braving the extreme cold of Russia's Arctic, Goldstein journeyed to a part of Russia where ancient methods are still being employed to produce flavors and dishes that fuse the traditional with the innovative.\nWith Goldstein's compelling signature style of combining history, culture, and food, Beyond the North Wind is both an engaging travelogue and an appetite-whetting cookery book, filled with new interpretations of classic Russian peasant food. Here are the hearty soups, stews, and braises, but also innovative fish dishes, creative desserts, and revamped pies and pastries. Discover the tangy sweetness of local berries, the crisp flavors of Arctic herbs, flavored salts, and the umami of whole grains. This is a cuisine close to the earth, shaped by long winters and short, intense growing seasons. Above all, this is a story of resilience: of the Russian people and their tenacious ability to survive and thrive in adversity, be it political, economic, or climatic, and their inimitable spirit that celebrates the here-and-now with hospitality and zeal.\nDarra Goldstein is the author of Fire + Ice, which was nominated for a James Beard, IACP, and The Art of Eating awards. She is the founding editor of Gastronomica: A Journal of Food and Culture, named Publication of the Year by the James Beard Foundation. Darra also serves as a series editor of California Studies in Food and Culture and has written for Gourmet, Saveur, Bon Appetit, and The New York Times. Follow Darra on Twitter, and Instagram.\nJennifer Eremeeva is an American expatriate writer who writes about travel, culture, cuisine and culinary history, Russian history, and Royal History, with bylines in Reuters, Fodor's, USTOA, LitHub, The Moscow Times, and Russian Life. She is the award-winning author of Lenin Lives Next Door: Marriage, Martinis, and Mayhem in Moscow and Have Personality Disorder, Will Rule Russia: A Pocket Guide to Russian History.\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
