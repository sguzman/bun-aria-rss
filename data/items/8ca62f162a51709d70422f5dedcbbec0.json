  "description": "<p><p>NFL Week 13 Fastest 2 minutes (2:27 - 10:35). We recap every game from Sunday. Hank has taken the Patriots panic button out of the closet, the Bengals won a game. We're now a Derrick Henry appreciation podcast. The Eagles and NFC East are a dumpster fire, the Browns Brown'd it up in Pittsburgh. The Redskins are hot and we talk about Nick Foles having the weirdest NFL Career of all time. Justin Tucker's worth, Jon Gruden is losing it and the Chargers played the exact same game yet again (10:35 - 100:43). We recap Thanksgiving Day games, who's back of the week and a quick recap of CFB Rivalry Week.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
