  "title": "Mike Bush: Kia Ora",
  "description": "<p>Mike Bush, the former Commissioner of the New Zealand Police, served for more than four decades in law enforcement – starting as an 18-year-old constable, serving as a detective, and promoting up through the ranks of this highly professional and respected organization.  </p><p>The population of New Zealand is roughly five million people.  About one in six New Zealanders are of Maori descent – an indigenous Polynesian community – and that community has historically been underserved.  Building ties to the Maori community was a priority for Mike, as was recruiting more citizens of Maori descent to the department, so that the New Zealand Police better reflected the diversity of the country.</p><p>One of the initiatives Mike developed and promoted as Commissioner was something he called “Prevention First” – to change the focus of policing from a model of locking people up to a model of early intervention, designed to prevent crime in the first place.  Mike knew that gave his officers more of an opportunity to help people and to keep them safe.   </p><p>The New Zealand Police have long been leaders in community policing.  More than half a century ago, the New Zealand Police dropped the word “force” from their name and to this day their officers do not routinely carry firearms.  The New Zealand Police have a well-deserved reputation for integrity and decency, and Mike describes their efforts to earn and preserve that reputation and to serve the diverse communities in his country.  </p><p>Though violent crime is relatively rare, Mike investigated some of the biggest and most interesting cases in New Zealand history, including the successful recovery of a five-year-old girl who had been kidnapped, and a cold case investigation of a young murdered woman, solved through ingenious forensic work.  </p><p>And, while posted overseas for part of his career, Mike was a first responder to the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami that struck Thailand – where he was stationed – and many other south east Asian nations, killing almost one quarter of a million people.  Mike describes how law enforcement officers from around the world responded to that horrific tragedy.</p><p>Mike Bush had a fascinating career in the New Zealand Police, ultimately running the service and leading its 13,500 men and women.  He helped transform policing in his nation, and is widely regarded as a visionary law enforcement professional.</p><p>If you have thoughtful feedback on this episode or others, please email us at <a href=\"mailto:theoathpodcast@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">theoathpodcast@gmail.com</a>.</p><p>Find the transcript and all our previous episodes at <a href=\"http://msnbc.com/TheOath\" target=\"_blank\">MSNBC.com/TheOath</a></p><p><br /></p>\n",
