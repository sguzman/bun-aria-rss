In this first installment of a special three-part series, The Vanished  probes the circumstances around the 12-year-old mystery that has confounded everyone from the small town detective on up to the DEA special agent who gave the case a special assist. \n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
