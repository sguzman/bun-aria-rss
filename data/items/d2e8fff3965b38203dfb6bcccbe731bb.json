  "description": "Larissa Fasthorse's new collection of plays includes the wildly successful plays The Thanksgiving Play/What Would Crazy Horse Do? (Theatre Communications Group, 2021). In both plays, Fasthorse explores issues facing contemporary Native Americans, but also white America's complicated self-identity in an era of multiculturalism. In The Thanksgiving Play, four white people with varying degrees of theatre experience try to stage a historically sensitive Thanksgiving pageant for a local school, with predictably disastrous results. What Would Crazy Horse Do? features the last two members of a fictional tribe who are forced to confront uncomfortable aspects of their own history when they learn that their grandfather participated in a reenactment of a powwow as part of a Klan rally. This gut-churning play reveals the fallacy of any ideology of racial purity, whether involving whites, indigenous peoples, or any other group. Together, these two plays are a riotously funny but ultimately unsettling look at contemporary politics of race and representation.\nAndy Boyd is a playwright based in Brooklyn, New York. He is a graduate of the playwriting MFA at Columbia University, Harvard University, and the Arizona School for the Arts.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
