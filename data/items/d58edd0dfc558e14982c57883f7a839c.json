  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br>In 2022, book bans in United States schools and libraries are at their highest since the ALA Office of Intellectual Freedom started collecting data. Bans are happening around the country, in every state, and disproportionately affecting books by and about LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC people. What’s more, challenges are likely underreported, because librarians who are resisting them are facing unprecedented workplace retribution and in some cases physical danger.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Book Bans are on the ballot on November 8th, in every state and local election, up and down the ticket. State legislatures, local town councils, county leadership and school boards are being overrun with candidates supported by conservative activists looking to limit access to books and ideas that offer identity, empathy, awareness, and power to young people around the country. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We’re concerned, so today, we’re releasing a special episode of Fated Mates focused on book bans across the country.
