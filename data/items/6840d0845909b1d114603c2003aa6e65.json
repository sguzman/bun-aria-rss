  "description": "<p> View on Odysee: https://odysee.com/EvoLens105:ab84d3cbe2a641c230507d2a3406fdf5d0972168 <br/><br/>In this 105th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. <br/><br/>We discuss compliance, and that non-compliance is not inherently a bleak, dark, dreary place; it can be joyous. We read an excerpt from Catch-22. The Multnomah County Sheriff’s office is—in contrast—a bleak and dreary place these days. Then we investigate how “crossed state lines” is like “horse dewormer”? The Atlantic goes full gossip girl on vaccines. And we discuss the virtues of being in one place, really being there, and getting to know it over time. <br/><br/>Get your “Welcome to Complex Systems” shirts here: store.darkhorsepodcast.org <br/><br/>Heather’s newsletter, Natural Selections (subscribe to get free weekly essays in your inbox); last post: why we should not allow medical transition for children; next post: higher ed: https://naturalselections.substack.com <br/><br/>Support the sponsors of the show: ReliefBand: Get relief from nausea without drugs.
