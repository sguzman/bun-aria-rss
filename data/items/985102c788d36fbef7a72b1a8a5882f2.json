  "title": "#139: Meet \"Scorpion,\" The Real-Life Santa Claus with an IQ of 197",
  "description": "<p>This episode might make your head explode... in the best way possible. Walter O'Brien (AKA \"Scorpion\") (@walterobrienscs) is the founder of Scorpion Computer Services&nbsp;and ConciergeUp.com, a for-hire global think tank that provides intelligence-on-demand as a concierge service. The&nbsp;tag line&nbsp;for the latter is, \"for any funded need.\" Need to defend against chemical warfare? Move an entire manufacturing operation over a weekend? Save a loved one from a deceitful spouse? Thread the needle on a thorny legal issue? Become a pop star in a foreign country? When Walter and his team of 2,000+ distributed geniuses say \"any funded need,\" they mean it literally. Born in Ireland, Walter was diagnosed as a child prodigy with an IQ of 197. He became an Irish national coding champion and competed in the Olympics in informatics. Fast forward to today, he and Scorpion get paid to fix every imaginable problem for billionaires, startups, governments, Fortune 500 companies, and people like you and me. On the large side, it ranges from mitigating risk on $1.9 trillion of investments to inventing artificial intelligence engines to protect&nbsp;United States&nbsp;war fighters&nbsp;in Afghanistan. Walter is also the executive producer of the hit CBS TV show Scorpion, inspired by his life, which has reached more than 26 million television viewers. I was introduced to Walter well before&nbsp;the show, and we go deep in this conversation, with lots of amazing and also hilarious examples of&nbsp;problem solving. Enjoy! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. This podcast is brought to you by Wealthfront. Wealthfront is a massively disruptive (in a good way) set-it-and-forget-it investing service, led by technologists from places like Apple. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and now has more than $2.5B under management. Why? Because you can get services previously limited to the ultra-wealthy and only pay pennies on the dollar for them, and it’s all through smarter software instead of retail locations and bloated sales teams. Check out wealthfront.com/tim, take their risk assessment quiz, which only takes 2-5 minutes, and they’ll show you—for free–exactly the portfolio they’d put you in. If you want to just take their advice and do it yourself, you can. Well worth a few minutes to explore: wealthfront.com/tim. This podcast is also brought to you by Boll and Branch.&nbsp;There is a lot of nonsense in the bedding business. For instance, did you know thread-count is not a good measurement of quality? It's a total myth. The \"Made in Italy\" label? It isn't something you should necessarily&nbsp;pay extra&nbsp;for because it generally means it's just finished in Italy&nbsp;and woven in places like China. The general industry mark-up for bedding&nbsp;is 700 to 800 percent at most retailers. Boll and Branch create&nbsp;incredibly high-quality bedding. They are the same sheets you'll find at my home in San Francisco. The best part? You can try anything you order at home&nbsp;for 30 days. If you don't love it, send it back and get a full refund. Go to Boll and Branch and use promo code \"TIM\"&nbsp;for 20% off your entire order. Whether sheets, towels, blankets, duvet covers, or anything else. Shipping is always free.</p><p>***</p><p><strong>If you enjoy the podcast, would you please consider&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-tim-ferriss-show/id863897795?mt=2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>leaving a short&nbsp;review&nbsp;on Apple Podcasts</strong></a><strong>/iTunes?</strong>&nbsp;It takes less than 60 seconds, and it really makes a difference in helping to convince hard-to-get guests.
