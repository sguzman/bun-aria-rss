  "description": "<p>r/Idontworkherelady In today's episode, OP is a black man attending a work event at a restaurant with his colleagues. He is very clearly a member of the party and not a restaurant worker, but that doesn't stop a Karen from handing him her keys and demanding that he go get her car. OP tries to politely explain that he's not part of the valet service, which prompts the Karen to call OP the worst thing you can call a black woman. I really wish OP had thrown her keys in the gutter!</p>\n",
