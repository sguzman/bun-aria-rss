That's right! Martin Luther King Jr. not only received the Nobel Peace Prize but set history with being the youngest man and second Black man to receive the Nobel. In this episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, Maia will share why MLK received this great honor and as well refresh us on some history of why King is so important to society today.
