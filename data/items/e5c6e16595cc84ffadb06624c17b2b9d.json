  "description": "<p>We give the explicit equations for a P^3 x P^3 embedding of the Jacobian of a\ncurve of genus 2, which gives a natural analog for abelian surfaces of the\nEdwards curve model of elliptic curves. This gives a much more succinct\ndescription of the Jacobian variety than the standard version in P^{15}. We\nalso give a condition under which, as for the Edwards curve, the abelian\nsurfaces have a universal group law, with no exceptions.\n</p>",
