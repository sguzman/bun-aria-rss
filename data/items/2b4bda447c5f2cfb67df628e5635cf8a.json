And across the centuries the fates of three women are linked: to this place, to each other.\n\nIn the early 1700s, Sarah, accused of being a witch, flees for her life.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War, Ruth navigates a new house, a new husband and the strange waters of the local community.\n\nSix decades later, the house stands empty. Viv, mourning the death of her father, catalogues Ruth’s belongings and discovers her place in the past – and perhaps a way forward.\n\nEach woman’s choices are circumscribed, in ways big and small, by the men in their lives. But in sisterhood there is the hope of survival and new life. Intricately crafted and compulsively readable, The Bass Rock burns bright with anger and love.",
