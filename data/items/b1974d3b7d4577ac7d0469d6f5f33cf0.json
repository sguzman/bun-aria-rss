  "description": "<p>    Mikey Garcia, one of the GREATEST boxers in the WORLD, was always destined to be a world-class boxer. He is a world champion in four weight classes and currently a unified lightweight world champion, having held the WBC title AND the IBF title.    On top of his amazing record and accomplishments in the ring, Mikey's insight into peak performance and Maxing Out inside and outside of the ring are going to help you tremendously!    “Visualization,” Mikey says, “is a big part of my training. I visualize every minute of every round.”    His is also a story of immigration. The son of immigrant parents, Mikey watched his parents barely survive as field workers for nearly 20 years and transform their lives to produce one of the greatest boxers of all time.  Their story will move you in ways you can't imagine.   I had the powerful and inspiring opportunity to sit down with this UNDEFEATED boxing champion. With 39 wins, 30 by way of knockout, this interview details how the champion within the boxer was created and will literally knock the wind out of you!    Please SUBSCRIBE to all platforms, by CLICKING THE LINK IN MY BIO.    SHARE, REVIEW, COMMENT, REPOST, and TAG SOMEONE to spread the word about the fastest growing show on earth! </p>\n",
