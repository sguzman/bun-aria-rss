As part of his critique of anti-semitism, Sartre criticized the responses of some Jews to this situation, e.g. denying that the persecution exists, pretending to not be Jewish, or in any way accepting the terms of anti-semitism and setting up one's life in reaction to it. Sartre instead recommends solidarity and \"concrete liberalism,\" which we try to figure out.</p> <p>Listen to <a href= \"https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/03/11/ep211-1-sartre/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">part one</a> first. <a href= \"http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com/support\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Please support PEL!</a></p>",
