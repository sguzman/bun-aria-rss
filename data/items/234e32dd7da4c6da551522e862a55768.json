  "description": "<p>For more than 20 years, broadcast executive and Radio Hall of Fame President Kraig Kitchin worked side by side with Rush Limbaugh as a business partner, friend, and confidant in developing the most successful radio talk show in history. James Golden, a.k.a. Bo Snerdley, sits down with Kraig to discuss how the Rush Limbaugh Show came to be what it is today. From the early days in New York City to the addition of several hundred affiliates across the country (plus a few pirate stations in the Caribbean, as Rush might say), Kraig gives you a unique perspective of Rush’s business acumen, in addition to sharing intimate details of how he learned of his advanced lung cancer diagnosis and how the decisions were made to carry on with the program during his treatment. This episode also contains an appearance from radio and Fox News personality Sean Hannity, who narrates a special feature dedicated to Rush’s early Top 40 radio days in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
