  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Israeli police have been called in to keep the peace in an uprising in Jerusalem. Hamas took advantage of the crisis and fired rockets into the region hurting hundreds. The Biden administration is causing great damage by pretending that both sides are at fault when this was clearly a one-sided attack. Then, a Russian front group has Cyber-hacked an east coast oil pipeline. Biden's softness is being tested and he's called for both the cyber gang and the energy company to calm down. Later, the IRS is claiming a backlog of tax returns because of faulty printers. The agency is behind by 32%. Yet, the crime of being a Trump supporter is clear. Individuals that merely attended the Capitol Riot are having their civil rights trampled and America is silent. 1500 inmates are kept in their cells for 22-hours per day as they await their trial. This egregious violation has made few headlines in Washington DC even garnering rebukes from Sen.'s Elizabeth Warren and Dick Durbin. Afterward, Biden claims that his American Rescue Plan is working yet unemployment is high, fuel costs are high, and the deficit spending has been unprecedented. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
