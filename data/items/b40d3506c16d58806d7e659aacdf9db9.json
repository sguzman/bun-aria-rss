  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, following the resignation of Justice Stephen Breyer, President Biden has said that he will nominate the first Black woman to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. The practice of hiring someone based on race or sex has been found to be unlawful for schools, businesses, and others but when Biden does it it’s no longer a problem. The perverse ideology of American Marxism has crept into every facet of our government including the judiciary. Then, Anthony Fauci has famously flip-flopped on the mask issue multiple times and now he's getting called out in a new ad by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Fauci's lack of commitment is shielded from the public by those in the media that carry water for the Democrats. Later, in response to a guest's comment about racism being a war, MSNBC host Tiffany Cross said, \" everybody needs to pick up a weapon and get involved because this is for the safety and lasting of the country.” Afterward, author Julie Kelly calls in to discuss how one federal district judge, who is angling for a spot on Biden's Supreme Court shortlist, is handing out very stiff sentences to the political prisoners of the January 6th riot at the capitol. Kelly added that previous reports that then-Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris was in the building have now been debunked.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
