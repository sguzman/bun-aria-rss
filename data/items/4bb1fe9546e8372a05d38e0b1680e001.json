  "description": "<p>5 Rounds In The Magazine!\n\nRound 1: Update the safety brief. If you see a WW2 era munition, DO NOT SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS. \nRound 2: Good initiative, bad judgment. Man gets caught using a fake arm to get the vaccine in Italy. Sadly, his lack of integrity will earn both Nonnas an extra shift of fire watch. \nRound 3: British troops apparently dont complain all the time. If that’s the case, we should not be allies with the British. It’s as simple as that. \nRound 4: Interview\nRound 5: Just to caveat off the safety brief in round 1, we'd like to remind you that burning the snakes that have infested your home, might just result in you burning your own house down.
