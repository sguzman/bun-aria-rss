  "description": "\"Human migration is both inevitable and growing. What are we as a global community doing to address it?\" asks human rights lawyer Becca Heller, who believes that every refugee and migrant deserves a safe pathway to resettlement. Through her work with the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), Heller is showing how the power of the law can help displaced people find homes. By providing access to legal information and services, IRAP champions a functional, rights-based legal system that empowers resettlers to find long-lasting safety. (This ambitious plan is a part of the Audacious Project, TED's initiative to inspire and fund global change. If you want to hear even more about Heller's work, stick around after the talk on the \"TED Talks Daily\" podcast, where she digs deeper into her ideas.)",
