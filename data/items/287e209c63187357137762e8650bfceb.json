I got excited and decided it was time to take our relationship to the next level, meaning it was time for sex. We have been together for six months and we were friends for 2 years before we started dating. We haven’t had sex, but we sleep in the same bed a lot and I like to sleep in my underwear...............</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
