  "description": "The third 2020 debate was last night, and Glenn pulls out the record player at Grandpa Biden’s request. TheBlaze sent a writer to Houston to get the media’s reaction firsthand: Castro’s a jerk, Harris was cringey, and no one cared about Klobuchar. Brad Meltzer finally talks to Glenn about his new children’s book, “I Am Walt Disney,” and how a shared goal helped him secure the rights to use Mickey Mouse. Bill O’Reilly also recaps the “amazing” debate and describes how a socialist president WILL cause a depression. Glenn gets even more coverage from Darin and Gabrielle, the two viewers he hired to watch the debates for him. While there was no clear winner, the candidates tried really hard to make Trump and guns the losers. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
