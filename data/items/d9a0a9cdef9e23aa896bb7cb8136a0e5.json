  "title": "Why podcasts are better than radio (Jad Abumrad, co-host, Radiolab)",
  "description": "Jad Abumrad, the co-host of WNYC Studios' hit show Radiolab, talks with Recode's Peter Kafka about the new season of More Perfect, a spinoff podcast about the Supreme Court. Abumrad says he was getting \"restless\" a couple years ago at Radiolab, and so dispatched his team to find interesting stories from the judicial system. He also talks about the intense process of making Radiolab — episodes can take a year to report and cost $100,000 — and why, in the heat of the political protests in Charlottesville last month, his team decided to pull down a controversial episode. Plus: The \"really weird\" way Abumrad was informed he'd won a MacArthur \"genius grant,\" which he initially suspected was a Nigerian email scam.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
