  "description": "In his new book, Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV (Broadside Books, 2011), Ben Shapiro, who is the youngest person ever to get a nationally syndicated column in the U.S., details the story of how television executives use the medium to spread political propaganda. Shapiro interviewed over one hundred prominent media figures, from the writer of House to the former president of ABC Entertainment and NBC, to get a sense of the political agendas driving those who produce scripted TV. In our interview, we talked about how politics makes shows dated, the conservative cast members of the A-Team, and why he won’t watch Glee. Read all about it, and more, in Shapiro’s revealing new book.\n\nPlease become a fan of “New Books in Public Policy” on Facebook, if you haven’t already.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
