  "description": "<p class=\"\">This week, it’s one of Sarah’s favorites, and by an author Jen has never read! Lorraine Heath is a master of the historical, and this one is near-perfect. It’s complex and nuanced and it has an infidelity plot and THERE IS SO MUCH ANGST!</p><p class=\"\">We love having you with us! — subscribe on your favorite podcasting platform and like/review the podcast if you’re so inclined!</p><p class=\"\">In two weeks, we’re reading the Queen of Dirty Talk! Sarah and Jen both love Tessa Bailey — so we’ll be talking about our two favorites of her books, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bvLWs4\"><em>Asking for Trouble</em></a> (Sarah’s) and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bt3THH\"><em>Protecting What’s His</em></a> (Jen’s).

You can also check out the blog, <a href=\"https://sensedisability.wordpress.com/\">Sense and Disability</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Callalily57\">@Callalily</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- <a href=\"https://www.audiofilemagazine.com/narrators/kate-reading/\">Kate Reading</a> is an amazing audiobook narrator, she's the one who narrates <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/11/25/s0212-lord-of-scoundrels\">Lord of Scoundrels</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- <a href=\"https://www.standoutbooks.com/fridging/\">Fridging</a> is a word from comics that is when women characters are killed to motivate a male character, but can be used to describe any time a less powerful or privileged character is used as a plot device. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Stanley\">Flat Stanley</a> is a character in children's books, but <a href=\"https://www.litcharts.com/literary-devices-and-terms/flat-character\">flat characters</a> you might remember from English class.</p><p class=\"\">- Harry and Meghan are still taking money from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/europe/harry-meghan-charles-duchy-of-cornwall.html\">the Duchy of Cornwall</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- Jen said she was going to go back and read the other books in the trilogy, and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2w4BI1r\">they are bundled together on Amazon for $10</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test\">The Bechdel Test</a> is a pretty simple way of judging how inclusive movies are of women characters; <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/22/16807424/alternatives-bechdel-test-bad-moms-lena-waithe\">it's limited</a> but <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/do-this-years-best-picture-oscar-nominees-pass-the-bechdel-test\">powerful</a>. Jen wrote about <a href=\"https://www.tbqsbookpalace.com/2018/07/jens-review-unraveled.html\">external and internal conflict in romance</a>, but we also talked about it on <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/11/4/s029-priest-by-sierra-simone\">the Priest episode</a> -- and we are always unpacking the way conflict works in romance.</p><p class=\"\">- Dialogue tags get a bad rap, famously <a href=\"https://writingcooperative.com/write-it-like-elmore-leonard-ditch-formal-language-82e642c1c692\">Elmore Leonard claimed that writers should only use \"said\" and \"asked.</a>\" In this part of the discussion, Sarah mentioned her friend <a href=\"https://barrylyga.com/morally-complicated-ya/\">Barry Lyga, a YA author</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- Jen thinks these three are <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/anxiety-zen/201609/6-signs-codependent-relationship\">codependent</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- Cheating is <a href=\"https://grammarist.com/usage/third-rail/\">the third rail</a> of romance. It is. There are some <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/cheating-romance\">lists on Goodreads of romances that have cheating</a>, but it's complicated and difficult. One Jen read recently was <a href=\"https://amzn.to/37hQ3Vs\">I Want You Back by Lorelei James</a>, but the cheating happened in the past. If you're interested in reading another book about someone who discovers the other family, Jen recommends <a href=\"https://amzn.to/37jD0CO\">Silver Sparrow by Tayari Jones.</a></p><p class=\"\">- Next time, we'll be reading Tessa Bailey, The Queen of Dirty Talk. Sarah's choice is <a href=\"https://amzn.to/39xK8x3\">Asking for Trouble</a>, and a secondary text is the first one of that same series, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OMZgyn\">Protecting What's His</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- Buy <a href=\"https://www.jenreadsromance.com/shop\">stickers and buttons from Kelly</a> and <a href=\"https://jordandene.com/collections/romance-sarah-maclean\">t-shirts from Jordan</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- We are experimenting with some voice to text <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/transcriptions/season-2-episode-23\">transcripts, so here's the first one for this episode</a>.</p>",
