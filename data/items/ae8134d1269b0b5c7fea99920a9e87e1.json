  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing a recent interview Drew did with a doctor who was cancelled for expressing concerns over Covid vaccine mandates. They also harken back to the comments made by Rochelle Walensky in regards to her children being allowed to go to summer camp. Adam also recounts his recent experience shooting a tv show where he had more than one person come up to express that they agree with his take on Covid but can't express it for fear of losing their job. They then turn to the phone and speak to a caller who wants a third category added to Adam's 'stupid or liar'. They also speak to a caller who recently read Adam's book and wants to discuss people who have been 'deputized' post covid and are exercising any power they can find.\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nTenThousand.cc/ADS\nCon-Cret.com/Podcast\nAmerican Hartford Gold - offers.americanhartfordgold.com/adam/",
