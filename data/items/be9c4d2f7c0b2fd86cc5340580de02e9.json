Love, joy, grief, guilt, beauty–no words can communicate these. We can only represent them in stories and pictures and songs. Art is the way we speak the meaning of our lives.</p> <cite>Andrew Klavan</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>He is led more by his ears than his understanding, taking the sound of words for their true sense…His ill-luck is not so much in being a fool, as in being put to such pains to express it to the world, for what in others is natural, in him (with much ado) is artificial.</p> <cite>Thomas Overbury, in “A Mere Scholar”</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Granted that the average man may live for seventy years, it is a fallacy to assume that his life from sixty to seventy is more important than his life from five to fifteen.

Any normal child will instinctively to agree with your own American poet, Walt Whitman, when he said: “To me every house of the day and night is an unspeakably perfect miracle.”</p> <p>In my tales about children, I have tried to show that their simple acceptance of the mood of wonderment, their readiness to welcome a perfect miracle at any hour of the day or night, is a think more precious than any of the laboured acquisition of adult mankind…</p> <cite>Kenneth Grahame</cite></blockquote> <h3>To Althea, from Prison</h3> <p><em>by Richard Lovelace</em></p> <p>When Love with unconfinèd wings <br /> Hovers within my Gates, <br /> And my divine <em>Althea</em> brings <br /> To whisper at the Grates; <br /> When I lie tangled in her hair, <br /> And fettered to her eye, <br /> The Gods that wanton in the Air, <br /> Know no such Liberty. </p> <p>When flowing Cups run swiftly round <br /> With no allaying <em>Thames</em>, <br /> Our careless heads with Roses bound, <br /> Our hearts with Loyal Flames; <br /> When thirsty grief in Wine we steep, <br /> When Healths and draughts go free, <br /> Fishes that tipple in the Deep <br /> Know no such Liberty. </p> <p>When (like committed linnets) I <br /> With shriller throat shall sing <br /> The sweetness, Mercy, Majesty, <br /> And glories of my King; <br /> When I shall voice aloud how good <br /> He is, how Great should be, <br /> Enlargèd Winds, that curl the Flood, <br /> Know no such Liberty. </p> <p>Stone Walls do not a Prison make, <br /> Nor Iron bars a Cage; <br /> Minds innocent and quiet take <br /> That for an Hermitage. <br /> If I have freedom in my Love, <br /> And in my soul am free, <br /> Angels alone that soar above, <br /> Enjoy such Liberty.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lxJE1Q\">The Truth and Beauty</a></em> by Andrew Klavan</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3MFij9K\">First Whisper of “The Wind in the Willows”</a></em> by Kenneth Grahame</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3LksfEa\">Jayber Crow</a></em> by Wendell Berry</p> <p><a href= \"https://apilgriminnarnia.com/2011/12/28/c-s-lewis-on-three-ways-of-writing-for-children/\"> “On Three Ways of Writing for Children”</a> by C.
