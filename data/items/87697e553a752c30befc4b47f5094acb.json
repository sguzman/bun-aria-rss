  "description": "In Episode #228, I sit down with Dr Stuart Phillips and Dr Christopher Gardner for a discourse on how much protein we really need. We discuss nitrogen balance, lack of protein vs lack of exercise, and protein restriction. We also cover protein quality, satiety, and environmental considerations. Recommended daily intake (RDA) is a key factor in this conversation, with discussion points including its definition, the studies used to inform it, and whether you should eat above it.\nThere is ongoing conversation about protein requirements across all eating patterns, with this contentious topic often sparking debate on social media. With protein regularly used as a marketing tool or to push an agenda, many online sources are diluted and separated from the evidence. Dr Gardner and Dr Phillips – both from different fields – have recently taken varying stances on protein, engaging in a Twitter dialogue. In this episode, we bring both of their informed perspectives to the table, and ask: how much do their opinions really differ?\n\nSpecifically, we discuss:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nAnalyzing the RDA for Protein (3:13)\n\nWhat is Optimal? (17:36)\n\nDr. Gardner’s Approach to Protein (22:25)\n\nAging & Muscle Preservation (33:38)\n\nHow much is TOO much? (38:32)\n\nPlant Protein (44:21)\n\nEnvironmental Concerns (56:54)\n\nSatiety (1:01:52)\n\nOutro (1:07:24)\n\n\nYou can connect with Dr Christopher Gardner on Twitter.
