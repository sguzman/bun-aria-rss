Also Five Headlines including the nun at the RNC convention last night sent in to do battle against the DNC’s fake nun. There was a clear victor. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel the New York Times for an article that asks us to feel sorry for men who get caught by police while trying to have sex with children.\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
