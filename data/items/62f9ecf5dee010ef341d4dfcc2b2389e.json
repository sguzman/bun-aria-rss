    "media:description": "Sound changes left French unlike Latin, Italian, Spanish or Romanian. How? Here's the recipe.\n\nSubscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=NativLang\nBecome my patron: https://www.patreon.com/NativLang\n\n~ Briefly ~\n\nFollow my animated recipe for a taste of how sound shifts changed French pronunciation throughout the ages: Latin, Gaulish and Frankish influence, an early Romance era of Oïl vs Oc, Old French, Middle French, the Renaissance, all the way to Modern and then Contemporary French.\n\nYes, it's a recipe! I originally wrote this as a more direct history. After much tinkering I wanted to recreate the story of the sounds of French as a pastry.\n\n~ Credits ~\n\nArt, narration, animation and some of the music by Josh from NativLang\n\nSources for claims made, and credits for most of the music, fonts, sfx:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1lo0bvzhli24783Ox5_THM3rHHe4lNV-7iO2jpqS3UF8/\n\nLicensed Music:\n\nLaid Back Guitars by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3964-laid-back-guitars\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\n\nDanse Macabre - Sad Part - no violin by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3597-danse-macabre---sad-part---no-violin\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\n\nSardana by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5002-sardana\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\n\nMarch of the Spoons by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4021-march-of-the-spoons\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\n\nVillage Consort by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4585-village-consort\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\n\nSuonatore di Liuto by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4440-suonatore-di-liuto\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\n\nHeavy Heart by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3865-heavy-heart\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\n\nSilver Flame by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4362-silver-flame\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\n\nThinking Music by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4522-thinking-music\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\n\nDuet Musette by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3685-duet-musette\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\n\nSneaky Snooper by Jason Shaw\nLink: https://audionautix.com/\n\nLicense: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode",
