  "title": "Kirk Minihane Gets the Rich Kelleher Experience",
  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane is chaffing at the editorial oversight of Barstool Sports, but that's barely even a blip in today's episode of the Kirk Minihane Show. The real headline? Rich Kelleher is fucking crazy. Two heavyweights of the Minifan Universe, Dave Cullinane and Kelleher, squared off today live and in person. Were we worried that one of them brought a gun? Yes. Are we still worried? Yes. Is Blind Mike dead somewhere right now. Chances are good. But the King of the Crazies wouldn't have it any other way. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
