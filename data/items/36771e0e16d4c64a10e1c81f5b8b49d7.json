  "description": "<p>Meditation: Collecting, Unifying and Opening the Mind (a favorite from the archives) - We begin with a listening attention, relaxing open, letting sounds wash through. Scanning through and feeling the aliveness of the body, listening to the breath. Not pushing away anything - a very open and relaxed, receptive attention. Sensing what's happening in this present moment. Closing by sensing all in the foreground and in the background - that alert inner stillness, that light of awareness, that which is our deepest, formless nature.</p> <p>Free download of Tara's 10 min meditation:<br /> \"Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease\"<br /> when you <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/6YfI\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">join her email list</a>.</p>",
