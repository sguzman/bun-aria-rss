  "description": "In Central Asia: A New History from the Imperial Conquests to the Present (Princeton University Press, 2021), Adeeb Khalid presents a comprehensive narrative of modern Central Asian history based on original research and an exhaustive synthesis of recent scholarship. \nKhalid explores how the modern forces of empire, revolution, and communism (and its collapse) have shaped both the \"Russian\" and \"Chinese\" parts of Central Asia from the 18th century to the present. Countering portrayals of Central Asia as a remote and inaccesible land on the peripheries of modern history, the author demonstrates how the region's connectivity and its participation in global exchanges of goods and ideas shaped its developments in the modern period. Students, specialists, and non-specialists will be delighted by Khalid's ability to capture the complexity of modern Central Asian history and deliver it in a readily accessible format.\nNicholas Seay is a PhD student at Ohio State University\nLearn more about your ad choices.
