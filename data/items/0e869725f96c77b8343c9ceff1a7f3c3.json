We learn how the script supervisor acts as a conduit to the Editor and their relationship to the director and the other departments. We also talked about handling a shoot with multiple units and multiple cameras. We delved into continuity and when it matters and when it doesn’t. Nicoletta leads us through the different aspects to the job of script supervisor - a very informative episode!</p>",
