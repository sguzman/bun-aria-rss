Born and raised in the great state of Massachusetts, Abigail wrote over 1,100 letters to her husband, President John Adams, throughout his political career.

Abigail was a trusted wife, loving mother, charitable educator, smallpox inculcator, ammunition maker, and at times, she was referred to as “Mrs. President.” Join Sharon and Kaben as they discuss the incredible life and legacy of Abigail Adams.</p> <p>For more information on this episode including all resources and links discussed go to <a href= \"https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast\">https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
