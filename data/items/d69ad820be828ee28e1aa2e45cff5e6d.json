  "description": "In this final installment of Amos Mortier's story, Vanished producer Nathan Comp gives us a peek into the evidence he says points to someone other than Big Jake Stadfeld, who police have eyed as their main suspect for the last 12 years. Former Det. Shannan Morgan, who headed the investigation into Amos's disappearance for nearly eight years, gives her reasons for fingering Stadfeld over all these years, despite the fact that nothing came from her probe. In this jaw-dropping finale to our four-part series on Amos Mortier's befuddling disappearance, you have a front-row seat to a missing person investigation run amok. \n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
