  "title": "PMS 2.0 519 - Aaron Rodgers Tuesday Week 6, Monday Night Football Recap, Mike Pereira, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ, and the boys chat about last night's Monday Night Football game and the Titans' big win over the Bills, why nobody is concerned about the Bills being a wagon, how you stop Derrick Henry in the 2nd half of a football game, if Mike Vrabel is pissed all the time while coaching, if we should take the Titans more serious, the decision to go for a touchdown instead of a field goal to send it into overtime, and much more as they wrap up week 6 in the NFL. Joining the program fresh off a win and a declaration of ownership in Chicago, is the QB of the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat, Aaron, and AJ chat about this weekend's game, if he knew the \"I own you\" quote was going to go as big as it did, how he feels about where the team is at right now, he sets the record straight on a few things that have been taken out of context, why it didn't feel like the last time he would play at Soldier Field, the important of the Packers/Bears rivalry, the newest entry in the Aaron Rodgers bookclub, and much more (15:46-52:37). Later, former NFL Vice President of Officiating, current CFB & NFL on FOX Rules Analyst, Mike Pereira, joins the program to chat about why the officiating has been so bad, what he thinks the problem is, how we fix it and make it better, why the current set up is never going away, and much much more in a candid conversation about the current problems with officiating in the NFL (52:41-1:19:03).
