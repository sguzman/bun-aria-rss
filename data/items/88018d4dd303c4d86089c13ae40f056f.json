Pocket Planes is a game developed by NimbleBit for iOS and was available for Android up until 2015. It’s a simple airline sim that has you buying airports and planes to expand your airline. I played this game when it first came out in 2012 a lot. So, July 20th, 2012, I uploaded this video “Pocket Planes Hints and Tips” as a way to help people out. I’ll be going through the video today, specifically, the lore of the video. If you haven’t watched the video, that’s okay, I’ll be explaining the key points in each hint and tip needed to understand the lore anyway. How deep does it go? Sit back, relax, and let’s find out.\n\nThe one and only \"Pocket Planes Hints and Tips\" ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sc-fUKqftU\n\nSUBSCRIBE ► https://www.youtube.com/Sunflower41XD\nPATREON ► https://www.patreon.com/SunflowerYT\nTWITTER ► https://twitter.com/WeedStain69 \nINSTAGRAM ► https://www.instagram.com/sunflower_illy \nTWITCH ► https://www.twitch.tv/thiccyflower\nCHECK OUT THE DISCORD! ► https://discord.gg/hwnMbWy\n\nMY ICEBERG PLAYLIST ► https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaNAZk-mm5xT-Q93_cbFv1GZ2j0SGc__T\n\nCHANNEL ART BY Harru\nYouTube ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD8ieEwwSCzJHycjKR44CxQ\nInstagram ► https://www.instagram.com/harru.art/ \nTwitter ► https://twitter.com/HarruM0 \nTwitch ► https://www.twitch.tv/harru_m/\n\nMUSIC USED IN THE VIDEO\nLillie Exists - cianwood city (lofi edit) – lillie ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDM-GTEJ56w&t=54s \nMario Kart 64 – Choco Mountain\nPersona 4 – Reasoning\nPersona 4 – Borderline of Madness\nMihkelMacaroni - drip fortress 2 (original) ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv44NStkJeY&t=0s \nPersona 4 – Reverie\nandroid52 - android52 - dancing all night ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJtGnnhYZOo \nhttps://soundcloud.com/android52\n\nVIDEOS USED IN THE VIDEO\nIGN (Pocket Planes Trailer) ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=001yXkzj7J4\nAlpharad Deluxe (\"Need healing\") ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgbM6hlwy7A",
