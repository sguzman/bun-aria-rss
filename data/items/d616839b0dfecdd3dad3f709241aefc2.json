The half-baked Rousseau-ism in which most of us have been brought up has given us a subconscious notion that the free act is the untrained act. But of course, freedom has nothing to do with the lack of training. We are not free to move until we have learned ot walk. We are not free to express ourselves musically until we have learned music. We are not capable of free thought unless we can think. Similarly, free speech cannot have anything to do with the mumbling and grousing of the ego. Free speech is cultivated and precise speech, which means that there are far too many people who are neither capable of it nor would know if they had lost it. A group of individuals who retain the power and desire of genuine communication is a society. An aggregate of egos is a mob.</p> <cite>Northrop Frye</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>He had had a choice, after all. The army had been keen to keep him, even with half his leg missing. Friends of friends had offered everything from management roles in the close protection industry to business partnerships, but the itch to detect, solve, and reimpose order on the moral universe could not be extinguished in him. He doubted it ever would be.</p> <cite>Robert Galbraith</cite></blockquote> <h3>The Composer</h3> <p><em>by W. H. Auden</em></p> <pre class=\"wp-block-verse\"> All the others translate: the painter sketches  A visible world to love or reject;  Rummaging into his living, the poet fetches  The images out that hurt and connect.  From Life to Art by painstaking adaption  Relying on us to cover the rift;  Only your notes are pure contraption,  Only your song is an absolute gift.   Pour out your presence, O delight, cascading  The falls of the knee and the weirs of the spine,  Our climate of silence and doubt invading;  You, alone, alone, O imaginary song,  Are unable to say an existence is wrong,  And pour out your forgiveness like a wine.</pre> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3yKMKWu\">The Dwarf</a></em> by Par Lagerkvist</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3uUk38f\"><em>The Well-Tempered Critic</em></a> by Northrop Frye</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3oahawi\"><em>Formation of Character</em></a> by Charlotte Mason</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aHm8NY\">Anatomy of Criticism</a></em> by Northrop Frye</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ckiLx3\">Lethal White</a></em> by Robert Galbraith</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3OcwdAj\">Poet’s Corner</a></em> by John Lithgow</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3OfbuvH\">Rob Roy</a></em> by Sir Walter Scott</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3PfOeyP\">The Wise Woman</a></em> by George MacDonald</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aMmmUa\">The Princess and the Goblin</a></em> by George MacDonald</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3zbZNBH\">Paradise Lost</a></em> by John Milton</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aGVDZh\">The Wood Beyond the World</a></em> by William Morris</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3oeUN8V\">Phantastes</a></em> by George MacDonald</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IM2vRm\">Ivanhoe</a></em> by Sir Walter Scott</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cexjOF\">The Bride of Lammermoor</a></em> by Sir Walter Scott</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3RHfGr6\">Evelina</a></em> by Fanny Burney</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3AW7A7Z\">The Boys</a></em> by Ron and Clint Howard</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3AVQUgY\"><em>The Most Reluctant Convert</em></a> by David C.
