  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the biggest story of the day today is Iran. U.S ally Saudi Arabia has been hit with precision accuracy in a drone strike combined with cruise missiles from Iranian soil. This attack may have been a test to see how precise an attack like this could be on the U.S's Fifth Fleet which is stationed very close by in neighboring Bahrain. With half of Iraq being controlled by Iranian militia and half of Syria overrun by Iran, the Iranians are becoming a bigger and better threat to the U.S and the world as they impact global oil production. Iran is a hostile regime and must not give our enemies the wrong idea by meeting with them. Iran will take this as a first step in their aggression toward America. Later, the leftist media will not relent on their assault on Justice Brett Kavanaugh, unleashing more fake news about him designed to intimidate and threaten. The articles were quoted from a book and were partial and unsubstantiated. This comes on the heels of media leaks from the New York District Attorney's office that they will subpoena the President's financial records by intimidating the accounting firms that handle Trump's financial records and engaging them in a monetary war of attrition.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
