  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I often find myself walking through this particular Downtown Los Angeles Park around noon where the sun directly hits. I know there is an official name for the park, but I can never remember it. Everyone I know just calls it “Protest Park”. It’s the middle of March where in Los Angeles the temperature is warm and then cools once the sun starts hiding behind the buildings. As I enter the park through the northwestern entrance, I have an overview of the space and admire at the purple Jacaranda petals that blanket the ground. I like to sit on the benches underneath the trees and let my mind escape into the sky.</span></p>",
