  "description": "<p>For most normal people, personal finance is boring! There are many reasons why Americans have a really difficult time getting their money act together, but today we’re addressing the fact that we’d rather spend our time doing almost anything else. This is a problem as it takes intentional action for the rubber to meet the road and for our hopes and dreams to be turned into a debt slaying, wealth building reality. Gamifying our personal finances can help us to <em>actually</em> achieve some of those goals when it would otherwise be something we wouldn’t do at all. When we can figure out what it is about a particular game that we love, then we can bridge that gap and take some of the elements from the games we love and apply them to our personal finances. We really believe that gamification will level up your money game.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Astral Prism by Modern Times Beer- another big thanks to our friend Craig there at the brewery for donating this one!
