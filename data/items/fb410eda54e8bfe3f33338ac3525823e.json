The incident comes a day after President Aleksandar Vucic issued a shoot-on-sight order for any UAVs violating Serbian airspace.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong></strong>The drone was detected and followed in the sky over the Raska garrison and came from the direction of Mt. Kopaonik, the Serbian military said in a statement, adding the UAV was <em>&ldquo;brought down using electronic jamming measures.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.11/thumbnail/636146c72030270a290a6639.jpg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Serbian Air Force Mig 29 fighter planes fly over the Batajnica military airport near capital Belgrade.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565753-serbia-drones-kosovo-military/\">Serbia issues drone shoot-down order</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    \n\n<p><em>&ldquo;The skies over Serbia are safe,&rdquo;</em> Defense Minister Milos Vucevic told reporters on Wednesday evening.</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;We did not use cannons but the most modern [electronic] equipment,&rdquo;</em> Vucevic added. <em>&ldquo;This shows we are serious. We do not threaten anyone, we aren&rsquo;t saber-rattling, but we are determined to protect Serbia and its freedom and independence.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p><strong></strong>According to the newspaper&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.novosti.rs/c/vesti/politika/1169191/hitno-vojska-srbije-oglasila-oborenom-dronu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vecernje Novosti</a>, the drone came down somewhere on Mt. Kopaonik. Military search parties expect to locate it before Thursday morning.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;In accordance with the standing orders of the president and commander in chief, the Serbian Army will continue to shoot down any UAVs entering restricted airspace or approaching military installations,&rdquo;</em> the military said.</p>\n<p><strong></strong>Vucic announced the shoot-down order on Tuesday, after two MiG-29 interceptors were deployed against multiple UAVs spotted above the military bases in Raska.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Novosti cited unconfirmed reports that the drone was a commercial model and was used to scout the area, which is near the boundary with the&nbsp;province of Kosovo.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong></strong>Kosovo was occupied by&nbsp;NATO in 1999 and declared independence in 2008 with US support. Belgrade refuses to recognize the breakaway province, a position supported by Russia and China.<strong><br /></strong></p>",
