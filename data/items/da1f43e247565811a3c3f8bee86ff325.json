  "description": "My special guest tonight is Clete Keith who's here to discuss the paranormal activity experienced inside one of Beverly Hill's most beautiful mansions.\nClete Keith never had thoughts of writing a book, let alone one on the paranormal. He was not someone totally convinced in the existence of ghosts or spiritual hauntings-until he started working at Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills. After twenty-two years and retirement looming, he woke up one night at three o'clock with the idea of writing a book about all the stories he has heard as well as his own experiences. Ghosts of Greystone - Beverly Hills is not just a collection of ghost stories, but a landmark exposé of eyewitness accounts detailing supernatural activity associated with this extraordinary location. Having been approached by many guests, patrons, and employees over the years, Keith has heard it all. \"Two tourists walked up to me and asked how they could get inside the mansion for the tour. When I told them the interior is closed to the public one replied, 'Oh, because we saw a man in period clothing staring out the window and we thought he was part of the tour.'\" This marks just one encounter of 237 paranormal stories documented at Greystone Mansion. Keith spent nearly three years interviewing and researching the supernatural activity at the estate. With 86 interviews, including guests of the park, City staff, police officers, movie crew personnel, and janitorial services, Ghosts of Greystone - Beverly Hills promises you a riveting history and ghostly encounters. For more than two decades, the mystery surrounding the strange events taking place in and around Greystone Mansion have been suppressed, ignored, and disbelieved... until now. \"From a paranormal perspective, the estate is extremely active,\" warns author and investigator Clete Keith. \"Until now, witnesses to unexplained phenomena have been reluctant to come forward fearing ridicule, as well as accusations that their experiences are nothing more than junk science. I believe it's time to open the lid on this Pandora's Box, one shrouded in secrecy, and finally reveal the mystery inside.\" Along with rare photographs and intriguing details about the landscape and architecture, Keith delves into the family of Ned and Lucy Doheny, including the fateful murder/suicide on the night of February 16, 1929, and other unfortunate deaths that surround these enigmatic grounds that may have stoked the paranormal fire of active.\nWant more paranormal episodes?
