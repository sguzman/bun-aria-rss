  "description": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/zen__r/\">Zen Rahmoun</a> is living what may be the story of our age: that of the refugee. Whether triggered by war, climate change, political upheaval, or economic collapse, one in 95 people around the world have been forced to leave their home, resulting in over 82 million refugees. Well over a thousand people drown every year trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to find a better life in Europe. Zen was almost one of them. </p><p>Please consider <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://chrisryan.substack.com/subscribe?utm_medium=web&utm_source=subscribe-widget&utm_content=51429990\">subscribing</a> to my hybrid newsletter/blog/podcast.</p><p><em>Also, if the frequency of these emails is too much for you, I’ve set up a monthly option, so you’ll just get a summary of what I’ve posted once in a full moon.
