  "description": "Today we welcome Atlanta-based designers Will Huff and Heather Dewberry. They are the dynamic duo behind the boutique, residential interior design firm Huff-Dewberry, Inc. Their signature style brings together timeless beauty and modern comfort while reflecting the personality of their clients in their design. They have been featured in House Beautiful, Southern Home, and many more publications, including their recent cover feature in Atlanta Homes & Lifestyles. Heather and Will talk about what they’ve learned in their 20-year work partnership, how they use antiques in a fresh and modern way, their favorite colors and how to use them, and so much more!\n\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nHow did Will and Heather each get started in design? And how did they team up?\n\nWhat are the biggest strengths and weaknesses they see in each other?\n\nHow are Heather and Will able to use antiques in a modern way for their projects?\n\nWait. Is chocolate brown making a comeback?!\n\nWhat are Heather and Will’s g0-to colors and how do they use them?\n\nWill’s tips and tricks for finding the best rug.\n\nHeather and Will break down the good trends vs. the bad trends in design right now.\n\nHow to choose wallpaper that will last?\n\nHow to lead the eye outside through doors and windows.\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma\nHi Casey,\nWe tend to gravitate towards 28” side tables with a lamp on them. With the shape of your sofa, you could try a drinks table with a floor lamp so it’s not a huge side table. This would give the functionality of having somewhere to put your drinks without taking focus from the sofa arm. You could even just have a coffee table and floor lamps if you want to keep it simple. For the window treatments, we would tuck the panels into the window and go all the way from the crown molding to the floor with the drapery. Maybe to keep it light and bright try a simple white or use a trim or print in the blue-green from the sofa. Regarding the mantlepiece, you can paint the brick the same white as the bookcases and mantle so it looks more like one white wall with interest and texture. For the backs of the bookcases, you could paint them one shade lighter than the blue-green sofa or even a slightly textured white and blue-green wallpaper. You can also fill the bookcases with a collection of things so the speakers aren’t the focal point and become part of the layout. One big rug would definitely help to soften this area and tie it all together. You could put a bench in front of the fireplace or another small “perching” spot for some extra seating. Some pillows and throws would also add some warmth and personality, as well!\nThis is a really welcoming spot and we can’t wait to see what you do with it.\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\n\nHuff-Dewberry, Inc\n\nHeather Dewberry on Instagram\n\nWill Huff on Instagram",
