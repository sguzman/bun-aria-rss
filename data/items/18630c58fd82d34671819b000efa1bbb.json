Howard Stern has shot down claims that his in line to get a $100 million payday from Sirius XM, and Kirk has a new theory about what's going on. Dan \"Big Cat\" Katz, host of Barstool Sports' Pardon My Take, joins the show to talk about the VP debate, low NBA ratings, Chinese internment camps, negotiations with Sirius XM, and why he loves Fleetwood Mac (0:44:30).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
