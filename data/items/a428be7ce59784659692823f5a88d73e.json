  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p><p>There are multiple layers to unpack when discussing Black women and girls who die by suicide. Historically much of the research conducted around suicide has been synonymous with whiteness, although Black women harming themselves is not a new phenomenon. As death by suicide has continued to rise among Black women and girls in recent years, pointed research in this area is still sorely lacking. This week we're joined by Dr. Jeannette Wade and Dr. Michelle Vance, Assistant Professors at North Carolina A&T State University, whose work centers suicide research & intervention among Black women and girls. In this conversation, we explored psychological stressors like sexism and racism that can lead to suicidal ideation, how research efforts conducted by and for Black women can save lives, and the importance of humanizing Black women with mental health issues. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast!</p><p><a href=\"https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a></p><p><a href=\"https://afsp.org/what-to-do-when-someone-is-at-risk\">Helping Someone Who May Be Suicidal</a></p><p><a href=\"https://afsp.org/find-a-support-group/\">Support Groups for Those Who've Lost Loved Ones to Suicide</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Wade</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeannette-wade-phd-918a4628/\">LinkedIN</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dr.j.wade/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Vance</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA3O24gB8Ds1BUcarNUkHsLBzFQ6UwjXmAY/\">LinkedIN</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drmichellevance/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p><p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
