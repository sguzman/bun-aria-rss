  "description": "What does it take for all girls to achieve? What will it take to remove the seen and unseen barriers-- some a matter of policy and others cultural practice--to more girls achieving the equitable education that is their human right? Sally Nuamah has an answer to these questions. She is the author of How Girls Achieve(Harvard University Press, 2019). Nuamah is assistant professor at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, a documentarian, and entrepreneur.\nDrawing on ethnographic research in classrooms in the United States, Ghana, and South Africa, Nuamah calls for a new approach to overcome institutional sexism: feminist schools. Feminist schools will actively teach girls how and when to challenge society’s norms, and allow them to carve out their own paths to success. How Girls Achieve combines political science theory, lessons from educational practice, and application to public policy.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
