  "description": "Change. What holds us back from accomplishing it, why do we fail time and time again in pursuit of it, and how can achieve it once and for all? It is what frees us from being stuck in our ways and it opens up our lives to new opportunities, perspectives, and paths that we didn’t even knew existed. On this episode of Impact Theory, Tom Bilyeu joins psychotherapist and author  Lori Gottlieb to discuss such matters and more as they explore the power of therapy, how to move on from your past and forwards towards change, and why self-compassion is crucial to leading a happy life. They discuss how to become unstuck in your negative ways, how to truly achieve change in your life, why it’s crucial you need to have self-compassion, the freedom in knowing you have choices, how to see things from other people’s perspectives, how forgiveness is truly achieved, and ways to overcome trauma and pain.
