There is an identical symmetry between graphs of cosmic macro phenomena and the graphs of the hydrogen wave function or its probability density. The hydrogen atom&#8217;s wave function or probability density describes macro phenomena, or macro phenomena describes hydrogen atom&#8217;s wave function or probability density, or both.\n  \n   "
