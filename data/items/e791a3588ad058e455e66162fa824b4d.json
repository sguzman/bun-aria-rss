  "description": "<p>America's self-important baseball writers have elected not to send anyone -- and especially not Curt Schilling -- to the baseball Hall of Fame. Kirk decides that a more important HOF -- the Minifan Hall of Fame -- shall be established. But who will the voters be? Kirk clears up some fake news Steve spread on Intern Justin's recap show about the time and nature of the next Madawaska show; Stacy is A.W.O.L. Kirk addresses the controversy erupting over Barstool CEO Erika Nardini's audacious decision to promote the National Women's Hockey League, even entertaining the idea of owning a team one day (0:36:30). Of course, none of the keyboard cowboys (and cowgirls) who lashed out at Barstool this week would come on the show for a civil discussion. The Boston Globe employees continue to get shafted by billionaire owner John Henry. A stunning resignation in the Minifan Community.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
