  "description": "<p>Sam Bankman-Fried—or simply SBF—is the founder and CEO of FTX, one of crypto’s biggest exchanges. In this episode, we dive into how Sam built a company worth $30 billion… in less than three years! And before the age of 30!</p> <p>As a centralized exchange unicorn, FTX has exploded into the mainstream, sponsoring massive sports arenas and partnerships with celebrities like Tom Brady. The mainstream-ification of FTX culminated with its Super Bowl ad with Larry David, which had a significant cultural impact on FTX and crypto more broadly.</p> <p>Is Sam on Team DeFi? Or is FTX a competitor? And what about banks? SBF also recently appeared in front of Congress. After this discussion, we are increasingly convinced of the alignment between Bankless and SBF.</p> <p>------<br /> ✨ DEBRIEF ✨ | Ryan & David's Unfiltered Thoughts on the Episode<br /> <a href= \"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/debrief-sbf\">https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/debrief-sbf</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 📣 OPOLIS | Sign Up to Get 1000 $WORK and 1000 $BANK<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Opolis\">https://bankless.cc/Opolis</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER:          <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a>  <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST:                 <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/ </a> </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS: </p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>🍵 MATCHA | SMART ORDER ROUTING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Matcha\">https://bankless.cc/Matcha</a> </p> <p>🚀 SLINGSHOT | LAYER 2 SOCIAL TRADING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Slingshot\">https://bankless.cc/Slingshot</a> </p> <p>🏦 GEMINI | TURN FIAT INTO CRYPTO<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Gemini\">https://bankless.cc/Gemini</a> </p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Brave\">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 5:30 SBF<br /> 9:13 Building Successful Products<br /> 15:56 Why Sam is in Crypto<br /> 20:40 Crypto Values & Opportunity<br /> 25:27 Use Cases & Decentralization<br /> 31:04 The Future of FTX<br /> 37:18 FTX vs DeFi<br /> 41:16 SBF’s Preferred Blockchains<br /> 45:12 Sam’s Legendary Tweet<br /> 53:30 FTX vs Banks<br /> 56:46 Regulation<br /> 1:03:45 Talking to Congress<br /> 1:06:02 Spectrum of Decentralization<br /> 1:10:05 Super Bowl Ads<br /> 1:16:34 Mainstream Crypto & NFTs<br /> 1:21:30 Building Wealth<br /> 1:24:45 Giving Everything Away<br /> 1:27:45 Crypto Price Predictions<br /> 1:31:27 Crypto 5 Years from Now</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>SBF on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX\">https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX</a> <br />  FTX<br /> <a href=\"https://ftx.com/en\">https://ftx.com/en</a> <br /> Sam’s Legendary Tweet<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1347964322459262977\">https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1347964322459262977</a> <br />  FTX Super Bowl Commercial<br /> <a href= \"https://youtu.be/BH5-rSxilxo\">https://youtu.be/BH5-rSxilxo</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
