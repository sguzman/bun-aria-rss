His first album, <em>Aromanticism</em>, came out in September 2017, but before that, he’d already worked with an impressive and diverse list of collaborators, from Sufjan Stevens, to Solange, to Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, to Skrillex. That spirit continues with the song Moses takes apart in this episode, which has contributions from producer Cam O’bi, Paris Strother, and legendary bassist Thundercat.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://songexploder.net/moses-sumney\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">songexploder.net/moses-sumney</a></p>",
