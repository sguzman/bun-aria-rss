  "description": "<p>Today on the show we opened up the phone lines to see if our listeners have any horror stories when dating someone that has a child after Nelly tweeted out he is \"not messing with no more baby mamas\". Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to a South Carolina man who was arrested for stealing a horse, and trying to hide it in his room. We opened up the phone lines a second time to see if our listeners will their kids if they fell on hard times even if they are grown after reports came out that Dr. Dre declines helping his 30 year old daughter from being homeless.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
