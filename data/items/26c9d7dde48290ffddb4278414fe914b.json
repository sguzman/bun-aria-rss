  "description": "Today we look at the power of the Chinese government. The first book, <em>How I Survived A Chinese Reeducation Camp</em>, is by Gulbahar Haitiwaji, a Uyghur woman who spent years in a detention camp. It's a stark account of human rights atrocities. Haitiwaji told NPR's Scott Simon she feels lucky because millions of people are still suffering. Next is an interview with Chinese businessman Desmond Shum about his book <em>Red Roulette</em>. It's the story of his wife's disappearance and then reappearance. Shum told NPR's Steve Inskeep that when she resurfaced he felt like he was \"negotiating with her kidnapper.\"",
