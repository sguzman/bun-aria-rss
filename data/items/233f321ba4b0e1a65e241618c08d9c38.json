  "description": "We face an extraordinary challenge--a massive economic crisis and a great public health crisis, each feeding into one another. Our government's response thus far has exacerbated both. To recover is going to require big ideas and bold execution from the next president of the United States. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz offers some of those ideas and thoughts on how a Biden Administration could make them a reality in the latest edition of our Agenda 2021 series. It is essential listening on issues from how to create millions of jobs to how to save our cities and states from an even greater crisis, from how to foster a green recovery to what lessons the G.I. Bill may offer for those thinking about the issue of reparations. Join us!\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
