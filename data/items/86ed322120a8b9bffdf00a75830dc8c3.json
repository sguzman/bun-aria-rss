Also, Eisler gets into a bitter back-and-forth with Solomon Zeitlin in the pages of the Jewish Quarterly Review and one Christian scholar dedicates an entire book to discrediting the methods of Eisler and other “learned Jews.\"\nVoice of Robert Eisler: Caleb Crawford\nAdditional voices: Brian Evans\nMusic: “Shibbolet Baseda,” recorded by Elyakum Shapirra and His Israeli Orchestra.\nFunding provided by the Ohio University Humanities Research Fund and the Ohio University Honors Tutorial College Internship Program.\nSpecial thanks to the Warburg Institute.\nBibliography and Further Reading\n--Eisler, Robert.
