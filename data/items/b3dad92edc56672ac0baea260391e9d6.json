  "description": "<p>How to moderate good, productive discussions and navigate tricky conversations is top of mind -- whether doing a panel, conducting a live event, presenting a talk (or hosting a podcast), managing (and even just participating in!) a meeting. Especially in a world where remote and virtual work is increasingly become the norm for many knowledge workers, one in which we're increasingly communicating through little \"Hollywood Squares, Brady Bunch\"-like boxes.</p><p>So how to translate physical and nonverbal presence in such virtual environments, or voice-only modes? How to manage unruly discussions? Do parasocial vs. social interactions change things? And beyond these broader contexts, how do the things <i>inside</i> us -- whether agendas, tics, anxiety -- manifest outwardly, and can we better control them?</p><p>In this episode of the a16z Podcast, <a href=\"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/matt-forrest-abrahams\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Abrahams</a> -- lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business (where he also has a podcast, \"Think Fast Talk Smart\"); principal and co-founder of Bold Echo (a company that helps people with presentation and communication skills); and author of <i>Speaking Up Without Freaking Out</i> -- shares frameworks and best practices, in conversation with Sonal Chokshi. The discussion offers many concrete tips for moderation and communication for anyone, across all kinds of mediums and modes.</p><p> </p><p><i>image: </i><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pahudson/2217562952/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Paul Hudson</i></a><i> / </i><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Flickr</i></a></p>\n",
