  "description": "<p>Before you’re tempted to rush out and pounce on those Black Friday deals: How amazing is it that we live in a world where there are so many ‘free’ things all around us? And how unfortunate it is, that we often don’t even see these ‘free’ resources because we’re so used to purchasing and consumption- we don’t even think to make use of them. Our technology and culture steers us in the direction to spend. Chances are you’re not taking advantage of this ‘free’ stuff and you’re overspending because maybe you haven’t thought about it or there are some things you’re not even aware of yet. Putting these resources to use will make you smarter, save you money, and will overall lead to a healthier and more balanced life.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Sticky Hands IPA by Block 15 Brewing Company- a big thanks to Dale for donating this beer to the show!
