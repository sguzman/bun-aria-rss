    "media:description": "This is a cover of Creation Calls by Brian Doerksen.\n\nI actually did this for a homework assignment, and was a bit rushed.  As such, the quality is not as good as I would like.  I've also switched operating systems since my last video and had to switch to a different video editor.  For some reason, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't quite get the audio and video to sync up.  Oh well.",
