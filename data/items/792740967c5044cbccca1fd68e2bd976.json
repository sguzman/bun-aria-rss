  "description": "<p><p>On this edition of ZBT, we give RadioBren advice on what to do with his money now that he is a full-time employee (spoiler alert: we tell him to go on a bender). We discuss a story about a veteran who went on an epic beer run to Vietnam, and react to two news updates. The new addition to the ZBT team Kate tells us a first-person story about Anna Mae Hays. All that, and more! </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
