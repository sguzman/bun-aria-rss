  "description": "<p>Shannon is finally getting settled into NYC, and is joined by one of her new friends, Cassidy Lynn. Cass is a celebrity stylist, but Shannon mainly wants to talk about one thing- boys/dating in the city. The pair find themselves locking eyes on the dance floor with two extremely tall men, and the rest is history (and by that, we mean we talk about it on this podcast). Did Glitz and Glam lead to love in a dark hopeless no cell service place? How many people do the girls keep on their roster at a time? How many different code names are mentioned during this episode? We actually lost track. Hockey? We dig it. Tampons, tampons, tampons. This is Season 2 Episode 8 of Probably a Podcast. <br /> <br /></p>",
