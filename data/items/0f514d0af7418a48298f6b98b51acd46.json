  "description": "<p>This week we're responding to a question from Sara, a listener who recently exhibited a series of paintings. Sara hung 49 paintings in a \"gallery wall\" style display and she asked \"do you think less is more when it comes to displaying your work?\" This prompted a great discussion about curation when it comes to our art and why it matters so much. We both believe that curating our work is a way to guide the viewer's experience. Just as we edit a painting, we should also edit our exhibitions or online galleries in order to guide the viewer and help them understand or appreciate the work. But how to do that is the question? What do you include and what do you omit? We discuss the idea of creating a coherent story, the importance of not creating a visual onslaught, and the value of putting yourself into the shoes of buyers in order to understand what they are experiencing when they look at your work. Our key question is 'what do you want people to think or feel when they look at your work?'</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqPYhcdFgrlUXiGmPRAej1w\">Jason Stephenson meditations on Youtube</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globalplayer.com/podcasts/42KsV9/\">I Can't Believe it's Not Bhudda Podcast</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e129ihg/metadata/edit\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e129ihg/metadata/edit\">www.louisefletcherart.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
