If you search for tips on how to age gracefully, you get tips for how to be more mindful, be more forgiving, stay curious, keep learning, and more. You’ll find a few tips around staying physically active, but you don’t see a lot of advice (if any) on building muscle, getting in the gym, hitting the weights, and putting your body under stress.<br /><br />Dr. Gabrielle Lyon began her 20+ year career in geriatric medicine and palliative care. In her observations and studies on people in declining physical and mental health she became passionately aware of the missed opportunity in the medical community. Chronic diseases commonly associated with aging such as Alzheimers, cardiac disease, and diabetes, were being studied without addressing the underlying source that’s contributing to the problems, deteriorating skeletal muscle.<br /><br />By the end of this episode, if you’re not convinced on the power of muscle building you may want to rewatch. Whether you are male or female, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, or older, everyone needs to be invested in building muscle tissue to age gracefully and have a better quality of life. Healthy aging isn’t just about maintaining mental cognition with a failing body, it’s about having quality interactions and the physical ability to stand, walk, and travel without the fear of falling or being dependent on everyone for everything.<br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction to Gabrielle Lyon<br />0:14 | Focus on Resistance Training<br />13:06 | The 1st Meal of the Day Right<br />19:26 | Muscle-Centric Protection to Aging<br />34:17 | How to Reverse Aging<br />58:02 | Reduce the Fat Storage<br />1:08:41 | Build Muscle & Don’t Lose It<br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />“If you eat food that is subthreshold to that 2.5g of leucine you will be skinny fat…” [2:42]<br /><br />“The wider the waistline the lower the brain volume.” [23:19]<br /><br />“Lifestyle, choices midlife, having access to the right information changes the trajectory of aging.” [23:41]<br /><br />“Muscle is a nutrient sensing organ.” [34:26]<br /><br />“In the literature high quality protein is defined by amino acid content. It’s not a negotiable nebulous concept; these are hard fast biological numbers.” [36:47]<br /><br />“When we’re talking about the general population, typically people don't have a good solid foundational muscular base.” [43:33]<br /><br />“Everybody’s focused on adiposity, everybody’s focusing on insulin resistance, and if you care about root causes you have to care about skeletal muscle.” [45:22]<br /><br />“You have to train hard, [...] you have to get the stress in. The body thrives under stress, [...] your body requires physical stress.” [56:34]<br /><br />“When we are older, 30s, 40s, we are now no longer driven by hormones.
