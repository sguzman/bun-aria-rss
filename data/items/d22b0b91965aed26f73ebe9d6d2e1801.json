  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Fox News Contributor Dan Bongino fills in. Mike \"Nanny\" Bloomberg has taken a page from President Obama's playbook saying that people just need to take 'the pill' suggesting that giving care to the elderly is optional. Politics like this comes in three lanes; the safe lane, the radical lane, and the outsider lane. The problem is that too many politicians weave in and out of these lanes and come across as inauthentic. Then, Bernie Sanders is a real deal socialist. Sanders will bankrupt America in order to take over the lives of Americans. Later, Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn is a patriot that became a problem for the Obama Administration because he was open and honest that there was a growing problem within the intelligence community where intelligence officers and leaders were using the country's spying abilities to advance political influence as opposed to national security. This entire scam is the precursor to the Spygate fiasco where U.S intelligence officials used foreign intelligence assets to circumvent U.S laws and set up American citizens.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
