  "description": "<p>This week, we have a chat and then answer some listener questions, but our whole discussion revolves around a central issue: How do we manage this artist life? How do we make our work? How do we run our businesses? Are we getting it right? (And how does this relate to the choice between broccoli and chocolate?!) This is one of those rambling discussions that we hope makes some sense in hindsight. Listeners add to the conversation by asking about what to do when a painting takes a different turn, and also how to know when a painting is done. In the end, we both think it comes back to understanding that there is no \"right\" way to do things.
