  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week, we’re talking about one of our (and many of your!) favorite recent contemporary romances, Talia Hibbert’s <em>Get a Life, Chloe Brown</em>. We’ve talked about Talia on a number of episodes before, and we’re so happy that our final read-along for Season 4 is this one — which is a straight shot of sexy joy directly into readers’ hearts. Also…these two are so thirsty for each other and it’s great. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We talk about artists and handymen and cats in trees and heroines with bucket lists who are just a delight. Sarah goes on a Seth MacFarlane tangent, and yes, we’re still cataloguing the greatest romance grandmas around.   </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fated Mates Live, in person is happening — if you have tickets to the live show in Alexandria, VA on July 30th — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FatedMates/status/1537110494292676610\">let us know on our Twitter thread</a> (and find friends!).
