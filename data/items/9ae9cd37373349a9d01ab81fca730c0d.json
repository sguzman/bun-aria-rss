  "description": "<p>THE KING. What an incredible, incredible honor to be interviewed by the one and only, THE LEGENDARY, Larry King. Not only is he the best to ever do it but he's the purest example of what it means to love what you do and do it to the end. There's a reason why he's still working; He found his passion and he continues to execute. Not only was this moment monumental in context but MANY say this is my best interview ever. If you're still trying to get to know me, this is one of the best examples to draw from. <3</p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5041985.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
