  "description": "<p>&nbsp;On today’s show, Pat and the guys cover a vast range of topics. They discuss whether or not they think Urban Meyer will coach again and how the cult’s of college football teams impact a coach's legacy, and get into the feedback Pat was given after calling his first NFL game and if he thinks he’ll get another chance to do so and in what capacity and where. The guys also discuss the first few days of the weight loss challenge and how the participants are battling through it, dive into a little movie talk ranging from Kevin Costner’s athletic skills, to Avatar, to Goodfellas, which results in a conversation about the current state of the mafia, and if they still operate. They also cover all the drama going on in Pittsburgh with the Steelers and talk about a couple of the potential landing spots for AB if he is to get traded, chat about the NFL playoff games this weekend and who they’re leaning towards, get into a little bit of a fast food discussion, and question where the phrase \"bless you,\" came from and if it should be extended to other things as well. It’s a hilarious one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
