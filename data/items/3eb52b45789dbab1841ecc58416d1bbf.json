  "description": "<p>You can always be healed.</p><p>So many people struggle with chronic illness or pain. Whether it's back trouble, ringing in the ears, or headaches, we've almost all been in a situation when we know that something is wrong but we don't know what to do and how to fix it.</p><p>Thankfully, we have doctors and health professionals to diagnose us, and they're often right! But happens when the doctors aren't sure what's wrong or how to fix the problem?</p><p>What if I were to tell you that there was someone who could \"read\" your medical condition, like a person reads a book. He could sit down with you right now and tell you what's wrong, without even looking at your charts or medical history. You'd say I'm crazy right?</p><p>My guest today is committed to helping people around the world understand and improve their health. He doesn't go about it traditionally — he has a conversation with a spiritual medium about each person's individual health concerns and how to heal them.</p><p>A lot of you are probably skeptical, but when it comes to Anthony William, the results speak for themselves.</p><p>Anthony William, also known as The Medical Medium, is the originator of the global celery juice movement and #1 New York Times best-selling author of several books, including <a href=\"https://www.medicalmedium.com/liver-rescue\" target=\"_blank\">Medical Medium Liver Rescue</a>, <a href=\"https://www.medicalmedium.com/celery-juice.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Medical Medium Celery Juice</a>, and several others. His newest book, <a href=\"https://www.medicalmedium.com/cleanse-to-heal.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Medical Medium Cleanse to Heal</a>, is coming out this month! </p><p>Anthony was born with the unique ability to converse with the Spirit of Compassion, who provides him with extraordinarily accurate health information that's far ahead of its time. Since age four, Anthony has been using his gift to “read” people's conditions and tell them how to recover their health.</p><p>His unprecedented accuracy and success rate as the Medical Medium have earned him the trust and love of millions worldwide. Movie stars, rock stars, billionaires, professional athletes, and countless other people from all walks of life could not find a way to heal until Anthony provided them with insights from above. Anthony has also become an invaluable resource to doctors who need help solving their most difficult cases. When they aren't sure what's going on, Anthony is there to listen, channel the Spirit of Compassion, and provide his counsel. </p><p>Intriguing, right!?
