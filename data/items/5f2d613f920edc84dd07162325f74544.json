  "description": "<p>Recently, the dominant DETR-based approaches apply central-concept spatial\nprior to accelerate Transformer detector convergency. These methods gradually\nrefine the reference points to the center of target objects and imbue object\nqueries with the updated central reference information for spatially\nconditional attention. However, centralizing reference points may severely\ndeteriorate queries' saliency and confuse detectors due to the indiscriminative\nspatial prior. To bridge the gap between the reference points of salient\nqueries and Transformer detectors, we propose SAlient Point-based DETR\n(SAP-DETR) by treating object detection as a transformation from salient points\nto instance objects. In SAP-DETR, we explicitly initialize a query-specific\nreference point for each object query, gradually aggregate them into an\ninstance object, and then predict the distance from each side of the bounding\nbox to these points. By rapidly attending to query-specific reference region\nand other conditional extreme regions from the image features, SAP-DETR can\neffectively bridge the gap between the salient point and the query-based\nTransformer detector with a significant convergency speed. Our extensive\nexperiments have demonstrated that SAP-DETR achieves 1.4 times convergency\nspeed with competitive performance. Under the standard training scheme,\nSAP-DETR stably promotes the SOTA approaches by 1.0 AP. Based on ResNet-DC-101,\nSAP-DETR achieves 46.9 AP.\n</p>",
