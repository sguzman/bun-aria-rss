  "description": "<p>After extensive adventures in Europe, <a href=\"https://joeyrositano.myportfolio.com/work\">Joey Rositano</a> found himself on Jeju Island, South Korea, teaching English. During those initial years he heard about a mysterious practice of shamanism on the island that he decided to explore for himself. What he found was the fascinating world of mystical shrines, indomitable grandmas, and spirits among us. Rositano set out to record the voices and stories of the island in his documentary <strong><a href=\"https://pagansweare.wordpress.com/documentary/\">Spirits</a> </strong>and the associated <a href=\"https://pagansweare.wordpress.com/photobook/\"><strong>photobook</strong></a>. </p> <p>Joey's work, on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pagans_we_are_shamanism/\">Instagram</a>.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"http://chrisryanphd.com/support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please consider supporting this podcast.</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intro music: “Brightside of the Sun,” by <a href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\">Basin and Range,</a>\"Big Sky Blues,\" by <a href=\"http://waste-division.org/\">Phil Griffin</a>.</span></p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
