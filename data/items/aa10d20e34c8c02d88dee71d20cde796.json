  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, WPHT Radio host Rich Zeoli fills in for Mark. Joe Biden is failing miserably as President on schools, vaccines, and the Constitution. The vaccine distribution has been a disaster and Biden is still blaming Donald Trump, even though Trump bulldozed regulations to get multiple vaccines developed in record time. Vaccine rollouts have been the worst in Democrat cities and states. Instead of blaming Trump, why not look at what Andrew Cuomo and Phil Murphy did? Teachers unions across the country are in control because Democrats are beholdened to them. Parents are losing their minds because they’ve had it with how poorly Biden and Democrats have handled reopening schools. Democrats are holding our kid’s future hostage while playing political games over Covid. Also, Americans need vaccines, so Biden pledged $4 billion for global vaccines. It isn’t selfish or a bad thing to want to vaccinate our own country before we vaccinate the rest of the world.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
