After all, Functional Medicine is all about looking at the way our systems function together, rather than focusing on one part of the body at a time. The steps you take to support whole-body health work in the same way. Diet, exercise, stress reduction—they simultaneously affect more than just one aspect of your health—and new research has revealed that choices like these can have major impacts on our sleep, and how that cycles back to support overall optimal health.</p><p> </p><p>On this episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy, I discuss all-things-sleep with my guest Shawn Stevenson. Shawn is the author of the international best-selling book Sleep Smarter and creator of one of my favorite podcasts, The Model Health Show. A graduate of The University of Missouri - St. Louis, Shawn studied business, biology, and kinesiology, and went on to be the founder of Advanced Integrative Health Alliance, a company that provides wellness services for individuals and organizations worldwide.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
