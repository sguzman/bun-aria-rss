  "description": "<p>Danny Koentopp wakes up every morning, gets dressed, has a bite to eat, kisses his wife and kids, and heads off to a garage in LA, often not coming out until long after the sun has set. For Danny, this garage is a creative temple. An innovative workshop, where he spends his days handcrafting some of the most breathtakingly-beautiful and sought after archtop acoustic jazz guitars and hollow-body electric guitars on the planet. He literally loses time there. But, his story runs deeper than a devotion to craft and music, family and mastery. When Danny steps into his workshop, he's not alone. He built his first guitar side-by-side with his dad in a home workshop. Danny's father passed-on shortly after, but he inhabits this little oasis, guiding and inspiring Danny along the way. In that magical space, they reconnect and make magic together.</p><p>You can find Dan Koentopp at: <a href=\"https://koentoppguitars.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> https://koentoppguitars.com/| <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/KoentoppGuitars/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> https://www.instagram.com/KoentoppGuitars/</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
