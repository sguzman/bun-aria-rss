  "description": "<p>Back after the Russ episode and a chill weekend, the guys get right to the shits; the shits being the reunion of Drake and Kanye at the Free Larry Hoover benefit concert held in Los Angeles. Rory and Mal give their opinions on the show, the experience of live tweeting it, and speculate how a Kanye & Drake tour would look in 2022. They speak on Travis $cott’s interview about the tragic incident at his festival, and this segues into a thankful Rolling Loud LA recap, as they celebrate a safe completion of the festival, even though LA is in a  self-proclaimed “purge”-adjace state currently. The guys rehash memories of summer camp, and decide to take the New Rory & Mal team on an Adult Summer Camp trip. Mal stresses over the thought of having daughters, and this leads into a conversation about Rory giving up his preference to keep his white bloodline pure, because Gingers are going extinct. They also cover Rick Ross’ new album honestly, speak on more new music that was released + more!</p>\n",
