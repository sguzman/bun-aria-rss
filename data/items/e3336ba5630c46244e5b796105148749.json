  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, Paul Ryan isn’t resigning because hes tired of being speaker of the house. Ryan’s spending bill that was passed in March was disastrous for the country and the Republican party. Republicans who voted for that bill and who are running for re-election this year can’t say they are fiscal conservatives anymore. Republicans will have to contend with quite a bloodbath of their own making in November’s midterm elections. The reason for this is the failure of Republicans to communicate basic principles of conservatism to voters. Rather than President Trump being blamed for a November loss, he will actually be the victim of this because if the House of Representatives goes to the Democrats he’s in deep trouble. Later, there’s a new CBO report that shows that government spending is on an abysmal path. This won’t effect us today but when an economy starts to unravel it’s like dominos, everything is effected and it will arrive eventually. We are reaching a point of no return. Also, Trump has pulled together a coalition to take military action against Syria. Trump has drawn a red line and means it unlike Barack Obama. Finally, Bradley Smith, Chairman of the Center for Competitive Politics, calls in to discuss the payment by Michael Cohen to Stormy Daniels. Even if you take the facts set forth by the NY Times as truth, the Cohen payment to Stormy can’t be an in-kind campaign contribution to the Trump campaign because not everything that might benefit a candidate is a campaign expense.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
