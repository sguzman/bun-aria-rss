  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, thousands of Americans are serving overseas in the U.S military and they must be shaking their heads when they see what is going on right now. They're not athletes, media personalities, or politicians. They don't take a knee when the National Anthem plays. They stand up for their country. The unreality being pushed by the Democrat party only promotes their ideology. Meanwhile, 18 people were killed in one of America's largest cities, Chicago, yet it's completely ignored. To the left it seems only certain lives matter; no mention of these murdered souls in Chicago was made at George Floyd's funeral. Sadly, Abraham Lincoln was right when he said that the temple of Liberty is being built for all to have equality and freedom in the future. Then, Professor Walter E. Williams, an Economist from George Mason University, joins the show to make the point that black neighborhoods are suffering financially and educationally as a result of the Democrat Party's policies in these cities. In fact, Williams asserts that teachers' unions and feckless politicians prevent black school kids from school choice options. Later, Homicides in Los Angeles have spiked by 250% since last week yet the conversation to abolish police continues. They claim that the cops are the problem, not the criminals.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
