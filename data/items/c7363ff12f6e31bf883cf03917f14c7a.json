My personal favorite is <a href=\"https://thedowtheory.com/\">Jack Schannep&#8217;s interpretation</a>. I was introduced to it by his excellent <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dow-Theory-21st-Century-Indicators/dp/0470240598\">Dow Theory for the 21st Century</a> book. What really hit home with me, is that his approach is fully-quantified. The book also covers 60 years of history and provides detailed data on entry, exit, gains, etc. All in all, one of the best I have seen. I have been monitoring some of Schannep&#8217;s indicators in real life for quite a while now. The signals are rare, but for example take a look at my old blog posts <a href=\"https://theaverageinvestor.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/the-monthly-update/\">around the European crisis of 2011</a>.</p>\n<p>So what happened on Friday? Well, the indexes closed at levels very close to signal the end of the bull market. First, let&#8217;s take a look at the S&#038;P 500. The R code first:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\">\nrequire(quantmod)\nrequire(plotly)\n\npretty.plot = function(t, name, short.name, level) {\n  df = data.frame(Date=index((t)), Close=as.numeric(t), row.names = NULL)\n  hovertext = paste0(\"Date:  <b>\", df$Date, \"</b><br>\", short.name, \":  <b>\", trunc(df$Close), \"</b><br>\")\n  p = plot_ly(data=df, x = ~Date, y = ~Close, mode=\"line\")\n  p = layout(p, title = name)\n  p = add_lines(p, y = ~Close, line = list(color = \"#00526d\", width = 4), hoverinfo = \"text\", text = hovertext)\n  p = add_trace(p, x = df[,'Date'], y = rep(level, NROW(df)), showlegend = FALSE, mode='line', hoverinfo = \"none\", line=list(width=0.5))\n  p\n}\n\ngspc = getSymbols(\"^GSPC\", from=\"1900-01-01\", auto.assign=F)\npretty.plot(Ad(gspc)[\"2017-09/\"], \"S&P 500\", \"S&P 500\", min(Ad(gspc)[\"2018\"])) \n</pre>\n<p>The code uses plotly for charting. I got inspired <a href=\"https://moderndata.plot.ly/time-series-charts-by-the-economist-in-r-using-plotly/\">by this link</a>.</p>\n<p>This results in:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spx-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spx-1-720x405.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3335\" srcset=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spx-1-720x405.png 720w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spx-1-240x135.png 240w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spx-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spx-1.png 1248w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nThe critical level to watch is <b>$2,581</b>. The Friday close was <b>$2,588</b>. Still holding.</p>\n<p>Next comes the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI):</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dji-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dji-2-720x405.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3340\" srcset=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dji-2-720x405.png 720w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dji-2-240x135.png 240w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dji-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dji-2.png 1248w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nThe important level here was <b>$23,860</b>.

Friday&#8217;s close was higher &#8211; <b>$10,163</b>. Still holding.</p>\n<p>What does all this mean? If you are interested in history around similar events &#8211; check out the book. What it means to me is that the party can be over anytime now. Even a small down day will squeeze out a confirmation from the S&#038;P 500 or from the DJT, which combined with the signal from the DJI will put us in what I call the no man&#8217;s land. No bull, no bear &#8211; we will be waiting for further confirmation.</p>\n<p>To make things bleaker, the Fed is tightening.</p>\n<p>On the bright side, we haven&#8217;t reached a bear market definition yet. Here again I am a Schannep&#8217;s follower &#8211; a bear market is at least a 16% correction. On the DJI, the market currently measures an 11% correction. 16% is around $22,358 more than a 1,000 points lower. The skeptics will also point out that we haven&#8217;t crossed the 200-day moving average yet.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/2018/03/24/the-bull-barely-survived-on-friday/\">The Bull Survived on Friday, but Barely</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.quintuitive.com\">Quintuitive</a>.</p>\n",
