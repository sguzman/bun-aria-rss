  "description": "In the history of sports punishment, there is no case quite like the one of Deshaun Watson. The Browns had acquired the star quarterback from the Texans back in March, amid dozens of civil lawsuits, filed by dozens of women who accused him of sexual assault and misconduct. And even though Watson wouldn’t face criminal charges, the question was never if Watson would be suspended by the league this season: it was for how long. ESPN’s Cleveland Browns reporter Jake Trotter explains how a quarterback’s “predatory conduct” only warranted a six-game suspension, potentially returning him to America’s televisions by October 23rd. And what the NFL might do next, as a result.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
