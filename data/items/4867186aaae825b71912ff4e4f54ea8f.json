  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including this past weekend's protest that temporarily shut down the Harvard-Yale football game. Spectators rushed the field to stage a climate change protest at halftime, delaying the start of the second half by almost an hour and causing the game to finish in near darkness because the Yale Bowl doesn't have stadium lights. Also talked about are possible changes to the NBA schedule and in-season format. Talks with the players' union are taking place over changes that would include the reseeding of teams in the semifinal based on regular-season record, and an in-season tournament modeled after European soccer. Also discussed is EBay's sale of its ticket marketplace StubHub to European rival Viagogo for about $4 billion, allowing the company to focus on its main retail site and address pressure from shareholder activists.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
