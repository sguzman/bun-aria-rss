  "title": "NFL Draft QB Prospect Week: Jets and 49ers could be making big mistake by passing on Justin Fields (Football 4/14)",
  "description": "Justin Fields and Trevor Lawrence entered college as closely-ranked high school recruits and prospects and many thought they'd enter the NFL Draft 1-2 as well. In the past few months, Lawrence has remained at the top of the class, but other quarterbacks have risen above Fields. That's a mistake according to Tom Fornelli. On this episode, Tom tells Will Brinson why teams (especially the Jets and 49ers) shouldn't be sleeping on the Ohio State product when the draft arrives. The guys break down Fields' game, highlighting all the things he does exceptionally well. While Zach Wilson and Mac Jones appear like the #2 and #3 picks at the moment, laying some money on Fields to go in one of those spots might return some value. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
