  "description": "<p>Many of us live in a constant state of low-grade dissatisfaction that we don’t need or deserve. Yet there are tools waiting within all of us that can connect us to our purpose—and show us how to share our unique gifts with the world. In his conversations with Reverend Michael Beckwith and Dr. Andrea Pennington, Dr. Hyman explores how we can connect to our highest selves through simple practices, even in the face of relentlessly hostile messages from society.</p><br><p>Reverend Michael Beckwith is the Founder and Spiritual Director of the Agape International Spiritual Center, a trans-denominational community headquartered in Los Angeles, comprised of thousands of local members and global live streamers. In 2012, Rev. Michael Beckwith addressed the UN General Assembly during its annual World Interfaith Harmony Week. As co-founder and president of the Association for Global New Thought, he hosts conferences featuring harbingers of world peace including His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and had the distinguished honor of presenting Nelson Mandela with the Gandhi King Award. Dr. Beckwith is a sought after meditation teacher, conference speaker, and seminar leader on the Life Visioning Process™.</p><br><p>Dr. Pennington is an integrative physician, acupuncturist, meditation teacher, and #1 international bestselling author.
