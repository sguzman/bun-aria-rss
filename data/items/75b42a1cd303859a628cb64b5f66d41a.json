  "description": "We have a two for the price of one podcast today! For the \"main\" part of the podcast, I have my old friend George Pettit on the show today. He's the vocalist for the now active Alexisonfire. We hopped on the phone one day (some dodgy cell service up in Canada) and discussed his life as a firefighter, being a reluctant frontman and the importance of obsession. Before that discussion, I have Dan Thomson from Sparrows on. They are a great hardcore band that deserves your attention.
