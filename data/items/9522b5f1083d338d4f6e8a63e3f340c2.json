And the best, most objective science available.</p><p>This is the life’s work of today’s guest and my friend, <strong>Dr. Michael Greger.</strong></p><p>Long time listeners are well acquainted with Dr. Greger, one of my very first guests back in 2012 (<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/007-michael-greger/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RRP #007</a>).

So let's put matters to rights.</p><p>A graduate of Cornell and Tufts University School of Medicine as well as a founding member and Fellow of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, Dr. Greger is a nutrition science wizard who with a library of scientific journal publications to his name.
