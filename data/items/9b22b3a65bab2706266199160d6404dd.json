  "description": "<p>Soldier Vanessa Guillen was brutally murdered at a Texas military base by fellow soldier Spc. Aaron Robinson.  A document from the Texas Department of Public Safety reveals that Robinson killed Guilllen was because she saw a photo of a woman on Robinson's phone. That photo was of Cecily Aguilar, the wife of another soldier, with whom Robinson was having an affair.  According to Aguilar, who is also charged in Guillen's death, Robinson was worried about getting in trouble for violating the Army's fraternization rules.    </p>\n<p>A $35 million dollar lawsuit against the Army has been filed in Guillen's death by her family. The lawsuit is seeking damages for wrongful death but that's not all. The family is suing on the basis of sexual harassment, abuse, assault, rape, sodomy as well.  A military investigation found that 20-year-old Guillen was also sexually harassed and that leaders failed to take appropriate action. The lawsuit describes two instances in which Guillén was harassed. Guillen told family that she did not report the harrassment for fear of retaliation.   </p>\n<p>Joining Nancy Grace today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Myra Guillen - Vaness Guillen's sister</li>\n<li>Natalie Kwahan - attorney for Vanessa Guillen family</li>\n<li>Tim Miller, Texas Equusearch</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Dr Bethany Marshall - Psychoanalyst, Beverly Hills, ww.drbethanymarshall.com</li>\n<li>Joseph Scott Morgan - Professor of Forensics Jacksonville State University, Author,\"Blood Beneath My Feet\"</li>\n<li>Olivia Levada KXXV TV  </li>\n<li>Jasmine Caldwell, KCEN </li>\n</ul><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
