And on the slide, the bacteria were swimming in a stark line. And that gave James an idea. He took out his phone and opened up his compass app. Then he placed the phone on the microscope stage to see what direction the bacteria were swimming in. And he found that the bacteria were all swimming north.\n\nShop The Microcosmos:\nhttps://www.microcosmos.store\n\nFollow Journey to the Microcosmos:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/journeytomicro\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/JourneyToMicro\n\nSupport the Microcosmos:\nhttp://www.patreon.com/journeytomicro\n\nMore from Jam’s Germs:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jam_and_germs\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn4UedbiTeN96izf-CxEPbg\n\nHosted by Hank Green:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hankgreen\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/vlogbrothers\n\nMusic by Andrew Huang:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/andrewhuang\n\nJourney to the Microcosmos is a Complexly production.\nFind out more at https://www.complexly.com\n\nStock video from:\nhttps://www.videoblocks.com\n\nSOURCES:\nhttps://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/bacteria-that-synthesize-nano-sized-compasses-to-15669190/\nhttps://theconversation.com/magnetic-bacteria-and-their-unique-superpower-attract-researchers-100720\nhttps://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1197&context=phy_fac\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro842\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3811606/\n\nThis video has been dubbed using an artificial voice via https://aloud.area120.google.com to increase accessibility.
