  "description": "On The Best of Mark Levin, Mark plays back his monologue from \"Life, Liberty, & Levin\" that was supposed to air last Sunday. This program maintains its support for the Ukrainian people and President Zelensky will go down in history for staying and fighting with his countrymen. Hopefully, Putin will not resort to chemical weapons now that more countries have stepped up to send Ukraine some weapons. President Biden should have taken the lead early on, yet he continues to wait and just keeps announcing new sanctions that should have been in place already. While the U.S has a memorandum in place with Ukraine we have an obligation to protect Ukraine's neighbors who are NATO allies. It's deeply troubling and frustrating that the U.S is not pouring heavy weapons into Ukraine so that they can defend themselves while imposing seriously crippling sanctions on Russia. It's a perverted view of \"'America First' to think that the America has provoked Russia or China into invading smaller countries. The greatest generation understood this. Then, Mark talks about how the DOJ has dropped its investigation in China anti-espionage program.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
