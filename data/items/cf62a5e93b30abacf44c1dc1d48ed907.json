  "description": "What can the history of Jewish philosophy teach us about modern life? In How to Measure a World?: A Philosophy of Judaism (Indiana UP, 2021), Martin Shuster, an Associate Professor of Philosophy and Director, Center for Geographies of Justice at Goucher College, explores the history of Jewish philosophy to examine how key thinkers have understood the world. Using a phenomenological approach, the book brings thinkers including Levinas, Maimonides, Adorno, and Cavell into dialogue with a huge range of thinkers and traditions, from Greek and Islamic thought to more contemporary ideas. Thinking about language and discourse, history, pain and suffering, and ultimately, humanity and its relationship to the world, the book will be essential reading for anyone interested in Jewish philosophy and history, as well as for scholars across the arts and humanities.\nDave O'Brien is Professor of Cultural and Creative Industries, at the University of Sheffield.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
