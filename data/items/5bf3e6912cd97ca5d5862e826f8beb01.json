    "media:description": "We’re introducing Handles – a new way for people to find and connect with creators and each other on YouTube. Unlike channel names, handles are unique to each channel, making it easier for creators to establish and maintain their distinct presence on YouTube. Your Handle will show across a few surfaces within YouTube – including your channel homepage, search results, the Shorts feed, within comments and community posts, and more. And it can be used off YouTube to promote your channel. We’re gradually rolling out handles to all channels over the coming weeks, and we’ll notify you in YouTube Studio and by email when it’s time to choose your handle. \nYou can also go to youtube.com/handle for more information and to get started.\nAnd check out these articles for more information: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11585688\nhttps://yt.be/help/handle\n\nSubscribe and hit the bell to see new videos: https://goo.gl/So4XIG\n\n► Check out our Help Center: https://goo.gl/fBzr7",
