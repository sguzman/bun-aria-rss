  "description": "By my count, we drafted 8 quarterbacks, which seems absurd but watch the actual NFL pick nine in the first round this year and make us look lame. But will they draft a kicker? Will they draft an offensive lineman and make him play kicker? Will they forget one of the best defensive players in the whole draft is available until the first round is basically over?\nNo. And that's why you come to the Shutdown Fullcast, with special guest Harry Lyles. (Please follow Harry on Twitter - @harrylylesjr - and don't hold his appearance on this show against him. He just wanted to be a good coworker.)\nLearn more about your ad choices.
