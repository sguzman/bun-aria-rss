  "itunes:subtitle": "This week on The First Run, Chris and Matt discuss the return of one of the most influential sci-fi franchises of the past 25 years with ‘The Matrix: Resurrections’, Adam McKay’s political disaster satire, ‘Don’t Look Up’, and share their 5 Favorite Adam McKay Scenes.",
  "itunes:summary": "This week on the last episode of 2021 of The First Run, Chris and Matt share their thoughts on The Matrix: Resurrections.  Lana Wachowski returns to the franchise that changed cinema with a new story to tell.  But a story perhaps somewhat influenced by a studio with perhaps a concern for a payday and not a new artistic endeavor.  Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss return, certain other decisions are made, and a sci-fi franchise is brought back to life.  But things ended so perfectly last time, should we be plugging back in?  Then Adam McKay continues his run of all-star casts, political commentary, and possibly diminishing laughs with the eco-disaster political satire, ‘Don’t Look Up’.  Leonardo DiCaprio leads McKay’s film with an important message that either lands or crashes.  There’s the final rundown of the big releases on Physical Media, featuring the Straight to DVD and Streaming Picks of the Week.  Then Matt and Chris attempt to close out the year with some laughs as they share their 5 Favorite Adam McKay scenes.  It’s just another episode of the show that escalated quickly.\n\n00:00-20:27: Intro/Matrix: Resurrections\n20:28-26:52: Physical Media Picks\n26:53-40:10: Don’t Look Up\n40:11-54:34: 5 Favorite Adam McKay Scenes\n54:35-56:17: Wrap Up\n\nTheme music by Jamal Malachi Ford-Bey",
