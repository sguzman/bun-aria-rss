  "description": "Today's episode features a conversation with comedian Kathy Griffin. I tried to teach her to bake lemon bars and she tried to convince me she was too famous to have to know how to bake. But what she does do, brilliantly, is tell stories and the conversation we had while waiting for her lemon bars to come out of the oven is worth listening to. (The lemon bars are worth making too.)\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
