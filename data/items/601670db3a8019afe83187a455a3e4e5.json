  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Senator Rand Paul has repeated the recommendations of this program to invite President Trump to deliver the SOTU address from the US Senate chamber instead of the House chamber. Trump should not deliver the SOTU from a rally, where it would lose the addresses appeal. Meanwhile, President Trump issued a letter canceling all Congressional trips overseas due to the partial government shutdown – as he should. Also, Speaker Pelosi was criticized for not reigning in the anti-Semitic remarks of freshman member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN). In 2012, Omar accused Israel of \"evil doings\" on Twitter. Then, John Solomon from The HIll calls in to report the latest updates on Bruce Ohr who walked Christopher Steele into the FBI offices in July of 2016 mentioning that his wife's firm Fusion GPS was working with the Hillary Clinton campaign. However this did not stop, Andrew Weissman, Sally Yates, and other Obama-era officials in the DOJ and FBI from using this information to pursue FISA warrants for the Russia investigation. Yet Former FBI Director Comey's testimony seems to contradict Ohr's disclosure on these events, per Solomon. Finally, former deputy assistant to President Trump, Sebastian Gorka, calls in to discuss insults hurled at him by CNN’s Jim Acosta at the White House.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
