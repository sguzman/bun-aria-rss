  "description": "<p>On September 14, 1990, 10-year-old Kacey Perry disappeared while visiting with her father at his home in Portland, Oregon, after the two had a disagreement. In Part 1, we learned that it’s believed Kacey made it to a store blocks away from her father’s home, possibly to make a phone call to ask someone to pick her up. Witnesses spotted her at this location, and her belongings were later found at the store. It remains unclear if Kacey was picked up by someone she knew or possibly went with a stranger. In the early days of the investigation, one person close to her mom stood out. His name is Brian Keith George. Nearly a year after Kacey disappeared, he was arrested for a bank robbery and had something shocking to tell investigators.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Kacey Perry, please call the Portland Police Bureau at 503-823-0000.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://getquip.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">QUIP</a>- Go to <a href=\"http://getquip.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GetQuip.com/VANISHED</a>&nbsp;to get a free plastic dispenser with any refill plan.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.
