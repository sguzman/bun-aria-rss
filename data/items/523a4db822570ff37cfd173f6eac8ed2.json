  "description": "<p>We construct a monoidal category of open transition systems that generate\nmaterial history as transitions unfold, which we call situated transition\nsystems. The material history generated by a composite system is composed of\nthe material history generated by each component. The construction is\nparameterized by a symmetric strict monoidal category, understood as a resource\ntheory, from which material histories are drawn. We pay special attention to\nthe case in which this category is compact closed. In particular, if we begin\nwith a compact closed category of integers then the resulting situated\ntransition systems can be understood as systems of double-entry bookkeeping\naccounts.\n</p>",
