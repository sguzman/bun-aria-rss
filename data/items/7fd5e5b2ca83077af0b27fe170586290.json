    "media:description": "Welcome to the first Buffalo fractal zoom on Maths Town. Many of you have asked for it, and I've finally done it. I'm not sure why it took me so long to expolore this fractal, but it has some nice properties. \n\nThank-you to my supporters on Patreon.\n\nThis video will be available for Patreons to download in the coming days, which will have a higher bitrate.  You can also use these visuals on your own channel if you are a member of my Patreon page. https://www.patreon.com/mathstown\n\n/********************************************************************************\nOpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/maths-town\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/mathstown (Support, Downloads & Usage Rights)\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MathsTown\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/YphYVt787v (Drop by and say hello)\nGrab a T-Shirt: https://amzn.to/3eIfqmX\nWebsite: https://www.maths.town\n********************************************************************************/\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/ekoiev/\n\n#Buffalo #fractal #mathstown #fractals",
