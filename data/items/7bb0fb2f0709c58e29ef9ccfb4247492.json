  "description": "<p>How Eating An Anti-Inflammatory Diet Is Key To Regaining Your Health | This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://insidetracker.com/drhyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">InsideTracker</a></p><br><p>Inflammation is part of the body’s natural defense system and can be a good thing in balance. However, when your immune system shifts out of balance, inflammation can run rampant—causing a chronic, smoldering fire inside your body that contributes to disease, weight gain, and more. What we eat is one of the biggest levers we have when it comes to driving or reducing inflammation. Industrial food drives inflammation, oxidative stress, hormone and neurotransmitter imbalances, overloads your detoxification system, depletes your energy, damages your microbiome, and changes your gene expression to turn on disease-causing genes. Real whole nutrient and phytonutrient-rich food does the opposite. It turns off inflammation, increases antioxidant systems, balances hormones and brain chemistry, boosts detoxification, increases energy, optimizes your microbiome, and turns on disease-preventing, health-promoting genes.</p><br><p>In this minisode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Vani Hari and Dr. David Perlmutter about the dangers of inflammatory foods and how to eat a diet that is anti-inflammatory.</p><br><p>Named as one of the “Most Influential People on the Internet” by Time Magazine, Vani Hari is the revolutionary food activist behind <a href=\"http://foodbabe.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">foodbabe.com</a>, co-founder of organic food brand Truvani, New York Times best selling author of, The Food Babe Way, and Feeding You Lies. She has led campaigns against food giants like Kraft, Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, Subway and General Mills that attracted more than 500,000 signatures, and led to the removal of several controversial ingredients used by these companies. Through corporate activism, petitions, and social media campaigns, Vani and her Food Babe Army have become one of the most powerful populist forces in the health and food industries.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Her drive to change the food system inspired the creation of her new company, Truvani, where she produces real food without added chemicals, products without toxins, and labels without lies. Vani has been profiled in the New York Times and The Atlantic, and has appeared on Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, CNN, The Dr. Oz Show, The Doctors, and NPR.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. David Perlmutter is a Board-Certified Neurologist and four-time New York Times bestselling author. He serves on the Board of Directors and is a Fellow of the American College of Nutrition. He serves as a member of the Editorial Board for the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease and has published extensively in peer-reviewed scientific journals including Archives of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and The Journal of Applied Nutrition.
