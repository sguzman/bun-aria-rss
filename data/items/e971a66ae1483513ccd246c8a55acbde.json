    "media:description": "Today let's take a look at arguably one of America's strangest religions, the bearded men of the Amish and Anabaptists faiths. We will be going over the origins of the Amish, Mennonites and other Anabaptists in the European continent and their journey from Siberia, to the American frontier and even to the depths of the Amazon rainforest. From Pennsylvania to Bolivia, the Anabaptists continue their unusual luddite form of Christianity that prohibits them from using many forms of modern technology and the ramifications for this cultural microcosm in the future of the US, Latin America and elsewhere.\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.germansfromrussiasettlementlocations.org/2017/12/mennonite-colonies-map-from.html\nhttps://amishamerica.com/only-amish-community-texas/\nhttps://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Amish-Population%3A-County-Estimates-and-Patterns-Donnermeyer-Anderson/16f65b5477c1e8855edcbe50f0ee4895fbebcb12/figure/1\nhttps://www.incontext.indiana.edu/2012/nov-dec/article2.asp\nhttps://medium.com/migration-issues/how-long-until-were-all-amish-268e3d0de87",
