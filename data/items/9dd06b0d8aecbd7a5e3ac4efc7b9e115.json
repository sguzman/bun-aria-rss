It wasn't supposed to be Des' race. Her preparation wasn't ideal. She didn't feel great. And doubt crept in. On top of everything, the weather conditions were unprecedented. So Des Linden decided to do what nobody does — sacrifice herself and her personal performance for the benefit of her friends. She famously pulled up when Shalane Flanagan detoured to the porta potty to pace her back to the group.&nbsp;Then selflessly repeated the gesture to help Molly Huddle bridge a separation gap.</p><p>These are not things you do when you are in it to win it.</p><p>But Des Linden is no ordinary athlete. And this was no ordinary race. At mile 22, Des surged out of nowhere, impossibly depositing her into the lead. In the biggest race of her life — on a day when&nbsp;Mother Nature and her icy rains and 25mph headwinds proved the biggest antagonist — she finally claimed the precious victory that had always previously&nbsp;eluded her.</p><p>Today the 2-time Olympian shares her story.</p><p>How she did it.
