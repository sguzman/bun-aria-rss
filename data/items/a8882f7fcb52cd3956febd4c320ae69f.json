  "description": "<p>Yes, you read that correctly. We bought a house. Rest assured, we haven't decided to abandon the homestead and head into the suburbs. On the contrary, we're making an investment in our future and and the future of our community. Join me today as I explain our plans to (hopefully) generate more income and jump start the growth of an old town. Follow along with our thought process of investing in tools over toys and how this can excel your growth in every area of your life. Don't get me wrong. Im still processing this whole thing as we speak, and it's taken overcoming some fears to get to this point. Listen to find out why learning to push past fear will take you wherever you want to go in life.</p><p>I am so thrilled to have Mason Jars Makerplace as our July sponsor! I have been using their ReCap lids & mason jar accessories non-stop this year as I work on beefing up our pantry.  These lids come in a variety of styles-- flip top, pour spout, shaker inserts, and even sprayers and soap pumps.
