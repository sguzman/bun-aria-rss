He credits much of his success to what he learned in the 100 percent online </span><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Wisconsin Master of Science in Data Science</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (MSDS) program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would not be in the position I am if I had not gone through that program and had that foundational knowledge and practitioner knowledge,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But getting there wasn’t simple. Austin’s path to success resembled a winding road more than a straight line.</span></p>\n<h2><b>From Programming and Art History to Project Delivery</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before he was a published author and Director of Data and AI at </span><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Austin’s interests led him to several experiences in and outside the tech industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the 1980s, Austin&#8217;s father worked in engineering at the onset of computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM). Influenced by his father&#8217;s career and the many computers within his childhood home, Austin began programming at an early age. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He carried that passion for programming with him throughout high school and into college, where he pursued an undergraduate degree in physics at </span><a href=\"https://uwm.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UW-Milwaukee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Austin grew to love the humanities courses he was required to take for his degree and saw a new opportunity to apply his background to an entirely different field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I actually switched to an art history major with a focus on leveraging data and statistics,” Austin said. “Because so much of [art history] was subjective at the time, I was very interested in taking a more empirical, data-driven approach. Having been so focused on technology in my younger years, it was incredibly rewarding to focus on the humanities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin graduated from UW-Milwaukee and later attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post-baccalaureate in art history to dive deeper into the field and explore a potential career change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn&#8217;t want to be 70 or 80 years old and say, well, I stayed in tech and never explored that other potential path in life,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Austin appreciated his time at UCLA, he ultimately decided</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a career in art history wasn’t for him. With many of the art pieces he was studying being variations and copies of original work or stolen without context, the amount of data that could be analyzed in the field at the time was insufficient to drive meaningful insights. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin pivoted his focus back to the tech industry after college, working in project delivery as a project manager, program manager, and eventually portfolio manager</span><b>.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In those roles, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he learned how to run a business and lead engineering efforts while still keeping his technical skills intact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He then had an opportunity to lead a workforce analytics team at </span><a href=\"https://www.northwesternmutual.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Northwestern Mutual</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Milwaukee</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which allowed Austin’s background and interests to converge. Shortly after starting this new position, he enrolled in the UW Data Science program to expand his data science knowledge and grow as a leader.</span></p>\n<h2><b>An Online Data Science Degree Program with Value</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Austin researched graduate-level data science programs, the Wisconsin native compared other universities and their tuition costs to the UW Data Science program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many were incredibly expensive,” he said. “And for an online program, it didn’t make sense to invest $60,000 or $70,000 just to have the university name. Instead, I prioritized quality and program value. Reputation was also important, and UW has a fantastic reputation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course list was another factor that stood out to Austin, as the UW program included diverse course offerings like </span><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Course-Syllabus-for-DS-760.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DS 760: Ethics of Data Science</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Having a class on ethics was perfect, because that’s a constant discussion item when you’re doing any workforce analytics problem,” Austin said. “You have to continually ensure that the analysis you are doing is fair and ethical.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other highlights of the program for Austin included taking courses on </span><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Course-Syllabus-for-DS745.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data visualization and analysis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Course-Syllabus-for-DS-715.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data warehousing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Course-Syllabus-for-DS-780.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strategic decision making</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/original_4a2f0a6c-4c4c-42fa-95d6-6f119696dee0_IMG_20211121_202943.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-7933 alignright\" src=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/original_4a2f0a6c-4c4c-42fa-95d6-6f119696dee0_IMG_20211121_202943-225x300.png\" alt=\"Austin with his daughter\" width=\"416\" height=\"554\" srcset=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/original_4a2f0a6c-4c4c-42fa-95d6-6f119696dee0_IMG_20211121_202943-225x300.png 225w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/original_4a2f0a6c-4c4c-42fa-95d6-6f119696dee0_IMG_20211121_202943.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" /></a>Because the UW Data Science program is 100 percent online, Austin benefited from a flexible learning environment where he could complete coursework anytime, anywhere. The online learning format was especially helpful when major life events took place, like when his family moved to a new city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he graduated from the program with a 4.0 GPA, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin’s experience did not come without some initial challenges. Since he had not taken a college course in many years, part of the learning curve was simply getting back into the rhythm of being a student.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Learning how to learn is in many ways more important than just rote memorization of facts and course materials,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, faculty were engaged and eager to provide support when Austin had questions or feedback. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> received help from </span><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/student-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Success Coach Michael Paul</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.uwlax.edu/profile/jbaggett/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Jeff Baggett,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the assigned student advisor from his home campus of </span><a href=\"https://www.uwlax.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UW-La Crosse</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin found a sense of community in the program. He enjoyed working on group projects and meeting other students through discussion sections, which resulted in interesting networking opportunities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I actually ran into [a former classmate] a couple of years later on the job,” he said. “And we just happened to recognize each other&#8217;s names, living in Texas, of all places. A big part of grad school is who you meet, the connections you make, and developing that passion and career support as you move forward.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin’s determination led him to complete the program in two years, a rapid pace for students working full-time.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>RELATED</strong>: <a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/blog/data-science-course-preview-foundations-of-data-science/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Take a Look at a UW Data Science Course: Foundations of Data Science</a></em></p>\n<h2><b>Finding Further Success in Data Science</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While enrolled in the UW Data Science program, Austin immediately applied the knowledge he learned in the courses to his work as Assistant Director at Northwestern Mutual. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wasn&#8217;t doing a lot of the coding myself, but [I learned how] I could guide the team and step in where they didn&#8217;t have skills,” he said. “It helped me be a better leader.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Austin credits the skills he acquired from the UW Data Science program for the career growth that followed. He used the knowledge and experience gained to help organizations build and grow data science functions and realize the value of data. His latest endeavor as Director of Data and AI at Microsoft opens new doors to driving impact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is a great way to expand [my] knowledge, to help [Microsoft] deliver value for customers through data science, and it’s in a field that is growing and booming,” he said. “There’s a lot that I’ve learned over the years too that I’m able to apply [to this role] because of the UW program.” </span></p>\n<p><em><strong>RELATED</strong>: <a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/blog/data-science-webinar-highlights-future-of-the-field/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data Science Webinar Highlights the Current Job Market and Future of the Field</a></em></p>\n<h2><b>Writing the Next Chapter</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UW Data Science program has helped elevate Austin’s career in more ways than one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each step of the way, the program has benefited me,” he said. “I&#8217;ve been able to be an effective data science leader because I can understand the concepts and speak the language.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This includes written language as well—two months after accepting his position at Microsoft, Austin published </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3030676250?pf_rd_r=B0MZSMZSHKTZKSZA4J82&pf_rd_p=5ae2c7f8-e0c6-4f35-9071-dc3240e894a8&pd_rd_r=7c362973-21b6-4704-9253-fb26696e4462&pd_rd_w=yQOZO&pd_rd_wg=6z5s1&ref_=pd_gw_unk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introducing HR Analytics with Machine Learning: Empowering Practitioners, Psychologists, and Organizations</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

His advice to prospective students? Focus on mastering the core elements and understand how to find and leverage new information. Students should also keep an open mind and have a desire to learn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There&#8217;s a lot of different paths you could take with a program like this,” he said. “And from a career perspective, stay curious. Stay intellectually hungry. Keep learning.
