OP also happens to be a fish owner, so he comes up with a bright idea. He puts bloodworms into the freezer, which are frozen in a red block to look like a popsicle. The food thief falls for it and takes a huge block out of the frozen blood worm block! If you like this podcast and want to see more, follow my podcast for more daily Reddit content!</p>\n",
