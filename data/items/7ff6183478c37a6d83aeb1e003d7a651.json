  "description": "<p>In recent years, aerial swarm technology has developed rapidly. In order to\naccomplish a fully autonomous aerial swarm, a key technology is decentralized\nand distributed collaborative SLAM (CSLAM) for aerial swarms, which estimates\nthe relative pose and the consistent global trajectories. In this paper, we\npropose $D^2$SLAM: a decentralized and distributed ($D^2$) collaborative SLAM\nalgorithm. This algorithm has high local accuracy and global consistency, and\nthe distributed architecture allows it to scale up. $D^2$SLAM covers swarm\nstate estimation in two scenarios: near-field state estimation for high\nreal-time accuracy at close range and far-field state estimation for globally\nconsistent trajectories estimation at the long-range between UAVs. Distributed\noptimization algorithms are adopted as the backend to achieve the $D^2$ goal.\n$D^2$SLAM is robust to transient loss of communication, network delays, and\nother factors. Thanks to the flexible architecture, $D^2$SLAM has the potential\nof applying in various scenarios.\n</p>",
