In the US, the NSA Director says a nation-state made a conscious attempt to influence American elections. Dictators can use social media, too, it seems. Huawei and ZTE reassure customers about the Adups backdoor. Holiday shopping security warnings are out, and they're not just about online purchases, either—watch out for that in-store Wi-Fi. The UK's Snooper's Charter passes the House of Lords. Ran Yahalom from Ben Gurion University describes USB hardware attacks. John LaCour, CEO of Phishlabs provides advice on avoiding (wait for it…) phishing attacks. And a Russian court tells that country's ISPs to shut down LinkedIn—it's a concern about privacy, don't you know.",
