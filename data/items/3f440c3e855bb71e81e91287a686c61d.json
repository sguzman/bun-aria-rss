  "description": "Addiction occurs among physicians at the same rate as in the general population, about 10%. Unlike the general population, however, an intensive rehabilitation program, geared specifically for their profession, vastly improves their chances of finding long-term sobriety. Over 70% of these physicians will be clean and sober-and practicing medicine-five years later. How is this achieved, and can these principles be applied to anyone?\nA Spiritual Pathway to Recovery from Addiction: A Physician’s Journey of Discovery (The Meadows Farm, Inc.) is the memoir of a group of physicians going through an intensive rehab program for addiction to drugs and alcohol. It is presented as a collection of their stories and the lessons they encountered during their time together.\nAs they proceed on a course of personal self-discovery, they share their past experiences, fears, and hopes. As the lessons of recovery begin to sink in, their thinking and behavior change from that of a self-absorbed ego-driven wreck to someone capable of changing their life for the better, without drugs or alcohol.\nIn his memoir, Dr. Meadows shares his insight into the spiritual pathway to recovery from addiction.\nLinville Meadows, M.D. is an Honors graduate of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and studied at Duke University.\nFor more information about Dr. Meadows and his book, please visit https://www.spiritualpathwaytorecovery.com/welcome\nElizabeth Cronin, Psy.D., is a licensed clinical psychologist and mindfulness meditation teacher with offices in Brookline and Norwood, MA.
