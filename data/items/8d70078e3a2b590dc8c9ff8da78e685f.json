  "description": "Will the Euro area's unprecedented program of fiscal risk sharing in response to the pandemic, and a new, likely less fiscally conservative, ruling coalition in Germany increase integration, raise growth and improve investor returns in the region? In the latest episode, experts debate whether the current moment will go down as a seized—or (another) missed—opportunity for Euro area integration. Host Allison Nathan, creator and author of the Top of Mind report on which the episode is based, speaks with Goldman Sachs Research’s Jari Stehn, former ECB Chief Economist Otmar Issing, former PM of Italy and President of the EC Romano Prodi and Oxford’s Timothy Garton Ash.",
