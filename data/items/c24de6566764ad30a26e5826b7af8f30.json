    "media:description": "Feedback by students and their teacher in a UK school about using our OER videos in the flipped classroom model. Hear for yourself what they have to say!\n\nIf you are free to test this approach and our free resources at your school, please get in touch via info@fuseschool.org\n\nfuseSchool has the intention of not only revolutionising access to good quality education free for everyone. We feel we also have an opportunity in those countries where access is provided, where good teaching does happen already. In these types of scenarios, we want to give teachers and students the chance to liberate there time in the science classroom - by applying fuseSchool videos in the flipped classroom model. \n\nPerhaps the experience made with this is best told by the users themselves - hence we recorded a set of interviews with students and teachers, and here you can see the result, in a concise video about the flipped classroom experience with fuseSchool so far.",
