Green is not a creative color but the people who made the show sure are. They turned the iconic series into a real tv show on england television on channel 4. With a bigger budget it was given 6 episodes to make amazing new episodes. So today on Spilling The Milk we reacted to the first 3 episodes or full episodes not just clips and funny or scary moments of the new show.  Don't Hug Me I'm Scared REACTION BABY\n\n#dhmis #reaction #channel4",
