  "description": "<p>I'm 38 weeks pregnant and terrified that I still feel so negatively about my current life and the idea of life with two babies under two...so in this episode I unpack these very ugly feelings with some beautiful souls: actor Shanola Hampton (mother of two) and performance coach Lauren Morrison (mother of two). With them I ask the million dollar questions: what happens when the way you know you're supposed to feel, has little resemblance to your reality? And more frighteningly... What if that never changes?</p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n<p>This is a unique episode of Lovers and Friends and also apart of a small series I'm going to make surrounding preparing my life for our second blessing, our second (yet to be named) daughter. Regularly scheduled program will be back in late August!</p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n<p><strong>Follow Shan </strong></p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://instagram.com/shanboody\">http://instagram.com/shanboody</a></p>\n<p>Call in to the show to leave a voice note<br>\n‪(323) 375-4797<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:loversfriendspodcast@gmail.com\">loversfriendspodcast@gmail.com</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Follow the guests on this episode </strong></p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n<p>Shanola Hampton</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://instagram.com/shanolahampton\">http://instagram.com/shanolahampton</a></p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n<p>Lauren Morrison</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://maketheshiftcoach.com/\">http://maketheshiftcoach.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://instagram.com/thisislaurenelizabeth\">http://instagram.com/thisislaurenelizabeth</a></p>\n\n",
