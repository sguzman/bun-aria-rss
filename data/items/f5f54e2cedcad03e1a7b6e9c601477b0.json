  "description": "Changing things up a bit this week… Daniel returns to discuss current events. We start by going over a bizarre situation involving Southwest Airlines...  The airline canceled nearly 2,000 flights over the weekend, blaming it on bad weather. Daniel and I discuss the role vaccine mandates are playing in the disruption. [1:30] Speaking of vaccine mandates, I’m done sugarcoating this: Freedoms are being taken away from individuals here in the U.S. While I'm personally vaccinated, I strongly believe it should be an individual choice… and these mandates will crush our economy. [5:30] Inflation is making it a tough environment for finding ideas. Daniel explains why he’s focusing on ESG (environmental, social, and governance). [18:40] With earnings season kicking into full gear, we share what we’re most excited about as we dig through earnings results. [28:20] Lastly, if you’re looking for an easy way to add crypto to your portfolio, keep an eye out for a special offer I’m putting together for my Crypto Intelligence advisory. We’ve got some massive winners in the portfolio—I’m talking in the triple and quadruple digits—with more room to run… [32:50]. ---------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyed this episode?
