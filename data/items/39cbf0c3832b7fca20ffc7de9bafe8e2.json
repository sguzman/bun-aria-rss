  "description": "Beirut's latest album, The Rip Tide, was recorded in New York during the winter of 2010 and takes a surprise turn away from the group's early, ?o?ek-influenced sound and toward more mainstream indie rock. But the band hasn't reinvented itself entirely: Anyone drawn to the trumpet and ukulele on Beirut's first album, Gulag Orkestar, will find those familiar sounds on The Rip Tide, but set amidst wurlitzer, pump organ and percussion that can sound almost electronic at times. Beirut showcased this new material in a live concert webcast from Washington, D.C.'s 9:30 Club. ",
