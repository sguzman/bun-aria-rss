Since I’ve been dating her husband, I see that he’s being bullied by her. I didn’t want to believe it at first but she talks to him like he’s a weakling and he won’t say anything to her because she hits below the belt............................</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
