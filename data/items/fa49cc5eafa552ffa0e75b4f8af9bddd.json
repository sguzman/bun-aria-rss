  "description": "So much for a relaxing Thanksgiving break… Markets sold off on news of the new COVID variant, Omicron, and volatility is soaring. I expect both the media and the government to overreact… But don’t worry: In today’s show, I lay out what you need to know—and do—in the coming weeks to prepare your portfolio. [0:30] While we still don’t know much about Omicron, countries around the world are already restricting travel. I highlight the dangers of governments reacting prematurely… what we currently know about the new variant… and how the narrative has changed around vaccines. [7:25] I also explain why the market selloff we’re seeing is illogical… and how the media and big business—especially Big Pharma—use fear to make profits. [13:00] But volatility leads to opportunities... Here’s what investors should be focused on as we prepare for the Omicron circus. [21:30] Fed Chair Jerome Powell testified on Capitol Hill today regarding the country’s economic outlook—including ongoing inflationary pressures. I break down the huge mistake the Fed continues to make… why inflation isn’t priced into this market… and why we need to be prepared for it to get much worse before it gets better. [31:40] Finally, I explain why Genia Turanova’s  strategy is the perfect way to hedge today’s market risks—and why I personally follow it with my own money. [39:15] Enjoyed this episode?
