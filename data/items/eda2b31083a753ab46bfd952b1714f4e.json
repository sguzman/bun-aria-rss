Unfortunately, there still have not been any arrests in the crime that has evolved into the most notorious murder investigation in recent South Carolina history. \nHowever, this week we broke some important news in the double homicide. \nAudio and video evidence obtained by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division shows that Alex Murdaugh was at Moselle in the moments just before the murders. \nIn this episode, Mandy and Liz take you through everything we know about the double homicide — the means, the motive, and opportunity. \nWe’ve learned in this case how important sunlight is — and you’ll hear attorneys Eric Bland and Ronnie Richter and FITSNews founding editor Will Folks talk about that. \nAlso in this episode, we share good news in the jailhouse phone call case. \n\nThe Murdaugh Murders Podcast is created by Mandy Matney and Luna Shark Productions.
