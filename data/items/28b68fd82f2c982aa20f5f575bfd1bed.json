  "description": "<em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obedience.</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s an outdated word, right? But really, our questions in motherhood about where to send our kids to school, what to feed them, and even how we spend our time and money, boils down to this. We don’t want to fail, so we wonder what to obey, how to obey, and how to keep going when we stumble. Essentially, we want to know what it looks like to live ‘Risen Motherhood’—to do all things in a way that please God. This is what we’re exploring in our new mini-series. In the first episode, Emily and Laura tackle these questions and explain why obedience brings freedom. We want to be good moms, and obedience to Christ’s commands is the place to start.</span> <p>____</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re so thankful for</span> <a href=\"http://www.crossway.org/risenmotherhood\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Crossway</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">, publisher of the</span> <a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/articles/special-offers-for-risen-motherhood-listeners/\"> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ten Words to Live By</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Jen Wilkin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for helping make this mini-series possible!</span> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">This book is a fresh, biblical look at the Ten Commandments and how they impact our lives today.
