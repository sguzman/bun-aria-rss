  "description": "<p>Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa are joined by Sopranos writer/executive producer and Academy Award nominee Terry Winter. Terry is a fascinating character and if you don’t know his full story check out Talking Sopranos #18. In this interview he talks about what it was like going into that final season, and how the writers were trying to wrap things up. He shares what David told him about the ending, and what he thought about the cut to black. Terry wrote four episodes in Season 7 including this one which he both wrote and directed. It was also the only show he ever directed. </p><p>In this episode Christopher and Paulie are at odds and AJ can’t handle his break up with Blanca. Robert Iler’s is absolutely fantastic in this one.
