  "description": "Relax.  Keep your champagne on ice.  Donald Trump is still president of the United States.  And his foreign policy--which is a crudely mixed cocktail of racism and greed with a twist of incompetence--is still what America is serving up to the world.  But that won't always be the case.  In fact a New Democratic House of Representatives may start changing some of it pretty soon.  Which begs the question, where do we go from here?  What about the tariffs and the transactionalism and the attacks on international institutions and the distrust of our allies and alliances is going to outlast Trump and what will change the day he leave the White House?  We discuss in a great and wide-ranging conversation with one of the Democratic Party's foremost foreign policy thought-leaders, former National Security Advisor to V.P. Joe Biden and chief advisor to the Hillary Clinton Campaign, Jake Sullivan.
