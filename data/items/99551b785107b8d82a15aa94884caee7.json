  "description": "<p>Your boyfriend's close friend flirts with him directly in front of you. He doesn't reciprocate, but it does bother you because you know -- from conversation you've had with her in the past before you became his significant other -- that she actually <em>does</em> fancy him. Should you communicate your displeasure to either party or just keep your cool?</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Jason DeFillippo</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpdef\" target=\"_blank\">@jpdef</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
