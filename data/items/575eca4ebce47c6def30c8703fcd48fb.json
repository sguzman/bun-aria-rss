  "description": "<p>Ribera del Duero makes some of the most outstanding Tempranillo in the world. Located in the northwest of the Spain, about two hours north of Madrid, Ribera del Duero has been making wine for 2,600 years but its modern story is one of a dynamic, changing region that is improving every year. This is an exciting region and an example of Spain's willingness to change, improve and go the distance to produce excellent quality wine.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/img2017737114.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"179\" /><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><a href= \"https://www.foodswinesfromspain.com/spanishfoodwine/global/wine/do/product-detail/PRG2017737113.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Photo: Food & Wines from Spain</em></a></span></p> <p>Here are the show notes:</p> <ul> <li>Ribera del Duero is on an elevated northern plateau of the Iberian Peninsula.
