  "description": "<p>Part 4 - Equanimity: Present Heart - Universal Expressions of Love (2018-02-28) - Equanimity unfolds as we find a wise balance and spaciousness in the midst of this living, dying world. This series reflects on four primary expressions of an awake, wise heart: lovingkindness, compassion, joy and equanimity. In each talk we explore the habitual patterning that blocks our full realization of these innate capacities, and the understandings and practices that nurture their unfolding.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely.
