  "description": "With a stage name that's helped him rise to the top of iTunes libraries everywhere, A.A. Bondy -- once known as Scott Bondy from the band Verbena -- writes dark songs about staying a half-step ahead of damnation and doom. Fortunately, Bondy's gentle voice and low-key arrangements help him cut through the bleakness with considerable warmth and pop appeal. Expect him to showcase songs from last year's 'When the Devil's Loose at the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, R.I.",
