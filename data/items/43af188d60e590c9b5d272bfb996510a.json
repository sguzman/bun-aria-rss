The Pro Bowl is broken (6:17 - 11:32). Who's back of the week including our first ever sponge bob review (11:32 - 22:16) . Coach Jeff Fisher joins the show for an extended interview about his career, the narrative about his coaching, the music city miracle almost not working, and the time a bear attacked him (22:16Â  - 82:28).
