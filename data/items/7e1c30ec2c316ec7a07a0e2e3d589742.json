He collected their responses and here are the results. For a more detailed look at responses, here is the spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DPYWmmEy2P13xI0KptkkGW2rjeXXGPNrxAuW30IbpsE/edit?usp=sharing \nIt's a working document, meaning he'll keep updating it if he gets more responses. \n\nProduced by Matt Beat.

After this experience, that‚Äôs not true at all.\n\nI assumed I would get way more responses.\n\nI do get why Representatives can‚Äôt make much time for constituents. The average Representative is supposed to represent 759,000 people. But as I said in my follow-up video to calling every Senator, I KNOW these Representatives make time for their campaign donors, and I KNOW they make time for lobbyists who bribe them. So I ask again‚Ä¶why can‚Äôt they make time for us?\n\nThis whole experience of calling every member of Congress has caused me to question everything about how our federal government is supposed to function. I used to naively believe that we truly lived in a constitutional republic, just like I used to teach my students in Government class. But these Representatives don‚Äôt seem to represent us much at all.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n1:44 The bill I focused on\n12:32 Responses\n15:14 My takeaways\n17:19 My own Congressman's response\n19:06 My final takeaway",
