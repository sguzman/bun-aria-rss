  "description": "Being sworn into the Supreme Court is a major accomplishment to add to your resume of life. But for Thurgood Marshall, being sworn into the nation's highest court was not just a major achievement for himself, but a leading step forward in society. On this episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, Maia reveals the reason why Thurgood Marshall is a pivotal character in our nation's history. He influenced not just those around him, but inspired a generation of individuals younger than him to step up and be courageous in their search for justice. In addition to this, Maia as well shares the story of a musical figure who is the voice behind the band’s biggest hits, like “Don’t Stand So Close to Me” and “Every Breath You Take.” You might not know him by his real name, but he sure does fly like a butterfly and sting like a bee. Join this episode today and make sure you’re following along with the daily updates @365daysmxmtoon on all platforms.
