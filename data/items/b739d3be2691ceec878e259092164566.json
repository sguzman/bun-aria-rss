  "title": "Emission Control: The Expanding Low Carbon Economy",
  "description": "Until recently, low carbon technologies like wind and solar were a niche part of the global energy landscape. But Goldman Sachs Research's GS SUSTAIN team, which focuses on identifying long-term industry leaders, says that low carbon technologies like onshore wind, solar PV, LEDs and hybrid/electric vehicles are now \"taking off the training wheels\" and rapidly gaining share. According to GS SUSTAIN's Jaakko Kooroshy, these four technologies not only could help global carbon emissions peak as early as 2020, versus mainstream expectations of a peak closer to 2030-they're also poised to reshape competitive dynamics across the global economy.\n\n\nThis podcast was recorded on July 11, 2016.\n\n\nAll price references and market forecasts correspond to the date of this recording.\n\n\nThis podcast should not be copied, distributed, published or reproduced, in whole or in part.
