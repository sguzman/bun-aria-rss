  "description": "<p>When adapting Simultaneous Mapping and Localization (SLAM) to real-world\napplications, such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and augmented reality\ndevices, its memory footprint and computing cost are the two main factors\nlimiting the performance and the range of applications. In sparse feature based\nSLAM algorithms, one efficient way for this problem is to limit the map point\nsize by selecting the points potentially useful for local and global bundle\nadjustment (BA). This study proposes an efficient graph optimization for\nsparsifying map points in SLAM systems. Specifically, we formulate a maximum\npose-visibility and maximum spatial diversity problem as a minimum-cost\nmaximum-flow graph optimization problem. The proposed method works as an\nadditional step in existing SLAM systems, so it can be used in both\nconventional or learning based SLAM systems. By extensive experimental\nevaluations we demonstrate the proposed method achieves even more accurate\ncamera poses with approximately 1/3 of the map points and 1/2 of the\ncomputation.\n</p>",
