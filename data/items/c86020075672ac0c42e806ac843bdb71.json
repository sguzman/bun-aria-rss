  "description": "<p>Yes, there is wine made in Uruguay, a small but mighty country that borders Argentina in the east. In this episode you'll learn about a country we should all have on our list to visit and Tannat, the wine we should all have on the list to buy!</p> <p>Some of the important stuff we discussed:</p> <ul> <li>Uruguay is between the 30 – 35th parallels, so pockets of coolness are needed to keep structure in the wines</li> <li>Most of the wine is made by small producers</li> <li>The area has 22,250 acres of vines (Napa alone has 45K) and 200 wineries (Napa has over 400)</li> <li>Most of the wine is red, and most of that is Tannat with some Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Cabernet Franc. The biggest white grapes are Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc.</li> <li>Tannat is a robust, tannic red that has a pivotal role in the country's rising wine status. It's similar to Carmenere in Chile, Malbec in Argentina. Uruguay makes Old World Style Tannat, France makes New World Style Tannat!!! Wines are  rich, full-bodied wines with dark fruit and spice aromas and flavors</li> <li>Top regions include: Montevideo, Canelones, Colonia, San Jose, Maldonado, and Salto</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>You may have a hard time finding these wines, but ask your wine shop to bring a bottle in for you. I promise it's worth the hunt! Great stuff! </p>",
