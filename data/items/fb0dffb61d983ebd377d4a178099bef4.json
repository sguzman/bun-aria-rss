  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, President Biden had a town hall event yesterday. Mostly he babbled incoherently, but the coherent parts were the most disturbing. Among other things, he called for kids over the age of 12 to wear masks. We’ll talk about why pushing masks on kids, especially at this point, is irrational, anti-science, and abusive. Also our Five Headlines, including a new poll which shows that race relations are at their lowest point in decades. I wonder who we can blame for that? And JK Rowling continues to stand firm in the face of insane hatred from trans activists. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will address the very intense backlash from my review of a BTS song.\nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
