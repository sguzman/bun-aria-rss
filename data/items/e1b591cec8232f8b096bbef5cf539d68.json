Given permission to do the thing that was in your heart, acknowledged and seen for who you are, even when it seemed everyone else was shutting you down or telling you to take a different and often \"safer\" option? If so, you know the power of that person who accepted and inspired you in that moment.</p><p>But, what about the other side of that conversation? What's it like to be person who lights that fire, who sees, heres, feels and acknowledges someone else at a moment that sparks a profound awakening to possibility? That's what we're talking about on today's GLP Riff.</p><p><strong>Good Life Science:</strong>&nbsp;In our Good Life Science segment, we're diving into some fascinating research on how \"visualizing\" exercise can potentially deliver similar gains in strength as \"doing\" the exercise.
