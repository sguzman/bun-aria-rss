  "title": "PMS 2.0 301 - Thanksgiving Day Games, Mike Alstott, Tom Pelissero, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys preview the Thanksgiving Day games, react to the news that the Ravens v. Steelers game has been canceled due to a Covid outbreak in Baltimore, and Pat and AJ Hawk dive into some questions from other sports shows and give their takes about everything going on around the NFL. Later, NFL Network Insider, and friend of the program, Tom Pelissero joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about the decision to cancel the Ravens/Steelers game, if an NFL week 18 is inevitable at this point, teams jumping into more intensive protocols now that the playoffs are in sight, and everything else happening around the NFL (33:44-54:59). Next, Super Bowl Champion, 6x Pro Bowler, 4x All-Pro, member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Ring of Honor, one of the most physical running backs of all-time, Mike Alstott joins the show. Pat and Mike chat about his career and his mentality going into every game, if he thinks he'd be successful in today's NFL, his focus now being a high school football coach in Florida and how that has filled his football void since retiring, what his workouts were like in high school, college, and the NFL, and much much more (55:01-1:17:35).
