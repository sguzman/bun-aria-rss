  "description": "'Twas four days before Christmas, and all through the club, not a single bear was stirring, not even a cub. The fishnets were hung, by the faux fireplace with care, in the hopes that Trixie and Katya, would magically sprout thick, luscious hair. They were comfy and nestled, all snug in their beds, whilst questions of \"Who would play her?\" danced through their heads. When out on the boulevard, there arose such a clatter, it was their crazy neighbor Andre, dressed like the Mad Hatter. He yelled up to their window, \"Hey Trixie! Hey Katya! Come down and let's party!\" To which Trixie replied, \"I can't! I had Taco Bell and now I'm a bit farty!\" As Andre ran away, in a ketamine-fueled haze, Trixie and Katya turned to the camera and yelled, \"To all the Bald & Beautiful listeners, we wish you Happy F**king Holidays!\"\n\nFollow Trixie: @TrixieMattel\nFollow Katya: @Katya_Zamo\n\n\nTo listen to our podcast on YouTube: http://bit.ly/TrixieKatyaYT\n\n\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the podcast for free wherever you're listening or by using this link: http://bit.ly/baldandthebeautifulpodcast\n\n\nIf you want to support the show, and get all the episodes ad-free go to https://thebaldandthebeautiful.supercast.com/\n\n\nIf you like the show, telling a friend about it would be helpful!
