  "description": "<p>On today’s show, the guys welcome IndyCar Driver and friend of the show, Conor Daly into the studio. He makes an announcement regarding his participation in the Indianapolis 500, chats about what his 2019 season will look like, and talks more about some of his previous races, crashes, and what he thinks could be done to make IndyCar more entertaining moving forward (3:07-49:06). Todd wants to know what type of fast food restaurants the guys would open, along with a signature menu item. They also get to the bottom of whether or not Jack Nicholson actually had a heart attack, and try to decide the roommate arrangements for Atlanta. They also answer some listener questions including what their top 3 Super Bowl party snacks are, and what one entity they would each sue for loss of enjoyment of life. To close out the show, the guys each give out some vitamin thoughts. It's a fun one, come and have a good time with us.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode features @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @HeyGorman, @VivalaZito, @evanfoxy, and @ConorDaly22.</p>\n",
