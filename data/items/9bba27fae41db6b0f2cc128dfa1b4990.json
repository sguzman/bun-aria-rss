  "title": "275 - The Bible With & Without Jesus - with Dr. Amy Jill Levine",
  "description": "This one is fun! Today we sit down with one of our favorite guests, Dr. Amy Jill Levine and discuss some of the theology and ideas behind her new book, “The Bible With & Without Jesus.” Dr. Levine, who is a University Professor of New Testament and Jewish Studies, Mary Jane Werthan Professor of Jewish Studies, and Professor of New Testament Studies at Vanderbilt Divinity School, presents a way for people with differing faiths to interact and learn from one another while not compromising their own beliefs. Is it possible for a Christian to grow a more robust faith and understanding of Jesus by interacting with the Jewish tradition? How can we re-approach scripture and tradition? How does context change understanding? How did Jesus’s Jewish heritage effect his teaching? How does interpretation, translation and even mood effect our reading and understanding of text? This was such a fun and enlightening conversation. \n\nYou can purchase Dr. Levine’s book here: https://www.amazon.com/Bible-Without-Jesus-Christians-Differently/dp/0062560158/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&hvadid=78134114429055&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvqmt=e&keywords=amy+jill+levine&qid=1608574374&sr=8-2&tag=mh0b-20\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
