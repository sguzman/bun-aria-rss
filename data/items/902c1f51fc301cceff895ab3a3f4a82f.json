  "description": "In this episode, we talk about the master or primary bedroom and advantages of investing in your own sleeping space, which can tend to get neglected when you're a parent trying to tend to the other rooms in your house. We want to help the listener have a better experience sleeping & living in your room of privacy and repose. We start our discussion by answering questions from listeners, including how to pick furniture while not being too “matchy.” We feel the answer is to look at function by addressing the habits of those living in the room, as well as room design and color. <br /><br />We discuss space planning with the bed, dressers and nightstands, how to get the right scale of art above your bed, using a 30” lamp for your nightstands and when to blend TV’s into walls.  We share the advantages of using a rug, even if your floor is already carpeted and how that helps delineate space and benefits of a settee or small sofa at the foot of the bed. <br /><br />Are you struggling with styling your nightstand?  Our recommendation is to start by cleaning off the top completely, then adding the lamp (softer, round shaped to soften angles and corners in the room), faux florals, coasters, and whatever else you need and use. Trays and bowls can be useful to keep things from falling. Don't feel pressured to fill the whole space up -- less is more.<br /><br />We talk about our favorite way to dress your bed including our favorite sheets, white quilts and adding interest with the duvet or pillows.  There are easy ways to make your room feel luxurious, therapeutic, and soothing by getting the right scent, selecting candles that will help you relax and linen sprays.  <br /><br />All these elements work together to create an amazing space for you to relax and enjoy. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a><br /><br />Bedroom Dressers and Tables 1:54<br />Space Planning 11:39<br />What to Put Above the Bed; Bedding 18:03<br />Getting the Right Scent For Your Room  25:42<br />How To Style a Dresser/Nightstand in a Master Bedroom 27:54<br /><br />“I’m picturing more of a darker, coffee-stained or a walnut nightstand that’s a chest, and then next to that, on her side of the bed, is a round table that has a marble top. And maybe it’s a black iron base, so it feels like an estate. So they’re actually not the same finish, but they have depth -- the black iron does, and so does the dark, burled wood.”  6:42<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a>",
