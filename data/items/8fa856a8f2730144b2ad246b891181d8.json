  "description": "<p>Count Dankula met me in Edinburgh, Scotland to tell me about his crazy ordeal being arrested AND CONVICTED of a crime for making a funny video on YouTube. It's a crazy state of things right now, all over the world. So come listen in to the Glaswegian (if you can understand the accent) tell about what he went through. The video will be posted on my site, arithegreat.com.</p> <p>Now, whether you find the video funny or not is of no consequence to the point. I personally found it quite funny. It made me legitimately laugh. But that's also got nothing to do with it. The point is whether a government should be mandating what types of humor people should be allowed to put out.</p> <p>My next tour stop is in Austin on the 19th-22nd of September where I will be performing Ari Shaffir: Jew, followed by one night of shows and a storyteller show in Phoenix at the end of October. Then my European tour goes from mid-November till the end of December.</p>",
