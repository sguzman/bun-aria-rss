We hope you'll buy a copy and tell your friends and colleagues and leave us a review. We put a lot of work into this book and think it's one of the best ways to learn Deep Reinforcement Learning from the fundamentals to implementing some of the latest research papers.</p>\n<p>Here's the table of contents:</p>\n<h5>PART 1:  FOUNDATIONS</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>1 What Is Reinforcement Learning</li>\n<li>2 Modeling Reinforcement Learning Problems: Markov Decision Processes</li>\n<li>3 Predicting the Best States and Actions: Deep Q-Networks</li>\n<li>4 Learning to Pick the Best Action: Policy Gradients</li>\n<li>5 Tackling more Complex Environments with Actor-Critic Methods</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>PART 2:  ABOVE AND BEYOND</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>6 Alternative Optimization Methods: Evolutionary Algorithms</li>\n<li>7 Distributional DQN: Getting the full story</li>\n<li>8 Curiosity-Driven Exploration</li>\n<li>9 Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</li>\n<li>10    Interpretable Reinforcement Learning: Attention and Relational Models</li>\n<li>11    Conclusion</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>APPENDICES</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>A Deep Learning, Mathematics, PyTorch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>-Brandon</p>",
