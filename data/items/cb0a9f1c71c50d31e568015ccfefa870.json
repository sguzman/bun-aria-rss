But what does that mean for the ERA now? Does it finally have a shot at becoming the law of the land, or will it be marred by an endless series of legal challenges? ERA Coalition Co-President and CEO Carol Jenkins walks Katie through the history of the amendment and what comes next. Katie also talks with playwright Heidi Schreck about why the ERA’s inclusion is so crucial for — and personal to — American women.</strong></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
