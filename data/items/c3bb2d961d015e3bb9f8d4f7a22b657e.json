And while these creatures likely don’t exist, that doesn’t mean it isn’t fun to speculate on their biology. Enter Cryptozoologicon, a book that imagines evolutionary backstories for legendary creatures. Created by renowned paleontologist Darren Naish, alongside channel mainstays C.M. Koseman (author of All Tomorrows) and John Conway — the volume is so detailed that it’s worth exploring further.\n\nSo, for this entry into the archive, we’ll investigate the speculative biology of the world’s most famous cryptids. You can purchase the book and follow and support the creators using the links in the description below.\n\nNow, let’s explore the creatures of Cryptozoologicon…\n\n0:00 Creatures of Cryptozoologicon\n2:04 Bigfoot & Yeti\n3:36 Chupacabra\n4:41 Loch Ness Monster? \n6:26 Bunyip\n7:44 Beast of Gevaudan\n9:18 Megalodon\n10:42 Ahool\n11:40 Kelpie\n12:56 Mbielu-Mbielu-Mbielu\n14:29 Goatman\n15:31 Lost Dinosaur\n16:29 De Loys’s Ape\n17:41 Long Necked Seal\n18:31 Tizheruk\n19:30 Hoop Snake\n21:03 Support the Creators\n \nCopyright Disclaimer: Under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education, and research.
