  "description": "Season 2 Episode 4 MAT BERGEL Props Team Deakins is so pleased to welcome props maestro Mat Bergel (ROBIN HOOD, HUGO, TRAINSPOTTING) to the podcast. Mat starts this conversation by detailing how he got into the movie business through managing restaurants, and landed in the props department. He explains why some of the hardest work for the props team involve eating, drinking, and smoking scenes. We talk about the different kinds of acting styles that relate to props, and why some actors latch onto them, while others seem to dismiss them out of hand. Then things get exciting with tales of jostled Faberge eggs, missing Rolex watches, and a stolen Picasso! You won’t want to miss this one!",
