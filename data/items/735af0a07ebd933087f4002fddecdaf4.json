  "description": "<p>In 1987, John O’Leary was a curious nine-year-old boy. Playing with fire and gasoline, he created a massive explosion in his home and was burned on 100% of his body. He was given less than a 1% chance to live. John not only survived but, with the support of an incredible family, friends and community, found a way to reclaim a sense of wonder, joy and service that has led to a stunning career inspiring millions, writing books, while marrying the love of his life and raising four kids together. His #1 National Bestselling book ON FIRE recounts much of this story, and his popular Live Inspired Podcast takes you deeper into lessons learned.&nbsp;John's new book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dQ1dUO\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>IN AWE</em></a>, (https://amzn.to/3dQ1dUO) explores the key elements that allow you to live from a place of awe, no matter what the world throws at you.</p><p>We recorded a Good Life Project conversation with John in 2016, which you can listen to <a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/john-oleary-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>: https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/john-oleary-2/</p><p>You can find John O'Leary at:</p><p><a href=\"http://johnolearyinspires.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> : http://johnolearyinspires.com/</p><p><a href=\"http://instagram.com/johnoleary.inspires/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> : http://instagram.com/johnoleary.inspires/</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My New Book </strong><a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a></li><li><strong>My New Podcast </strong><a href=\"https://pod.link/1610198312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SPARKED</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sponsors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Our Sponsor Page For a Complete List of Vanity URLs & Discount Codes.</a></li></ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
