  "description": "Buy some FFT stuff here (use promo code FANTASYFOOTBALL20): https://store.cbssports.com/collections/fantasy-football-today%20\nWe start the show with an offensive line that got much better and a couple that have gotten worse. Then we have some quick rankings debates (4:35)! Antonio Gibson vs. J.K. Dobbins. Allen Robinson vs. Darnell Mooney ... News and notes (10:50) with a lot of Rams news and a case for Sammy Watkins as the best Packers WR. And let's talk about players with wide ranges of draft value. You might see these players taken fairly early in your drafts or you may see them slide. We talk Javonte Williams (18:15), Saquon Barkley/Cam Akers (22:00), Tee Higgins/Jaylen Waddle (29:40), Breece Hall (33:40), Michael Thomas (35:40), Antonio Gibson/Josh Jacobs/Eli Mitchell (36:50) and a trio of running backs who have a lot to gain and/or lose during training camp (42:00) ... Breaking down the offensive lines (45:30)! We tell you which teams had the best and worst lines last season, what it meant for Fantasy and which teams have gotten significantly better or worse in 2022 ...
