That's the Sublime. And that's what we're talking about on today's ep. It's a concept in aesthetic philosophy and it's a bit difficult to describe, but you know when you see it. Other topics discussed include VR Everest, the amount of space in Michigan, and the amount of space in space! Enjoy!</strong></p>",
