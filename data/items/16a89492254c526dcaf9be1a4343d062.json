  "description": "<p>The Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (QSSEP) is a model of quantum\nparticles hopping on a finite interval and satisfying the exclusion principle.\nRecently Bernard and Jin have studied the fluctuations of the invariant measure\nfor this process, when the number of sites goes to infinity. These fluctuations\nare encoded into polynomials, for which they have given equations and proved\nthat these equations determine the polynomials completely. In this paper, I\ngive an explicit combinatorial formula for these polynomials, in terms of\nSchr\\\"oder trees. I also show that, quite surprisingly, these polynomials can\nbe interpreted as free cumulants of a family of commuting random variables.\n</p>",
