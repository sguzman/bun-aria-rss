  "description": "Werewolves are people that turn into wolves. Or they don't. Maybe they just wear a fancy wolf belt. Or maybe part of a wolf skin. Or maybe they just like to think they're a wolf. Or maybe they're just people that like killing. Werewolf stories are simple ones, but there's no simple answer as to why this thing happens. And it did. A lot. All throughout history there are stories of Werewolves, stretching back as far as Ancient Greece. As it turns out, humans being monstrous is as old as humanity itself. The creature this time is the reason why you'll want to avoid the river if you see a ghostly woman crying out for her children. But if you're not already doing that, a podcast description won't save you. Sponsors: Check out Hello Fresh! It's the best meal delivery service we've used.
