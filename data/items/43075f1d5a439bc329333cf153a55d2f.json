  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Rich Zeoli from WPHT fills in for Mark. Was former FBI Assistant Director Andrew McCabe's discussion of the 25th Amendment a joke? If he and the others in his cabal loved America so much why did they circumvent all of her laws? The 25th Amendment was created for the cabinet in the event of the death, incapacitation, or extremely ill health of the President—not for rogue FBI officials to circumvent an election they disagreed with. The FBI wasn't created to stop campaigns, candidates or sitting presidents. The only part of our government that is charged with removing a president is the US Congress through the Constitutional process of impeachment. Yet McCabe threw Rod Rosenstein under the bus several times in his 60 minutes interview continually saying he offered to wear a wire on several occasions to secretly record the President inside the White House. Then, Actor Jussie Smollett continues denying any involvement in what is now beginning to look like a hoax attack that may have been staged.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
