  "description": "<p>Summer is here and that means there’s an abundance of memories to capture and save. Today I’m going to share the 4 elements to capturing better summer memories to remember for years to come without being hyper-focused on the camera.</p><p><b>The 4 Elements of Capturing Better Summer Memories</b></p><p><b>#1 Prepare:</b> Theres a fine line between capturing everything and being present in the summertime activities. That means you’re going to miss some photos and you have to be ok with that! Make summer time photos a game. Give your self a rule like Only one camera and one lens for the whole summer.</p><p><b>#2 Capture:</b> Focus on just two photography elements this summer to skyrocket the quality of your photography. Composition and Action. Focusing on these two aspects of photography will force you to think quickly during the fast-paced summertime activities.</p><p><b>#3 Edit:</b> The majority of the photos we take are in the 3-4 months that are summer, so you need to have a system to organize your images so they don’t get lost. I choose to orginize my family photos by year and month. That way I don’t have a million folders called “Kids at the Park”. Next, you want to spend your summertime enjoying the summer and not stuck behind a computer editing. Download my 52 Free Lightroom presets today to speed up your editing and unlock the full potential of your summertime images. <a href='https://www.freephotographypresets.com/'>www.FreePhotographyPresets.com</a></p><p><b>#4 Share:</b> What good are summertime memories if you cant share them with family, friends, and your future self. Do yourself a favor and have your photos printed at your local big box store or make a summertime book within Lightroom and have it printed by Blurb.</p><p><b>Resources:</b></p><ul><li><a href='https://freephotographypresets.com/'>Download your FREE 52 Lightroom Presets Now</a></li><li><a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/1278078252272020'>Join The Beginner Photography Podcast Facebook Community</a></li></ul><p>Grab your Free CloudSpot Account at <a href=\"http://deliverphotos.com/\">DeliverPhotos.com</a></p> <p>Grab your Free CloudSpot Account at <a href=\"http://deliverphotos.com/\">DeliverPhotos.com</a></p>",
