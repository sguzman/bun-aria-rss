  "description": "Finally, we're previewing a game! Before we get to the full HOU-KC preview let's talk about the Brandin Cooks injury (2:06) and who to start if Cooks is out. And we've got more news for you, plus the players who have moved the most in our rankings since the start of training camp (14:00) like Antonio Gibson and Devin Singletary ... Let's preview HOU-KC (21:10)! We know who the obvious starts are, but is David Johnson going to struggle against the KC run defense? Who should you bench for Will Fuller?

Will Cam Newton run the ball? Will the ATL OL take a big step forward? And we finish the show with NFL predictions (44:40) and Buy or Sell from our listeners (49:00). Will the Patriots make the playoffs? ...
