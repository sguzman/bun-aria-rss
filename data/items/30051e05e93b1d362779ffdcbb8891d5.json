Have you ever thought about that before?</p> <p>Life is such a delicate thing, yet it’s not something to experience without a zest and vigor that throws caution to the wind, and pulls every ounce out of this opportunity.</p> <p>Rationality would say that the longer you live, the more opportunity for experiences you have. This is definitely true if, of course, you’re taking full advantage of the situation called “your life”.</p> <p>Many people live less in terms of number of years, but far more in terms of experiences, fullness, and impact. Abraham Lincoln said, “It’s not the years in your life that count, it’s the life in your years.” So when you decide how long you want to live and walk in that direction, make sure that it’s tied to a strong enough why and add plenty of life to those years you’re vying for.</p> <p>Today we have an absolutely phenomenal teacher, healer, and guide to help you live a longer, more fruitful life. Christiane Northrup, M.D., is a true pioneer and leading authority in the field of health and wellness. She’s here to share some powerful insights that will last you a lifetime (and a much longer, healthier lifetime at that!).
