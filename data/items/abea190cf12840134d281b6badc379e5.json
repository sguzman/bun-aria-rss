  "description": "<p>Today, Darkness Radio is Encountering Anton LaVey and The Church of Satan with Carl Abrahamsson!</p>\n\n<p>Carl Abrahamsson was a young man in Sweden who quickly became fascinated by the magic act of Anton LaVey and his appearances in different occult magazines in his native land.  He went from creating a fanzine and band, to making a song dedicated to LaVey to soon interacting with him and getting contributions of articles from LaVey to Carl's Newsletter.</p>\n\n<p>Carl then struck up a friendship with LaVey towards the end of his life that gave him a unique retrospective of the man behind the Church of Satan.  Carl Abrahamsson joins us today to talk about that relationship, the legacy he has left behind, and what made LaVey the cult of personality that he was.</p>\n\n<p>Get the book, \"Anton LaVey and The Church of Satan: Infernal Wisdom from the Devil's Den\" here:  <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Dx4S8b\">https://bit.ly/3Dx4S8b</a></p>\n\n<p>To find out more about Carl Abrahamsson, check out these links: <a href=\"https://www.carlabrahamsson.com/\">https://www.carlabrahamsson.com/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/intothedevilsden\">https://vimeo.com/ondemand/intothedevilsden</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/vanessa23carl\">https://www.patreon.com/vanessa23carl</a></p>\n\n<p>Darkness Radio is partnering up with the UFO Disclosure Symposium!  To get more information and to get your tickets, click on this link: <a href=\"https://ufodisclosuresymposium.com/?ref=tim%40darknessradio.com\">https://ufodisclosuresymposium.com/?ref=tim%40darknessradio.com</a></p>\n",
