  "description": "In today's podcast we follow the story of Meltdown and Spectre, which pose kernel-level security issues: speed was inadvertently purchased at the price of insecurity. Spectre affects most chips, not just those from Intel. Mitigations are on the way. Bogus security apps booted from Google Play. Be on the lookout for phony Android Uber apps. Iran's Internet crackdown continues. Michael Daly from Raytheon and David DuFour from Webroot share their views on Meltdown and Spectre. And former NSA contractor Hal Martin may plea to taking one classified document home with him.",
