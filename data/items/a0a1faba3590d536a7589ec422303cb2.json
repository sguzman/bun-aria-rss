  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the flourishing of the idea of Purgatory from C12th, when it was imagined as a place alongside Hell and Heaven in which the souls of sinners would be purged of those sins by fire. In the West, there were new systems put in place to pray for the souls of the dead, on a greater scale, with opportunities to buy pardons to shorten time in Purgatory. The idea was enriched with visions, some religious and some literary; Dante imagined Purgatory as a mountain in the southern hemisphere, others such as Marie de France told of The Legend of the Purgatory of Saint Patrick, in which the entrance was on Station Island in County Donegal. This idea of purification by fire had appalled the Eastern Orthodox Church and was one of the factors in the split from Rome in 1054, but flourished in the West up to the reformations of C16th when it was again particularly divisive.\n\nWith\n\nLaura Ashe\nAssociate Professor of English and fellow of Worcester College at the University of Oxford\n\nMatthew Treherne\nProfessor of Italian Literature at the University of Leeds\n\nand\n\nHelen Foxhall Forbes\nAssociate Professor of Early Medieval History at Durham University\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
