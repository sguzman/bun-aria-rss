  "description": "<p>Meet two chefs putting their own spin on fine dining. Chef Lana Lagomarsini and Chef Nana Wilmot recently collaborated on a dinner with Resident, the roving luxury pop-up series that wove together the history of Black food, their personal stories, and their fine dining backgrounds, one course at a time. The two were working up the ladder in the restaurant world, at places like Le Coucou and Daniel, before the pandemic struck, changing their career trajectories. They each took matters into their own hands and began working as private chefs and exploring a more personal approach to their food. Lana and Nana join host Kerry Diamond to share the inspiration behind their dinner and give their take on the current and future state of fine dining. </p><p>Thank you to our sponsors: <a href=\"https://www.lenox.com/\">Lenox</a> has a new wine glass collab with sommelier Victoria James.
