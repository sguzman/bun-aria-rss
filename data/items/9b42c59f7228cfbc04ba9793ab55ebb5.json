  "description": "<p>The best chess and Go players in the world aren’t human beings any more; they’re artificially-intelligent computer programs. But the best poker players are still humans. Poker is a laboratory for understanding how rationality works in real-world situations: it features stochastic events, incomplete information, Bayesian updating, game theory, reading other people, a battle between emotions and reason, and real-world stakes. Maria Konnikova started in psychology, turned to writing, and then took up professional-level poker, and has learned a lot along the way about the challenges of being rational. We talk about what games like poker can teach us about thinking and human psychology.</p><p><em>Support Mindscape on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/seanmcarroll\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Patreon</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Maria Konnikova received her Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia University.
