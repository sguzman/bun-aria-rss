  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the media is thoroughly and grotesquely racist, antisemitic, and Marxist. Darryl Edward Brooks Jr has been charged with the slaughter of 5 and the injuries of 40 children and adults he allegedly ran over at a Christmas parade. Brooks is a career criminal with a listing on Arizona's sex offender registry and his motivation remains to be seen. Then, these problems are perpetuated by the rejection of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King's idea of a color-blind society from the Marxists that promote critical race theory and MSNBC hosts smear and trash White people and this country's founding. Later, the Civil War was fought to end slavery in the United States and what the media is pushing is antithetical to that history. Afterward, law professor and author Randy Barnett joins the show to discuss his new book \"The Original Meaning of the 14th Amendment.\" Barnett explains that many cases of abuse ensued as a result of poorly interpreting the Constitution, particularly the 14th Amendment.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
