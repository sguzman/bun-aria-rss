  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, in less than 24 hours many in the media, conservative and otherwise, were duped by the testimony of one aide who was not a senior staffer to the President and had not been an eyewitness to anything. The uncorroborated testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson, without any cross-examination, was almost immediately challenged as false by the United States Secret Service. The agents in question are willing to testify to correct her false testimony. Then, the J6 committee doesn't want truth and the media doesn't want it either. The Committee has now subpoenaed former white House Lawyer Pat Cipollone knowing full well that he can't waive attorney-client privilege. They do this so that they can then say he refused to cooperate and continue their obstruction narrative. They could have subpoenaed him a long time ago but wanted until now. Irrespective of Cassidy's previous four testimonies, Cippalone was always the White House Lawyer. Afterward, crimes are being concocted, criminal laws are being stretched, and the law is being used to break the law just to go after citizens that disagree about politics. The arrogance of the left is such that they would stretch the limits of federal statutes to try and indict a former president in order to determine the outcome of the next presidential election. This also chills free speech and scares people into submission; if they can arrest a former president just imagine what they will do to you. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
