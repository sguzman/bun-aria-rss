So we do see them correlate - it's hard to tease them out.” [15:45]<br /><br />“I can't stress this enough: Alzheimer's disease, autism, diabetes - a lot of these diseases that we see in society have been tied to mitochondrial damage from reactive oxygen species. It's really important.” [20:50]<br /><br />“We have technology today, that allows us to eat 24 hours a day. We have technology today that we can turn night into day if we want, we can work 24/7. There's gamers that do that, they go straight for 48 hours and they die. And so what we're finding out is that technology, even though it allows us to do certain things, they may not be optimal.” [37:43]<br /><br /><br />Follow Dr. Roger Seheult and MedCram:<br />Website: <a href=\"https://www.medcram.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.medcram.com/</a> <br />Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/medcramvideos\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/medcramvideos</a> <br />Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/medcram/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/medcram/</a> <br />LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Dl291B\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3Dl291B</a> <br />YouTube: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3JJGX7M\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3JJGX7M</a>",
