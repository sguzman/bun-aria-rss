  "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Do you need permission to ask for exactly what you want? When nonbinary queer switch and writer Leland Carina interviews Sarge and the GangBang Girls for an article in Leatherati.com, she is so impressed with what they do. As Leland marvels at 1) The 100% Consent-based Fantasy Fulfillment 2) The Negotiation that goes into each Scene 3) The Menu of Gang Bang styles that they offer, Leland realize that this is more than a mere writing assignment. This is a way to introduce someone they love to some next level pleasure (with their consent, of course) - and a chance to experience it, too! #Safe #Celebratory #Cathartic #Surprise #Public #Private #MilitaryTakedown</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>Song: ‘Religion’ (Zand)</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>About the Storyteller:</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p4\"><strong>Leland Carina is a Bay Area artist, writer, performer, and teacher. She first came into leather over a decade ago in San Francisco. She has authored an extensive number of articles that have been published by Leatherati.com, PQ Monthly, SALACIOUS magazine, Kink.com, and more. Her photography has been shown at the Mark I Chester gallery, in SF Weekly, and in countless sexy PR campaigns. She has modeled for Folsom Street Fair, the Portland Dykes on Bikes, graced the cover of the SF Bay Guardian, and has been a bondage and fetish model for many photographers. She was named Leather Marshal of the SF Pride Parade in 2012 and Ms Oregon State Leather in 2018.</strong></p> <p class=\"p4\"><strong>Leland identifies as a non-binary queer switch and She/her or they/them pronouns work. She’s a Femme Daddy and a power bottom who deeply enjoys D/s dynamics and hard play. In her spare time, she enjoys designing and creating her own latex outfits, beekeeping, and indulging her fetish for collecting plants.</strong></p> <p class=\"p5\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Episode links:</strong></span></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Uberlube:</strong></span> <strong>Uberlube is a luxurious, high-grade silicone lubricant made from clean, body-friendly ingredients; it’s just silicone with a little Vitamin E.
