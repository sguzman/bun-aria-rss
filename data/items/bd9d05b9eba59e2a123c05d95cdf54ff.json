The guys also hand out their stooges and sellaht's of the week, investigate a new dating app that encourages men with small penises to join, and gear up for another round of Digs Debates which include arguments about who is better, Chuck Norris or Jackie Chan, or would you rather be stranded in the ocean or space with 10 days of supplies and rations. Today was a fun one. Enjoy.</p>\n",
