  "title": "84 - The Demonic Possession of Anneliese Michel 2 of 2",
  "description": "<p>In 1973, 21 year old German college student Anneliese Michel began to descend into an existence of pure and utter madness. She had begun to see the faces of demons appear around her with increasing frequency. She awoke more and more often in the middle of the night, unable to move, unable to scream out, feeling an evil presence overtake her body. Her life had become a never ending parade of visits to doctors and prayer. And neither priest nor neurosurgeon seemed able to help her. And for the last ten months of her life, one exorcism after another would be performed on the deteriorating mind and body of this fragile, frightened, and tormented young woman. And today, we dig into those final years of her life and leave you to decide if her death was in fact the result of demonic possession, today, on Timesuck! </p>\n<p>Wanna check out Theo Von's This Past Weekend podcast? <a href=\"http://theovon.com/\">CLICK HERE! </a></p>\n<p>Check out the My West Coast Buds podcast!</p>\n<p>Timesuck is also brought to you today by by the socially conscious on-line fantastic mattress store LEESA!
