  "description": "Liz Cheney has been ousted from the Republican Party...for speaking the truth about election results. Anyone Republican who opposed Trump is also on thin ice, and effectively must worry about being ousted for their views. And when it comes to passing good policy, Democrats don't have all the answers (or the majorities needed to pass legislation) either. Political scientist Rob Saldin makes the case that American democracy requires two healthy parties and lays out a roadmap that would enable both parties to function better and make space for all voters. He and Geoffrey Kabaservice discuss: \n\n- Why moderate factions within each party are better and more realistic than hoping for a third party.\n- What caused the Republican Party to seemingly lose all interest in governing.\n- How nationalization of news and issues has impacted party agendas, to the detriment of every day Americans. \n- Why Democrats should care about winning in rural areas, and how they can do so without compromising their national party platforms.
