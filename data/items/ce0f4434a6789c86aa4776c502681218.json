  "description": "\n<img src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.png?id=27151193&width=980\"/><br/><br/><p>As the automotive industry navigates a new era of self-driving cars, every second matters. The information obtained from sensors and electronics must be given to the main CPU as precisely and quickly as possible. To ensure optimal safety and performance, it’s imperative that no data is lost in transmission. To achieve this, we’re increasingly relying on receiver testing for validation. <br/></p><p>Learn more today by <a href=\"https://connectlp.keysight.com/LP=38320?elqCampaignId=22877&cmpid=ASC-2106526&utm_source=ADSC&utm_medium=ASC&utm_campaign=302\" target=\"_blank\">downloading the whitepaper</a>, “Use Receiver Testing to Improve Automotive In-Vehicle Network Performance.”</p>",
