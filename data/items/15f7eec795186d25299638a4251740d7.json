His political research has investigated various topics, including economic inequality, racial prejudice, masculine overcompensation and Americans' views of climate change. Willer's writing has appeared in the New York Times and the Washington Post, including his op-eds \"The Secret to Political Persuasion\" and \"Is the Environment a Moral Cause?” Willer received a Ph.D from Cornell University and a BA from the University of Iowa.
