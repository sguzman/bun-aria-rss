  "description": "In April of 1995, wildlife biologists flew small airplanes over Yellowstone National Park, looking for two missing wolves. “They’re just gone. And that’s implausible because wolves don’t just disappear.”\nThe missing wolves were two of 14 that had been brought down from Canada in an attempt to reestablish the wolf population in Yellowstone. Not everyone supported the Yellowstone Wolf Project—including a man named Chad McKittrick.\nWe speak with Thomas McNamee and Joe Fontaine. McNamee’s book is The Killing of Wolf Number Ten.\nWe’re trying something new. Two stories about the same family of wolves in Yellowstone. One is a crime story, and one is a love story. For the love story, check out Episode 19 of This is Love. It’s called The Wolves: https://apple.co/2wSJs7B\nSay hello on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
