In a single, haunting image, a novel’s worth of narrative seems to play out just below the surface. If you’ve ever seen this art before, you’ve probably experienced this too — even if you didn’t know where it was from.\n\nTales from the Loop and its sequel Things from the flood are worldbuilding projects set in an alternate version of Sweden in the 80s and 90s, in which a gigantic particle accelerator buried beneath the fields and suburbs begins to alter reality in unpredictable ways. Yet the story is so much more than a summary can convey. So, for this entry into the archive, I want to dive deep into the hidden lore of Tales from the Loop — and investigate why this project has struck a chord with myself and so many others.\n\nNow, let’s enter the world of Simon Stålenhag, and discover the mysteries of Tales from the Loop.\n\n0:00 Tales from the Loop\n1:44 Cracks in Space and Time\n5:51 Of Dinosaurs and Androids\n9:46 Things from the Flood\n13:34 Horrors of Hubris\n16:42 End of an Era\n18:37 Understanding the Loop\n\nCopyright Disclaimer: Under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education, and research.
