  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Stalinist Democrats and the monolithic media are attacking Fox News. Despite the biased nature of CNN and MSNBC and their envoy of former political operatives at times posing as objective journalists, they continue the offensive on non-leftwing points of view. In much the same way, they attacked President Trump this weekend for his two-hour speech — in which he referred to this program multiple times — at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), comparing him to a despotic dictator for his \"America First\" agenda. Using that as a catalyst, Congressman Jerrold Nadler is now starting a new coup-attempt using tax-payer-funded Congressional staff and committees to investigate every aspect of the President's family, private life and businesses for their own political gain. All of Trump’s family should fight this all the way to the Supreme Court. This crooked and corrupt effort to push radical leftism and massive taxation will backfire and the fury of the American people will be evident at the ballot box. Congress needs a legislative purpose to subpoena people to testify in a committee hearing; they have no such reason to question the children of any politician as part of their oversight duties. The Democrats are using these document requests and sworn testimonies as a front to conduct opposition for the Democrat National Committee (DNC). Then, freshman Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib both are trashing Israel. After another public rebuke of Omar's anti-Israel comments the House should censure her and if it continues, they should expel her.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
