  "title": "Donald L. Carveth, \"Psychoanalytic Thinking: A Dialectical Critique of Contemporary Theory and Practice\" (Routledge, 2018)",
  "description": "Since the classical Freudian and ego psychology paradigms lost their position of dominance in the late 1950’s, psychoanalysis became a multi-paradigm science with those working in the different frameworks increasingly engaging only with those in the same or related intellectual “silos.” Beginning with Freud’s theory of human nature and civilization, Psychoanalytic Thinking: A Dialectical Critique of Contemporary Theory and Practice (Routledge, 2018) proceeds to review and critically evaluate a series of post-Freudian contributions to psychoanalytic thought.\nOut of dialogue and mutual critique, psychoanalysis can separate the wheat from the chaff, collect the wheat and approach an ever-evolving synthesis. This book will be of interest to psychoanalysts and psychoanalytic psychotherapists and, more broadly, to readers in philosophy, social science and critical social theory.\nDonald Carveth is an Emeritus Professor of Sociology and Social and Political Thought and a Senior Scholar at York University, Toronto, Canada and a Training and Supervising Analyst in the Canadian Institute of Psychoanalysis. He is past Director of the Toronto Institute of Psychoanalysis and a past Editor-in-Chief of the Canadian Journal of Psychoanalysis/Revue canadienne de psychanalyse.\nPhilip Lance, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist with a private practice in Los Angeles. He is candidate at The Psychoanalytic Center of California. He can be reached at PhilipJLance@gmail.com\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
