  "description": "<div>Nick Canon's third baby mama Abby De La Rosa says she is happy with Nick as her primary partner in their very open relationship. Do you believe her? Let's examine why or why not...\"Believe women\" is an American political slogan arising out of the #MeToo movement that refers to accepting women's allegations of sexual harassment or sexual assault at face value. BUT does it have limitations? Do we also believe women when they say that they're happy in romantic relationships...even if they're involved in dynamics that we don't think would work for us?<br>\n<br>\nAbby challenges us to see beyond our biases AND hold both of her contrasting truths about her love life. Also in this episode LMFT Mayana Geathers shares her professional opinion on believing women claiming to be happy in unbelievable arrangements.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Follow Shan: <br>\n</strong><a href=\"http://instagram.com/shanboody\">http://instagram.com/shanboody</a><br>\n<br>\nCall in to the show to leave a voice note<br>\n‪(323) 375-4797<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:loversfriendspodcast@gmail.com\">loversfriendspodcast@gmail.com</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Follow the guests on this episode: </strong><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Abby De La Rosa</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hiabbydelarosa\">https://www.instagram.com/hiabbydelarosa</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://onlyfans.com/hiabbydelarosa\">http://onlyfans.com/hiabbydelarosa</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Mayana Geathers</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mayanageathers/\">https://www.instagram.com/mayanageathers/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.mayanageathers.com/\">https://www.mayanageathers.com/</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Kenya Alexander</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kenyaonhair/?hl=en\">https://www.instagram.com/kenyaonhair/?hl=en</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.kenyaonhair.com/\">https://www.kenyaonhair.com/</a><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
