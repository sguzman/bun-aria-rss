  "title": "Sandra Fahy, \"Dying for Rights: Putting North Korea’s Human Rights Abuses on the Record\" (Columbia UP, 2019)",
  "description": "“The things that are happening to North Korea are happening to all of us…they are part of the human community. To say that this is just a problem for North Korea is to say that North Koreans are not part of the human community.” In her new book, Dying for Rights: Putting North Korea’s Human Rights Abuses on the Record (Columbia University Press, 2019), Sandra Fahy gives a thorough and compelling analysis of testimonies and reports on North Korea. Fahy explores the United Nation’s report as well as North Korea’s response to the report. The book also tackles issues of famine and hunger, information control, movement within the country and outside it, in addition to other pertinent issues. The book is full of detailed reporting on the issues but is still written in an accessible way in order to help readers understand more about North Korea and its people.\nSarah E. Patterson is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Michigan.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
