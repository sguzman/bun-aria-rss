  "description": "Episode 48 with Tess Begg is perhaps one of my favourite conversations to date. Tess is in her early 20's and isn't afraid to tell it how it is. Her life so far has been anything but rosy and I love the fact she owns these hardships and openly talks about how they led her to where she is now.
