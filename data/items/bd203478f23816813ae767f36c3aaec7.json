Many had lost their boots, \nBut limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; \nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots \nOf gas-shells dropping softly behind. \n\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling \nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time, \nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling \nAnd flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—\nDim through the misty panes and thick green light, \nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning. \n\nIn all my dreams before my helpless sight, \nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. \n\nIf in some smothering dreams, you too could pace \nBehind the wagon that we flung him in, \nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face, \nHis hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin; \nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood \nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, \nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud \nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,— \nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest \nTo children ardent for some desperate glory, \nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est \nPro patria mori.",
