  "title": "Here's Why You Need to Stop 'Manifesting' ANYTHING in Your Life | Sadie Robertson Huff & Chad Veach",
  "description": "Sadie welcomes author and pastor of Zoe Church Chad Veach to the podcast. Chad shares why worrying is never the answer and why you need to stop \"manifesting\" — instead of looking to \"the universe\" for answers, why not focus on the One who created the universe? Sadie and Chad outline practical steps for how to start praying if that's not part of your daily life and remind us that the point of prayer is to connect with God. Prayer is an invitation into intimacy, so we can talk to Him like a friend! Chad also walks us through what he's learned about the physical ways your brain is transformed when you regularly pray. Prayer helps us get a new perspective. And remember: God doesn't want anything from you, He wants YOU. Your relationship with God is exactly that — a relationship!\n\nhttps://athleticgreens.com/whoa — Get a FREE 1-year supply of Vitamin D & 5 FREE travel packs with your first purchase!\n\nhttps://www.audible.com/SADIE — Visit the link OR text SADIE to 500-500.
