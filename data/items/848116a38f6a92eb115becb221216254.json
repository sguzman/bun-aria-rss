An estimated 92% of people are disengaged from the topic and feel they don’t know what to do. But today, I want to share some good news with you that will leave you feeling hopeful instead of hopeless in terms of saving our planet. Just like we use Functional Medicine to get to the root cause of disease in our bodies, we can come up with an actionable, results-oriented plan when we look at the root cause of our climate crisis. On this episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, I was thrilled to sit down with Paul Hawken to talk about his framework for healing the planet in a way that dramatically changes the outlook of our world for future generations.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Paul Hawken starts ecological businesses, writes about nature and commerce, and consults with heads of state and CEOs on climatic, economic, and ecological regeneration. He has appeared on numerous media including the <em>Today Show</em>, <em>Talk of the Nation, Bill Maher</em>, <em>CBS This Morning</em>, <em>Charlie Rose</em>, and others, and his work has been profiled or featured in hundreds of articles including the <em>Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Newsweek, Washington Post, Forbes,</em> and<em> Business Week</em>. He has written eight books, including five national and <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers: <em>Growing a Business, The Next Economy, The Ecology of Commerce, Blessed Unrest, </em>and<em> Drawdown</em>, <em>The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming</em>.&nbsp;</p><br><p>He is the founder of Project Drawdown, which worked with over two hundred scholars, students, scientists, researchers, and activists to map, measure, and model the one hundred most substantive solutions that can cumulatively reverse global warming. He is the founder of Regeneration.org, and his latest work, <em>Regeneration, Ending the Climate Crisis in One Generation,</em> was just released.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This episode is brought to you by ButcherBox, BiOptimizers, and Paleovalley.</p><br><p>For a limited time, new subscribers to ButcherBox will receive ground beef for life.
