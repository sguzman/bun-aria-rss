  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat welcomes one of his white whales. Former Head Coach of the Indianapolis Colts and current Defensive Coordinator of the Chicago Bears, Chuck Pagano, finally joins the show. He and Pat chat about the adjustments he had to make during his time away from football, the season he was diagnosed with cancer and he dives deep into his process to recovery. They also reminisce on a couple of their seasons together, and Chuck looks ahead to all the weapons he’ll have on the Bears defense (2:52-35:37). Later, Pat and the guys discuss plans for what to expect once they get to Atlanta, and Pat teases some guests that may be stopping by. Pat also recaps his weekend in Phoenix for the WWE NXT Takeover preshow, playing golf with AQ Shipley and Foxy, and how he had perhaps the best steak on the west coast. The guys also recap the Pro Bowl and offer a few enhancements, discuss the final few moments left in the weight loss competition, and Pat details his near death experience driving to work. Today's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
