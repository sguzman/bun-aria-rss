  "description": "<p><strong>Finding a private money lender is far less complicated than people think</strong>. Striking up a ten-minute conversation could be enough to find your next round of private money. At least that’s how it worked out for <strong>Josiah</strong>. Josiah is a <a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/stages-scale-small-business\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">small business owner</a>, running a <strong>pool cleaning business</strong> while building up a <strong>small portfolio of rental properties</strong>. He sees dozens of new faces every day, and those new faces directly translate into new opportunities.</p><p>After hearing our past episodes with <a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/real-estate-636\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Amy Mahjoory</strong></a>, Josiah took some of her tips and began <strong>pitching his deals to everyone he encountered</strong>.
