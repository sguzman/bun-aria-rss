  "description": "<p>I thought that it was too late for me. I thought that too much time had passed…</p> <p>For two and a half years I was in pain as my spine was essentially falling apart. Two herniated discs, advanced degeneration, and a disease prognosis that gave me no hope of recovery.</p> <p>Leading up to the day that I finally decided to make some changes and do something about it, this profound sense of hopelessness came over me. I thought to myself, “Too much time has passed. If my body was going to get any better it would’ve happened by now.” I was giving myself an out before I even started. But, fortunately I woke up and gave my body a chance.</p> <p>The funny thing was actually witnessing how quickly my body turned things around. My body was wanting all along to restore vibrant health, but I was fighting against it. All I needed to do was give my body the right conditions to do what it already knows how to do. Our bodies are designed to heal. Our bodies are designed to thrive.</p> <p>But what about the case of an autoimmune disease? Isn’t your body fighting against you this time? Well, not exactly. In the case of many autoimmune diseases, your body thinks that it’s actually helping you by attacking your tissues. It’s friendly fire. But, why in the world would it do that?</p> <p>That’s what Dr. Terry Wahls was struggling to understand when multiple sclerosis left her wheelchair-bound and slowly watching her life slip away. Years went by for her as well. But, fortunately, she didn’t give up. And her story, which you’re going to hear today, is absolutely incredible!</p> <p>Dr. Wahls' protocol has enabled tens of thousands of people all over the world to put their MS or autoimmune diseases into remission. The principles in how she was able to make this happen are bundled up for you right here, and I’m beyond grateful to be able to share it with you.</p> <p>As you may know from my story, I had a complete reversal of the spinal and bone disease, and better health than I could’ve ever imagined. But there are countless stories of transformations like this, and Dr. Wahls' is one of them. I want you to know that no matter how long you’ve been struggling in your health, there is always an opportunity for you to turn things around. Hopefully Dr. Wahls' protocol will provide you with some tools and inspiration to help make it happen.
