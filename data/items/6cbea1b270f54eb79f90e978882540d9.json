  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the kerfuffle surrounding golfer Matt Kuchar's tip to a local caddie he used while winning a tournament in Mexico. In short, Kuchar's usual caddie couldn't make the trip, so he used a caddie from the course where the tournament was played. Kuchar took home about $1.2 million as the winner, and gave the caddie $5,000. His usual caddie would've been paid $126,000. Also discussed is the Premier Lacrosse League's latest investor, Alibaba billionaire Joe Tsai. The league begins play in June. Also talked about is the decision by the Cleveland Browns to sign running back Kareem Hunt, who faces a National Football  League suspension for domestic abuse, and the Chicago Cubs starting a regional sports network with Sinclair. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-WilliamsProducer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
