The point is that we got to see two highly anticipated things: the unveiling of Chateau Sheree and the return of Kim Biermann. Naturally, fighting ensued.</p>\n<p>Later, on \"Real Housewives of Potomac,\" a high tea aims to patch things up between Gizelle and Charisse, but instead it just puts Robin on the hot seat.  Also, we get a new cast member and the return of Katie!
