  "description": "The entire show is sick. Bubba is out. Greg is out. Rick, Speedy, Helmsey, and Adler are limping along the best that they can. Which brings us to today's main point: Doctors don't know what they are talking about. One year ago, the director of the CDC, Rochelle Walensky, who has received five COVID jabs, told us vaccinated people can't get or transmit COVID. Today, she tests positive for COVID-19. In politics, Joe Biden sits down with MSNBC and struggles to stay awake and form coherent sentences. Biden also clarifies that he supports gender-affirming surgery for minors. And, Rick has a big win over the weekend when he successfully jumps off his wife's car with barely any help.\nSponsor: Allegiance Gold - We recommend you diversify with Gold & Silver. Allegiance Gold can help you protect your IRA or 401K with physical gold and silver, or, if you prefer, have it delivered securely, right to your front door. Their approach is different; they focus on educating and developing a long-term strategy that's right for YOU.
