  "description": "<p>In this 71st in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. In this episode, we talk about trees and mental health and lockdowns and polar bears. Among other things. Does having trees outside your window help mitigate depression? If so, how close do they need to be? Does it matter what species they are? What’s so great about trees anyway? What about rivers or birds or volcanoes? Also: how do extended lockdowns affect teenagers in particular? What do we lose when we close schools, shut down organized sports, keep people from socializing? And: what do polar bears eat when melting sea ice keeps the seals out of reach? Duck eggs of course! <br/><br/>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is now available for pre-sale at amazon.
