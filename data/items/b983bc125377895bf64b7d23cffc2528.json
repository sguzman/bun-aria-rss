  "description": "<p>Today’s guest,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://elenabrower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Elena Brower</a>, dedicated her life to the practice and teaching of yoga nearly 20 years ago. She rose to acclaim, becoming known first as a wonderful teacher on the New York yoga scene, and then a teacher of teachers on a larger stage.</p><p>But she also had a secret. Actually, not so much a secret as an addiction. And there came a time where she felt she not only had to get sober, but also share the journey in a very public way. With her students, her community of teachers, and her son.</p><p>It became one of the most empowering journeys of her life. This is just one of the many paths our conversation takes in today's episode.</p><p>We explore Elena's early years, her career in textile design and what led her to leave it behind and make yoga her \"thing.\" We talk about the path to becoming a teacher, then eventually developing an authentic voice, a treasured lens and emerging as a teacher of teachers. We explore the power of awareness and mindful attention.</p><p>We also dive into what it's like to run your own studio, to travel the world, speaking and teaching. And, we talk about how becoming a mom has changed her and her world in a profound way.</p><p>The emergence of digital practice and online yoga classes and education, something Elena has embraced, finds it way into the conversation as well. And we explore Elena’s latest ventures, <a href=\"http://teach.yoga/\" target=\"_blank\">Teach.Yoga</a>, a global hub of content and&nbsp;inspiration created by yoga teachers, for yoga teachers and her beautiful self-practice guide,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.artofattention.com/book/\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Attention</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
