  "description": "It's the conclusion of the Lancelot story, and we'll immediately pick up after last week's fairly cheap cliffhanger ending. He'll finally see the end of his quest... Either by plummeting to the choppy waters below...or by the lions on the other side of the sword...or the castle full of people who want to kill him on the other side of the lions. The creature is the Tannarak, who just wants to date you or steal your child. It really does not care, which is fairly problematic.
