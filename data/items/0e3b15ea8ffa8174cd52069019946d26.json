  "description": "<p>Troll of the Year. On part 2 of My 2020 Year in Review podcast I talk about how I brought a city to its knees. With a few expertly timed and crafted words I made Los Angeles crumble. It was hilarious. Even the comedy world wasn’t immune from my power. While most standups laughed and were tremendously supportive, a few comedians fell to my power. Some who had previously held that jokes were always just jokes, for the first time in their lives took the side of the censors. They had never been so expertly triggered before and they lost their minds. And we all laughed at them. It was one my greatest trolls, if not my greatest. It made hypocrites out of the mighty and showed the world how much they overvalued the lives of celebrities. Their anger was my applause. Their threats of violence were my standing ovation. I am God.</p> <p><strong><em>The Music</em></strong></p> <p>Distillers - City of Angels</p> <p> </p> <p>Please subscribe to my <a href= \"patreon.com/arishaffir\">Patreon.com/AriShaffir</a> so that I can keep making jokes I find funny without having to worry too much about the massive amounts of money that it keeps costing me.
