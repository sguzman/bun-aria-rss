  "description": "<p>Shane Sprenger disappeared from Vida, Oregon, on November 2, 2021. Shane was a contractor, and on that day, he was working at a job site near&nbsp;McKenzie Bridge, Oregon. Around 9:30 am, Shane left the job and returned to his home in Vida. No one ever saw Shane again. In the days following his disappearance, Shane's truck was found abandoned on a logging road near the Blue River Reservoir, about 16 miles away from his home. The area where they found the vehicle was one of Shane's favorite mushroom picking spots. It was suggested by some people close to Shane that maybe he had gone mushroom picking and got lost. However, it was later discovered that Shane planned to return to the job site to meet with a subcontractor. It did not make sense that Shane would have stopped to pick mushrooms because all clues indicated that he was planning to return to work after a quick break. Shane's family in Minnesota had no idea that anything was wrong until they got a phone several days after Shane vanished. They made the trip to Oregon to search for him. They began to hear strange stories about the day Shane disappeared, tales that simply weren't adding up.</p><p>If you have any information about Shane Sprenger's disappearance, please contact the Lane County Sheriff's Office at 541-682-4150. </p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://prose.com/thevanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prose</a>- Take your free in-depth consultation and get 15% off your first order today at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://prose.com/thevanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prose.com/thevanished</a>.</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our case submission form:<a href=\"http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
