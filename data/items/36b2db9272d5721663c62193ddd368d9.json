  "description": "In this episode we examine what it means to forgive.  We feel we cannot fully appreciate the weight or forgiveness from God, but for those of you intend to follow Jesus, it should look a lot like him.  There is much that forgiveness is not and furthermore to completely forget the injustices against us isn't quite the picture Jesus had in mind.  Looking forward to you thoughts!\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nLike Mike on Facebook www.facebook.com/officialmikeerre\n\nMike Erre participates as VOX Team Leader at VOX Community, a church expression of the VOX Podcast.
