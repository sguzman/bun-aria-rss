  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Because life is full of ups and downs, from time to time we all need a change of perspective, inspiration, and a reminder of how powerful we are to affect change.

Dr. Beckwith is one of the most sought-after meditation teachers, speakers, and thought leaders.</p> <p class=\"p1\">On this special compilation episode, I’m bringing you two of my favorite interviews with Dr. Michael Beckwith.
