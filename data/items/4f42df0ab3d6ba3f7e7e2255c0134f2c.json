We’re here to remind you of the many benefits of having a budget- it’s not only about saving more money (but really, who needs more of a reason than that?!). We’ll share some universal tips that will help you get started as well as show how budgeting can look different based on your personality type.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Bourbon County Wheatwine Ale by Goose Island - a big thanks to Alex for donating the beers to the show this week!
