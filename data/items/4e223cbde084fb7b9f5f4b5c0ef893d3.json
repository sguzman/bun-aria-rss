  "title": "How to Talk About Your Art [155]",
  "description": "<p>Talking about our work can be challenging. You might not know what to say - how to find the words to describe the feelings - or you might feel self-conscious, thinking others don't want to hear or that they may judge you. But, learning to talk about your art can open so many doors - doors to conversations, doors to sales, and doors to new realisations for yourself. Once you can tell the story of your art, others can connect with it in new ways. In this episode, we share our own experiences and offer tips and strategies to help you find the words. So whether you are sharing with friends, exhibiting in a gallery, attending an art fair, or even just writing a social media post, we hope this episode will get you started.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Words & Pictures: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkHrVw-cDmU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkHrVw-cDmU</a></p>\n<p>Beatles Abbey Road: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiRfv6LFXYE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiRfv6LFXYE</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
