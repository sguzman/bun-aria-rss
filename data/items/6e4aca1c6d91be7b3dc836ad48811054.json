  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, a Senate ethics complaint has been filed against Sen. Chuck Schumer by Landmark Legal Foundation for his threats against 2 Supreme Court justices. Schumer has said that he couldn't have carried out any physical threat, but the U.S Code is clear that even threatening political retribution is a crime. Schumer's apology isn't good enough. Saying that he didn't mean it the way he said it isn't good enough; his words were clear, very clear. Then, the media covers for Schumer by conflating and distorting the facts. Not once do they even ask why the left has such an obsession with aborting human babies — we don't even treat animals this way. This is a serious moral issue and this is why the rhetoric from Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer, and the left is so dangerous. Chief Justice Roberts took extraordinary action in face of extraordinary threats made by Schumer. Also, federal taxes have remained high for decades in spite of the claims of Sanders and the phony Republican populists. Later, Elizabeth Warren drops out of the race and blames it on sexism. Could it be that voters didn’t vote for her because she’s a kook, a liar and nobody believe in what she was pushing?  Finally, KT McFarland calls in to discuss her new book, Revolution: Trump, Washington and \"We the People\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
