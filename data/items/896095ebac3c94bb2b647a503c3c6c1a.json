Also Five Headlines including an unlicensed security guard apparently hired by an NBC affiliate shot and killed a Trump supporter. And Tucker Carlson talks about UFOs, and brings up a number of important questions. And in our Daily Cancellation, as is my custom on Columbus Day, I will cancel those who have been trying to posthumously cancel the great explorer.\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
