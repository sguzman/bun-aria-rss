  "description": "<p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 1:</p><p>Jason Whitlock: Election was love vs. hate. Networks wait for Fox to call the race. This should not be happening in the most developed democracy in the world. Republicans won down ballot, House could end up 50-50 and Trump is losing? Rush makes clear he's not conceding anything. It's Biden operatives under cover of night who are closing the gap for Biden with chicanery. Biden underperformed Hillary in just four urban areas, Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia and Atlanta. All the key swing states. Trump team must get out front with all of the ample evidence of fraud, make the case. Ballot harvesting has become a staple of Democrat politics. Rush's prediction that Democrats want to eliminate elections has come true. They're rendering the will of the people irrelevant. They want us to believe that the country voted overwhelmingly for Republicans, but against Trump? It makes no sense.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>Rush runs through all the anomalies in the election. Biden over-performs only in the four swing state cities. McConnell, Trump Jr. tweets on count. Mail-in ballots is where all the fraud will be found. Trump team is now collecting all of the evidence to present in courts. Huge overnight vote dumps for Biden are not legitimate. Dems claim \"the John Lewis district\" beat Trump in Georgia. Rush is just as mad about this as the Russian collusion hoax. Jason Whitlock thinks hate beat love. North Carolina voter says her husband waited in line to vote only to be told somebody voted for him.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p>It's not time to panic. It's never going to be time to panic. Rush will never give up, will never walk away from the United States of America. GOP Establishment is trying to hold on to you, while getting rid of Trump. The left wants Fox News to call the election. Establishment GOP thinks you will go for Rubio or Haley in 2024. If Trump loses and he wants it again, he'll win in 2024. Washington GOP would be happy to get rid of Trump and have senile Biden in White House. Hillary told Biden not to concede because she thinks she shouldn't have conceded. If Trump loses, the young people he brought into the movement will continue to fight for America.
