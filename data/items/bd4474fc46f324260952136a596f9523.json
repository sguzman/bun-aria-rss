  "description": "<p></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dariopes/\">Dario</a> is a science journalist based in Madrid who was instrumental in getting <em>Sex at Dawn</em> published in Spain (<em>En el Principio era el Sexo</em>). We’ve been friends since around 2011, when he interviewed me about that book. In this conversation, we talk about Spanish culture and history, the challenges of writing about science for Spanish publications, and some of the personal challenges Dario has worked his way through over the past few years and the loving friends who stood by him (but not too close by!). Dario’s intelligence, courage, and kindness are on full display in this chat. I hope you enjoy it.</p><p>Intro music “Brightside of the Sun,” by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\">Basin and Range</a>. “Mulata,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/5jRt7DUQuMW6zZ2tLXFz6c\">Raul Paz</a>; Outro: “Smoke Alarm,” by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.carsieblanton.com/\">Carsie Blanton</a>.</p><p><p>Tangentially Speaking with Chris Ryan is a reader-supported publication.
