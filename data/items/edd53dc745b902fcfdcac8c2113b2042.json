  "description": "<p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred joins the podcast from London to talk about the league's first-ever games in Europe. The Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees played twice in London last weekend, drawing two sold-out crowds and combining for 50 runs. MLB essentially built a make-shift baseball stadium inside London's Olympic Stadium, complete with imported locker rooms and dirt imported from Pennsylvania. Manfred discusses baseball's goals in hosting games in London, plus the economics of the games, which cost tens of millions to put on. He also discusses the payments MLB paid to the Red Sox to compensate them for losing two home games, and the possibility of placing a franchise in Europe in the future. </p><p>Hosts: Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams</p><p>Producer: Colin Tipton</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
