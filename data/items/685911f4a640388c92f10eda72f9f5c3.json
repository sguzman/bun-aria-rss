  "description": "<p>Yale's woke maniacs foreshadow a corrupted legal system. Buck and lawyer Clay remind us that these elite woke law students don't just change once they start working; they are still \"woke maniacs\" in positions of influence. The game is all about signaling one's virtue. Kamala Harris is very concerned about: the significance of the passage of time. Just another of her vapid statements, and, C&B ask, where did she go to law school? Failure after failure won't stop tired old man Biden from leading a New World Order. Buck sums it up: \"It feels like a Biden-led New World Order is one where Putin, Xi, and others are getting a bigger piece of the pie.\" Twitter banning the Babylon Bee shows free speech is not so free these days. Overall, it's Clay's feeling that, \"Arguably, we are becoming less free in the Internet age than we ever were before.\" </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
