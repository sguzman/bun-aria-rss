    "media:description": "The integration of Mizrahi Jews into Israel was not an easy one. Jews from countries like Yemen, Morocco, Iraq, Egypt, and Syria had lived there for generations and after much oppression found themselves running for their lives to Israel. \n\nEnraged by the inequality they faced in their new home, a group of Mizrahi Jews took inspiration from the Black Panthers movement in the United States. \n\nThe Israeli Black Panthers, HaPanterim HaShchorim, who emerged from this painful time period fought for systematic change and their impact is still felt in Israeli society today. \n\nSubscribe and turn on your notifications so you don’t miss future uploads!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/UNPACKED?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nRecommended video— Who Are The Mizrahi Jews?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4NjZBD9fW4&list=PL-DNOnmKkUaa6YEEEhDmTnLlWKc5a3TYH&index=12\n\nWe have merch! – http://shop.jewishunpacked.com/?utm_medium=youtube&utm_source=video-description&utm_campaign=merch\n\nLet’s connect:\nWebsite — https://www.jewishunpacked.com\nInstagram — https://www.instagram.com/jewishunpacked\nTwitter — https://twitter.com/jewishunpacked\nTikTok — https://www.tiktok.com/@jewishunpacked\nFacebook — https://www.facebook.com/jewishunpacked\n\n-----------\nExecutive Producers:\n— Debra Klein\n— Avi Naider\n— Jerry Ostrov\n— Barry Skolnick\n\nGold Level:\n— Blavatnik Family Foundation\n— The Associated’s Insight Israel Forum\n— The Crane Foundation\n— Aimee & Jerry Ostrov\n— Skolnick Family Charitable Trust\n\nSilver Level:\n— Sig and Miriam Feiger Family Foundation\n— The Messinger Family Charitable Fund\n— Rachie and Jon Teller\n\nBronze Level:\n— The Bernstein Family Foundation\n— Jewish Federation of Broward County\n— Betsy and Philip Darivoff\n— Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit\n— JCRC of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia\n— Marilyn and Neville Isaacson\n— Corie and Michael Koss\n— Steve Miller\n— Pamela Rose\n— Kim and Perry Shwachman\n— Marci and Andrew Spitzer\n\n-----------\nImage and footage credits:\n\nAssociated Press\nTom Avni\nA-WA\nZehava Ben\nBritish Pathé\nCarmel Newsreel\nCarmel Herzilya Newsreel\nCentral Zionist Archives Collection.
