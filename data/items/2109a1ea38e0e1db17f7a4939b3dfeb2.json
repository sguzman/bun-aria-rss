  "description": "<p>From face recognition in smartphones to automatic routing on self-driving\ncars, machine vision algorithms lie in the core of these features. These\nsystems solve image based tasks by identifying and understanding objects,\nsubsequently making decisions from these information. However, errors in\ndatasets are usually induced or even magnified in algorithms, at times\nresulting in issues such as recognising black people as gorillas and\nmisrepresenting ethnicities in search results. This paper tracks the errors in\ndatasets and their impacts, revealing that a flawed dataset could be a result\nof limited categories, incomprehensive sourcing and poor classification.\n</p>",
