  "description": "Happy belated Halloween!  Today’s show starts with a rant about how times have changed since I was a kid… why I’m worried kids can’t have fun anymore. Turning to the markets… I break down what to expect from tomorrow's Fed meeting… and why the latest jobs data should kill any optimism about the Fed turning dovish. I also dig into some stats on the booming market for HELOC loans… and what it means for the economy. We’re still in a bear market, but that doesn’t mean you should be selling everything. I break down exactly which sectors investors should be buying right now… which ones to avoid… and the best strategy to profit from the ongoing volatility in stocks. In this episode   Happy Halloween! [0:30] What killed this morning’s rally [5:10] Inflation has NOT peaked [10:05] Why strong demand for HELOCs is a bad sign for the economy [18:40] Which sectors to buy and avoid now [23:35] How to make a fortune in this volatile market [31:19]  Enjoyed this episode?
