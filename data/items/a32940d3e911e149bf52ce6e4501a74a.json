  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, a Capitol police officer was murdered in an attack outside the Capitol, strangely there was no mention of the attacker who drove his car into a barricade before attacking others with a long knife. The killer identified as Noah Green a follower of Minister Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam. In the recent Atlanta shooting it was immediately repeated by the media that the shooter was a white male, including in remarks from a visit from President Biden and Vice President Harris. This begs the question: what are the politicians doing to this country? Then, in response to the new voter laws in the State of Georgia, Major League Baseball (MLB) has decided to cancel their mid-season all-star game at the suggestion of Biden. The Georgia law expands voting times and prevents groups that are electioneering from influencing voters by distributing anything of value to anyone waiting in line. Later, Sen. Mike Lee calls in to explain the need to push back on these corporations like MLB that have monopolized their industries and potentially violated anti-trust laws. Corporations should not engage in the malicious propaganda known as woke-ism. Afterward, author Steve Deace joins the show to discuss his new book Faucian Bargain: The Most Powerful and Dangerous Bureaucrat in American History. Deace highlights Anthony Fauci's hypocrisy and how the data has always shown the death rate to be less than one percent. Deace is calling for Congress to assemble a 9/11-style commission to investigate Fauci-ism and lockdown-ism. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
