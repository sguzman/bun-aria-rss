  "description": "<p>Stephane Gosselin is the Founder of Flashbots, an R&D organization that’s trying to fix the most pernicious problem in crypto—the problem of MEV (Maximum Extractable Value).</p> <p>Many of us are massively optimistic about crypto and aren’t worried too much about its future. However, this MEV thing could be our achilles heel.</p> <p>On this episode, we dive into what Stephane and his team are doing to make MEV less of a potential weak point, how MEV works, and what our industry would look like if Flashbots didn't exist. And of course—so much more.</p> <p>This is another fundamental Bankless episode that you won’t want to miss.</p> <p>------<br /> 📣 Chainlink | Register for SmartCon 2022 with promo code “BANKLESS”<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/smartcon\">https://bankless.cc/smartcon</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🌱 LENS | ACCESS CODE: MERGE (only valid for 24 hours!)<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Lens\">https://bankless.cc/Lens</a> </p> <p>🚀 ROCKET POOL | ETH STAKING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/RocketPool\">https://bankless.cc/RocketPool</a> </p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Brave\">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a> </p> <p>🌉 JUNO | BRIDGE FIAT TO LAYER 2<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Juno\">https://bankless.cc/Juno</a> </p> <p>⚡️ ZKSYNC | THE LAYER 2 SCALING ENDGAME<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/zkSync\">https://bankless.cc/zkSync</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 9:28 MEV Explained & Its Importance<br /> 13:35 The Evil Side of MEV<br /> 21:26 MEV Utopia vs. Dystopia<br /> 28:54 Competitiveness, Market Structure, Equilibrium<br /> 32:10 MEV Supply Chain Crashcourse<br /> 37:24 Timeline<br /> 38:56 Flashbots Thesis<br /> 42:31 No MEV Geth Scenario<br /> 45:15 Flashbots Continued<br /> 49:10 Solutions<br /> 51:15 MEV Boost<br /> 1:00:18 MEV Boost Adoption<br /> 1:05:10 Differences in Staking APY<br /> 1:08:20 Flashbots Incentives<br /> 1:12:57 Infinite Problems to be Solved?<br /> 1:14:35 PBS<br /> 1:17:54 Relayer Role<br /> 1:20:05 Weird MEV Potential Merge Issues?<br /> 1:22:40 Byproducts of MEV Boost<br /> 1:27:17 New Builder Market Speculation<br /> 1:31:15 Stephane’s Optimism<br /> 1:32:55 Closing & Disclaimer</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Stephane Gosselin<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/thegostep\">https://twitter.com/thegostep</a> </p> <p>MEV-Boost in a Nutshell<br /> <a href= \"https://boost.flashbots.net/\">https://boost.flashbots.net/</a> </p> <p>Flashbots Blog Posts<br /> <a href= \"https://writings.flashbots.net/writings\">https://writings.flashbots.net/writings</a> </p> <p>Guide to Ethereum Roadmap<br /> <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/guide-to-the-ethereum-roadmap-jon#details\"> https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/guide-to-the-ethereum-roadmap-jon#details</a> </p> <p>Ethereum’s Hidden Power Structure<br /> <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/125-matt-cutler#details\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/125-matt-cutler#details</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
