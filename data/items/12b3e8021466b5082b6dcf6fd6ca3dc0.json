  "description": "Our audiobook this week is Doctor Dave by Abby Knox! \n\nNarrated by Matthew Maddux and Lauren Sweet\n\nWorking the graveyard shift at a local shopping mall isn’t as bad as you think, and 29 year old security guard Millie has plenty of hobbies to help her pass the lonely hours each night. Need a hand-knit animal hat? She’s got you covered.

With her 30th birthday fast approaching, she’s quickly giving up on finding true love for herself. Tonight, however, she’s giving it one more chance before taking extreme measures.
