  "description": "<p>Dr. Kevin Pogue, PhD, professor, geologist, and terroir expert educates us on terroir. This podcast is like taking a terroir class: it debunks so many things that people spout in reference books, at wineries, and in mainstream press about the topic! He explains things brilliantly and he is one of the first people I've ever met who actually has answers to my really dorky questions about terroir. </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/cotebrun.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"170\" height=\"300\" /><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Photo: Kevin Pogue. <a href=\"https://www.vinterra.net/about.htm\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">From Vinterra.net</a></span></em></p> <p>As more detail, Kevin is one of the most famous people in the field of terroir. He's considered the foremost terroir expert on Washington State wine and he’s known around the world -  his work has been featured in both national and international journals. He's a licensed geologist and professor of geology at Whitman College in Walla Walla. Kevin has a doctorate in geology from Oregon State University, and decades of college teaching and research experience. He has authored books, articles, and done extensive research on the terroir of the Pacific northwest, with a good portion of this time spent on investigating the deposits of the Missoula floods, which were the pivotal event that formed the geological base of the region.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p> </p> <p>Kevin’s research today focuses on terroir.
