  "title": "Uncle Si Ain't Buying the Propaganda",
  "description": "Si teaches a master class on how to hustle a skeet shooter, but then he loses a crisp hondo to Stone's 13-year-old daughter on their fishing trip. Si and the boys shake the Robertson family tree, and a whole lotta hilarity falls out, including what Phil did when Al had appendicitis, the time Phil had food poisoning and refused to miss a duck hunt, and the tale of Uncle Marvin the Lead-Eater. Stone brokers a compromise when his kid refuses to go to the daddy-daughter dance. Martin nails the two things everyone sucks at, and Si reveals the magic words every marriage needs. JD gets roasted for his truly hideous shirt. And Si says JD, Martin, and Stone can flush their theories on PED use in baseball right down the bidet — he knows the truth.
