  "description": "<p>Welcome to another episode of The Literary Life podcast with Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks! This week our hosts open a new series on Ray Bradbury’s well-known novel <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3vEd0P7\">Fahrenheit 451</a>.</em> They talk about the form of the dystopian novel and why it is such a popular form in the modern world. Angelina shares some background on the form, as well as some of the foremost authors and books in this genre. Then they dive into the text, starting with the images of the hearth and the salamander. Looking at the world Bradbury has created, they take note of some of the major ideas and discuss any similarities to our current culture seen in these first several chapters.</p> <p>Cindy is hosting a new summer discipleship course for moms this year, so head over to <a href= \"https://morningtimeformoms.com/product/morning-time-for-moms-summer-discipleship-2021/\"> morningtimeformoms.com</a> for more info and to sign up!
