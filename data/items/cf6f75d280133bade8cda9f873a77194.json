  "description": "In Florida, a video shows police arresting 19 people accused of committing voter fraud. A 2018 state constitutional amendment restored the right to vote to many felons, but not those convicted of murder or felony sex offenses, leading to confusion over who was eligible. Neil Volz, deputy director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, joins us. Then, human-made threats are responsible for the decline of nearly half of bird species. One in eight species is threatened with extinction, according to a new report, and birds tell us a lot about the state of the environment and the health of the planet. Stuart Butchart, a chief scientist at BirdLife International and a co-author of the report, joins us. And, Sam Heughan may not be too similar to his \"Outlander\" character Jamie Fraser, but he has a tale of his own journey to tell. The actor documents his hike of Scotland's West Highland Way while reflecting on his personal life and acting career. \"Waypoints: My Scottish Journey\" comes out on Oct. 25 and Heughan joins us. ",
