After discussing the <em>Dobbs</em> case which, we hope will overturn Roe, Kevin and Erika turn their attention to the Enlightenment writer Mary Wollstonecraft. In this wide-ranging discussion through Erika’s book <em>The Rights of Women: Reclaiming a Lost Vision</em> (University of Notre Dame Press, 2021). Kevin and Erika talk about the staunch anti-abortion views of early women’s rights advocates, how the feminist movement lost its way, and why our culture needs a new (old) vision of motherhood and fatherhood.</p>\n<p><strong>Timestamps:</strong></p>\n<p>Intro and Sponsor [0:00-1:22]</p>\n<p>Guest: Erika Bachiochi [1:23-8:48]</p>\n<p>Abortion & Women's Rights History [8:49-19:12]</p>\n<p>Mary Wollstonecraft - Misunderstood?
