It is considered a rare malignancy but likely afflicts more people than prior literature suggests given that review of that literature shows patients more in line with Renal Medullary Carcinoma rather than Collecting Duct Carcinoma. 3 year overall survival of RMC is 3%. Upfront chemotherapy then surgery is the suggested treatment. Response rate to platinum based chemotherapies, gemcitabine, doxorubicin is 29%.",
