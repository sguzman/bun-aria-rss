  "description": "If you haven’t been fat, you might not know what it’s like to fly as a fat person. To walk past rows of passengers who meet your face with dread, disgust, or fear. To hear your body loudly derided in your presence. To be removed from a flight and required to rebook, sometimes without a refund, and nearly always without legal recourse. \n\nThis week on The Best Money I Ever Spent, Aubrey Gordon, the writer behind ‘Your Fat Friend’ and the co-host of the Maintenance Phase, explains how a simple device she purchased for $19.98 — her travel talisman — helped her reclaim control and dignity over some of the worst aspects of flying. \n\nRead Aubrey’s essay here. \n\nThis episode was made by: \n\n\n- Writer: Aubrey Gordon (@yrfatfriend)\n\n\n- Editor: Alanna Okun (@alanna)\n\n- Producers: Schuyler Swenson, Taylor Maycan (@taylormaycan) \n\n\n\n- Engineer: Paul Mounsey\n\n\nEnjoyed this episode?
