  "description": "<p>In this 54th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world though an evolutionary lens. In this episode, we discuss COVID-19, lockdowns, masks, and the implications for a possible vaccine. We ask if there are questions that should not be asked, and what makes a person an ideologue. Should you stay in your lane? What does it mean when a person is consistent in their arguments over time? How do new social media platforms become like old social media platforms? <br/><br/>Find more from us on Bret’s website (https://bretweinstein.net) or Heather’s website (http://heatherheying.com). <br/><br/>Become a member of the DarkHorse LiveStreams, and get access to an additional Q&A livestream every month.
