Thank you for being a friend, Betty White. Why do leftist bigots get to describe West Virginia as a horrible, inbred place just 'cause Democrat Joe Manchin stands up to Biden? Growin' up in southeast Texas meant growing up in Louisiana. The many lies of plagiarizer Joe Biden. There's an explosion of content; here's what Michael recommends. What does 2020's Democrat primaries tell us about Kamala and who'll be on tap in 2024? The Rush Limbaugh Show was a great free school. Wishing continued great shows for Clay and Buck in 2022 and thanks to the entire C&B team -- and all of you -- for this opportunity.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
