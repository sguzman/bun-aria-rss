And, trust me, when you are able to cut out or back your emotional eating you WILL LOSE WEIGHT.</p> <p>Most of us are eating for all kinds of reasons other than hunger. Things like you are afraid you will get hungry so you eat a little something, you are transitioning from the commute to cooking dinner so you grab a handful of chips, or it's been a long day and you need a little something to go to sleep.</p> <p>Listen up because this recording could be a game changer.</p> <p> </p>",
