  "description": "In today's podcast we discuss another in the long-running series of big social media breaches, this one in VK. Password re-users are advised to change not only their credentials, but their ways. Vulnerabilities are reported in Facebook features, and in Ubee VoIP routers. Dale Drew from Level 3 Communications explains that cyber attack traffic in Latin America is up. Raytheon's Dave Amsler shares the findings of a new survey on how companies interact with MSSPs. Al Qaeda makes its way back to Twitter (from Syria). As the US seeks expanded warrantless electronic search authority in terrorism and espionage investigations, observers find themselves thinking that maybe Snowden actually did the NSA some favors.",
