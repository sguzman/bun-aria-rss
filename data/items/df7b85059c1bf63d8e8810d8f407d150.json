  "description": "Over 2,000 bodies were discovered on the property of a deceased doctor, making him the WORST serial killer in American history. But since his victims were all aborted babies, the media has remained silent. Texans apparently love telling Beto how willing they are to give up their AR-15s, but Texas-based Glenn isn’t buying it. And over HALF of Saudi Arabia’s oil production was just disrupted in a drone attack, with all signs pointing to Iran. Dr. Marty Makary joins the program to discuss his new book, “The Price We Pay,” which describes what’s REALLY wrong with American health care and how we can fix it.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
