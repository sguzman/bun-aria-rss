    "media:description": "In most disciplines \"Engineering\" means the stuff that works, an application of scientific reasoning to solving practical problems. In Software, depending on your background, it either means something bureaucratic that doesn't work, or it is just another name for software development. So what are the ideas that we can use as tools to give real, practical advantage in our work in the way that other disciplines achieve? What ideas should we treat as \"the tools of our trade\" whatever the technology or problem before us? This presentation explores two \"tools\" that we can use, Testability & Speed.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
