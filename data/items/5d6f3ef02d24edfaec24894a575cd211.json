  "description": "Since Myths and Legends is off this week, I thought I would run an episode from our other show, Fictional. It's a podcast where we adapt and retell stories from all over fiction. Today's episode is part one of \"The Time Machine\" by H.G. Wells. If you're not already subscribed, this is a chance to check out the new show, and if you are, we'll see you next week with a new Myths and Legends! --- Subscribe to Fictional: Apple Podcasts: http://apple.fictional.fm/ Spotify: http://spotify.fictional.fm Stitcher: http://stitcher.fictional.fm/ Google Play: http://google.fictional.fm/ via the site: https://fictional.fm Copy and paste our RSS feed anywhere you get your podcasts: http://fictional.libsyn.com/rss --- Here are the original shownotes for this episode: \"The Time Machine\" is a book written by the father of science fiction, H.G. Wells. This is a book so famous that it actually coined the phrase \"time machine\" to refer to a machine that travels through time. It is a short but sprawling book, flinging mankind into the farthest future where we see how the consequences of our actions today can affect the world for millennia. It still holds up, too. It's a little more plot- and concept-heavy than today's novels, but it's a fascinating story full of interesting twists. The villain this time is neither fascinating nor full of twists. He's a one-note idiot obsessed with returning to a past that never was. ----- Music: “Cylinder Three” by Chris Zabriskie Additional music by Breakmaster Cylinder<p><a href=\"https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
