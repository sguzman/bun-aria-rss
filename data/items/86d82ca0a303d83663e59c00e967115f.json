  "description": "<p>Spoke to Randy and he said “I have never seen a Sasquatch but I have dealt a lot with demonic possession. I have many accounts that made the hair on my arm stand up. Many people come to me with accounts of running into these creatures.”</p> <p>Randy writes “I have two encounters to share, both happened in Kentucky, one was right outside of Louisville city limits.</p> <p>1968,69-70</p> <p>The Green River was dammed up to create an 8,210 acre lake, “Green River Lake.” During this time my friend’s family owned land on green River. Naturally, As the lake filled up, many caves in the area were flooded. We think that’s what drove the Sasquatch in this story out into the open and searching for new territory.</p> <p>My friend and his cousin came down to the riverbank to do some target practice with their 22 rifles. They would walk up stream a ways, throw pop cans in the water, then run back down stream and wait for the pop cans (targets of choice) to float by.</p> <p>While blowing the cans to smitherines, my friend’s cousin’s gun jammed.</p> <p>They walked around a tree line, across a field and back up to their car which was sitting on the side of the road. They opened the trunk, sat on the back bumper, and began to dislodge the shell from his 22 rifle. As they were reloading they heard limbs snapping, they looked up and back toward the tree line they had just walked from. The tops of the trees were swaying wildly.</p> <p>My friend’s cousin asked, “who let the elephant out?” They decided to check it out.</p> <p>They closed the trunk and jogged back down across the field then walked quietly around the line of trees and back into the opening on the river bank where they had been standing moments before.</p> <p>“Sam” not his name..said when they came into the opening something started screaming at them. They jumped and looked toward the scream….Standing on top of a deadfall was a creature covered in hair, his arms were above his head and he was waiving them back and forth in a left, right motion. Sam’s cousin spun the barrel of his rifle around and shot 5 times.</p> <p>Sam said all five shot’s hit the creature in his chest area. He said he could hear the bullets landing almost like the sound of them hitting the water. The creature dropped his arms and fell straight back behind the deadfall. He hit with a large thud, then silence. The silence was very short lived. Sam’s cousin, started screaming, “I’ve killed our crazy uncle”</p> <p>“I’ve killed our crazy uncle”</p> <p>“I’ve killed our crazy uncle”</p> <p>“He dressed up in a monkey suit to scare us and I’ve killed him.”</p> <p>Sam told him, I don’t know what you’ve killed but it’s not our uncle. They were both in shock so holding onto each other they walked slowly over to the dead fall and looked over it to the back side. The creature was laying on its back and not moving. One of them (not sure which one) said, what the heck is it?</p> <p>This stirred the creature, he opened his eyes and jumped up. They jumped back, turned and started running. The creature “galloped” away in one direction, the two cousins in the opposite. I say galloped because of the way he was swinging his arms.</p> <p>(This is my opinion, not theirs)</p> <p>I think the creature was in shock, I think he was running but using his arms as if he was on all four. He was running on two but his arms were swinging as if he was using them to touch the ground. The story extends, They raced home and got their dad’s 30-30…..Tracked it….. with more info coming from a neighbor the next day.”</p> <p> </p> <p><strong><em>This episode brought to you by M-Y-B-O-O-K-I-E.
