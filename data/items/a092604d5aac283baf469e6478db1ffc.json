  "description": "<p>Tonight I will be speaking to Mark who is from Southern California and had an encounter over a year ago. Mark moved to Washington state and went out with a friend to try hunting for the first time east of Seattle, Washington. I know the area well, and have recently received many reports from this area.</p> <p>Mark saw a creature who stood up and looked directly at him, and had a great description of what he saw. Mark says “I could not believe what I was looking at, I never believed in this before and didn’t care about the topic.”</p> <p>The men decided to go to the area where he saw the creature, and they found where the creature had been laying down, as well as large, human-like tracks. Mark and his friend have returned to the area almost every weekend for the last year and have had other encounters with the creatures. Mark says “I have just become obsessed with this, I feel like I need answers.”</p> <p>Mark invited wildlife biologist, John Bindernagel out to the area and John was so impressed he gave Mark a plot watcher to set up. Mark has sent me some of the evidence that he has collected, and has also sent the Olympic Project his audio to have it reviewed. Mark says “We have seen the creatures on several occasions and I am working on getting some clear video of them, I have recorded strange chatter, whoops, screams, roars and yells.”</p> <p>He was able to capture them on video as the creature was ducking down between two trees and sent me the still frames from that video. Mark says “I want to gather all of the evidence and work on getting them better on film before I release it to the public.”</p> <p>Tonight Mark shares with us the encounters he has had in this area and even an encounter where he was charged by one.</p>",
