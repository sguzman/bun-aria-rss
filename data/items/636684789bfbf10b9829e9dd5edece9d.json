One of the most fascinating and popular guests to grace this platform, Today Zach Bush, MD returns for a third mind-altering bend around the multiverse.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Zach's varied interests belie attempts to properly define him — but I'll give it a try. One of the few triple board certified physicians in America with expertise in Internal Medicine, Endocrinology and Metabolism, and Hospice/Palliative care, he is the founder and director of <a href=\"https://themclinic.com\" target=\"_blank\">M Clinic</a>&nbsp;integrative health center in Virginia.</p><p>In addition to his experience in functional medicine, longevity, autism, gut health, cancer, and many other areas of medicine, he is an avid environmentalist and activist involved in a multitude of projects that focus on ecology, regenerative agriculture, farmer well-being and spirituality.</p><p>To advocate&nbsp;for soil health & food independence, Zach is also the creator of <a href=\"https://farmersfootprint.us/\" target=\"_blank\">Farmer's Footprint.</a> Seen through the lens of farmers and their communities, it's a documentary series & grassroots movement that evaluates the impact of monocrop farming and pesticide reliance on chronic disease&nbsp;and planetary health — while simultaneously exploring evidence-based solutions to rebuild living biodiversity and ultimately reverse climate change.</p><p>But more than anything, Zach is a healer.
