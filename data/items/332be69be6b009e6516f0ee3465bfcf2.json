  "title": "David Hieatt: Co-Founder Hiut Denim Co & The Do Lectures",
  "description": "David Hieatt explains the importance of telling stories in brand building and how he applied the skills he learned in advertising to build globally recognised brands. His life is so unusual that it's hard to be sure what our listeners will take away, but he is clearly grounded in what he is doing now, recognised as successful in the eyes of his peers, and has built a brand, business and events that have impact and meaning for him, and others and his local community in Wales.\nHe co-founded Howies which was acquired by Timberland, later The Hiut Denim Co, whose mission was and is to bring jeans making back to his hometown in Wales, and a popular & unique event called \"The Do Lectures\" which attendees say is better than TED and/or Burning Man.\nWhile taking us through some of the big moments in his life, he shares how his interest in brands got him into advertising, how he managed to position himself as an expert in marketing sports brands to young consumers at the age of 13, and to lose half his father's savings when he was 16.\nWe hear about the power of persistence, doing things that other people don't do, and counter intuitive episodes in his life. We hear how half the people in his company were happy when he sold Howies to Timberland because he drove things too hard, and the exit made him unhappy. How he showed up with his friend for job interviews and was rejected 150 times and moved from living on \"beans on toast\" to a senior position in a global advertising agency through working all hours, studying hard, and taking the jobs that nobody else wanted. We get some insights into the \"Mad Men\" alcohol fuelled culture of \"chaos with bright people\". He asks an important question for any entrepreneur \"Why would you sell something you love for money?\".\nWe learn how a good entrepreneur who wants to build a brand needs to have two factories: one producing the product, the other producing the stories.\nIf you listen to this episode you may learn where you should never ever underestimate the power of a sticker.\nWe hear about the challenges of success associated with the Do lectures event which, despite being expensive, sell out, and from which amazing people have to be turned away. Perhaps in 2022 they will have randomised selection.\nAbout David Hieatt and other links\nRead interviews with David life here and here\nDavid’s Linkedin\nThe Do Lectures \"The idea is a simple one: To gather together the world’s DOers, disruptors and change makers, experts and pioneers, to share their stories, and encourage others to go and DO.\"\nThe Hiiutt Denim Company \"We make jeans.
