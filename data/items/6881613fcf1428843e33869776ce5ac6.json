  "description": "Cracking down on large tech companies may be one of the few remaining areas of political consensus in Washington D.C. However, many legal experts caution that antitrust cases could take years to complete and the outcomes are far from certain.\nStill others claim that the recent focus on antitrust is more about punishing tech platforms for being successful. They argue that it would have little impact on more pressing concerns, such as the spread of misinformation, the erosion of privacy, and the acceleration of political polarization.\nIn this episode of [Un]Common Law we speak with:\n\nDerek Bambauer, professor of law at the University of Arizona, where he teaches internet law and intellectual property.\n\nSally Hubbard, attorney and director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute.\n\nChris Koopman, executive director at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University.\n\nDavid McLaughlin, reporter for Bloomberg News covering antitrust, finance, and mergers and acquisitions. \n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
