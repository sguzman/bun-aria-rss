  "description": "June 1 and we're already thinking about how we can make money in September and again in February. R.J. White joins Will Brinson to break down MVP futures (3:00) and Week 1 spreads (30:15). First, the guys find the best value on the board for MVP candidates, identifying their top picks, value bets and longshots. Dak Prescott is certainly the Comeback Player of the Year favorite, but could be worth some cash to capture Most Valuable Player. Sure, the NFC East is far from elite, but Jalen Hurts might actually offer some value if the Eagles are able to exceed expectations. R.J. and Will are already eyeing plenty of Week 1 picks that make sense to jump on now before the spread changes over the next few months.
