  "title": "Beyond the Brink: Escalation and Conflict in U.S.-China Economic Relations",
  "description": " <div>\n\n</div>\nThe U.S.-China trade war is unprecedented in size, scope, and importance. The potential economic costs of the conflict—and any decoupling it prompts—are enormous, not only to the United States and China but to the global economy. Nearly 18 months since escalation began, the path to resolution is still unclear.<br />\n<br />\nIn this event, senior experts will discuss the state of U.S.-China trade relations today and roll out a major CSIS report on escalation dynamics in economic conflict. The event will draw on game theory as well as observations of real-world escalation to help policymakers manage economic conflict with China.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Agenda:</b><br />\n<i>Welcome and Presentation of Findings</i><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.csis.org/people/matthew-p-goodman\">Matthew P.
