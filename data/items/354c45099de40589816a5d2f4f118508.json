  "description": "<p>Québec City is the capital city of the province of Quebec and sits along the Saint Lawrence River. The city is mostly French speaking as it was established by the French. This is an area of natural beauty and centuries of history. Several locations here that incorporate those two elements are reputedly haunted. These locations include Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Plains of Abraham, Chateau Frontenac Hotel and Montmorency Falls. Join us as we explore the history and haunts of Quebec City in Canada!
