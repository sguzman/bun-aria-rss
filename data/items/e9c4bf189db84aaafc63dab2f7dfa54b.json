  "description": "<p>Is religion good? Or bad? If we try to get rid of it entirely, does that help? Or just make things worse? And how do so many people get the basic message of Jesus so completely wrong? Today we dive into Skye Jethani's new book – What’s Wrong With Religion? – to wrestle with some absolutely fundamental questions about walking with Jesus.</p> <p>Plus - education and church attendance might go hand-in-hand after all, and a great worship band might not be what your church needs most. Oh… and muddy jeans as a sign of the end times. Really expensive ones.</p> <p>You can download the first two chapters of Skye’s new book for free by clicking <a href= \"https://philvischer.lpages.co/wwwrpreview/\">here</a>. Check it out! Tell your friends! It’s a fun read (with pictures and everything!) that could actually change your life, or the life of someone you love.</p>",
