  "title": "Can we say what diet is best for health with David Katz, MD",
  "description": "In Episode #108 I sit down with Dr David Katz, MD who in my opinion, is one of the greatest voices of clarity in a space of science which let's be frank, is littered with confusion tactics, hidden agendas and bias. This is a great episode which reinforces many of the key principles that I have been sharing with you via social media and on this show for the past 2 + years. It also emphasises the 3 pillars that I look to when making my personal food decisions - the pillar of human health, planetary health and animal welfare.\n\nIn this episode we specifically talk about:\n\n\nWhy an infectious disease pandemic may be what we need to take chronic disease more seriously\n\nThe number one risk factor for chronic disease in developed countries\n\nWhy debating the little stuff is keeping us from making impact on the big stuff\n\nThe characteristics of an optimal diet\n\nCan we say what the single best diet is\n\nThe importance of the replacement nutrient in nutrition science\n\nThe use of strawman diets in nutrition science\n\nShould we eat fish? What are the considerations here?\n\nWould adding animal products to an optimally planned vegan diet improve one's health\n\nand much more\n\n\nI really hope you enjoy the show. Of course, if you do, please share your feedback with David and I on social media. The best place to find David is on Twitter - you can also find me on Twitter and Instagram too.\n\nBelow is a few resources that we spoke about in this episode:\n\n\nDavid's website\n\nDavid's wife's recipes at Cuisinicity\n\n\nDavid's books - How to Eat & The Truth About Food\n\n\nWhy Two Pandemics are better than one\n\n\nWant to support the show?\nIf you are enjoying the Plant Proof podcast a great way to support the show is by leaving a review on the Apple podcast app. It only takes a few minutes and helps more people find the episodes.\n\nSimon Hill, Nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist\nCreator of Plantproof.com and host of the Plant Proof Podcast\nAuthor of The Proof is in the Plants\nConnect with me on Instagram and Twitter\nDownload my two week meal plan\nLearn more about your ad choices.
