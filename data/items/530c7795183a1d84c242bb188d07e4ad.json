  "description": "Happy Thanksgiving from everyone at The Late Show! Families around the country are planning a return to larger Thanksgiving celebrations as 53 million Americans are hitting the road and traveling this week for the holiday. Meanwhile… New York City’s elected leaders decided they no longer wanted to conduct business in the shadow of a man who enslaved people, so a statue of Thomas Jefferson was packed up and moved to a new location this week. Next, Rosamund Pike, the Oscar-nominated actor you know from \"Gone Girl\" and \"Pride & Prejudice,\" shows Stephen how she used a pencil to train her British self to speak in an American accent, a lesson that came in handy for her starring role in the new Amazon Prime series \"The Wheel Of Time.\" Then, in part one of their extended interview, Stephen welcomes Sir Peter Jackson and sets the stage for their in-depth discussion of Jackson’s work directing the incredible Disney+ documentary, “The Beatles: Get Back,” which is set to change the public’s perception of the relationship between John, Paul, George and Ringo in their final years as bandmates.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
