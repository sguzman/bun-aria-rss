There have been plenty of strange leads in this case. Emma is spotted and photographed in a nearby city sipping coffee at a coffee shop - or so they thought. A strange unidentified man gets upset when he sees Emma's missing persons poster. He rips the poster off of the wall and tells a store clerk that the picture is of his girlfriend. Then there's the stalker. Was Emma stalked or was it as he puts it \"we were just friends.\" Emma's mother Shelley Fillipoff spends 2 months in a city far from her home searching for her missing daughter. After criminal charges are filed against her on an unrelated event, the public eye has now become very suspicous of the mother who arrived in a city far from her home the very same day her daughter was last seen there.
