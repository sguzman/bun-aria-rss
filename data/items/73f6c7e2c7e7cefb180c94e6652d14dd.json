  "description": "<p>Download my new and improved brain detox app here: https://neurocycle.app</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>SHOW DESCRIPTION:&nbsp;In this week’s podcast I continue my discussion of the different parts of the mind, and how they are connected. Last <a href=\"https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/the-difference-between-the-nonconscious-subconscious-conscious-mind\">week</a>, I spoke about the difference between the nonconscious, subconscious and conscious mind. This week, I am going to talk about how interconnected these three parts of the mind are, and the nature of the nonconscious, “wise” mind. The nonconscious mind is incredible but often misunderstood. Even the word nonconscious is used incorrectly most of the time. Yet it’s worth putting in the effort to try to understand it, because it’s a key player when it comes to mind-management. <strong>The more you understand the nonconscious mind, the more you will see that you also have the ability to change your mind.</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sign up to Patreon to get access to the full video and audio recording add-free, exclusive downloads, live Q&As, and more: https://www.patreon.com/drcarolineleaf</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Read the blog and show notes here: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/how-to-tap-into-the-nonconcious-mind-to-unwire-trauma-toxic-thinking-habits</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>OFFERS FROM OUR SPONSORS:</p>\n<p>-<strong>Kion: You can now save 20% on monthly deliveries and 10% on one-time purchases.
