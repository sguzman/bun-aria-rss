  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">There are many issues that can spark a heated controversy in the US, one of them being our for-profit healthcare system. Each year, our country spends $4 trillion on healthcare, yet we’re sicker than ever. When you go to the doctor with a symptom, you’ll most likely walk out of the office with a prescription to manage or suppress that symptom, instead of treating the root cause.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">This begs the question: who is this system built to serve? If the healthcare industry isn’t helping patients get healthier, what is its mission?

Most importantly, we’re diving into the importance of taking control of your health and why our tendency to avoid the root causes of illnesses is exacerbating our health problems.
