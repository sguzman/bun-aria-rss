  "description": "<p>What’s in pee? Should you donate a kidney to a stranger? Which hurts worse: childbirth or kidney stones? Why are some kidneys the size of footballs? March is World Kidney Month and before you shrug it off: 15% of adults have chronic kidney disease -- and most don’t even know it. This episode could save a life. Transplant Nephrologist Dr. Samira Farouk chats about how nephrology is for cool kids, how transplant chains work, legends about bathtubs filled with ice, how dialysis works, where nephrology ends and urology begins, how much water you should drink and why kidney punches aren’t allowed in boxing.
