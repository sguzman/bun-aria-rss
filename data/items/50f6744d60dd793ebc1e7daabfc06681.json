  "description": "<p>Our season 3 opener is HERE and Stew as Jessi in the HOT SEAT answering questions and pulling back the curtain to talk about how her family helps her balance her spontaneity, how diving in \"head first\" has been her life motto, and how overwhelm is real and how she's learning to better balance everything she wants to do with the things that need her time most. No one knows you like your best friend and Stew is asking the questions we want to know the answers to most!</p>",
