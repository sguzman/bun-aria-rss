  "description": "If there was such a thing as a mind-ectomy or a mind transplant, our guest this week, Sylvia Boorstein, tells us she would have had it, confiding, \"I need a mind that doesn't make up worries about something that didn't even happen yet.\" She calls herself \"a life-long worrier, an inveterate fretter.\" Yet this very same person is an accomplished author, psychotherapist, Buddhist teacher, co-founding teacher at Spirit Rock Meditation Center and a senior teacher at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts. Years ago, on her first meditation retreat, she received news that her father had been diagnosed with a form of cancer. She remembers feeling devastated, but not hysterical or overwhelmed.  It was in that moment she realized how meditation had prepared her to deal with life's challenges differently. Through her captivating story-telling, Boorstein explains how she has achieved “poise of mind” and is able to manage life more gracefully.\nPlug Zone\nWebsite: http://www.sylviaboorstein.com/\nAbout: http://www.sylviaboorstein.com/about\nBooks: http://www.sylviaboorstein.com/books\n***VOICEMAILS***\nHave a question for Dan?
