  "title": "How will the downturn affect climate tech?",
  "description": "Stock markets are in decline. Inflation is on the rise. Interest rates are up. Private tech companies are laying off workers. \nIs this the long-awaited market correction that never quite materialized during the bull market of the last 13 years?\nAnd what does it mean for climate tech? \nIn this episode, Shayle talks to Saloni Multani, a partner at Galvanize Climate Solutions and former chief financial officer for Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign. \nShayle and Saloni place the current moment in historical context. They cover the recent wave of low-cost capital that poured into climate tech and the low interest rates that gave renewables an advantage over fossil-fuel investments. \nAnd they dive into some pressing questions like:\n\nAre the broader market impacts on climate tech delayed? Or is climate tech somehow more insulated than general tech companies?\n\nThe green premium question: Will a downturn in the market jeopardize investments in more expensive but lower-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels, such as airlines’ recent purchases of Sustainable Aviation Fuels, or SAFs?\n\nHow should climate tech investors rethink their strategies? What should entrepreneurs expect in the coming years?\n\n\nCatalyst is brought to you by Arcadia.
