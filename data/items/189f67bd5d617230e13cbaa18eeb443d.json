  "description": "<p>We’re not airing an episode of Radio Cherry Bombe today. Instead, we’d like you to take the time you spend listening to our show and seek out new voices, in particular food podcasts by Black women. Some suggestions: Afros + Knives by Tiffani Rozier, The Food Truck Scholar by Ariel Smith, the Pro Food Maker Podcast by Mercedes Gosby, A Hungry Society by Korsha Wilson, and Dinner for One by Sutanya Dacres. There are many, many others and we’ll be seeking them out and listening as well. If you know of other Black female-fueled food podcasts, please share them on social media and tag Cherry Bombe so we can learn and share as well.</p>\n",
