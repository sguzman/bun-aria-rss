  "description": "I explain how to blunt sugar cravings through fundamental knowledge of how sugar is sensed, metabolized, and utilized within the body. I explain how sugar is processed through the digestive tract and nervous system and how both the taste and nutritive components of sugar can lead to specific appetite changes and cravings. I discuss the connection between sugar, dopamine, and cravings and outline many tools to curb sugar cravings, specifically craving highly processed refined sugars.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Sugar & Physiology\n(00:03:13) Sponsors\n(00:07:40) Sugar & the Brain\n(00:10:06) Appetite & Hormones: Ghrelin & Insulin\n(00:14:17) Glucose & Brain Function\n(00:24:19) Glucose & Physical Activity\n(00:26:16) Fructose vs. Glucose\n(00:32:41) When to Eat High-Sugar Foods?\n(00:35:01) Sugar’s Taste vs. Nutritive Pathways, Sugar Cravings\n(00:41:46) Tool: Sugar & the Dopamine, Pleasure – Pain Dichotomy\n(00:48:43) Subconscious Sugar Circuits, Hidden Sugars in Food\n(00:58:03) Glucose Metabolism in the Brain\n(01:03:00) Tool: Glycemic Index, Blunting Sugar Cravings\n(01:12:08) Sugary Drinks, Highly Refined Sugars\n(01:14:33) Artificial Sweeteners\n(01:22:36) ADHD, Omega-3s\n(01:30:18) Tools: Reduce Sugar Cravings with EPA Omega-3s & Glutamine\n(01:35:15) Tool: Blunt Sugar Peaks & Craving with Lemon Juice\n(01:43:09) Tool: Reduce Sugar Cravings & Spikes with Cinnamon\n(01:45:10) Berberine, Sustained Low Blood Glucose Levels\n(01:51:24) Tool: Sleep & Sugar Cravings\n(01:56:33) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Instagram, Twitter, Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
