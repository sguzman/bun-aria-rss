  "description": "<p>Malith walked away from his home in France about 15 months ago and has been walking ever since. He walked past me last night and I knew I wanted to hear his story. He wandered along the Camino de Santiago then kept going south in Portugal until he reached Gibraltar, where he met a couple sailing to the Canary Islands. He'll be here for a while, then hopes to find a boat going to the Caribbean, South America, and on to Asia. He's a bit over a year into a 5-year journey.</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
