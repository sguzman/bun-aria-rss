  "description": "<p>What if you could work, play, and live in a state of wonder? Even now! That’s the question I explore with today’s guest, Jeffrey Davis. A poet, writer, deep-thinker, founder and CEO of the Tracking Wonder Consultancy, Jeffrey’s got an invitation for all of us. To get off the toxic productivity treadmill, which so many have been hammered by in recent times, and reclaim a sense of possibility, meaning, and wonder. To step back into a place of curiosity and lightness.&nbsp;</p><p>And, when Jeffrey offers that invitation, it’s not just a naive suggestion to rediscover your inner child, but rather a quest to bring wonder back into your life, based on more than 15 years of research, experimentation, and application. Along the way, Jeffrey has developed a powerful, proven, step-by-step methodology to begin bringing wonder back into your work, relationships, devotions, and life. He shares this in his gorgeous new book, Tracking Wonder, and we dive into key ideas and explorations in today’s conversation.</p><p>You can find Jeffrey at: <a href=\"https://trackingwonder.com/tracking-wonder-book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jeffreydavis11/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode:</strong></p><p>You’ll also love the conversations we had with iconic author, <a href=\"https://pod.link/goodlifeproject/episode/6e786611b48cc0003e29aab6c515b658\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Anne Lamott</a>, about opening to all life brings your way.</p><p><strong>My new book</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a>.</p><br><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
