  "itunes:summary": "Here's a quick public service announcement for policymakers about a simple manipulation everyone keeps falling for: the concept of \"historically marginalized\" groups. Whether using the phrasing \"historically marginalized\" or \"traditionally marginalized\" groups, this little manipulation enables a grab of power and resources in a truly tricky way, and it's \"feel good\" phrasing that appears in policy everywhere today. What's the trick? Join James Lindsay for a few minutes in this episode of New Discourses Bullets to find out. Spoiler alert, if you're in a hurry: It's that no matter what happens after a policy bearing these terms is enacted, the group referenced as \"historically marginalized\" will always remain historically marginalized because history can't be changed. Any benefits assigned to those groups will be a permanent reorganization of distribution of power and resources as a result.\n\nSupport New Discourses:\npaypal.me/newdiscourses\nnewdiscourses.locals.com/support\npatreon.com/newdiscourses\nsubscribestar.com/newdiscourses\nyoutube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://newdiscourses.com\n\nFollow:\nfacebook.com/newdiscourses\ntwitter.com/NewDiscourses\ninstagram.com/newdiscourses\nhttps://newdiscourses.locals.com\npinterest.com/newdiscourses\nlinkedin.com/company/newdiscourses\nminds.com/newdiscourses\nreddit.com/r/NewDiscourses\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
