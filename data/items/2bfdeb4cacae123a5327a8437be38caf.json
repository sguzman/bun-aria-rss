  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the Senate is part of this impeachment process so that it can act appropriately to dismiss these articles perpetrated by a rogue house of Representatives. The Senate has a duty to uphold the Constitution for the sake of the republic Democrats have finally delivered their partisan articles of impeachment to the Senate. They make allegations that are filled with platitudes but they can't substantiate a single one. If the Senate is going to conduct an evidentiary hearing, witnesses or accept additional investigative sources from the House, then what is the need for House of Representatives? The House prevented the President from basic due process yet gave unprecedented protection to the anonymous \"whistleblower.\" The House insists that certain witnesses be called in the Senate, yet the House had their chance and chose to quickly move on instead of waiting for key witnesses to testify. Speaker Pelosi held onto these articles for almost a month in order to blackmail the Senate. So the precedent has been set that seeking judicial review is now an impeachable offense. Later, why didn't Mitt Romney and the other RINO Senators demand that John Bolton appear in the House, after all, it’s the House's job to do that. Then, in the 11th hour, Adam Schiff and company release new handwritten notes as \"evidence\" from an indicted Ukrainian national with ties to Rudy Giuliani.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
