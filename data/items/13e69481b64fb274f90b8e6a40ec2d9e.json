  "description": "In today's podcast, we follow up on Russian intelligence services' hacks of the US Democratic National Committee, and their connection with other cyber espionage campaigns. We hear about more Chinese government industrial spying. ISIS claims to the Orlando shooter as one of its own as the civilized world continues to grope toward an understanding of ISIS information operations. More breaches add more credentials (and server access) to the black market. We take a quick look at Patch Tuesday. Charles Clancy from the Hume Center at Virginia Tech gives us a lesson in information sharing, and Vinny D'Agostino from K2 Intelligence shares how they're helping NFL players stay safe on social media.",
