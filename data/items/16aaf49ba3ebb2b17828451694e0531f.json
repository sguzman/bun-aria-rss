  "description": "<p>In the explosive conclusion of the Spotsylvania Court House trilogy, Avery, Codie & Tony discuss the final days of the longest single battle of the American Civil War. Myers' Hill, the brief engagement between Thomas Rosser's Virginia Cavalry and Edward Ferrero's USCT regiments, Grant's final assaults on Lee's line on May 18th, and the botched Confederate counterattack at the Harris Farm are all the main points of discussion as the guys tumble through the end of the fighting at Spotsylvania. Also, Codie can't stop messing with his hair and it's hilarious. Enjoy!</p>",
