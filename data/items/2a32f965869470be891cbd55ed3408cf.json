  "description": "Today’s Future of Music episode comes from Ariel Shapiro, The Verge’s lead reporter of HotPod, our weekly newsletter about the audio industry. Last week on the show we talked about old music… specifically how the back catalog is a big part of what makes “new” music. This week Ariel picks up right where we left off, with the revival of stars from the past on platforms like TikTok. But what about new… undiscovered talent? Is that even a thing anymore? Can a budding artist find their place in the world of viral video? Ariel explores the complicated relationship between musicians and platforms.\n\nEmail us at vergecast@theverge.com or call us at 866-VERGE11, we'd love to hear from you. \nWe are conducting a short audience survey to help plan for our future and hear from you.
