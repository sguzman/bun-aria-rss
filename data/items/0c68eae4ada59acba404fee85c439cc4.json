  "description": "<p>I remember the exact moment I first heard Nirvana and I remember the day he died. But I didn't know how hard he had to work for Nirvana to break through, and I didn't know how terribly troubled he was while they were breaking through. With the recent suicides of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park, it felt like the right time for this episode. And it was a great excuse to listen to Nirvana all week. They were so good it made me angry all over again that Kurt's not still with us. The life of Kurt, the rise of Nirvana, and the circumstances of his tragic death in today's grunge edition of Timesuck!   Timesuck is brought to you today by the Crime in Sports podcast.
