  "content": "<p><em>This work is supported by <a href=\"http://anaconda.com\">Anaconda Inc</a></em></p>\n\n<p>People often ask general questions like “Who uses Dask?” or more specific\nquestions like the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>For what applications do people use Dask dataframe?</li>\n  <li>How many machines do people often use with Dask?</li>\n  <li>How far does Dask scale?</li>\n  <li>Does dask get used on imaging data?</li>\n  <li>Does anyone use Dask with Kubernetes/Yarn/SGE/Mesos/… ?</li>\n  <li>Does anyone in the insurance industry use Dask?</li>\n  <li>…</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This yields interesting and productive conversations where new users can dive\ninto historical use cases which informs their choices if and how they use the\nproject in the future.</p>\n\n<p><em>New users can learn a lot from existing users.</em></p>\n\n<p>To further enable this conversation we’ve made a new tiny project,\n<a href=\"https://dask-stories.readthedocs.io\">dask-stories</a>.  This is a small\ndocumentation page where people can submit how they use Dask and have that\npublished for others to see.</p>\n\n<p>To seed this site six generous users have written down how their group uses\nDask.  You can read about them here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><a href=\"http://dask-stories.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sidewalk-labs.html\">Sidewalk Labs: Civic Modeling</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://dask-stories.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mosquito-sequencing.html\">Genome Sequencing for Mosquitoes</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://dask-stories.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fullspectrum.html\">Full Spectrum: Credit and Banking</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://dask-stories.readthedocs.io/en/latest/icecube-cosmic-rays.html\">Ice Cube: Detecting Cosmic Rays</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://dask-stories.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pangeo.html\">Pangeo: Earth Science</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://dask-stories.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hydrologic-modeling.html\">NCAR: Hydrologic Modeling</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We’ve focused on a few questions, available in <a href=\"http://dask-stories.readthedocs.io/en/latest/template.html\">our\ntemplate</a> that\nfocus on problems over technology, and include negative as well as positive\nfeedback to get a complete picture.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Who am I?</li>\n  <li>What problem am I trying to solve?</li>\n  <li>How Dask helps?</li>\n  <li>What pain points did I run into with Dask?</li>\n  <li>What technology do I use around Dask?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"easy-to-contribute\">Easy to Contribute</h3>\n\n<p>Contributions to this site are simple Markdown documents submitted as pull\nrequests to\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dask/dask-stories\">github.com/dask/dask-stories</a>.  The site\nis then built with ReadTheDocs and updated immediately.  We tried to make this\nas smooth and familiar to our existing userbase as possible.</p>\n\n<p>This is important.  Sharing real-world experiences like this are probably more\nvaluable than code contributions to the Dask project at this stage.  Dask is\nmore technically mature than it is well-known.  Users look to other users to\nhelp them understand a project (think of every time you’ve Googled for “<em>some\ntool</em> in <em>some topic</em>”)</p>\n\n<p>If you use Dask today in an interesting way then please share your story.\nThe world would love to hear your voice.</p>\n\n<p>If you maintain another project you might consider implementing the same model.\nI hope that this proves successful enough for other projects in the ecosystem\nto reuse.</p>"
