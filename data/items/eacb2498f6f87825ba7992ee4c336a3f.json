All the goods are said to be contraband seized by the country&rsquo;s customs service.</p>\n<p>On offer are 350 lots worth approximately &euro;1 million ($980,430). More than 1,200 prospective buyers have already signed up for the auction that kicks off on Friday at 9:30 GMT.</p>\n<p>Among the items presented on the Hotel Drouot auction house&rsquo;s website are 14 platinum ingots weighing 1kg each with a starting price of &euro;22,000. The bars were reportedly impounded after the luggage of two UK-bound passengers was searched.</p>\n<p>The catalogue also includes historic British gold coins, and a collection of uncut diamonds, seized at Paris airports.</p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.10/thumbnail/634ac7582030272bca0deab2.jpg\" alt=\"RT\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/564729-hitler-painting-uk-show/\">TV channel explains purchase of Hitlerâ€™s paintings</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    \n\n<p>There are also several pricey watches, including a gold Rolex inlaid with 40 rubies estimated at &euro;15,000 as well as a stack of designer handbags.</p>\n<p>A Volkswagen Golf which was used in an attempt to haul some 480kg of hashish across the Spanish-French border is also up for grabs.</p>\n<p>More than 2,000 bottles of Grey Goose vodka are listed with a starting price of &euro;10,000. However, only professional buyers will be able to lay their hands on the upmarket spirit, with the auction organizers citing security and legal reasons.</p>\n<p>Not all the items on offer fall under the category of &lsquo;luxury goods,&rsquo; there are semi-trailer trucks and laptops in the catalogue too.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the auction, the finance ministry praised the customs service for its daily battle &ldquo;<em>against all illegal traffic that threatens our territory and our society in order to protect citizens and the environment.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The officials added that the sale reflected the sheer diversity of impounded goods.</p>",
