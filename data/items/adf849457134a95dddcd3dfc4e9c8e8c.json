  "description": "<p>We really GO THERE in this conversation. Galactic beings. The media. Porn industry. Channeling. All of it. This is a multilayered conversation and exploration of spirituality in the modern world, especially the parts we don’t want to look at. We discuss darkness, spiritual protection, duality, oneness and a variety of topics that so many of us are wondering about and observing, but aren’t really speaking about.
