  "description": "<p>There are some people in life who are more than unpleasant, more than annoying. They're real, genuine a**holes.</p>\n<p>My guest today has written the preeminent field guides to identifying, dealing with, and avoiding all of life's jerks, bullies, tyrants, and trolls: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OT8GV2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000OT8GV2&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The No Asshole Rule</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MU0FL7M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B01MU0FL7M&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Asshole Survival Guide</em></a>. His name is <a href=\"https://www.bobsutton.net/\">Bob Sutton</a>, he's a Stanford professor of organization and management, and we begin our conversation together with how Bob defines what makes an a-hole an a-hole, what causes their jerkiness, and the costs of having such disagreeable people as part of an organization. We then get into the circumstances of when being a jerk yourself can actually be advantageous. We then turn to how to deal with the jerks in your own life, including distancing yourself from them, deciding you're going to be better than them, and imagining you're a jerk collector encountering a new species of jerk. Bob explains smart ways to fight back against jerks, and gets into the wisdom of documenting their jerkiness, why it's occasionally helpful to take an aggressive stand, and how even Steve Jobs learned how to be less of an a-hole. We end our conversation with how to build a jerk-free workplace. </p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/jerks\">aom.is/jerks</a>.</p>\n",
