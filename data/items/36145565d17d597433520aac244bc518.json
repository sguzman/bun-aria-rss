  "description": "<p>For several months, India has been in the grip of massive farm protests as millions gather to demonstrate against a series of controversial reforms collectively known as the Farm Bills. These bills, in theory, are meant to address problems with India's current agricultural system -- but a large percentage of India's farmers fear these new laws will only make their lives more difficult. Some even believe the Farm Bills are part of a conspiracy to sacrifice the livelihood of farmers for the profits of large businesses. On the other side of the protest line, members of the domestic media believe the protests themselves are a conspiracy designed to further the aims of separatist groups with ulterior motives. So which, if any, of these conspiracies are true?
