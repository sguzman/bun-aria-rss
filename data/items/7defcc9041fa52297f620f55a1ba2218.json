  "description": "<p>In this episode of the Being Human is Good For Business Podcast we talk to a leader at the forefront of the biotech industry, Genentech’s Vice President of Litigation, Mary Riley. </p><p>In this interview, Mary shares with us how leading with empathy not only improved her team’s dynamics, but it also led to major breakthroughs for the business too. </p><p>“Our group had existed for a number of years and thought they knew each other well,” explains Mary. “But it turned out they didn't actually know each other as well as they had thought. And as a result, we were unable to tap into the team’s full capabilities and potential. Getting over this hurdle was an essential part of achieving Genentech’s many accomplishments over the past few years.” </p><p>Mary started her legal career in law firms, but it was only when she moved to Genentech 15 years ago, that she realised she needed to be more strategic and thoughtful about people management issues. That’s when she started exploring the Enneagram, a human development framework that allows people to become aware of their own automatic patterns of behavior. </p><p>Wendy Appel is the author of <i>InsideOut Enneagram: The Game Changing Guide for Leaders</i>.  She’s also an executive coach, consultant and one of the founding partners of Trilogy Effect. She explains, “We often don't know how we, as individuals, come across to others. The Enneagram helps us understand how people experience us, what drives our automatic patterns of interaction and what drives and motivates others, so we can respond more thoughtfully, rather than become reactive to people and situations.”</p><p>In this podcast episode Mary shares how empathy has been the key to leading her world class team at Genentech successfully through rapid growth and expansion in the fast-changing biotech industry. She also shares her predictions for the future of work in the post-pandemic era.
