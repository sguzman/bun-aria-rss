  "description": "My favorite retail expert and founder of The Talented Blonde, Kristin Bentz, joins us for this week's special episode. On today's interview, Kristin gives listeners an interesting refresher on the retail markets. The 30-year retail veteran gives her \"ahead of trend\" analysis on what to expect as the holiday season is approaching. She explains why investors should take action now as companies are currently positioning themselves for their most important quarter. Kristin then talks about the shift of competition in the retail markets. These days, consumer spending and shopping trends are always changing. Kristin shares her thoughts on what sectors in the industry are \"too little, too late\" compared to those that are moving in the right direction. On today's Educational Segment I'll be breaking down last week's Delivering Alpha Conference. This is where the greatest asset-managers in the world get together to share their ideas and forecasts. Not only did I get front-row seats, I was the only newsletter writer in attendance. Stay tuned after the interview to find out what was being discussed behind the scenes... when the cameras weren't on. You won't get this information anywhere else.",
