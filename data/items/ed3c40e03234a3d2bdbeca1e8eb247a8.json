Our diets are the main driver of the chronic disease epidemic we are experiencing today. But food is also the most powerful medicine available to heal chronic disease, which will account for over 50 million deaths and cost the global economy $47 trillion by 2030. This is because the foods you eat are the keystrokes that send messages to your genes with every bite, telling them what to do—creating health or disease. What you put at the end of your fork is a more powerful medicine than anything you will find at the bottom of a pill bottle.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this miniepisode, Dr. Hyman speak with Dr. Josh Axe and Dr. William Li about eating to create health and how nature has an intelligent way of showing us how to use food as medicine</p><br><p>Dr. Josh Axe is a certified doctor of natural medicine, a doctor of chiropractic, and a clinical nutritionist with a passion to help people get healthy by empowering them to use nutrition to fuel their health.
