To start, the guys look at this week's primetime games with the Packers and Bears facing off on Sunday night (5:26) and Monday's doubleheader with both the Bills and Titans (11:36) and Vikings and Eagles (17:33) squaring off on Monday Night Football.  After the break, the guys draft this week's games (23:55), starting with Tom Brady and the Buccaneers hitting the road to play the Saints (24:48) and two teams looking for their first win of the season in Cardinals versus Raiders (31:06). Everyone picks a lock of the week, the guys talk about what the Cowboys should do against the Bengals without Dak Prescott at quarterback (49:56), and Dan explains why things could go from bad to worse this week when the Jets play the Browns (1:08:30). </p>\n<p>Note: timecodes approximate.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
