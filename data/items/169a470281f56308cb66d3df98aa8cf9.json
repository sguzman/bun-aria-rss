  "title": "118 - The Alphabet Murders",
  "description": "<p>Three young girls were kidnapped, raped, and strangled to death near Rochester, NY in the early 70s. Carmen Colon, Michelle Maenza, and Wanda Walkowicz. Their crimes became referred to as the Alphabet Murders or the Double Initial Killings due to the first letter in their first name matching the first letter in their last name. No one has ever been caught but there are a variety of disturbing suspects including two different serial killers and another serial rapist. Then, in 2011, Joseph Naso was arrested for and then convicted of four additional double initial murders in California. And where is Joseph Naso from? Rochester, NY. Did he commit all seven killings? And possibly others?
