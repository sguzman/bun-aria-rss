  "description": "<p>Before Arnold Schwarzenegger, even before Charles Atlas, there was Eugen Sandow. Rising from obscurity in Prussia, Sandow became an international celebrity during the Golden Age of the Strongman in the late 19th Century for his amazing feats of strength and his well sculpted physique. While Sandow wowed crowds in the United Kingdom and United States, he also preached a new gospel of physical fitness and well being. Our guest today has recently published a biography of Sandow and his times. His name is David Waller and his book is The Perfect Man: The Muscular Life and Times of Eugen Sandow, Victorian Strong Man. Mr. Waller has worked as a journalist for the Financial Times and has written and published two books on business. He lives in South West London with his wife and three children.
