  "description": "<div>The COVID-19 pandemic, Russian invasion of Ukraine, energy crisis and the resulting high inflation have created new worries about inequality on both sides of the atlantic. Labour markets and occupations have gone through profound changes as a result of technological progress, globalisation and changes to labour market institutions, among many other factors. In this episode of the Sound of Economics, Giuseppe Porcaro hosts Indivar Dutta-Gupta, President & Executive Director, CLASP Center for Law and Social Policy, and István György Tóth, Director of Tarki Social Research Institute, for a conversation about the evolving nature of inequality on both sides of the Atlantic, what are the drivers of this wedge and what policy tools are needed to address it.<br>\n<br>\n<em>This was produced within the project \"</em><a href=\"https://www.bruegel.org/eu-us-transatlantic-expert-group-on-the-future-of-work\"><em>Transatlantic expert group on the future of work</em></a><em>\", with the financial support of the European Union.
