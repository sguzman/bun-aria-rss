    "media:description": "What do our passions for pasta and decarbonizing the Earth have in common? MIT alumna Shreya Dave explains how she and her team at Via Separations are building the equivalent of a pasta strainer to separate chemical compounds for industry. “Most industrial processing facilities today are like a pot of pasta,” she explains, “You boil off all the water to get to the pasta at the bottom of the pot, instead of pouring it through a strainer in your sink, which at the industrial scale is 50% lower capital costs, 90% lower energy costs, and more modular and demand responsive\".",
