  "description": "<p>It’s a Flinstone/Jetson’s crossover! Em tells the podcast’s FIRST alien story, featuring Barney and Betty Hill, who were not martians, although they did get abducted by a UFO. Meanwhile Christine shares the story of the Lake Bodom murders, Finland’s most notorious unsolved homicide. There’s a lot to unpack in this episode, including the correct pronunciation of Bananas in Pajamas. (The jury’s still out on that one.) Just remember to always check your genitals. <br />This story is donated (you’ll see it on our tax return) to our loyal $25 patron Mio Diaz! Thank you for your support.</p>\n",
