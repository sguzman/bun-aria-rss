  "description": "<p>True Crime Tuesday presents The Last Jewish Gangster: The Early Years with Author, David S. Larson!</p>\n\n<p>In 1944 Brooklyn, newborn Michael J. Hardy is rejected by his mother so she can run with gangster Bugsy Siegel, Hardy’s godfather. Shirley Rook rose to the top of the criminal ranks. As the Queen of New York City crime, she laundered Mob money, ran the city’s largest bookmaking operation, and handed payouts to dirty cops, politicians, and judges.</p>\n\n<p>To win his mother’s love and respect, Hardy became a fearless gangster. Throughout his career as a criminal, he robbed banks and drug dealers alike, ran a kidnapping ring, and even became a hired gun. At his lowest, he ended up doing time for his mother’s counterfeiting operation in Mexico’s most dangerous prison.</p>\n\n<p>David S. Larson joins TCT today to tell us about Hardy's unbelievable early years, and about what kept him tethered to his humanity as he plunged headlong into hell!</p>\n\n<p>Get the book, The Last Jewish Gangster, The Early Years, Here: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wwRIoB\">https://amzn.to/3wwRIoB</a></p>\n",
