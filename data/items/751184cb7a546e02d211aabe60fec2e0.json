  "description": "Writer and comedian Charles Demers has a lot of thoughts on the differences between the United States and his home country, Canada. Differences that are political, social and professional. But he also tells Marc his thoughts about how Canada presaged Donald Trump in one specific way, how socialized medicine in Canada helps the national psyche as well as individual lives, and how the alt-comedy scene in Vancouver took off with the help of a couple prominent American comedians. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube Music</a>, The Alec Baldwin Show on ABC, <a href=\"http://policygenius.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Policygenius</a>, <a href=\"http://stamps.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stamps.com</a> and <a href=\"http://simplisafe.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SimpliSafe</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
