  "description": "<p>We have a really inspiring interview today that will encourage anyone who is looking to change their life by paying down debt. Jen Smith is a personal finance expert and she has the experience to back it up. Jen and her husband paid off $78,000 of debt in less than two years making well under 6-figures. She's been featured in Kiplinger, U.S. News & World Report, Money Magazine, and she's co-host of the Frugal Friends podcast and blogs over at ModernFrugality.com. Getting out of debt and frugality go hand in hand, so we spend some time talking about why frugality is so important and what it means to be frugal. We also cover some of Jen’s favorite tactics and strategies that she used in order to become debt free.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed a cold brewed coffee since we recorded this episode in the morning (back with craft beer on Wednesday)! And as we have ramped up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!
