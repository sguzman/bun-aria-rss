  "description": "Glenn can’t look at Adam Schiff any more! The Left insists everything Trump says is a conspiracy theory, despite any FACTS! Today’s inquisition features David Holmes, who overheard a call, and Fiona Hill, who will focus on Russia. But yesterday Glenn spoke to the president’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and he explained EXACTLY what he was doing in Ukraine (being a defense attorney)!
