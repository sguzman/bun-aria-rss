  "description": "<p>American Athletic Association Commissioner Mike Aresco joins Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr to discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including his take on how college football teams in his conference are treated by those who determine national rankings and, by extension, postseason invitations and matchups. Aresco, a former executive at CBS and ESPN, says his teams -- which include the University of Central Florida, Temple, Cincinnati and Memphis -- aren't treated fairly by a system that seems to value membership in what are called the Power 5 Conferences like the SEC and Big Ten. Aresco also talks about the importance of his conference's new $1 billion television agreement with ESPN, and how he intends to secure a spot for the AAC in a major bowl game moving forward. Aresco also discusses the sports media landscape, and the blue turf at Boise State.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
