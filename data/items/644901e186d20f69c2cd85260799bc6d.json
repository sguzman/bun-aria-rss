  "description": "<p>The fortieth anniversary of the Malvinas/Falklands War of 1982 is coming up in just a few weeks’ time. There will no doubt be many retrospectives, which, here in the UK, will focus on the actions of the British government, and whether the UK’s response would be different if anything similar took place today.</p><p>But what about Argentine perspectives on the war? Why did the then Argentine government invade the islands? How was the conflict perceived in Argentina at the time, and how is it seen today? In understanding the thinking of Argentina’s rulers in 1982, can we gain insights into the calculations of authoritarian leaders who might be contemplating military action today – not least, of course, President Vladimir Putin of Russia?</p><p>Host Professor Jennifer Hudson is joined by <a href=\"https://www.llschenoni.com\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Luis Schenoni</a>, Lecturer in International Relations. His research explores the determinants of international conflict and its effects on the dynamics of state formation, particularly in Latin America. </p><p><strong>Mentioned in this episode:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636412.2020.1693618\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Was the Malvinas/Falklands a Diversionary War?
