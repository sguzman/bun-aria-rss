  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing lockdowns and restrictions surrounding covid and how they will apply to the Super Bowl coming next weekend to Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium. They also turn to the phones and speak with a caller who is managing women's OnlyFans accounts and is looking for advice on navigating the situation. Adam also harkens back to a funny clip from May 2020 where a Long Island official is giving guidance on safe use of tennis courts. As the show wraps up they speak with a caller who credits Adam with inspiring Joe Rogan to start podcasting and wants to know if Adam has considered what that means for his place in history.\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nEvite.com/ADS\nJordan Harbinger Show\nBlocktraffik.org\nGeico.com",
