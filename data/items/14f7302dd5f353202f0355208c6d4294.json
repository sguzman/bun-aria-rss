  "title": "The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck by Mark Manson",
  "description": "The world we live in demands much from us, leading many to care too much about the things that surround them. How do we care less? Simple, Don't! Manson describes principles that we can all use to create a life on our terms, not beholden to others' influence or demands. The philosophical nature of his arguments is similar to reading academic literature on philosophy but told amusingly and provocatively. Do not be put off by the title. The arguments and thoughts of the author are profound, suggesting ways for us all to find the things that we care about the most and focussing solely on these. I enjoyed the storytelling ability of the author when analysing topics that could be quite dry otherwise. This all culminates into a book that inspires to create a mindset that cannot be influenced by anyone or anything. I rate this book five stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
