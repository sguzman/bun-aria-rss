  "description": "<p>This episode is an illustration. Many regular listeners of the program might think \"Why is this guy on?\" and the simple answer is that he's a hardworking dude. Of Mice And Men may not be your cup of tea musically but no one can deny the work that it takes to arrive in a band like this. Tino (as his friends refer to him as) and I unwrap his journey from the early touring days signed to Ferret Music, taking an unconventional role in the band and showing \"fans\" that you are indeed a nerd just like everyone else. Toss aside any preconceived notions you may have of the band and dig into this crucial episode, Tino is the epitome of hardwork. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
