  "description": "<p>In 1587, Englishman John White led a group of 118 colonists to what was supposed to Roanoke Island. One hundred fifteen of those colonists were never seen again after White returned to England to get word to Sir Walter Raleigh that the colonists desperately needed supplies. On August 18th, 1590, John White returned to Roanoke three years after leaving to get those supplies and found the settlement completely deserted and the word “Croatoan” <strong><em> </em></strong>carved into a fence post. And historians, archaeologists and others have been trying to figure out what happened to those initial settlers ever since.
