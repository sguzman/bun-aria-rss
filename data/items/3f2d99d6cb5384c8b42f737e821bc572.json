  "description": "<p>In this brief review, we report some new development in the functional\ndeterminant approach (FDA), an exact numerical method, in the studies of a\nheavy quantum impurity immersed in Fermi gases and manipulated with\nradio-frequency pulses. FDA has been successfully applied to investigate the\nuniversal dynamical responses of a heavy impurity in an ultracold ideal Fermi\ngas in both the time and frequency domain, which allows the exploration of the\nrenowned Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe (OC). In such a system, OC is\ninduced by the multiple particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea, which is\nbeyond a simple perturbation picture and manifests itself as the absence of\nquasiparticles named polarons. More recently, two new directions for studying\nheavy impurity with FDA have been developed. One is to extend FDA to a strongly\ncorrelated background superfluid background, a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)\nsuperfluid. In this system, Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe is prohibited\ndue to the suppression of multiple particle-hole excitations by the superfluid\ngap, which leads to the existence of genuine polaron. The other direction is to\ngeneralize the FDA to the case of multiple RF pulses scheme, which extends the\nwell-established 1D Ramsey spectroscopy in ultracold atoms into\nmultidimensional, in the same spirit as the well-known multidimensional nuclear\nmagnetic resonance and optical multidimensional coherent spectroscopy.\nMultidimensional Ramsey spectroscopy allows us to investigate correlations\nbetween spectral peaks of an impurity-medium system that is not accessible in\nthe conventional one-dimensional spectrum.\n</p>",
