  "description": "<p>How much are you paying to invest in your 401k or IRA? You might see fees as an unavoidable cost of investing, but even a 1% fee could easily cost you more than a half million dollars over your investing lifetime. Fees not only erode how much money you have to invest now, but they lessen the amount of money that is compounding in your account year after year- the impact is twofold! Listen as we discuss the different types of fees, how to look for them, and then where to go in order to avoid fees altogether.</p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Bent De Garde by Braindead Brewing which you can find on Untappd. A big thanks to Jerrod and our friends out there in Dallas for donating this beer to the show!
