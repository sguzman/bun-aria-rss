  "description": "<p>Three years ago, we brought you the story of Lillianna Pagano, who had been abducted by her mother, Jillanne, when Lillianna was an infant. A few days before airing our story on Lillianna, we received word that she had been found alive and was reunited with her father, Tyler, a completely unexpected surprise. While this was the ending we hope for in every story, Tyler and Lillianna still had a rough road ahead of them. Lillianna had been missing for nearly six years and was told her father was dead. We recently checked in with Tyler to see how Lillianna is doing with her dad today and what they’ve been through together since they were reunited in June of 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">case submission form</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
