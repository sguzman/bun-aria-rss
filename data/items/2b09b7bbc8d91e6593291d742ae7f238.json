  "description": "In search of new knowledge practices that can help us make the world livable again, this book takes the reader on a journey across time―from the deep past to the unfolding future. The authors search beyond human knowledge to establish negotiated partnerships with forms of knowledge within the planet itself, examining how we have manipulated these historically through an anthropocentric focus. Rolf Hughes and Rachel Armstrong's book The Art of Experiment: Artistic Research in Experimental Architecture (Routledge, 2020) explores the many different kinds of knowledge, and the diversity of instruments needed to invoke and actuate the potency of human and nonhuman agencies. Four key phases in our ways of knowing are identified: material, strengthening, reconfiguring, and extending, which are exemplified through case studies that take the form of worlding experiments.\nThis pioneering work will inspire architects, artists and designers as well as students, teachers and researchers across arts and design disciplines.\nBryan Toepfer, AIA, NCARB, CAPM is the Principal Architect for TOEPFER Architecture, PLLC, an Architecture firm specializing in Residential Architecture and Virtual Reality. He has authored two books, “Contractors CANNOT Build Your House,” and “Six Months Now, ARCHITECT for Life.” He is an Assistant Professor at Alfred State College and the Director of Education for the AIA Rochester Board of Directors.
