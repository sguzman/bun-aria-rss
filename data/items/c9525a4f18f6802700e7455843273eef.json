  "description": "<p>This week we’re breaking down “Scott’s Tots” and the ladies chat with the director of this episode and the man behind the sometimes-fedora-wearing Ryan Howard, B.J. Novak! Ten years has passed since Michael promised 15 third graders that he would pay for their college if they graduated high school, and guess what? They’ve all graduated and Michael cannot afford to fulfill this promise. So he must do the right thing, give them all lithium laptop batteries and break the bad news. Often referred to as the “cringiest” episode, B.J. discusses what it was like directing his first “Office” episode, which includes filming the kids singing and dancing to “Hey Mr. Scott”. Angela shares a deleted scene where Dwight impersonates Meredith and Jenna shares a real life Scott’s Tots' success story. So if you’re a Stanley, you will love this episode. But if you’re a Pam… well, we still think you’ll enjoy this episode even though Michael has done a terrible, terrible thing. It’s just terrible.</p>\n",
