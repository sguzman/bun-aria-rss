    "media:description": "Today we introduce some of the ideas of analytic number theory, and employ them to help us understand the size of n!.  We use that understanding to discover a surprisingly accurate picture of the distribution of the prime numbers, and explore how this fits into the broader context of one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics, the Riemann Hypothesis.\n\nIt is this channel's inaugural video!
