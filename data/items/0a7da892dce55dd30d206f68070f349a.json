    "media:description": "In this Short, The Amoeba Sisters give a general definition of organic vs inorganic compounds. However, as the video mentions, this is a general definition that can vary in some disciplines. Please  expand description to learn more! To see our Amoeba Sisters Shorts Playlist, visit https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwL0Myd7Dk1Hby0rih8yhnwGUv9lb-2PB  To see our longer biology content videos, see our biology learning playlist here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwL0Myd7Dk1F0iQPGrjehze3eDpco1eVz  #shorts #amoebasisters #amoebasistersshort \n\n-------------\nRemember, as mentioned in the video, this is a general definition. We are using this definition of containing both carbon and hydrogen as also listed in the peer-reviewed Openstax:\nBetts, J. Gordon, et al. “2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning” Openstax.org, 20 Apr. 2022, ohttps://openstax.org/books/anatomy-and-physiology-2e/pages/2-4-inorganic-compounds-essential-to-human-functioning\n\n-------------\nHOWEVER, remember as the video mentions, the definition can vary among biologists and chemists. Some prefer a definition of only covalently bound carbons [with quite a few exception compounds].\n\n--------------\nSo why does this topic matter? There are branches of science that focus on organic compound interactions such as organic chemistry. In biology, photosynthetic organisms can take inorganic compounds (like water and carbon dioxide) and ultimately produce organic compounds (glucose). Glucose, an organic compound, can be broken down to generate ATP, an energy currency. Organic and inorganic compound involvement in biological processes are mentioned in many of our videos.\n\n--------------\nSupport Us? https://www.amoebasisters.com/support-us\nOur Resources: https://www.amoebasisters.com/handouts\nBiology Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwL0Myd7Dk1F0iQPGrjehze3eDpco1eVz\nGIFs: https://www.amoebasisters.com/gifs\nHandouts: https://www.amoebasisters.com/handouts\nComics: https://www.amoebasisters.com/parameciumparlorcomics\nUnlectured Series: https://www.amoebasisters.com/unlectured\n\nConnect with us!\nWebsite: https://www.AmoebaSisters.com\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AmoebaSisters\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AmoebaSisters\nTumblr: https://www.amoebasisters.tumblr.com\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/AmoebaSisters\nWebtoon: https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/amoeba-sisters-sisterhood/list?title_no=289479&page=1\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/amoebasistersofficial/?hl=en\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@amoebasistersofficial?lang=en\n\nTRANSLATIONS:\nSpanish Caption Translation: Jeremy García \n\nWhile we don't allow dubbing of our videos, we do gladly accept subtitle translations from our community.
