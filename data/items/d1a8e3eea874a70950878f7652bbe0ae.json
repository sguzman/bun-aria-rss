  "description": "Proponents of trans female athlete bans struggle to cite examples of trans women or girls gaining an unfair advantage in sports competitions. But amid a lot of debate about fairness, there's been less attention on science. NPR sports correspondent <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/2100552/tom-goldman\">Tom Goldman</a> spoke to a pioneering trans researcher who explains why — in most sports —  trans women can compete fairly against cisgender women. <br/><br/>Behind a recent spate of anti-trans state laws, LGBTQ communities see a new chapter in a familiar story: the culture wars that broke out in America in the 1990s. A new episode of the FX documentary miniseries <a href=\"https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/pride\"><em>Pride </em></a>examines that era. It was directed by Academy-Award nominee <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yford?lang=en\">Yance Ford</a>, who tells NPR why the culture wars of the 90s are so relevant today. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/05/03/991987280/idahos-transgender-sports-ban-faces-a-major-legal-hurdle\">Additional reporting on the legal debate over Idaho's ban on trans female athletes from our colleague Melissa Block</a>. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this\">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:considerthis@npr.org\">considerthis@npr.org</a>.
