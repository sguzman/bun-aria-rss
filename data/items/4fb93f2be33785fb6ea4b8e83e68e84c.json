  "description": "<p>What do you think is impossible? Pretty much everybody told my guest & friend James Lawrence that doing 50 Iron Mans in 50 days in 50 different states was impossible. But he did it. Not because he is a gifted athlete or had access to special resources, but because he learned how to create a mental toughness that is 1000 times stronger than iron. This episode will show you that you really can crush the absurdly huge goals that everybody else thinks you can't.</p>",
