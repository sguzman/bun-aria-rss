  "description": "<p><em><strong>Light: Bearers of the Name</strong></em>. Today we are starting a new series on the idea of Evangelism called ‘Light,’ a play on ‘This Little Light of Mine…’ We begin with what a name is. How were names used in the ancient world? How does it differ from now? How does God refer to Himself when asked? What does taking the name ‘Christian’ really mean? How does His name differ from how our names are used today? What of the name Jesus? How do we can bear His name individually; how can it rest over a place; how do we can walk in a way that can bear His name? What does ‘Hallowed be Thy name’ mean in this? How doe we profane His name? How does this set up the idea of Evangelism???</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
