  "description": "<p>In every relationship we have, we often set expectations. When these expectations aren’t met, we feel unloved and uncared for. And sometimes, we feel that it’s not working and that it isn’t true love. </p>\n<p>What we fail to realize is that our expectations are based on our standards, our own ideals, our own terms. OURS, not theirs. It’s one sided. We want the other person to meet our standards, ideals, and goals; but we never consider THEIR own expectations of us. </p>\n<p>In this episode of On Purpose, Jay Shetty explains why setting unrealistic expectations only leads to a failure in your relationship and builds up your insecurities. </p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for Jay Shetty’s free </strong><a href=\"http://www.jayshettypurpose.com\"><strong><em>“Pursuit of Purpose”</em></strong><strong> Live Masterclass</strong></a><strong> at </strong><a href=\"http://www.jayshettypurpose.com\"><strong>www.jayshettypurpose.com</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>01:34 What are your expectations when you’re in a relationship?</li>\n<li>03:45 Expectation #1: We create a list of expectations that we will find</li>\n<li>07:07 The three G’s: Goal, Growth, Gratitude</li>\n<li>11:20 Expectation #2: Our partner should be perfect</li>\n<li>15:50 Expectation #3: Expecting your partner to make you happy</li>\n<li>18:56 Expectation #4: Our partners can read our mind</li>\n<li>22:20 Expectation #5: Know how to do things we usually do that we’ve never explained</li>\n<li>25:33 Expectation #6: Have it all together all the time</li>\n<li>27:38 Expectation #7: Our partner want the same things we want</li>\n<li>30:03 Expectation #8: Our partner should understand us immediately</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/on-purpose-with-jay-shetty/id1450994021\"><strong>Like this show?
