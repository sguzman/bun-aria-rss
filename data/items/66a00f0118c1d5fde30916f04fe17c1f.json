Boom! Boom!\nOn the sun-bright sand.\nThen I'd leave my ship and I'd land,\nAnd climb the steep white sand,\nAnd climb to the trees\nThe six dark trees,\nThe coco-nut trees on the cliff's green crown -\nHands and knees\nTo the coco-nut trees,\nFace to the cliff as the stones patter down,\nUp, up, up, staggering, stumbling,\nRound the corner where the rock is crumbling,\nRound this shoulder,\nOver this boulder,\nUp to the top where the six trees stand....\n\nAnd there would I rest, and lie,\nMy chin in my hands, and gaze\nAt the dazzle of sand below,\nAnd the green waves curling slow\nAnd the grey-blue distant haze\nWhere the sea goes up to the sky....\n\nAnd I'd say to myself as I looked so lazily down at the sea:\n\"There's nobody else in the world, and the world was made for me.\"",
