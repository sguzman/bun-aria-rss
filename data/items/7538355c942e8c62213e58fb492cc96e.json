  "description": "Humans have an innate urge to reach for explanations of the world around us. For example, \"What caused this tragedy?\" or \"Why are some people successful?\" This episode features psychologist and philosopher Tania Lombrozo, discussing her research on what purpose explanation serves -- i.e., why it helps us more than our brains just running prediction algorithms. Tania and Julia also discuss whether simple explanations are more likely to be true, and why we're drawn to teleological explanations (e.g., \"Why does the sun shine? So that plants can grow.\")",
