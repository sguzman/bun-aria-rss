  "description": "<p>Danish and Oneill came over to my Los Angeles AirBnB to talk about when it's time to call it a career in show business. That was the topic. Obviously we tangented onto some ridiculous crap. And somehow we managed to end it around a fire pit making smores. I'm not quite sure how that happened. It's always a good time when Jeff Danis and Ryan Oneill come on and this one was no exception. Now hopefully Danis will come to his senses and release the episode of Danish and Oneill that I did over a year ago.</p>",
