  "description": "Adam remembers the type casting in the 70’s where a handful of nearly identical actors always played the same roles before Dawson debuts his finished mashup of Olivia Newton-John and porn director Bobby Hollander. Adam looks at the career of Shania Twain and her partnership with Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange before giving insight into his dog’s sleeping habits. The gang takes calls from listeners including someone wondering if he is going to get in trouble for using the terms ‘sir’ and ‘ma’am’, someone who heard a rumor about Charles Manson and Al Lewis, and someone wondering when the next Carolla Cruise will be. \n\nTHANKS FOR SUPPORTING TODAY’S SPONSORS:\n\nSimpliSafe.com/ADAM\n\nGeico.com\n\nCon-Cret.com/PODCAST\n\nFreshly.com/ACS\n\nThe Jordan Harbinger Show",
