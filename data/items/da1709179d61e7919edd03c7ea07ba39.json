  "description": "The sun beats down hard on the Madrid street and it’s hot. The ice here is normally in drinks to cool down. The Spanish capital doesn’t seem like a natural first choice for Winter Olympians. That was until Javier Fernandez slowly worked his way to becoming one of the world’s leading figure skaters. He is a two-time world champion and took home a bronze medal from PyeongChang 2018.\nAs a young man, once he reached a certain level, he knew he had to leave his country behind. He has trained with the legendary Brian Orser in Toronto for eight years. As his illustrious career competing comes to a close, he’s back and is looking to teach his skills to a new generation of Spanish skaters.\nSo what does he have planned? Does he have any career regrets? And what does he make of double Olympic champion and training partner Yuzuru Hanyu?\nSUBSCRIBE for the best Olympic interviews from the podcast every Wednesday. We want you to think like an Olympian.\nLINKS:\nShredding Monsters: Mavericks: https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/features/shredding-monsters-mavericks/\nRich Roll podcast: http://www.richroll.com/podcast/rangan-chatterjee-376/",
