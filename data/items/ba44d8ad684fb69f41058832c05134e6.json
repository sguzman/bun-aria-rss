She was 49.</p><br><p>Named one of&nbsp;<em>National Geographic’s</em>&nbsp;2018 Adventurers of the Year, Hilaree was an adventurer at the absolute highest level—a giant who summited, explored & skied some of the most exotic and treacherous mountain ranges on Earth and served as an inspiration, mentor, and role model to many.</p><br><p>In tribute to her extraordinary life, this episode is a re-release of our conversation from 2018 (RRP 364).
