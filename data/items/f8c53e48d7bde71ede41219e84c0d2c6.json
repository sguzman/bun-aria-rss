  "description": "In life, what is it that pushes us to discover our true self-identities? Who are we truly and how can we begin to know ourselves on the deepest level possible so that we can push through life’s greatest failures and relish in life’s greatest successes? By chasing fear, taking on challenges, and learning to live in discomfort, we can uncover who it is we truly are.
