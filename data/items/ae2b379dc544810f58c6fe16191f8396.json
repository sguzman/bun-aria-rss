  "description": "In today's podcast we hear about trends in cyber espionage and ransomware. We also learn more about the DNC hack, which looks more like a Russian operation (and Guccifer 2.0 goes a little bit public and looks a lot less plausible as a lone hacktivist). XDedic looks bigger (but may be out of its stolen server-time business). GSA has a new cyber SIN, and the US Secret Service wants cyber triage tools. Israel relaxes its cyber export controls, and Wassenaar reconvenes to rework its cyber arms export control regime. Fidelis Vice President of Cybersecurity Services Mike Buratowski shares their research into the DNC hack, and CyberWire editor John Petrick explains false flags.",
