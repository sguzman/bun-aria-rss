  "description": "The marathon continues. Big Jinx is still trapped in the German bunker with the boyz for the Patreon-exclusive part 2 of his Throwing Fits debut. We’ve still got a lot of ground to cover. From how Jimmy and Larry have always been allies, what he remembers from the now infamous Bleacher Report pilot and what Kobe Bryant taught him, to getting courted by Diddy, proximity vs. power and the art of balancing an elevated conversation, there are miles to go before we sleep. Plus, an extendo edition of 90 Seconds of Thirst, featuring the glorious return of Producer Jay.\n \nFor more Throwing Fits, check us out on Patreon: www.patreon.com/throwingfits\n",
