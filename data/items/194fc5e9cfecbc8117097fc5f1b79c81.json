  "description": "When folks think about where to get the latest in hip-hop, NPR doesn't usually come to mind. But that's changing, thanks to the team at the Tiny Desk Concerts, which was just nominated as the Best Hip-Hop Platform for the 2022 BET Awards. Since 2008, Tiny Desk Concerts have delighted millions of listeners and viewers on YouTube with stripped-down performances from their favorite artists. Now the series is proving it's also an authentic space for showcasing all forms of hip-hop. Guest host Elise Hu talks to Tiny Desk Concerts series producer Bobby Carter about bringing new musicians into the mix, what goes on behind the scenes and where the team wants to take the show next.<br/><br/>Then, Elise plays a Tiny Desk edition of 'Who Said That' with Carter and video producer Josh Bryant.<br/><br/>Finally, Elise chats with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_pem_pem\">P.E. Moskowitz</a>, author of the 'Mental Hellth' newsletter, about how terms from therapy have crept into our daily language.
