  "description": "<p><p>This isn't a war Kirk Minihane sought out, but it's one he will fight -- and win. On today's show, Kirk Minihane discovers that one of Jared Carrabis' minions on the Section 10 podcast -- which Minihane graciously did while he was in New York -- went behind Minihane's back to shit all over him on some podcast. Carrabis' water boy Steve Perrault is about to discover that Minihane has eyes and ears everywhere. Earlier on the podcast, Minihane takes a trip into his producers' early careers: Steve Robinson as a stand up comedian and Blind Mike as the operator of a legendary Twitter account and sometimes podcast guest. Minihane reacts to CNN's LGBTQ town hall. The crew tallies how many states have been prank called by the Minifans. Plus: Rich Kelleher scores a victory and some very bad news for Dave Cullinane.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
