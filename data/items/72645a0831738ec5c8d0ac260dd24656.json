  "description": "<p>What should you do if your daughter just wants to have fun-- hanging out at her wealthy boyfriend's house instead of yours?  Music icon Cyndi Lauper and Tig answer that,  plus give advice to a woman who lost her mother's diamond decades ago and wonders if she should confess now. Cyndi also admits she sometimes pretends she's someone else when spotted by a fan in public, and Tig tries to help Cyndi figure out which celebrities are in her cell phone under coded initials.</p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Betterhelp Online Counseling (betterhelp.com/Tig), Indeed (indeed.com/tig), Storyblocks (storyblocks.com/tig), and Sakara (sakara.com/dontask and use code: dontask20).</p>\n<p>Need advice?  Submit your question for Tig at dontasktig.org/contact.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
