  "description": "<p>Karen Kilgariff, comedian and co-host of the wildly popular podcast My Favorite Murder, talks to her pal Tig about what she thinks fuels true crime obsession, and they trade stories on lessons their mothers taught them that they fully believe continue to save their lives to this day. Tig and Karen also advise a listener at the end of their rope because their partner ignores any recommendations they share about books and entertainment, and together they brainstorm snappy comebacks for a pioneer reality tv star whose onscreen past keeps coming back to haunt them. </p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Betterhelp (go to Betterhelp.com/TIG for 10% off the first month of online therapy), Shopify (go to Shopify.com/TIG for a free 14-day trial and full access to Shopifyâ€™s suite of features), Macys (go to Macys.com/purpose to celebrate Pride month), Truebill (go to Truebill.com/TIG and start canceling today), and eHarmony (go to eHarmony.com to start free today). </p>\n<p>Need advice?
