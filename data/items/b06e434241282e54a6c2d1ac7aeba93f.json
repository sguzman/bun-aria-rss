  "description": "<p>Adam Scott is a familiar face, having starred in some truly bingeable TV, including &ldquo;Parks and Rec,&rdquo; the cult-fave &ldquo;Party Down,&rdquo; &ldquo;Big Little Lies,&rdquo; and now the psychological thriller, &ldquo;Severance&rdquo; from Apple TV. Adam is one of those actors you feel like you know. But going into this conversation, Katie realized she didn&rsquo;t really know anything about him. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie and Adam talk about his cuss-loving hippie mom, his fondness for forts, and his youthful, almost delusional, drive to become an actor. They dive into the uncanny timeliness of &ldquo;Severance&rdquo; and also go back to Adam&rsquo;s youth and his Harrison Ford ah ha moment. No doubt, you&rsquo;ll come away loving Adam Scott just as much as you thought you did.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
