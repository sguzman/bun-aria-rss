  "description": "<p>As we develop our plans for the coming year, we dive into a discussion about our goals. This episode was recorded two weeks in advance, so it’s early in our planning process, but we already have some ideas forming. Our discussion includes how we each use Trello as an organisation tool; the value of clear mission statements; and the role of limiting beliefs (how much do we shape what’s possible through our beliefs about what is <em>impossible</em>?). Alice also shares her new system for checking whether commitments overlap, and we discuss the need to balance teaching with time spent developing our own work. Above all, we stress that this has to be personal for you and not based on what anyone else thinks. And finally to close the episode - and the year - Louise reflects on what she wants for her work, Alice stresses the importance of flexible goal-setting and we both wish you a very happy, creative and productive new year.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Best-Year-Ever-Artist-workbook-Art-Juice.pdf\">Best Art Year Ever download</a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
