  "description": "<p>This week, in Raeford, North Carolina, a family in crisis is the perfect prey for a predator, who moves in, and disrupts any potential harmony. When a 15 year old girl goes missing, she is considered a runaway, but when a close family member also disappears, it seems like a bigger picture is forming.  It all ends in a courtroom showdown with the death penalty in the balance.  There's a lot of crazy in this one!!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Along the way, we find out that turkey cooking is very competitive, that anyone who owns a nightclub is probably a dirtbag, and that when two bodies are buried in your yard... you are more than likely a murderer!!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New episodes every Thursday! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com & use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow us on... </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>twitter.com/@murdersmall </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>facebook.com/smalltownpod </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
