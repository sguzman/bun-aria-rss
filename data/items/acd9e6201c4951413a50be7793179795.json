NFL 100 QB's and we rank our personal top 10 QB's of all time post 1980 (13:24 - 28:44). Hot Seat/Cool Throne (28:44 - 41:20). NBA Champion Kendrick Perkins joins the show to talk about his twitter beefs, playing with KG, his sons spending 16,000 on his credit card in fortnite and being a center in today's league (41:20 - 82:16).
