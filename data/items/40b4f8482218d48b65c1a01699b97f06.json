  "description": "<p>Zac Amico told me some amazing stories about producing low budget horror movies. Zac is a hilarious comic and podcaster and he's also a producer of films for Troma, one of the greatest pulp horror makers of all time. We talked about the history of this kind of campy, low budget horror. Why they always seem to have ditzy bimbos. Where the ridiculous titles come from. All of it. Plus I did the intro from an abandoned cemetery for maximum effect.</p> <p>Watch Zac's horror podcast, <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE4LDP__k0GvtustV3x3uiQ\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zac Amico's Midnight Spookshow,.</a> catch him hosting Catalyst Wrestling or follow him on instagram at <a href=\"instagram.com/zacisnotfunny\">@ZacIsNotFunny</a>. I'd tell you to go watch his movie that he made, Shakespeare's Shitstorm, but the last screening happened on Friday so unless it becomes a cult classic, you're gonna have trouble watching it. But I heard it was really good.</p> <p>You can watch the entire podcast at <a href= \"youtube.com/arishaffir\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">YouTube.com/AriShaffir</a> if you want to see what monsters Zac and I actually look like. </p> <p>And please subscribe to my <a href=\"patreon.com/arishaffir\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patreon.com/AriShaffir</a> for bonus content, a way longer introduction to this episode, and really just o support me so I can keep doing the outsider stuff I like doing sometimes without having to worry about the financial impact it'll have on my life every time I lose all my sponsors just because I love crossing the line 3 times a year or so.</p> <p>Thank you to my sponsor, KushyDreams.com. They make great CBD smokeables that I actually love smoking myself. It gets you re-laaaaaaaaxed for real. Use promo code \"Ari\" for 20% off your first order.
