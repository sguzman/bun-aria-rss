  "description": "<p>On today's show, the boys chat about their respective weekends and Mitt waking Connor and his dog up at 4:45 in the morning on Friday night/Saturday morning after boozing with his buddies. They also chat about what shows they've been watching including the new Mighty Ducks series, the new Melissa McCarthy superhero movie, Gumpy is pumped Big Sky is returning, and whether or not Marvel fatigue is a real thing. They also get into the Pod FOD that addresses things like whether or not Connor is slowly transforming into Richard Jewell, stop lights for camels being installed in China, Gary Player's son being banned from the Masters, the new Kevin James/Sean Payton biopic that will inevitably stink, getting fired from&nbsp;various jobs, and how the movie theaters are once again, dead. Don't forget to subscribe to the Youtube channel to watch full episodes of the Pod and follow&nbsp;@ThePodPMI on Twitter and Instagram to send in your submissions to the Pod FOD. We appreciate you all for listening, we'll see you on Friday.</p>\n",
