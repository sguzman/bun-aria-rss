  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys are live from Canada and have a couple of incredible interviews. First, Super Bowl champion, 5x Pro Bowler, First Team All-Pro, one of the best RB's of all-time, Beast Mode, Marshawn Lynch makes his long overdue first appearance on the show. Pat and Marshawn chat about the fallout from the decision not to run the ball at the goal line in the Super Bowl and how it started the collapse of the Seahawks dynasty, his thoughts on current RB's in the league getting big money contracts, what he did growing up that prepared him for the NFL, and whether or not the Hall of Fame is something he has his eyes on (3:12-37:05). Next, 2x NBA MVP, 8x All-Star, 3x All-NBA First Team, 5x NBA assists leader, and member of the Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor, Canadian legend Steve Nash joins the show. They chat about his mentality towards the grind of an NBA season, what it was like playing with guys like Shaq, Kobe, and Dirk, and what he learned from guys like that, what he's currently doing with his media company, his relationship with Kevin Durant after serving as a consultant for the Warriors, and who he believes is the greatest NBA player of all-time (41:53-01:11:11). Pat and the guys also cover some NFL as they chat about Antonio Brown's newest drama with the Raiders and if the Chiefs are going to win the Super Bowl. They also recap their time in Canada and Pat previews a MASSIVE GIVEAWAY that will result in him giving away his Escalade to a fan who listens to the radio show every day next week (starting on 9/9). Today's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
