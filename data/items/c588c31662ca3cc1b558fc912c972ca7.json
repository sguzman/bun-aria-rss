  "description": "Do you like horses? How about dancing horses? If those words sound fun to you, you’ll be delighted to meet Amanda Kenny, the head horse trainer at Medieval Times in Lyndhurst New Jersey, where a surprisingly large chunk of the show focuses on elaborate dressage routines (that’s horse ballet, for you non-equestrians out there). Amanda tells Jordan what it’s like training steeds to jump and kick, training knights to ride, and dealing with the dirty side of the stables. \nThis episode is brought to you by Constant Contact.
