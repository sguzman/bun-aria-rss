  "description": "<p>Pat is in Orlando recording the show from his hotel room as he finds himself in his first full week as a WWE employee and the guys record a late, slap happy episode. They cover his travels down to Florida, his entire first day at the complex including commentating a dark match at the WWE NXT event, and him hitting a HUGE Frog Splash on a training dummy. They also cover Zion Williamson's shoe/knee exploding and whether or not it will affect Nike stock, some of the guys competing in a very hot and spicy chocolate eating contest, and break down the sale on St. Paddy's day shirts available now for 20% off (through Saturday at midnight) at store.PatMcAfeeShow.com. Also included are a couple of incredible interviews. First, 2nd round pick of the New England Patriots and Pat's teammate in Indianapolis, one of the smoothest athletes to ever play in the NFL, former defensive back, Darius Butler, joins the show. He and Pat chat about him being in the room with the owners when trying to end the Kaepernick situation, what he thinks about the way everything unfolded, what he's expecting from his new podcast, and he answers a few questions about Antonio Brown, one of his best friends (1:11:15-1:35:21). To close out the show, 7x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, former center for the New York Jets and hilarious human, Nick Mangold joins the show. He chats about what it was like playing for the Jets through the good and bad times, which version of Rex Ryan he prefers, what some of his hobbies are outside of football now that he's retired, some Ohio St. and Michigan rivalry stories, and whether or not he'll raise his son as a Jets fan (1:50:38-2:04:38). It's a hilarious one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
