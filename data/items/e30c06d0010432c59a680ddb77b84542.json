  "description": "<p>“TREAT YOURSELF LIKE YOU ARE SOMEONE RESPONSIBLE FOR HELPING.”<br />\nIt’s common for people to question why they are here. This question can lead to depression and a sense that the world is a terrible place. I’ve sure you’ve experienced that feeling, and you may even be going through it right now.<br />\nDuring these times you’ll commonly replay events in your life where you felt out of control or like everything was going wrong.<br />\nThat reaction comes from a lack of purpose and responsibility for yourself. You’re lacking the goals you need to feel complete.<br />\nInstead, start making a road map for your life: the things you want to achieve, the family you want to have, etc.<br />\nIt doesn’t have to be a perfect map. In fact, it won’t be. No one has the ultimate road map. But any direction is better than no direction. Without a start, you’re just going to stand there watching the world pass you by.<br />\nTo dive further into this I’ve brought in a special guest: Dr. Jordan Peterson.<br />\nDr. Peterson is a professor at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist and the author of the million-plus selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (Jan 2018, Penguin Books), which has been a Number 1 bestseller in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands and Brazil, and which is now slated to be translated into 40 languages.<br />\nHe has become super popular in the last two years for his lectures which he records and puts on YouTube.<br />\nI had such an interesting interview with him that had so much important information, I actually split it into two episodes.<br />\nIn this episode of The School of Greatness, we sit down and discuss why we admire sports figures, how any aim (even a bad one) is crucial for you to feel fulfilled, and a mindset tool you can use to motivate you to do hard things.<br />\nLearn how you can find the strength to live life you didn’t know you had, on Episode 664.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nHow do you embody something in a shift of view? (7:23)<br />\nWhy is there so much conflict in the world? (8:14)<br />\nA clear conscience is different than happiness? (11:06)<br />\nWhen we’re watching sports, what does it do for us? (15:51)<br />\nHow do you fix your past traumas you can’t let go of? (21:22)<br />\nWhat do you mean by being reasonable with your goals? (23:18)<br />\nWhy is it better to have a bad plan than to be in “No Man’s Land”? (27:15)<br />\nWhat are some examples of weaknesses people might have? (28:42)<br />\nWhat are three weaknesses, you know right now, you can still work on? (29:29)<br />\nDoes a rationale mean a meaning?
