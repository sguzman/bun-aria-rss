  "description": "<p>We first brought you Antonio’s story in June of 2018. At that time, Antonio was still missing. His case had gone from a missing person case, to an active homicide investigation, and back to a missing case again. Antonio’s mom was left in limbo, not knowing what had happened to her son. All she had were the strange stories coming from people who had been in the house with Antonio when he disappeared. Was it true that Antonio had stabbed Andrew in the neck, completely unprovoked, then ran out of the house, disappearing forever? Jenny never believed that this version of events was true, but there was no evidence to prove what had happened. Then, six months after our original episode aired, and more than two years after Antonio had vanished, people walking along the shore of Jetty Island made a gruesome discovery.</p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance and death of Antonio Neill, please contact the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office at 425-388-3393. Crime Stoppers is currently offering a $1000 reward for information on Antonio’s case.
