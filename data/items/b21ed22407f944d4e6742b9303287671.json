  "title": "Ep. 843 - Another Major Public School Sex Abuse Scandal",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as yet another sex abuse scandal engulfs yet another public school system, an NBC News op-ed argues that parents should stop involving themselves in educational matters. To intrude in the schools is like interfering with your child’s surgery, they say. It’s a terrible analogy but revealing. Speaking of NBC, an MSNBC reporter was caught following the Rittenhouse jury home after deliberations. What does it take to get a mistrial? And students at SLU have started a petition to stop me from speaking on campus. So I started my own petition to stop them from stopping me from speaking on campus. It’s the battle of the petition, and right now I’m winning in a landslide. \nSign The Petition To Keep Matt Walsh on Saint Louis University Campus: https://bit.ly/3Dzeu1f\nAndrew Klavan's latest novel When Christmas Comes is now available on Amazon.
