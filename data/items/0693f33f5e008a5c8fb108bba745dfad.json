First up, we have Ethan from Great American Ghost discussing keeping his band together and balancing real life/tour life.\n\nThen, I have Travis Tabron who used to sing for the band Varials. We recorded this before he left the band and in this chat, you can hear a little bit of his thought process behind him leaving the band (without me even knowing it!). We also discuss the Philly hardcore scene and why recording vocals is a really terrible experience.
