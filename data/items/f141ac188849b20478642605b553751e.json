  "description": "<p>Slim semimodular lattices} (for short, SPS lattices) and slim rectangular\nlattices (for short, SR lattices) were introduced by G. Gr\\\"atzer and E. Knapp\nin 2007 and 2009. These lattices are necessarily finite and planar, and they\nhave been studied in more then four dozen papers since 2007. They are best\nunderstood with the help of their $C_1$-diagrams, introduced by the author in\n2017. For a diagram $F$ of a finite lattice $L$ and a congruence $\\alpha$ of\n$L$, we define the ``quotient diagram'' $F/\\alpha$ by taking the maximal\nelements of the $\\alpha$-blocks and preserving their geometric positions. While\n$F/\\alpha$ is not even a Hasse diagram in general, we prove that whenever $L$\nis an SR lattice and $F$ is a $C_1$-diagram of $L$, then $F/\\alpha$ is a\n$C_1$-diagram of $L/\\alpha$, which is an SR lattice or a chain. The class of\nlattices isomorphic to the congruence lattices of SPS lattices is closed under\ntaking filters. We prove that this class is closed under two more\nconstructions, which are inverses of taking filters in some sense; one of the\ntwo respective proofs relies on an inverse of the quotient diagram\nconstruction.\n</p>",
