  "description": "<p>An absolutely epic and history making day 5 of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is in the books with so many medals coming our way (for Australia, sorry Canada) that we barely know where to start! We talk up just how Tasmania is higher on the medal tally than most nations, and just how they are comparing to Canada right now. We also find out just how good rowing is and why it deserved more attention than it got. We also celebrate queen Penny Oleksiak and her history making day for Canadian Olympic history, bring you some epic badminton commentary and see if we can actually agree today on an athlete of the day. It's all here on a massively golden day at the 2020 Olympics!</p>",
