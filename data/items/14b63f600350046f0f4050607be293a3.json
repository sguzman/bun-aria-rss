  "description": "Lily tells Elizabeth she feels old compared to her university friends. None of them have lived or worked with a partner.  But mainly she feels unmoored – she and Russ had been together for so long.  Elizabeth convinces Lily to go to the Bull quiz with her and Freddie; Lily won’t feel unmoored there.  The ‘Quizzie Lizzies’ come second in the quiz and Lily admits to Elizabeth that she did the right thing making her come. She’s had a lovely evening.\nSusan gossips with Tracy about the broken Jack Woolley memorial window and wonders if it was vandals.  Susan says Tracy looks terrible and should take the night off, but Tracy’s counting the pennies and can’t afford to miss a shift at the Bull.  Tracy tells Susan that Chelsea went to her appointment with the Pregnancy Advisory Service today on her own.  They debate Chelsea’s choices and Tracy says she’ll respect Chelsea’s decision, whatever it is.  Later at the Bull, Susan buys Tracy a drink.  When Kenton sees Tracy drinking he wonders whether it’s wise, with her being pregnant.  Susan asks what he means, and Kenton explains that Jolene told him and he thought it was common knowledge. Tracy says she should’ve known word would get out and presumes it was due to Natasha seeing her at the baby clinic.  Later Susan wants to know why Tracy doesn’t put a stop to the rumour.  Tracy explains it’s because she doesn’t want Chelsea to be the subject of gossip.  So if people want to believe false rumours about Tracy, let them.",
