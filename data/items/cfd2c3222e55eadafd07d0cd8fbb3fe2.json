  "description": "The Biden Administration is working hard to maintain a fairly traditional front for US-Israel relations during the current crisis. Which is to say they are essentially following the playbook the Obama Administration would have followed (Trump's bromance with Bibi was an outlier). But times are changing, the views of Democrats are changing, the generational outlook is changing, and don't forget Bibi's bromance with Trump which did not help matters. We discuss what could trigger a change with former top Israeli diplomat and foreign policy specialist Alon Pinkas, the American Enterprise Institute's Kori Schake and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
