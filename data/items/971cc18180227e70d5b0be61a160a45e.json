  "description": "<div>Fam! We're super excited to share this episode of \"Strange and Unexplained\" with the TCO fam. I (Patrick) helped research and write this episode and it tells two stories I've been OBSESSED with for decades. As the title says, these two stories are about two really important people who were hiding in plain sight. Amazingly, they lived about a hundred years apart in time, but only a few blocks apart in geography. One was a prominent member of society, the other a marginalized group. And they both had a secret they desperately wanted to keep. <br>\n<br>\nIf you're looking for more stories like these, find and follow \"Strange and Unexplained With Daisy Eagan\" wherever you get your podcasts. </div>\n",
