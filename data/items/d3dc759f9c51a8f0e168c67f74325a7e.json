  "description": "Scientists are still racing to learn more about Omicron and how the seemingly highly infectious variant will impact this holiday season, and one man in Italy tried to dodge his Covid vaccine by wearing a fake arm to his appointment. Next, in his latest edition of “Cyborgasm,” Stephen Colbert examines the U.S. military’s decision to test robotic tanks while New Zealand urges the world to ban the deployment of killer robots. Jennifer Lawrence stops by to talk about her new film, “Don’t Look Up,” crack some jokes about what she did during her time off from Hollywood, and to reminisce with Stephen about their hilarious rum-fueled 2018 interview on The Late Show.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
