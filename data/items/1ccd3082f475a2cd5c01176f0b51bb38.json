  "description": "<p>Steve ruins today's show because he was more interested in lounging around in his PJs and eating like a pig than finding the right audio equipment. Joe Zarbano, the weasel who rode Kirk's coattails from lowly weekend producer to the lofty role of programming director at WEEI, has \"resigned\" - a.k.a. was thrown out on his ass (0:15:30). The guys ponder what could have been at Boston's other sports station if management had some balls (0:31:30). Kirk decides he will finally watch Tom Brady play football this season (0:58:00). Parler is down, but not out, and every Internet platform, from Spotify to Patreon, is reckoning in its own way with the new era of censorship (1:04:00). Kirk and Steve continue their South Carolina adventure for The Case: Season One.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
