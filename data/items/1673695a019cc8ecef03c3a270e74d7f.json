  "description": "<p>Jerry Saltz, perhaps the most well-known art writer working today, has been the senior art critic of <em>New York</em> magazine since 2006. During this interview with our host Charlotte Burns, which was recorded in the downtown offices of <em>New York</em> magazine, Saltz talks about a range of topics: from how he approaches viewing and reviewing art, to what he calls the “ass-holeness” of his social media persona. </p> <p>Before becoming a critic, Saltz was an artist and a long-distance truck driver, and he discusses the benefits of being a late-bloomer. He defines what great art means to him and describes a recent exhibition of work by an artist who could be the “strongest to emerge this century in America.\" We are, he says, “living in a crisis and it’s time to look at the art of the present. I want to see what artists say now.”</p> <p>Transcript: <a href= \"http://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-jerry-saltz/\">http://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-jerry-saltz/</a></p> <p>“In Other Words” is a presentation of AAP and Sotheby’s, produced by Audiation.fm.</p>",
