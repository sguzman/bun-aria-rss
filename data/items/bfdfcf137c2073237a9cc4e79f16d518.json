  "title": "BONUS 20 - The Demonic Possession of Anneliese Michel 1 of 2",
  "description": "<p>Anneliese Michel would die in a small, German town on July 1st, 1976. The official cause of death? Malnutrition and dehydration. But why did she stop eating? Mental illness? She’d seen a plethora of doctors for years, none of whom could determine, beyond epilepsy, exactly what was wrong. Brain scans revealed nothing abnormal. Why was she hearing voices? Was she simply suffering from a mental illness local doctors just weren’t knowledgeable enough to identify and treat? If so, how does mental illness explain others watching her eyes turn black and her hands turning into claws? Was something other than illness attacking her mind and body? Something not of this world? Something evil? We set this stage for both scientific and spiritual possibilities in part one of a two part dark and disturbing edition of Timesuck. </p>\n<p>Wanna donate and help the homeless?
