    "media:description": "On October 7, Bloomberg reported that an unnamed U.S. official revealed that the U.S. has been conducting various military simulations to prevent the Chinese Communist Party or the CCP from invading Taiwan by force and that the White House is even planning an emergency response plan for TSMC.\nPresident Tsai Ing-wen also expressed her great concern for Taiwan's semiconductor industry during her National Day speech on October 10 in the Republic of China, \"the concentration of the semiconductor sector in Taiwan is not a risk\", she said.\nWe agree with the view that if China were to invade Taiwan and create a war, perhaps the biggest concern would not be the chips, but the collapse of the world order.\n\nHave questions?
