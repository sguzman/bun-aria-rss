    "media:description": "Using free software Gimp, we can combine photos with different exposure levels to be able to see details in both bright and dark areas, even in scenes with extreme contrasts in light. This is sometimes called exposure blending, and in this video we will take a look at how to do it using brushes and masks.\n\nGIMP is 100% free and open source software that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac.\n\nAdobe Photoshop is a heavily marketed proprietary software that runs on Windows and Mac.\n\nBoth are professorial level programs and achieved a similar looking cropped image in a comparable amount of time.\n\nLearn more about GIMP:\nhttps://www.gimp.org/\nhttps://tjfree.com/gimp/ \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqazFFzUAPc4vITMJaF3Fnqh3pccSMnC4\n\nSubscribe for more Free Software info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/tjfree?sub_confirmation=1\n\nI'd love to connect with you on these socials:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itstjfree\nhttps://www.instagram.com/itstjfree\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/itstjfree\nhttps://twitter.com/itstjfree\n\nVisit my Website for Free Software Reviews and Tutorials:\nhttps://tjfree.com/\n\n#GIMP #freesoftware",
