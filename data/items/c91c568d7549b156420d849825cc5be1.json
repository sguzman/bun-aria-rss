  "description": "Not every great pop song has a standard format or even a chorus. Today on The Gist, Chris Molanphy joins us to look at the changing placement of the chorus in popular music. He writes Slate’s Why Is That Song No. 1 column. For the Spiel, Mike eats at the pop-up restaurant WastED.\n\nAt the very end of this show, we debut a new They Might Be Giants song, as part of their Dial-a-Song reboot, as we will be doing every Monday this year. You can find videos for the songs on the band’s website. This one is called “Unpronounceable.”\n\nToday’s sponsor: Stamps.com.
