  "description": "He was known simply as the Blind Traveler. A solitary, sightless adventurer, James Holman (1786-1857) fought the slave trade in Africa, survived a frozen captivity in Siberia, hunted rogue elephants in Ceylon, helped chart the Australian outback—and circumnavigated the globe, becoming one of the greatest wonders of the world he so explored.<br /><br />Today I'm talking with Jason Roberts,  author of one of my all-time favorite history books: A Sense of the World: How a Blind Man Became History's Greatest Traveler. We get into all the impossible-to-believe stories that come from Holman's life, including:<br /><br />-- Holman retraining his senses to use echolocation to “see” the world around him through sight and touch<br />- -Summiting Mt. Vesuvius as it was on the brink of eruption<br />-- Riding horses at full gallop<br />-- Negotiating peace between the British navy and islanders in Equatorial Guinea",
