  "description": "<p>Chances are that you bought something recently, or maybe you paid a friend- but you likely didn’t do that with physical cash, you probably did it via a digital payment online or with an app like Venmo or the Cash app. Everything is going digital these days and this presents a whole host of issues: we know how to keep people from stealing money out of our wallets and purses, but what about the money we have in our accounts online? Our guest today is Carole Theriault and she knows a thing or two about internet security. Carole founded the Sophos Naked Security site years ago and now co-hosts the podcast “Smashing Security”. She lives and breathes cybersecurity and we are so glad she’s with us today to talk about protecting our identity and ultimately, our money!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Duh! Snake Blood by Dssolvr.
