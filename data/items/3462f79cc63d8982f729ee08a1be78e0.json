  "title": "115 - Hatfield-McCoy Feud",
  "description": "<p>The Hatfields and the McCoys repeatedly attacked one another in the rural Tug River Valley separating West Virginia and Kentucky for over a decade in the late 19th century. Two patriarchs - Devil Anse Hatfield and Ol’ Randall McCoy - let their hatred of one another infect first their entire families and then an entire region of the country. Governor pitted against governor. West Virginia versus Kentucky. The Supreme court of the United States would end up getting involved. So how did it all start? How did it finally end? And how much blood was shed in between. The origins and the dirty deeds of America’s most famous feud revealed on today’s Timesuck. </p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you today by <strong>Eero!</strong> Never think about Wifi again.
