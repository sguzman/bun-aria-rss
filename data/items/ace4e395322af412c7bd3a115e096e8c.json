    "media:description": "Why does Prusa have meetings with the Voron team? Could it be that Prusa is leveraging the Voron project as a means to generate sales and attack their perceived enemies without appearing to be the driving force behind it all?\n\nBefore anyone actually says it. I know what your criticism is going to be \"Dude, Prusa does not control Voron. They are just a friendly open source company being nice to another open source project.\" My answer is this: Why doesn't the Ratrig have a vocal and toxic group of fanboys? Why isn't Ratrig meeting with Prusa and bragging about it while sucking up to Prusa on Twitter? Who are the team members designing Voron printers? Why did they decide to make the Switchwire and the Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder? Everyone knows that bed slingers are inferior to CoreXY, and everyone knows just how dysfunctional the MMU2 is. Why would the Voron team waste their time copying faulty flawed and otherwise bad designs when they already had a killer portfolio of CoreXY designs? The obvious answer is because they are being manipulated by Prusa to make Prusa's products look better in comparison. \n\nThe thumbnail reference: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/under%20someone%27s%20heel",
