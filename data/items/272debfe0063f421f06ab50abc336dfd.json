  "description": "<p>In this passage, the prophet Micah predicts the coming of the Messiah. What's intriguing about this Messiah is that on the one hand, he’s from of old. But on the other hand, he’s coming in the future. In this sermon, we will ask: 1) What does it mean that Jesus is the ancient King? 2) What does it mean that Jesus is the future King? 3) How we can make him our King?</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 16, 2007. Series: Jesus of the Prophets. Scripture: Micah 5:1-6.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
