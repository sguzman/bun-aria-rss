  "description": "Santa baby, I want a yacht, and really...that's not a lot\nDo you guys smell that? It's the smell of spilled spiked egg nog because you decided to go through your boyfriend's phone when you guys were supposed to be watching Charlie Brown's Christmas Special! Yes...it's the holidays Sloots. And per usual, with the holidays comes a whole lot of fuckery. Gift giving, more importantly: gift receiving, being forced to go to your Aunt Shirley's house who you hate - all wholesome activities that'll really put you in the holiday spirit, right? Luckily, Sofia is here to coach you every step of the way this holiday season with a VERY in-depth gift guide suitable for ALL budgets. In this episode, you'll find out who deserves a gift, who doesn't, and how much you should (or shouldn't) spend. Aside from helping you figure out which Old Navy cardigan you should get your boyfriend, Sofia then unpacks the overlooked beauty that is being talked through an orgasm. It's a real art form that you NEED to implement into your sex life. And if you don't have an active sex life, we have a Tik Tok for you that will give the same effect to you and your womanizer toy. Lastly, we have a special appearance from Sofia's younger brother Lucas, and there's also a prank call live on air? Clearly, things are a little unhinged around here, but it's the season of giving so who cares! Eggnog shots anyone?\nPSA: NEW HOLIDAY MERCH AVAILABLE NOW.
