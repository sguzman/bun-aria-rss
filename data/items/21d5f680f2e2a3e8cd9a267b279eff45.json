His name is <a href=\"https://theserendipitymindset.com/\">Christian Busch</a> and he's a professor of economics and entrepreneurship and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0818ZH58R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0818ZH58R&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Serendipity Mindset: The Art and Science of Creating Good Luck</em></a>. We begin our conversation with what serendipity is, and how it's different than simple chance, and is instead a kind of smart luck, which requires acting on the unexpected and connecting the dots of seemingly random events. We then discuss the three types of serendipity, the obstacles to experiencing this force, and how the amount of  serendipity you experience depends on how you frame the world. Christian explains how to develop a serendipity-seeking mindset, including how to intentionally seed triggers for it. We end our conversation with how organizations and not just individuals can take steps to strategically leverage the power of serendipity. </p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/serendipity\">aom.is/serendipity</a>.</p>\n",
