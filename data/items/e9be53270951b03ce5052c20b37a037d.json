One thing they all have in common is a component of insulin dysregulation. Take that into account with the fact that 90% of people who have insulin resistance are going to the doctor and remaining undiagnosed. Why then, are we testing everything but insulin?

Backed by years of research, Dr. Bikman’s mission is to help the world appreciate the prevalence and relevance of insulin resistance. He is the author of the book, <em>Why We Get Sick</em>, which offers a thought-provoking yet real solution to insulin resistance and reversing pre-diabetes, improving brain function, shedding fat, and preventing diabetes.
