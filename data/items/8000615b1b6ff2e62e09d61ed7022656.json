Food has the power to prevent and reverse disease; there can be so many powerful (and delicious) benefits waiting for you in each bite. There are powerful compounds in foods—like curcumin, genistein, catechins, lycopene, resveratrol, quercetin—that have medicinal impacts on the body. By keeping flavor and health benefits on the same parallel, we can feed the body, mind, and soul with each well-planned bite.</p><br><p>In this minisode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Chef David Bouley and Dr. William Li about how we can cook our way out of illness by aligning our foods to feed our health and get incredible flavor and variety all at once.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Among many accolades, Chef David Bouley earned several four-star reviews in <em>The New York Times</em>; seven James Beard Foundation awards for best restaurant and best chef; he was named “Best Chef in America” by <em>Herald-Tribune</em>; he received the TripAdvisor Traveler’s Choice Awards “The Best Restaurant in the United States” and #14 in the world; a 29 out of 30 rating in Zagat, and ranked #1 in New York City for many years. Chef Bouley is known as one of the most health-conscious chefs in the world, with a strong focus for diners with health concerns. He is currently contracted for a new book, <em>Living Pantry</em>, that will provide the building blocks for home cooking to deliver great taste and health benefits with easy execution.</p><br><p>William Li, MD, is a world-renowned physician, scientist, speaker, and author of <em>Eat to Beat Disease: The New Science of How Your Body Can Heal Itself</em>. He is best known for leading the Angiogenesis Foundation. His groundbreaking work has impacted more than 70 diseases including cancer, diabetes, blindness, heart disease, and obesity. His TED Talk, “Can We Eat to Starve Cancer?” has garnered more than 11 million views.
