  "description": "“Don’t give up the ship!” \nThis is the story of the first two years of the War of 1812, and it seems quite backwards. Despite expectations, the Americans are trying and failing (miserably) to invade Canada. The only thing more confusing is that the US Navy is holding its own against the British on the high seas ... well, at first, that is. Several major events happen in these two years: Indian coalition leader Tecumseh makes his last stand; the USS Constitution earns an enduring nickname; and the US Navy acquires a new saying that will stick with it through the centuries: “don’t give up the ship!” In short: welcome to the War of 1812.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
