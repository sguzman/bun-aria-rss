  "description": "In Episode #230, I’m joined by ecologist Nicholas Carter to examine the role of dairy and other animal foods on the environment. We discuss the implications of our food choices, detailing the impact of dairy specifically. Nicholas Carter breaks down the ways we measure environmental impact, and the strengths and shortfalls of these systems. We also cover “carbon neutral” dairy, regenerative grazing, biodiversity loss, and much more.\nOver the course of recent episodes, we’ve worked towards building a more comprehensive picture of the topics covered. Alongside some incredible guests, we’ve covered the theory, mechanisms, and implementation of exercise, and this episode we continue building out this broader view with dairy. In Episode #225, Dr Alan Flanagan honed in on the health implications of dairy. Today, I sit down with Nicholas Carter to examine the planetary effects of dairy production and consumption, helping you make more informed decisions in support of sustainability.\n\nSpecifically, we discuss:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nWhat Causes Climate Change (2:22)\n\nAgriculture Today vs in the Past (7:06)\n\nBiodiversity Loss (11:28)\n\nIncentives for Sustainability (17:26)\n\nCattle Grazing & Wildfires (25:15)\n\nRed Meat & Dairy (28:40)\n\nGlobal Dairy Production (30:55)\n\nMyths about Regenerative Agriculture (36:03)\n\nComparing Sheep/Cow Milk (45:46)\n\n‘Carbon Neutral’ Dairy (47:35)\n\nMilk Substitutions (58:50)\n\nPrecision Fermentation (1:06:36)\n\nDiet for Planetary Health (1:10:22)\n\nFuture of Food (1:16:23)\n\nOutro (1:22:12)\n\n\nTo connect with or reach out to Nicholas Carter, you can find him on Twitter and Instagram.
