  "description": "It's the final Monday Night Football game of 2020 and the final NFL recap of the year on the Pick Six podcast. The Bills showed the Patriots why they deserved to steal the AFC East crown in a 38-9 victory, as Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech offer their reactions. Cam Newton was benched but that may have not been the biggest revelation about the former MVP on Monday. The guys break down his insane daily routine as well as New England's poor performance. On the other side, Josh Allen proved once again why he could still be a value MVP pick, Stefon Diggs showed that he's a top 5 WR in football and the Bills displayed why they could be the Chiefs biggest obstacle in their quest for a repeat.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @johnbreech, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
