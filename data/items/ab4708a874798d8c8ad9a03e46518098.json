  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Codie & Tony are absent, busy with their holiday going-ons while Avery attempts to throw in a few more episodes before the year (AND decade) ends. He's joined by the World Champion of Frederick, Maryland himself, Patrick McGuire of \"History Things with Pat\", to discuss one of the most appalling battles of World War I: Passchendaele. Known for it's thick rains and death-dealing mud, the battlefield of Passchendaele was one of the most heart-wrenching and horrific settings for the British Expeditionary Force during the First World War, especially for the Canadian and ANZAC forces that also participated in the battle. Avery & Pat also discuss the upcoming war film \"1917\" and speculate how Passchendaele could tie into it, considering that the battle took place that year. Enjoy & Happy Holidays!</p>",
