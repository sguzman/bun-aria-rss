  "description": "<p>Sutton continues to shake up Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in the best way, affording us one of the funniest episodes in ages.  Basically, she makes Teddi cry at Kyle's dinner party, and we all rejoice.  But it's really a drunk, stoned Mauricio who steals the show (not to mention Faye Resnick captivated by an edible flower).  Also major props to Aaron, whose conspiracy theories about nuclear energy, cancer, and his ACL elevate this hilarious dinner party.<br />\nFun fact:  you can watch us recap this episode with Crappens on Demand here:  https://www.patreon.com/posts/crappens-on-1215-36582693<br />\n<br /><hr /><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p></p>\n",
