We talk about how to run a large scale business that relies on sourcing and how you protect the brands flavor integrity for the future.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about empty bottles.\n\nWhat game show would you want to be a contestant on?\n\nHow did you get into this business?\n\nWhat was the first step to start a spirits business?\n\nHow did you raise capital to make this happen?\n\nTell us about your brands.\n\nDid you have a proof of concept?\n\nHow do you select a distillation partner?\n\nTalk about the competitiveness of the sourced market.\n\nTell us about the pricing of sourced whiskey.\n\nHow do you differentiate your products?\n\nWhy 93 proof?\n\nHow do you get a brand to market?\n\nAny states you've seen success in that you didn't expect?\n\nWhich is a better ROI, liquor stores or bars/restaurants?\n\nDo you experience any frustrations with acquiring packaging materials?\n\nAny other frustrations with the business?\n\nSupport this Podcast on Patreon",
