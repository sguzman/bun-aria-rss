  "itunes:summary": "The dissonance of democracy; sum of an irreducibly complex combination of notes. We attune, celebrate, make difference audible, amplify disobedience, choreograph dissonance, enact alternative rituals and harmonies, open new horizons of possibility. \n\nToday on the podcast we revisit Mono-Poly-June with a Japanese ghost story told by Amy May Stuart, a performance of improvised violin by Lily Tait, and a selection of poems from Ender Başkan.\n\nLive on air, online and irl a program of live performances, radio plays, spoken words, archive recordings, and meta-mixes was broadcast in collaboration with Crawl Space Radio, an artist-led experiment in techno-institutional broadcasting from Samm Sutton and Lucy Dodd.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/mono-poly-june\n\nMono-Poly-June\n02 June 2022\nCrawl Radio, Padre Coffee, Collingwood Yards\nPresented by Liquid Architecture and Create Yarra\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
