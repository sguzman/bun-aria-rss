  "description": "<p>When we think about defining our career it is easy to get confined by an existing structure. What if we could breakaway and start to design our own career? This is what this book is about. &nbsp;&nbsp;‘The Squiggly Career’ by {insert names} describes that by taking advantage of 5 key career skills, you can put yourself in a position to start designing your own career. These 5 are: &nbsp;1️⃣ Super Strengths &nbsp;2️⃣ Values &nbsp;3️⃣ Confidence &nbsp;&nbsp;4️⃣ Networks &nbsp;5️⃣ Future Possibilities &nbsp;The book is interactive. When you read through the book there are exercises that provide supplementation to the ideas in the book and make you more involved in the reading process. 📚 &nbsp;Honestly, I don’t think this book is aimed at me. As I have only been in the working world for 4 years and looking to start my own business, I have a clear goal on my future as I have used the principles laid out in this book before such as vision boards etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;That is not to say the book doesn’t have value! For anyone that is looking to create a new career for themselves, regardless of their experience, this book is definitely for you. The interactive nature of the book makes it easy to digest and makes you engrain the ideas into practise which is the most important thing. If you fall into this category then I would definitely recommend this book for you. 👍</p>\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
