  "description": "Julius Robinson had killed for revenge before, and so when his sister was brutally murdered in her sleep last year, he says he planned to \"get\" the killer. He felt like his family expected him to get revenge, because that's what he'd always done, both in and out of prison. But when he learned that the killer was actually his 17-year-old nephew, he struggled against his family's expectations and his own.\nMusic by Elephant Micah.\nSay hello on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
