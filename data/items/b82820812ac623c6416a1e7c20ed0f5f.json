  "description": "<p>Establishing the limiting distribution of Chatterjee's rank correlation for a\ngeneral, possibly non-independent, pair of random variables has been eagerly\nawaited to many. This paper shows that (a) Chatterjee's rank correlation is\nasymptotically normal as long as one variable is not a measurable function of\nthe other, (b) the corresponding asymptotic variance is uniformly bounded by\n36, and (c) a consistent variance estimator exists. Similar results also hold\nfor Azadkia-Chatterjee's graph-based correlation coefficient, a multivariate\nanalogue of Chatterjee's original proposal. The proof is given by appealing to\nH\\'ajek representation and Chatterjee's nearest-neighbor CLT.\n</p>",
