Time stamps for each boss are listed below.\n\nThis channel features instructional & highly edited video game guides, walkthroughs, speedruns and other uniquely transformative videos.  My own personal gameplay, extensive editing & creative input are clearly added into each video, ensuring that all videos adhere to YouTube's partner program guidelines.  My walkthoughs take tremendous amounts of work & editing so that all videos are straight to the point & can be used as professional video game guides.  I have spent thousands of hours practicing & mastering games before recording to ensure the highest quality gameplay possible.  All gameplay is my own & is recorded and edited solely by me.
