  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our Trailblazer episodes continue this week with Jeannie Lin, one of the first authors to write historical romance featuring Asian characters set in Asia. Her debut romance, <em>Butterfly Swords</em>, is set in Tang Dynasty China. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In this episode, we talk about the craft of romance, about preparing for and resisting rejection while finding her own path to publication, about how she honed her storytelling, and about the way cultural archetypes find their way to the page. We also talk about the lightning fast changes in romance over the last twelve years.
