  "description": "The U.S. Senate, not recently known for its courage or willingness to stand up to President Donald Trump, sent the entire Trump Administration an acid rebuke on Thursday when it voted to stop funding for U.S. support of the War in Yemen and passed a resolution declaring that Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  At the same time, reports appeared that suggested it the Mueller probe will soon dig deeper into Gulf efforts to manipulate the Trump administration.  For Gulf allies who rejoiced when Barack Obama left office thinking that was a low point in the relationship, what's ahead will likely be much, much worse.  David Sanger of the New York Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund discuss with host David Rothkopf.
