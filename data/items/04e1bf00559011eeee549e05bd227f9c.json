  "description": "Kindness and empathy are loaded propositions right now. When you hear those words, you might think: Eh, those are soft skills that won’t help me get ahead. Or: If I’m too nice, I will get trampled. Or: I need my anger to be effective. Or: I am plenty nice -- it’s other people who need to up their game. My guest today will push back on all of these reservations, and tell us how -- and why -- to, as he says, “hack your empathy.” Jamil Zaki is a psychologist and director of the Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab. He wrote a book called, The War for Kindness. In this conversation, we talk about how our modern culture is suffering from an “empathy deficit”; why he believes selfishness is a sickness; how to avoid empathy burnout; and the academic criticism that empathy is actually an outmoded and unreliable human capacity.\nWhere to find Jamil Zaki online:\nWebsite: https://www.warforkindness.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zakijam\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/warforkindness/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/warforkindness/\nFull shownotes and list of other resources mentioned: https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/jamil-zaki-298\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
