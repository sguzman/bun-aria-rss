  "title": "Marc Lavoie, “Post-Keynesian Economics: New Foundations” (Edward Elgar, 2014)",
  "description": "This interview is a conversation with the author, Marc Lavoie, and his colleague Dany Lang. We discuss Post-Keynesian Economics: New Foundations (Edward Elgar, 2014) and Marc’s contribution to the heterodox-mainstream debate in economics. The book provides an exhaustive account of post-Keynesian economics and of the developments that have occurred in post-Keynesian theory and in the world economy over the last twenty years. Topics covered include open-economy issues, the methodological foundations of heterodox economics, consumer theory, firms and pricing, money and credit, effective demand and employment, inflation theory, and growth theories. The interview focuses on the introductory chapter, making the conversation accessible also to an audience of non-economists. The book has been awarded the 2017 Myrdal Prize by EAEPE, the European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy, ex aequo with Wolfram Elsner, Torsten Heinrich, Henning Schwardt, The Microeconomics of Complex Economies, Evolutionary, Institutional, Neoclassical, and Complexity Perspectives.\n\n\n\nAndrea Bernardi is Senior Lecturer in Employment and Organization Studies at Oxford Brookes University in the UK. He holds a doctorate in Organization Theory from the University of Milan, Bicocca. He has held teaching and research positions in Italy, China and the UK. Among his research interests are the use of history in management studies, the co-operative sector, and Chinese co-operatives. His latest project is looking at health care in rural China. He is the co-convener of the EAEPE’s permanent track on Critical Management Studies.\n\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
