The selection is quite biased, limited, and subjective, but it&rsquo;s meant to complement the other classes at the summer school.</p>\n<p>The slides are likely to grow, so in case of doubt, check for updates. Comments are most welcome. And yes, it&rsquo;s a horribly incomplete overview, due to space and time constraints.</p>",
