The overlook effect(OE) seems to be something out of the emergingspace age. However, it has been around as long asproto-humans first lived in trees. The OE is a keyaspect of general relativity, not related to speciousGeneral Relativity. Our survival depends partly onunderstanding the real OE in our modern world.\n  \n   "
