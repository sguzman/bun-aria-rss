  "title": "Cookbook Author Yasmin Khan on Her Latest Journey",
  "description": "Author Yasmin Khan has carved out a very specific space for herself in the world of cookbooks and produced a body of work that goes well beyond the sharing of recipes. Thanks to her intrepid nature and in-person reporting, Yasmin’s books are culinary and cultural postcards from parts of the world shaped by history, politics, and strife—but lots of humanity. Her latest book is 'Ripe Figs: Recipes and Stories from Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus' and it’s a heartfelt follow-up to her first two books, 'The Saffron Tales' and 'Zaitoun.' \n\nYasmin joins host Kerry Diamond to talk about 'Ripe Figs,' the recipes she loves from the book, and the work that went into producing it. Yasmin also discusses the recent Vogue.com article she wrote about miscarriage, and her experience with miscarriage while working on her book.",
