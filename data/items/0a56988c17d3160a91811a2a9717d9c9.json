  "description": "<p>On this episode, Mandii sits down with a couple who has joined the swinger lifestyle. The group discuss the Future debacle that swept social media this last week and then dig into the juicy stuff. The kink of the week involves the conversation around identifying as a straight male who is curious and sexually aroused by transgenders and this leads into a threesome story with a cross dresser. The couple then breaks down how they have managed to successfully maintain a happy, healthy relationship while bringing others into their bedroom and couple swapping.
