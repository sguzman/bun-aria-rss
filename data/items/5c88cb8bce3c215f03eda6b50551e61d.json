  "description": "<p>Fort Edmonton is a settlement that dates back to the true beginnings of Canada becoming an official country and to Alberta becoming a province. It moved many times and witnessed much history. It played a key role in history with both European settlers and the natives that lived on the land. Is this why its current location at Fort Edmonton Park seems to have unexplained activity? Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Fort Edmonton. Moment in Oddity features Legos washing up in Cornwall and This Day in History features Nellie Bly's historic trip around the world! Also included is a brief interview with Julie Rathsack of Ghosts of Grand Rapids about her personal true ghost experiences and more information on the Ada Witch. We announce our Design Contest as well and share listener mail and comments!</p> <p>*Special note: The last 10 minutes of the show is a bit tinny sounding.
