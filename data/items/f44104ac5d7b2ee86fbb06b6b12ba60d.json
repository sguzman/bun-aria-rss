If so, you may have unintentionally roused the ire of a certain \"Mr. Frederick Krueger.\" While a horrific death may be in your future, we offer the following option: propose a mutually-agreed-upon sexual romp with Freddy in exchange for your soul. While an orifice or two may be extremely sore the next morning, it may just save your life.\n\nFollow Trixie: @TrixieMattel\nFollow Katya: @Katya_Zamo\n\nTo watch the podcast on YouTube: http://bit.ly/TrixieKatyaYT\n\n\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the podcast for free wherever you're listening or by using this link: http://bit.ly/baldandthebeautifulpodcast\n\n\nIf you want to support the show, and get all the episodes ad-free go to https://thebaldandthebeautiful.supercast.com/\n\n\nIf you like the show, telling a friend about it would be amazing!
