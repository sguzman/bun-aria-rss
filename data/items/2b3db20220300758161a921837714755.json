We spent some quality time with Dinan BMW 1 Series M along with the new 2014 Subaru WRX.  We compare said WRX to Thad's modified Fiesta ST and follow it up with a little talk about the street racing scene in Compton.  While in Compton Zack and Thad were likely filmed by the new drone overlords of the LA Count Sheriff's Department.  All that and a little insight into the fraternity life of those that partook.</p><p> </p>\n",
