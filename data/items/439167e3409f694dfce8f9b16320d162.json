  "description": "<p>September 18th, 2009. Farmville, Virginia. Kathleen Wells hadn’t heard from her daughter, Melanie, for a few days and was worried. Melanie was staying in Virginia with her friend Emma Neiderbrock. Whenever Kathleen called Emma’s home, Richard McCroskey, Emma’s boyfriend, answered the phone and told various stories about where Melanie was. Kathleen called in a welfare check on the home on September 18. Inside the home, police found the bodies of four people. Questions arose. Was this a story of a jilted lover? Or was an intense interest in death and horror behind these murders?</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
