  "description": "<p>In life, as women we’ve been taught to behave a certain way for approval, acceptance and favorability. We’ve been told to be nice, selfless, devoted, the perfect wife. Not too loud, not too opinionated, not too intelligent. Well all of that was patriarchal BS. In this episode, I sit down with author Majo to discuss the five good girl myths that are holding us back and how to reclaim our full sovereignty. I also share the good girl myth I fell under and how I overcame it.</p> <p>Tap into your heart, your joy and your dharma this month with the frequency of Lemuria in Rose Gold Goddesses.
