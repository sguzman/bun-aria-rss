    "media:description": "Though the giant bodies in outer space that we would eventually call galaxies were first noticed by French astronomer Charles Messier in the 17th Century, Edwin Hubble, in 1923, was the first to realize what they actually were. It turned out that there were countless galaxies in our universe, made up of billions upon billions of stars and trillions of planets. It did not take humans long at all to do what we do best, imagine. If there were trillions of planets throughout the vastness of space. Could there be another world like ours, with sentient beings like us? From that point onward we began to see aliens everywhere.\n\nIt has been said that the oldest fear is the fear of the unknown. The fear of the unknown stands at the root of some of our greatest horror stories. Infamous but brilliant writer HP Lovecraft has influenced the entire horror genre, his work speaks because it reflects his genuine fear of the unknown and of the other. The fear of the other is at the root of our fear of aliens. Aliens are scary because we donâ€™t know them, we cannot predict their behavior, they could be cruel, they could see us as bugs beneath them, they could enslave us, steal our world's resources, and then discard us. They could in essence do to us what we do to each other, or perhaps even worse. Infinite terrors await within the unknown. We peer into the darkness of space and yet we do not know what might be peering back or what it might be capable of.\n\nMusic By Jamez Dahl: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvgQE_C66Mqg2xqKvHIdYPQ\n\nFOLLOW QUINN ON TWITTER: Twitter: https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRE\n\nThree-Body Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXGGVBzHLUfIzEhovpQJ2ENiNvJoOD2A\nH.P.
