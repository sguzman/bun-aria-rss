  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged!   This week, Jonathan Awde joins me on the show. Jonathan, CEO and President of Gold Standard Ventures (NYSE:GSV), gives us an inside look at what’s exactly taking place in today’s dispirited gold sector.   Whether its inflation, geopolitical risks, or weakness in the dollar... As of recent, investors are having a difficult time finding gold’s next growth catalyst…   Jonathan, nonetheless, sheds lights on a much clearer picture.   In part to recently released economic data, he explains why the sector may finally be reaching the tipping point we’ve all been patiently waiting for.   Jonathan then talks about Gold Standard Ventures.   Despite flatlining prices, the company is in the midst of its “largest drilling project” to date.   Tune in as Jonathan catches listeners up to speed… breaking down the company’s recent acquisitions, drilling results, and how the company is quietly positioning itself for gold’s inevitable bounce-back.   Good Investing,   Frank Curzio   PS - Don’t leave when Jonathan signs-off. On this week’s Educational Segment, I talk about a strategy I use to get my biggest, yet safest returns… a methodology, no matter how many times I mention it, no one ever uses.   Here we go again…",
