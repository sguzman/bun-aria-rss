  "description": "<p>Join Alan and Joey this week as they review their time thus far in Costa Rica...shark infested waters and all! Joining the conversation this week is legendary sportscaster and radio personality Dan Patrick of the Dan Patrick Show. Dan also happens to be their boss, and on this episode, they’re all officially meeting for the first time. They discuss everything from sports to botox, and our theme this week: Worlds Colliding. You’ll hear about Dan’s opinions on sports metaphors, on Alan and Joey as hosts, and his uncanny ability to guess who will win the Oscar and for what scene. Tune in for a great episode full of laughs and mistaken identities...you’ll want to hear the story behind that one. As always, we have a guest-inspired cocktail of the week! This week enjoy the MOSCOW FOOL.
