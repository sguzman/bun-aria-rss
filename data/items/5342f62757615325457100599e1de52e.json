Plus! The Celtics honor the Bill Russell, Aaron Judge is making history (if not the history a certain faction of fans WANT to pretend he's making) and Drake has a jimmy! But the real star of today's show is a caller who had his heart broken right before a birthday trip they booked together -- and the advice from Jalen Rose, which includes a quote we may be using for a long, long time. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
