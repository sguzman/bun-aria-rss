Under his leadership, over 70,000 people defeated the Roman legions multiple times. This episode features mass crucifixions, Dionysian orgies, a master course in guerrilla warfare, walls built with corpses, the most brutal punishment in military history, pirates, and overambitious Romans losing their heads.</p><p class=\"\">Please support our sponsors by shopping for supplements, special foods, clothing, and exercise equipment at<a href=\"http://www.onnit.com/history\" target=\"_blank\">www.onnit.com/history</a>&nbsp;and receive a 10% discount.
