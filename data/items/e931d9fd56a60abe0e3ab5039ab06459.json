  "description": "Since March, the COVID crisis has caused massive disruption to every area of life and work. It has tested us, as individuals and as a business. Akamai has taken a very human-centric approach during the pandemic. Our guiding principle has been to do what is right for the health and safety of employees, customers and partners. I feel proud of this, because when I think about what I'm grateful for, it really does come down to people. I'm grateful to be working for a company that is keeping people connected to the world through technology. I'm grateful to be among smart, immensely resilient colleagues. And I'm grateful to have friends and family who are sticking together. Ultimately, it's the humanity that matters.",
