  "description": "<p>Tonight I will be speaking with Johnathan. Back in 2018 he had a very strange encounter happen to him while driving back to his cabin in Virginia. I have personally heard many accounts like this and I am happy Johnathan decided to come on the show and share it. Johnathan said after the encounter “I am left with no creature, no deer and no light. All I have is confusion. This incident has bothered me ever since.”</p>",
