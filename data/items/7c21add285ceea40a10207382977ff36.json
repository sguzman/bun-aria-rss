All the really 'good stuff' (science, poetry, etc.) was usually written on biological material like hides and papyrus, and obviously, they didn't age that well.\n1:33:28 Dutch East Indian Company records on paper exist till today from 1600 - 1700.\n1:34:36 In light of the recent law requiring free access to all federally funded research (and associated data), can you talk about how scientific knowledge and data has been shared throughout history?\n\nFollow us on our official social media channels.&#13;\n&#13;\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WolframResearch/&#13;\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wolframresearch/&#13;\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wolframresearch/&#13;\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wolfram-research/&#13;\nStephen Wolfram's Twitter: https://twitter.com/stephen_wolfram/&#13;\n&#13;\nContribute to the official Wolfram Community: https://community.wolfram.com/&#13;\nStay up-to-date on the latest interest at Wolfram Research through our blog: https://blog.wolfram.com/&#13;\nFollow Stephen Wolfram's life, interests, and what makes him tick on his blog: https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/",
