  "description": "<p>In Part 2 of Abortion: The Body Politic, we step into the past, long before <em>Roe</em>, and trace the roots of today&rsquo;s abortion&rsquo;s debate to understand&nbsp; &mdash; if abortions have always happened and the majority of Americans have always believed they should be legally accessible &mdash; why is abortion such a contentious, even volatile, issue in this country. In this journey, a new narrative of reproductive resistance comes to the surface. Women, particularly Black, brown and indigenous, have always made choices that are best for their bodies, families, and lives &mdash; no matter the obstacles men have placed before them. In these stories of resistance we also hear first-hand accounts of surprising allies in underground abortion access, courage in the face of limited reproductive choices, and a relentless push for bodily autonomy. The illegal period before <em>Roe</em> is a mirror to our impending, post-<em>Roe</em> future. It&rsquo;s vital that we pay attention.</p>\n<p><strong>More information on this episode&rsquo;s guests and resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/\"><strong>Guttmacher Institute</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/\"><strong>The Bixby Center for Reproductive Health</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://grandmothersforreproductiverights.org/\"><strong>Grandmothers for Reproductive Rights</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://rcrc.org/timeline/\"><strong>Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.drhern.com/\"><strong>Boulder Abortion Clinic</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Books and more:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520288201/reproductive-justice\"><strong>Reproductive Justice</strong></a><strong>, by Loretta Ross and Rickie Solinger</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520387416/when-abortion-was-a-crime\"><strong>When Abortion Was a Crime: Women, Medicine, and Law in the United States, 1867-1973</strong></a><strong>, by Leslie Reagan</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/movies/the-janes\"><strong><em>The Janes</em></strong></a><strong>, available to stream now on HBO Max</strong></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199391646.001.0001/acprof-9780199391646\"><strong>Defenders of the Unborn: The Pro-Life Movement Before Roe V.
