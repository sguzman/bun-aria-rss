  "description": "<p>Dear Steve and Shirley, I have an issue with my man and he told me to listen to Steve, so I’m writing for advice. The issue with my guy is that he’s very self-centered and loves himself to death. He is looking at his phone literally all day and he keeps it with him at all times… in the bathroom, while he’s cooking, and by his pillow every night. I’ve asked him several times to let me see his phone and he told me that I need to listen to Steve Harvey, who said that a woman should never touch her man’s phone! If the man doesn’t have anything to hide, then why not? He goes back and forth on his phone, sending messages to women and some guys, day and night............</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
