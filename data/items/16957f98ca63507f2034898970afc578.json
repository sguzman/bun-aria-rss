  "description": "<p>We&rsquo;re joined by fellow Atlantans- our friends Julien & Kiersten Saunders! They started their site Rich & Regular back in 2017 after they threw themselves into the financial independence movement and paid off $200,000 in debt. They&rsquo;ve been featured virtually everywhere- the Times, the Atlantic, Bloomberg. They&rsquo;re successful speakers, created a fantastic Youtube series called Money on the Table, and now they&rsquo;re about to be published authors!

In the book they write about creating your own career path, making peace with your finances, and building wealth on your own terms. During this interview we discuss Julien & Kiersten&rsquo;s introduction to the FIRE movement, avoiding imposter syndrome when creating content, and how to actually know if it&rsquo;s time to cash out by quitting your job.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Valley of Gold by Wild Heaven!
