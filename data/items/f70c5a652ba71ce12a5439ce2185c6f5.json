We last had Steve on the show to talk about <i>The Road</i> by Cormac McCarthy. In this episode, we unpack <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, beginning with some background on McMurtry, and the style and themes he explores in his work. From there we turn to <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, and its surprising influences, from Jane Austen to Cervantes. Steve and I explore the characters of Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call, how they can represent the archetypes of the Epicurean and the Stoic, and what we can learn from their friendship.
