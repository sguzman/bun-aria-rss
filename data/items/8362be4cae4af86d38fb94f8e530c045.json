  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that Ecuador has told the world they cut Assange's Internet connection (but will continue his asylum), and that they did so on their own. Russia Today remains predictably unconvinced. WikiLeaks shows no signs of stopping election doxing. The US may be considering a campaign of counter-embarrassment as its response to Russian information operations. Fallout from the Yahoo! breach continues. London banks are hit with ransomware. More IoT botnets form from Mirai code. Terbium's Emily Wilson explains the weaponization of intel. Venafi's Kevin Bocek describes what their look at Yahoo!'s encryption revealed. And we take a quick look at the blockchain.",
