  "description": "<p>The Roman Catholic Church purchased 90 acres of land in Canon City, Colorado, formerly known as Fruitmere Orchards, from Captain Benjamin F. Rockefeller for the Benedictine Society of Colorado. The Benedictines called the new religious foundation the Holy Cross Abbey. The main building was constructed in 1924 and rises to four stories and was designed by Joseph Dillon and L.A. Des Jardins with a Collegiate Gothic and Jacobean Revival style. This was not only a monastery, but it also was a boarding school for boys. There were bigger plans for the property, but the Depression stopped those plans. This location has been the scene of many suicides and other deaths and it seems that this has led to haunting activity. I am joined on this episode by Dennis Batchelor of Simply Ghosts, our listener Cheryl Lynn and two other investigators, Cindy and Sean, to share the history and their paranormal experiences at the Holy Cross Abbey. The Moment in Oddity features green olivine crystals from the sky and This Month in History features the Berlin Blockade.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pics can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2018/06/ep-263-holy-cross-abbey.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2018/06/ep-263-holy-cross-abbey.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer and give Mort something to do: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Vanishing from http://purple-planet.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p>",
