  "description": "The 13th-century English philosopher Roger Bacon is perhaps best known for his major work the Opus Maius. Commissioned by Pope Clement IV, this extensive text covered a multitude of topics from mathematics and optics to religion and moral philosophy. He is also regarded by some as an early pioneer of the modern scientific method. Bacon's erudition was so highly regarded that he came to be known as 'Doctor Mirabilis' or 'wonderful doctor'. However, he is a man shrouded in mystery. Little is known about much of his life and he became the subject of a number of strange legends, including one in which he allegedly constructed a mechanical brazen head that would predict the future. \n\nWith:\n\nJack Cunningham \nAcademic Coordinator for Theology at Bishop Grosseteste University, Lincoln\n\nAmanda Power\nAssociate Professor of Medieval History at the University of Oxford \n\nElly Truitt\nAssociate Professor of Medieval History at Bryn Mawr College\n\nProducer: Victoria Brignell.",
