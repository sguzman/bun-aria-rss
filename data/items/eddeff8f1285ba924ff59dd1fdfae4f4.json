  "description": "<p>Darkness Radio presents: Elements of a Haunting with Brandon Alvis and Mustafa Gotallari!</p>\n\n<p>After having been featured on A&E's Ghost Hunters, Brandon and Mustafa have teamed up to not only write this fascinating new book, but also create a new classification system for ghosts and hauntings! The book takes the classification system and matches it with past cases and the scientific methods that both use in every investigation to show you a new and improved way to decrease false positives. </p>\n\n<p>Brandon and Mustafa also briefly delve into what they believe a ghost is and what potentially happens when we expire. </p>\n\n<p>Get the book here:  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ARKJsf\">https://amzn.to/3ARKJsf</a></p>\n\n<p>Check out Brandon's website here: <a href=\"https://www.brandonjalvis.com/\">https://www.brandonjalvis.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Check out Mustafa's Twitter here:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tafgato\">https://twitter.com/tafgato</a></p>\n",
