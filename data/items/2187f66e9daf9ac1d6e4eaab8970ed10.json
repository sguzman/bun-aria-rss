  "description": "<p>Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including Kawhi Leonard's decision to join the Los Angeles Clippers. It was the latest blockbuster move in what has been a wild offseason for the league, and highlights a growing trend in the NBA -- star free agents are starting to act a lot like team general managers. Also discussed is U.S. women’s national team, which just won its fourth World Cup title. The championship comes as the team is taking legal action to try to raise pay to a level on par with the U.S. men's team, and also has ramifications for the nine-team National Women's Soccer League, which should see a large spike in interest. The pair also discuss 15-year-old American Coco Gauff, who make it to the Round of 16 in her first Wimbledon singles draw appearance. </p><p>Hosts: Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr</p><p>Producer: Bob Bragg</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
