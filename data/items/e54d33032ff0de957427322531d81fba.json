  "description": "In this episode we respond to an email on a topic we have not yet covered!  That the perceived exclusivity of Christianity or others religions as a whole.  In other words, is there one way to Heaven? Or what happens to people who never hear about Jesus? Does God only work through those who have chosen to follow him?  If there are the type of questions you find yourself wrestling with, then this episode might help provoke more discussion for you to consider!
