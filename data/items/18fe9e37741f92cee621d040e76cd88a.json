The bridge was a simple concrete arch bridge that spans Lady Bird Lake in downtown Austin. It needed to be rebuilt with more contemporary beams called “box beams.” The box beams sit below the road’s surface, and they needed to be spaced a certain distance apart. Bloschock and the other engineers decided that the gap should be somewhere between ¾ of an inch and an inch and a half, which didn’t seem like a particularly meaningful decision… until the bats moved in.</p>\n<p>A tale of bats and bridges and how the built environment and the natural environment don’t need to be at odds with one another.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=36226&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">The Batman and the Bridge Builder</a></p>\n<p>Plus, we talk with Simon Doble, CEO of Solar Buddy.
