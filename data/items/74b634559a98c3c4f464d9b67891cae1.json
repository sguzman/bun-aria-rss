  "description": "<p>We're still on lockdown and I'm still Dewin it! My HoneyDew this week is Justin Martindale! Justin is a True Dew and he does not hold back! We talk about his Texas cheerleading days as a closeted mascot before he was outted, getting yelled at by his pastor's wife (which still affects him today) reconnecting with his father at 25 and his 2019 that included embarrassing himself at his HS reunion and taking his grandmother off of life support. Please make sure you're subscribed to <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/user/rsickler/videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">my YouTube channel</a>! I'll be adding episodes and more content there! Stay healthy y'all!</p>",
