  "description": "A lot of people these days know about collaborative filtering. It's that Netflix Prize thing, right? People rate things 1-5 stars and then you have to predict missing ratings.\nWhile there's no doubt that the Netflix Prize was successful, I think it created an illusion that all recommender systems care about explicit 1-5 ratings and RMSE as the objective."
