  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, Don McGahn cooperating extensively with Robert Mueller while still serving as President Trump’s counsel is a major ethical issue. How can he have discussions with Trump and at the same time provide interviews to Mueller’s special counsel? McGahn can’t continue to give Trump advice and run the office of the President while also giving information to Mueller. Mueller is hunting Trump – that’s about it and that’s why we should resent all of this because it’s all a fabrication. Robert Mueller is not pure; he is a prosecutor looking to put people in prison rather than pursue the truth. If he was actually looking for truth he would have already concluded there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Instead, Mueller continues setting his perjury trap. Also, there’s something clearly wrong with John Brennan, and it’s a wonder why his security clearance wasn’t pulled a long time ago. He’s being propped up by the left and the liberal media just to attack Trump despite having a few lightbulbs out. Even James Clapper thinks Brennan is out of line, something that should speak for itself. Later, over 700,000 people overstayed their visas last year alone, accounting for almost half of the illegal aliens in the country. The left wants you to believe everyone here illegally is seeking asylum, yet almost half are coming through the front door.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
