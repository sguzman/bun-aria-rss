  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, former Sec. of State John Kerry has been named in a leaked tape of Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif who says Kerry informed him that Israel attacked Iranian interests at least two hundred times even after his role as secretary shifted. Kerry continued to represent the United States on the world stage which could be viewed as a violation of the Logan Act. Will the public Integrity section of the US Department of Justice open a preliminary investigation on this? Then, Hollywood leftists have destroyed the once great tradition known as the Oscars. Actor and Producer Tyler Perry publicly announced that he rejects hate against white, police officers, Asians, and others. Imagine if law enforcement refused protection to athletes, politicians, or other critics that don't respect them. Later, Rep. Liz Cheney has broken from the rest of the Republican leadership on the House concerning the panel on the Capitols Riot. Citizen activists in Wyoming must ensure that she is held accountable at the ballot box. Afterward, President Biden is spending like a drunken Marxist, taking credit for Trump's vaccine and he still can't get out of his own way. Kamala Harris is a stalking horse for Biden and has ignored the one job she's been given to resolve the issue at the border.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
