  "title": "137 - Madame Delphine LaLaurie: How Evil Was She?",
  "description": "<p>Did Madame Delphine and her Dr. husband really torture their slaves in the most horrific of ways at the now infamous LaLaurie Mansion at 1140 Royal St in the French Quarter of New Orleans? Or are the stories of firefighters walking into a burning structure in 1834 and finding horribly mutilated bodies just part of New Orleans ghost tour folklore? We do our best historical detective work as we examine the lives of one of the most infamous women to ever live in one of American's most interesting cities.
