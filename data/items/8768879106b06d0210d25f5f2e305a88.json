  "description": "In Tides of Revolution: Information, Insurgencies, and the Crisis of Colonial Rule in Venezuela (University of New Mexico Press, 2018), Cristina Soriano examines the links between the spread of radical ideas, literacy, and the circulation of information in a society without a printing press. In doing so, Soriano shows the ways Caribbean revolutionary ideas flowed into the ports and coastal communities across colonial Venezuela. The Haitian Revolution was front and centre of these revolutionary ideas, which inspired many and terrified others. Through these information networks, creole, pardo, and even enslaved people engaged in ideas about republicanism, abolitionism, and racial egalitarianism. This book offers insight into the later chaotic and multidirectional process of the anti-colonial movement in early nineteenth-century Venezuela.\nSharika Crawford is an associate professor of history at the United States Naval Academy. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
