  "description": "<p>Trae Young stepped on a ref's foot and the Bucks take control of the series. Khris Middleton legacy game (00:03:12 - 00:08:51). Clips/Suns was atrocious to watch and the Suns in 5 is looking likely as Playoff P showed up (00:08:51 - 00:24:01). The Waterdogs suck and someone got busted for sticky stuff (00:24:01 - 00:29:33). Who's back of the week including Fast 9 and Dame Lillard (00:29:33 - 00:44:52). Collin Morikawa joins the show to talk golf, the time he missed the ball on a shot, getting in the good graces of Mike Silver, golf feuds and more (00:44:52 - 01:23:12). Segments include Talking College Baseball, Stay Woke Tour De France, Big Cat gets a weird stock tip and Billy's recap.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
