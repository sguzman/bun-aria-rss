  "description": "Oh you are in for a treat! This is a masterclass in cool-headed political judgement. Gisela's story is impressive enough anyway - coming to the UK from Germany, winning an unwinnable seat and holding it for 20 years and now sitting in the House of Lords - but it's the way she tells that story which will have you engrossed. You've probably never heard a politician talk about themselves the way Gisela does. This is one of the most honest interviews you'll ever hear.
