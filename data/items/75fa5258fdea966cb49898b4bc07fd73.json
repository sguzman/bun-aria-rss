    "media:description": "Beast with many legs (36).\nThe special thing about the way a beach animal walks is that it does not bump like us. The body of a beach animal stays at the same level while the legs walk under it. This is the result of the angle of the upper leg in relation to that of the lower leg. The oblique position is continuously compensated by that of the lower leg so that the hip joint remains at the same height. Well, with the Multi Tripodes, behind the row of hind legs, there is a row of extra legs that imitate the hind legs by means of parallelograms. The high and lower leg of those extra legs are parallel to those of the hind legs. This provides six extra legs. Now you can continue by adding more imitating legs. The beast originally had 12 legs (connected to the crankshaft). I added a total of 24 legs (4 rows).",
