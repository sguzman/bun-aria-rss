Sharon gives details about the secretive ways three of our former presidents–Grover Cleveland, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin D. Roosevelt–kept the people in the dark about their surgeries and sicknesses. She talks about how presidential health was often tied to the nation’s health and success, and how that ultimately shifted during the Eisenhower Administration as transparency and medical technology evolved.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
