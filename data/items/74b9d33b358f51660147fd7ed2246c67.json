  "description": "You might be familiar with Hester Peirce, commissioner of the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC). Appointed by then-President Donald Trump to the SEC on January 11, 2018… Hester has become known as the “crypto mom.” Today, Hester joins the show for an in-depth discussion on crypto regulation. She shares what to expect from the SEC in the future… why too much crypto regulation could be a bad thing… and the problems that could result from too little regulation. [21:45] Speaking of regulation… Daniel and I debate whether regulators should look into stablecoins and “meme” coins like dogecoin. We also explain a particular stablecoin’s recent plunge to zero… and Daniel lays out why goldbugs and bitcoin bulls hate each other.
