  "description": "<p>Sometime, likely in late August of 2019, 18-year-old Luzeia Mathis disappeared from her Phoenix, Arizona apartment. Luzeia was an independent young woman who lived alone, so no one immediately noticed that she was gone. Her close family members thought she was off doing all the things teens that age do and that they would hear from her soon. That was until her aunt received a phone call in September of 2019, one of those calls we all dread from the police. They were called to Luzeia's apartment due to a bad smell. Officers entered the apartment and found a horrific scene inside, but Luzeia was not there.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Luzeia Mathis, please contact the Phoenix Police Department at 602-262-6151.&nbsp;You can follow Luzeia’s case on Facebook at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Luzeias-Voice-113991413350356\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Luzeia’s Voice</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.thehotline.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Domestic Violence Hotline</a>- 1-800-799-7233</p><p><a href=\"https://www.childhelp.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ChildHelp National Child Abuse Hotline</a>- 1-800-422-4453</p><p><a href=\"https://www.rainn.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Sexual Assault Hotline</a>- 1-800-656-4673</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.
