  "itunes:summary": "Douglas Kahn presents his lecture, Sound Matters: One Energy Among Others. Based on his most recent book, Earth Sound Earth Signal: Energies and Earth Magnitude in the Arts, Kahn reworks the histories of science, communications, music and the arts to account for the incursion of electromagnetism into culture from the nineteenth century to the present. Investigating the trade between acoustics and electromagnetism in aesthetics and the arts, Kahn poses questions for new approaches in the arts, ecology and media where sound is but one energy among others.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/douglas-kahn-sound-matters-one-energy-among-others/\nDouglas Kahn: Sound Matters - One Energy Among Others (Theories and Histories of Sound)\n\nHistories and Theories of Sound\n28 August, 2014\nGertrude Contemporary, Fitzroy\nPresented by Liquid Architecture\n\nAudio: Mara Schwerdtfeger\nImage: Douglas Kahn\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
