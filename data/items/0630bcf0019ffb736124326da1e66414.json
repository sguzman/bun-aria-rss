  "description": "In this episode of The Readheads the girls are recapping and discussing All Rhodes Lead Here by Mariana Zapata, a very Snitchy Snitch's choice. As per usual, the girls are disagreeing on just about everything. Plus they take listener questions and share the other books they read this month. The next book is Jackie's choice and she chose Run, Rose, Run by James Patterson and Dolly Parton.
