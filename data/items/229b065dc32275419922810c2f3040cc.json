  "description": "<p>LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he and his guest go deep into the subject of mortality via cinema, and this week he is joined by the incredibly funny comedian and improviser from Australia, it’s STEEN RASKOPOULOS!</p><br><p>A lovely episode, as Brett and Steen get into it like good old fashioned pally pals from the get go. It also helps that Steen is a very warm and friendly presence, which you will certainly enjoy throughout the episode! A great chance to get to know him, and most definitely to get to know his film favourites (and non-favourites), and hear about all of it, the whole story which includes his watching of many, many films on places (flying back and forth to Australia, see - you can cram in a ton), the resulting AALS (Altitude Adjusted Lachrimosity Syndrome - that is, crying easily at films on planes), his cricketing past which includes bowling out Alistair Cooke, his drinking sprees in those early cricketing days (ohh, those out of hand cricketers!), his very generous death scenario, skating accidents, how to make it through a horror film successfully, playing sports to playing theatre sports, the correct pronunciation of ‘Bowie’ (you may be surprised), and how films get invented and how tough that is. It’s got it all, people. You shan’t be disappointed.</p><br><p><strong><em>EPISODE LINKS:</em></strong></p><p>• <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steenrasko\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>STEEN on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://www.steenrasko.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>STEEN ONLINE!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheBearPack\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>STEEN's IMPROV GROUP 'THE BEAR PACK'!</strong></a></p><br><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mrbrettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT on INSTAGRAM!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/brettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT on PATREON!</strong></a></p><p><strong>• </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyHN3_ZUyuA\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>'SUPERBOB' - Brett's 2015 feature film!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/75576061\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>'CORNERBOYS' with BRETT & SCROOBIUS PIP!</strong></a></p><br><p>• <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/distractionpiecespodcast\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on FACEBOOK</strong></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/distractionpiecesnetwork\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on INSTAGRAM</strong></a></p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith\">http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
