  "description": "<p class=\"style1\">This is one of those \"flush the pipes\" ROMAs, where I talk about a slew of things that seemed unrelated until I started talking about them. By the end, I realized that they're all aspects of the same issue. Anyway, it goes from a defense of Dan Savage to the demise of organized religion to the necessary irrationality of group identity to institutional momentum to whether sex and gender are biological or merely cultural phenomena.</p> <p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.lelo.com/bestsellers?utm_source=christopherryan&utm_medium=ppr&utm_content=christopherryan_po_79152a&utm_campaign=OPPCPC-PR-LeloMix-lelo-SWD-TOP-GEN-eng-US\"> Lelo</a>, creator of the world's most amazing pleasure machines.
