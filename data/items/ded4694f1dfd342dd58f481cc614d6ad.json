  "description": "<p>Hardcore. Punk. Cancer. One of these things is not like the other. Nathan Gluck I've known for awhile and his band Ensign was monumentally important to me in my formative years of going to shows. Recently, he was diagnosed with stomach cancer and the hardcore community chipped in and raised over $100,000 for his medical expenses. It's a really incredible story and Nate was extremely candid about his time in Ensign and the fight he has going on currently.
