  "description": "How much would your relationships improve if you could up your emotional intelligence game? That phrase -- emotional intelligence -- entered the lexicon 25 years ago, when my friend Daniel Goleman wrote a book by the same name. And so on this episode, to mark the 25th anniversary edition of Emotional Intelligence, we’re having Danny on the show. By way of background, he is a Harvard-trained psychologist who, along with other contemplative luminaries such as Joseph Goldstein, Sharon Salzberg, Jon Kabat-Zinn, and others, went to Asia and discovered meditation in the 1960s, and then made it a huge part of their lives and careers. In this conversation, we talk about: the four components of emotional intelligence, how to develop them, and why these skills matter so much during the middle of a pandemic. We also discuss: empathy and relationship management in the age of zoom; the “marshmallow test” and impulse control; a phenomenon he calls “amygdala hijacks”; and why so many Jewish kids in the sixties and seventies got turned on to Buddhism.  \nWhere to find Daniel Goleman online: \nWebsite: http://www.danielgoleman.info\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DanielGolemanEI\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/danielgoleman\nBooks Mentioned:\nAltered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body by Richie Davidson\nhttps://www.richardjdavidson.com/altered-traits\nMan’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl\nhttps://bookshop.org/books/man-s-search-for-meaning-9780807014271/9780807014271\nA Force for Good: The Dalai Lama's Vision for Our World by Daniel Goleman\nhttps://bookshop.org/books/a-force-for-good-the-dalai-lama-s-vision-for-our-world/9780553394894\nHow much could your relationships improve if your loved ones practiced mindfulness together?
