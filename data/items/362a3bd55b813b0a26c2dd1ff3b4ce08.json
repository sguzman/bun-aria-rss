  "title": "BONUS 17 - Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield",
  "description": "<p>When murder investigators entered the rural farm house of loner Ed Gein just outside the tiny town of Plainfield, Wisconsin on November 16th, 1957, they found a scene like nothing any American investigator had ever seen before. A scene of outlandish, unimaginable horror. Body parts stored in bags and boxes. And so much skin. Human skin crafted into the stuff of nightmares. How could all of this horror come from a slight, soft-spoken, middle-aged local loner and farm-hand?
