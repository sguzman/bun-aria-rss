  "description": "Hey everyone, we’re still out on maternity leave. This week we’re bringing you a double feature re-release of our coverage on the #FreeBritney movement. \nBritney is still under the conservatorship and the control of her dad. The New York Times released the documentary \"Framing Britney Spears\" which featured video footage spanning the many years of this restrictive arrangement.\nThis episode covers Britney's early years all the way through the actions that caused her dad to petition for a conservatorship.\nAfter checking out these throwback episodes, you can head over to our Patreon for some bonus content like our minisodes, including our update on the FreeBritney movement that was released after these episodes. We also have other bonus content like mixed bags, Wheel segments and Am I the Asshole questions - where Reddit users ask whether they're acting like assholes and we judge them!\nEnjoy the episode! Thanks so much and keep it creepy\n_Starting with her pigtailed debut, she rocketed to stardom as one of the biggest pop stars of all time. At first, all her dreams seemed to be coming true. But behind the scenes, things weren’t going so well for this icon. A divorce. A custody battle. Stints in the hospital for mental health reasons then finally, her rights were stripped away via an allegedly temporary legal mechanism. A decade later, the conservatorship remains. How could a pop legend end up with her every move controlled? _\nSupport Sinisterhood\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
