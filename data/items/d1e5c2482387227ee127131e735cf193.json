  "description": "The debates over U.S. monuments that celebrate Confederate generals, soldiers, and politicians show just how pervasive slavery's legacy is - and how it continues to impact the way Black America moves and exists in the world today. How is - or isn't - this nation reckoning with the history of slavery, and what does it mean for our community? Today, we begin to answer that question with author and award-winning poet Clint Smith. Using his debut nonfiction book, \"How the Word is Passed,\" as a guide, we explore how America is or isn't accounting for the system of slavery and more fully understand history's vital role in the progress of our community. BHY is produced by PushBlack, the nation's largest non-profit Black media company – hit us up at BlackHistoryYear.com and share this with your people!\n\nPushBlack exists because we saw we had to take this into our own hands.
