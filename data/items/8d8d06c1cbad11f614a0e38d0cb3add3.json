  "description": "Start-ups come in all shapes and sizes, but they are similar in that they take a lot of grit and tenacity to get them off the ground. Despite all the love and hard work that goes into start-ups, about 90 percent of them fail. Still, that did not deter today’s guests, Krystle Mobayeni of BentoBox and Julia Joseph of Maple Hill Creamery. Their companies went from start-ups to success and they’re here to tell host Kerry Diamond about everything from the bumps to the triumphs. \nThank you to Schmaltzy, the podcast of the Jewish Food Society, for partnering with us on this episode.
