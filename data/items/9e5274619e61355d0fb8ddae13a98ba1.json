It has now been twenty years since the day that Jennifer’s mother reported her missing. 14 year old Jennifer Medernach left after an argument with her mother. She was spotted several times over the course of the next few days, still in the families’ neighborhood. But the story turned to tragedy when her body was found in a creek several days after being reported missing. This case is still very active and getting some justice for Jennifer is still very likely.
