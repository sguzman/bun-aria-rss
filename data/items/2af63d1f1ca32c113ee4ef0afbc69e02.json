  "description": "<p>Monday 12/10 - Today on show we had Vic Mensa stop by where e spoke about is controversial comments on XXX Tentacion, is new album \"Hooligans\" and more. Also, if you didn't know it has been 8 years that \"The Breakfast Club\" has been going live on air, can you believe it! However, what really got their start was when Ray J called up ranting about Fabolous, so we took it back to that call. We also flashed back to the time Lil Webbie couldn't pronounce any of their names, and it is possible he still may have trouble with it. Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to yet another Floridian, this time for farting obnoxiously and then pulling a knife on a man. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
