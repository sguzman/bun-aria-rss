  "description": "This episode is a twofer. You get the Van Winkle Family and the Bourbon Community Roundtable all in one which took place at Bourbon & Beyond 2019. Julian gives history about the brand and the timeline of when it became a part of the Sazerac portfolio. One of Julian’s daughters talks about the emergence of Pappy & Co and how she is more of a tequila person and never really gets to drink any of the family bourbon. Preston talks about their involvement with crack down of the secondary market groups as a counterfeiting measurement. Fred keeps lots of good questions rolling along that you all will find interesting. The 2nd half of the podcast is a live recording of the bourbon community roundtable as we share thoughts on the festival, the news that broke the evening prior, and what we recommend for those who can’t get Pappy. There’s almost too much going on, but it’s timely and full of good info you all will enjoy.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about Bourbon and Beyond.\n\nWhat was it like when your dad was trying to sell whiskey when no one was interested?\n\nDid you ever sneak in and steal some whiskey from your dad?\n\nWhat was it like for bourbon in the 1980s?\n\nHow did you barter with whiskey?\n\nWere you ever worried that you would have to close the company?\n\nWhen you were a child, did you feel the stress your dad was experiencing?\n\nTell us about the moment you realized you wouldn't have to shut down.\n\nWhat was the thinking behind partnering with Buffalo Trace?\n\nWhat do you think about your haters?\n\nWhat is the relationship with Buffalo Trace like?\n\nDoes Preston have the same palette as Julian?\n\nWhat's your favorite expression?\n\nIs it ok to drink Pappy 23 with coke?\n\nWhat does the future look like for the brand?\n\nDo you plan on increasing the price?\n\nWhat steps have you taken to curb the secondary market?\n\nWhat would happen if you were in the same room as an alleged counterfeiter?\n\nWhat did you learn from the sessions so far at Bourbon and Beyond?\n\nThoughts on the Van Winkle session.\n\nWho caught up with Marianne Eaves?\n\nIf you can't get Pappy, what do you recommend?",
