  "description": "<p>Leaders are creators.</p> <p>In last week’s episode of The John Maxwell Leadership Podcast, we discussed how leaders choose. This week, in Part 2 of this 3-part series, we’re talking about how leaders <em>create</em>.</p> <p>According to John, good leaders create four major things within their teams and organizations: confidence, strategy, ideas, and­­­ options. But, not only do great leaders create these four things; they foster an environment where others contribute to the creation process.</p> <p>Mark and Richard reflect on how this idea has helped their leadership and shaped their teams. They also challenge you this week to apply this principle by encouraging and boosting the confidence of someone within your team.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Picture of Leadership Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/picture and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/The-21-Irrefutable-Laws-of-Leadership-10th-Anniversary-Edition_p_2780.html\"> <em>21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</em> by John C.
