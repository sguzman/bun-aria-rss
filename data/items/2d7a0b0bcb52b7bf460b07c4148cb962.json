  "description": "<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 19px; background-color: #d4eff9;\">Steve Simeone came to the apartment and we got in a nice long conversation about our struggles in Hollywood over the years. I’ve known him for nearly as long as I’ve been in Los Angeles. I didn’t quite realize how long it had been until we started talking. Man, there were some great times had while we were coming up. Steve is one of the funniest guys I know and he’s also one of the nicest. The fact that he’s not a household name is a sign that there is no justice in the world. But at least it led to some good stories about life on the lower end of the standup totem pole. I hope you enjoy it. I think too often there’s talk of how a particular entertainer made it in Hollywood and there’s never enough attention called to the survival years where you’re just trying to get by while you’re chasing your dreams. We got a lot of those stories in here. Enjoy.</span></p>",
