  "description": "<p>What could you accomplish if you gave 100% of your effort to the things that truly matter? What if you wholeheartedly committed to your goals, and always went the extra mile? Too many of us only work at 99% capacity (or less), and then feel defeated when we can’t produce results.</p> <p>Today’s guest is a huge proponent and example of how giving 100% can change your life, help you reach your goals, and serve others along the way. David Meltzer is the co-founder and CEO of Sports 1 Marketing, which is arguably the most notable marketing firm in the world. He is a true leader, a successful businessman, and overall inspiring human being.</p> <p>David has an extraordinary story of rising to the top, failing, and then reengineering his life and redefining success in a deeper, more meaningful way. His story is a powerful testimony of what can happen when you decide to give 100%, sharply define your focus, and consistently practice gratitude.</p> <p>In this episode you’ll discover:</p> <ul> <li>The danger in attaching your happiness to outcomes.</li> <li>Why asking for advice from people we love can lead to resentment.</li> <li>The number one way you can prepare yourself for the things you want in life.</li> <li>What it means to elevate your vibration (and how it can help you accomplish more!)</li> <li>The importance of surrounding yourself with successful individuals.</li> <li>Why no experience is inherently good or bad.</li> <li>How radical humility changed David’s life.</li> <li>Why a victim mentality can diminish your potential.</li> <li>The four guiding principles on which David built his life and business.</li> <li>What it means to be a student of your calendar.</li> <li>How to attract abundance.</li> <li>What it means to go the empty mile.</li> <li>The importance of being consistent on a daily basis.</li> <li>What it means to pay a dummy tax.</li> <li>The number of mentors you should have at all times.</li> <li>Why (and how) David started prioritizing his health as his greatest expense.</li> <li>The multitude of benefits that come from serving others.</li> </ul> <p>Items mentioned in this episode include:</p> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.com/onnit\">Onnit.com/Model</a>⇐ Get your optimal health & performance supplements at 10% off</li> <li><a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.com/thrivemarket\">Thrivemarket.com/modelhealth</a>⇐ 25% off your entire 1storder + free shipping!</li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/ed-mylett/\">Get Financially Fit & Upgrade Your Identity with Ed Mylett – Episode 282</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/ed-mylett/the-ed-mylett-show/e/54250377?autoplay=true\"> Ed Mylett Show – How to Sleep Smarter with Shawn Stevenson</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HM8C481/\">Innercise by John Assaraf</a></li> <li>Connect with Dave <a href= \"http://www.davemeltzer.com/\">Website</a>/ <a href= \"https://www.entrepreneur.com/listen/playbook\">Podcast</a>/ <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/davidmeltzer11/\">Facebook</a>/ <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/davidmeltzer/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></li> </ul> <p>* <a href= \"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/themodelhealthshow/Episode+316.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download The Transcript</a></p> <p>Thank you so much for checking out this episode of The Model Health Show.
