  "description": "ABC News Senior National Correspondent Matt Gutman is, unfortunately, no stranger to tragedy, both in his career as a journalist and his personal life. He learned the practice of meditation at just 12 years old, mere months before his father would be killed in a plane crash. And now, nearly 30 years later he's reporting on how meditation played a role in the miraculous rescue of 12 boys trapped in a cave in his new book, \"The Boys in the Cave: Deep Inside the Impossible Rescue in Thailand.\" He opens up about his own personal tragedy and gives a riveting account of that rescue in this week's conversation.
