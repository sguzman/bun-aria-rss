  "description": "<p>Stuck in a baggage claim trying to find your missing bag?  Don't get mad ? just listen to this episode of \"Watch What Crappens\" instead. This week Ronnie Karam (trashtalktv.com) and Ben Mandelker (@banterblender) go to town on the ladies of \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.\"  We have a thing or two to say to Kim Richards. Then it's on to \"Vanderpump Rules\" for more inanity. Finally, the episode ends with us seeing Madonna fall down a staircase.  It has nothing to do with Bravo, but when have we ever stayed on message?<br />\nYou can donate to us at http://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens<br />\nAnd remember to like us on Facebook:  http://facebook.com/watchwhatcrappens<br />\nAnd here's some other stuff:<br />\nOur Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/watch-what-crappens<br />\nOn iTunes: https://bit.ly/crappens<br />\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/watchwhatcrappens<br />\nRonnie on the Web: http://www.trashtalktv.com<br />\nRonnie on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/trashtalkteevee<br />\nRonnie on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/trashtalktv<br />\nBen on the Web: http://www.bsideblog.com<br />\nBen on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/bsideblog<br />\nBen on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/bsideblog<br />\n<br /><hr /><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p></p>\n",
