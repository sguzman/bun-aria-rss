  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, when you are President of the United States and you leave the White House for the final time, the very act of taking classified or non-classified documents before you leave the White House is a Presidential act. If an ex-President has classified documents, he didn’t acquire them as an ex-President. A President can classify and declassify at will and doesn’t need to follow any protocol - he is the executive branch. The question remains, was this FBI raid about January 6 and broader issues? Also, did you ever think you would see the day when teachers in Virginia are trained to transition children's genders without parental approval? To figure out what’s going on we have to go back to Marx and Engels who argued that you had to destroy the family unit, and binary sex in order to establish a Marxist society. Then, California continues to destroy itself as they move toward banning new cars running only on gas by 2035. California has the highest income rates in the country, the health care system is a disaster because of the influx of illegal immigrants in the state, and businesses are fleeing. California is turning into Venezuela. Finally, Gov Ron DeSantis calls in to discuss the DeSantis education agenda. 25 out of the 30 DeSantis endorsed candidates won on Tuesday running on this agenda. DeSantis’s opponent Charlie Crist is insulting the voters of Florida and California Governor Newsom is getting involved in the Florida Governors race.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
