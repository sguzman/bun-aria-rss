  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, Longtime owner of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, was granted federal immunity to divulge details about affairs alleged by women with then-candidate Trump. The Special Counsel is now investigating associates of the President dating back to the 1990's under the guise of investigating alleged collusion with Russia and campaign finance violations. This is what Trump refers to as a witch hunt; these bogus charges are not meant to be be tested or withstand scrutiny in a court of law - they are solely a basis to try Trump in the court of public opinion in order to impeach the president. This abuse of power by Robert Mueller is a bastardization of the rule of law. Afterwards, there is a whole array of potential crimes on intervention, the espionage act, and more wrongdoing by the Democrats and nothing gets done! Yet the candidate that didn't pay for a phony dossier is the one that being investigated, called a racist and labeled mentally ill. Also, we need to wake up to the reality of a midterm election blue wave that could lead to President Trump’s impeachment. Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi are downplaying talk of impeachment to lull Republican voters into a false sense of security. There is a blue wave coming, and it can only be beaten by a red wave! Finally, Ron DeSantis calls in to discuss his run for Governor of Florida.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
