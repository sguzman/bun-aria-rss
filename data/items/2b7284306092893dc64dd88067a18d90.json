  "description": "<p>Stripping extraction of hydrogen molecular ions has gained interest in the\ncyclotron industry due to its high extraction efficiency. However, the magnetic\nfield could result in undesired Lorentz dissociation of the hydrogen\nanion/molecular ions during acceleration. Studies of dissociation under\nelectric fields comparable to that of a Lorentz-transformed magnetic field in a\ntypical cyclotron (a few MV/cm) are sparse. Hence, in order to fill in the\nmissing yet crucial information when designing a cyclotron, this work compiles\nand summarizes the study of Lorentz dissociation of H$^-$, H$_2^+$ and H$_3^+$\nfor stripping extraction in a cyclotron.\n</p>",
