  "title": "294 - Vladimir Putin",
  "description": "<p>Vladimir Putin. Who is the former KGB officer who has led Russia since 2000? Is he a friend of a foe of the West? Was he legitimately elected to office? Legitimately re-elected? Does he have any valid reason to be in Ukraine right now? What does he really want to accomplish in Ukraine? Today we dig into the story of Russia's leader, who is maybe one of the greatest propagandists the world has ever known. Can we actually trust anything that comes out of his mouth? Are his troops actually \"de-nazifying\" Ukraine? Or is that whole narrative just more of Putin's lies? </p><p><strong>Bad Magic Productions Monthly Patreon Donation</strong>:  The Bad Magic Charity for May is the HALO Dental Network.
