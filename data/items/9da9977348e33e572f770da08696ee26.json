  "description": "Richard Evans is a Senior Fellow in Computational Social Science at the University of Chicago, and Fellow here at the institute. Evans sees immense potential in the methods, practices, and even workflows that computer engineers have implemented in their own discipline, and is working to bring those skills into Chicago economics through his role both here at the institute and via the Masters in Computational Social Science, a graduate program he’s a part of. \n\nEvans spoke to us about how we can expect to see computation shape different aspects of economic study, as well as the ways that computer scientists and software engineers can teach economists how to work smarter.\n\nMusic in this episode:—\nAuscultation: https://auscultation.bandcamp.com/album/spiritland\nBoris Mann 2: https://soundcloud.com/boriscloud/acid-jazz-sunday",
