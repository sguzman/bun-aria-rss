Patch Tuesday notes, including some products that Redmond will no longer support. Crytpojackers are still busy. One new strain of coin-mining malware uses the Eternal Romance exploit to spread. World Cup surveillance threatens visiting fans. And don't plug gifts from strangers into your USB port.  Justin Harvey from Accenture with thoughts on supply chain security. Guests are Saher Naumaan and Kirsten Ward promoting RESET, BAE Systems’ Women in cyber event.",
