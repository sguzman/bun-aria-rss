  "description": "**Bruegel director Guntram Wolff and senior fellow André Sapir discuss how potential WTO reform might position the organisation differently towards China.**\n\nIn this Director's Cut of 'The Sound of Economics', Guntram Wolff talks to Bruegel senior fellow André Sapir about his upcoming paper on the WTO reform, specifically what is necessary in order for the Chinese economic system to be compatible with the global multilateral trading system.\n\nChina has recently been atop the European policy agenda, especially with President Xi's recent visits to Rome and Paris ahead of the EU-China Summit in April. The discussants here walk us through the main challenges in the EU's quest to position itself vis-à-vis China, including the issues of forced technology transfers and the behaviour of Chinese state-owned enterprises.\n\nFor further reading, we recommend the Bruegel Policy Contribution by Uri Dadush and Guntram Wolff on [how Europe should approach the unfolding crisis in global trade](http://bruegel.org/2019/03/the-european-unions-response-to-the-trade-crisis/).",
