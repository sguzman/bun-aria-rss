  "description": "Arianna Huffington has a multimillion-dollar media website that reacts to world events by the millisecond, she's a mother of two -- and yet she says she always gets a good night's sleep. Not only that, she says wants to help everyone else do the same.\nHuffington, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post, has a new book -- her fifteenth --\ncalled \"The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life One Night at a Time.\" In the book, she traces sleep deprivation back to the Industrial Revolution and argues that our culture's chronic need to be \"plugged in\" is hurting our health, productivity, relationships and happiness.\nShe started researching the effects of sleep deprivation after she collapsed from exhaustion in 2007, two years after launching The Huffington Post. It was also around this time, Huffington said, that she went back to meditation, a practice she had first started at age 13 while living in her home country of Greece.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
