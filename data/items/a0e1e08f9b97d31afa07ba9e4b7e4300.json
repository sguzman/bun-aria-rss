  "description": "<div>When Laci Peterson disappeared on Christmas Eve in 2002, her husband, Scott Peterson, was almost instantly the prime suspect. When it came to light that he'd been having an affair AND had told his mistress that his wife had been dead for months, the press and the world turned against him. But is it possible that he's the world's biggest dirt bag BUT MAYBE DIDN'T DO IT? Patrick and Gillian come at this case from opposite sides...sort of. Patrick thinks MAAAAAAAAAAAAYBE there's more to the story. Gillian....well, she's pretty convinced that he's a garbage murderer. <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">BINGE THIS ENTIRE SERIES RIGHT NOW ON PATREON!</a> On our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Patreon feed</a>, you'll also find over 100 FULL BONUS episodes to <strong>BINGE RIGHT NOW! </strong>Including our episode-by-episode coverage of <strong>\"Casey Anthony: American Murder Mystery,\"</strong> <strong>\"Serial,\" \"The Jinx,\" \"Making A Murderer,\" \"The Staircase,\" \"Lorena,\" \"The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,\" \"OJ: Made in America\" </strong>and so many more!
