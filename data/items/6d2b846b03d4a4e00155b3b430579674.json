  "description": "This episode of How to Raise a Parent is all about the incredible things adults can achieve when we reconnect with the creativity that comes so naturally in childhood — the sense of pure possibility that seems to become diluted as we age. We’re looking to kids for creative guidance as we tap back into the vibrant imaginations and sense of play that fills and fuels childhood. To help us explore this unadulterated creativity, we talked to Danielle Krysa, an artist, author, blogger, graphic designer, and mom, and Tom Sturges, a music executive, author, teacher, and father.  \nDownload and listen to How to Raise a Parent wherever you listen:\nApple Podcasts \nStitcher\nOvercast\nSpotify\nTuneIn\nHead here to learn more about this episode of How to Raise a Parent.\nThis paid podcast is produced by Slate Studios and DairyPure®.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
