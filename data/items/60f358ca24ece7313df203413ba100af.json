  "description": "American capitalism is kind of like apple pie. We know it’s supposed to be a quintessential component of our culture, but we’re not really sure how to make it from scratch without leaving a bad taste in someone’s mouth.\nThis week on Morning Brew’s Business Casual podcast, the provocative and recently very viral venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya argues that today’s recipe for capitalism isn’t working.\nPalihapitiya’s case against this “perversion” of capitalism looks a little like this: \n\nWe’ve strayed tremendously from the free market system that allowed all entities, wealthy or poor, to move together in unison.\n\nTo Palihapitiya, that’s resulted in a massive zero sum game between resilience and efficiency. If we want to have both, we need to make some changes. \n\nYou might not agree with Palihapitiya. But this episode is full of thought starters guaranteed to provoke even the least civically inclined of your group chat. And just wait for Part II coming out next…\nGo listen to Part I now.\n+ And if you want to check out the viral interview we reference in the episode, find that here.",
