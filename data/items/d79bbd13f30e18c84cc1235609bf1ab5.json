  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, The constant race baiting by the left in the media and in sports is sickening. The outrage over Ron DeSantis’ monkey comment is a phony issue – and now the word articulate is being called racist too. If what DeSantis said is a bullhorn for racism, what about Andrew Gillum calling for a confederacy of states to fund Medicare for all? We have so called reporters on TV stirring the pot and dividing the nation over these phony issues. The United States is the most diverse nation on earth, yet the left insists on attacking the values that bring us together as Americans. Also, there are serious questions about Robert Mueller’s investigation that should be raised by the media but aren’t. Instead they put Mueller on a pedestal and turn a blind eye to his unethical behavior because the liberal media wants Mueller to take out Trump. Finally, Joseph Flynn, brother of Lt. General Michael Flynn, calls in to give us an update on his brother and his defense fund.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
