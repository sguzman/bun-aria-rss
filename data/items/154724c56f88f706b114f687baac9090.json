  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane has a lot of followers, but not all of them are supportive of this Minifan Prayer Vigil on Saturday. Rich Kelleher is protesting his status as designated survivor and has requested a military tribunal, a request Minihane has graciously granted. Some anonymous donor gave Gordon College $75.5 million and the Boston Globe is furious. We discover that Ronan Farrow voiced his own audiobook and for some reason decided to do impersonations. Film critic Danielle Solzman joins the show to make her case for why Michael Che should be kicked off Saturday Night Live over a Caitlyn Jenner joke, why New York City should levy fines against people for misgendering, and why comedians who tell offensive jokes about minorities may need to be sent to rehab clinics. Two states remain.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
