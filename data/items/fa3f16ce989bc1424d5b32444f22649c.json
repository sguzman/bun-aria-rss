  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys run through a bunch of listener questions that found their way into the Pod FOD including whether or not they'd rather be blind from 9-5 on the weekdays, or not have the use of thumbs for the rest of their lives, why the guys seem pretty chummy with Mitt all of the sudden, they decide which actors would play each of them if a movie were to be made about the podcast, which white lies they were told as kids were the best, what some of their best accomplishments while boozed up have been, plus much much more. Don't forget to send in your questions and submissions to @ThePodPMI on Twitter and Instagram to get them into the FOD, and subscribe to youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow in order to watch new episodes of The Pod by joining McAfee's Mafia. We appreciate you all for listening, we'll see you on Wednesday, have a fantastic weekend.</p>\n",
