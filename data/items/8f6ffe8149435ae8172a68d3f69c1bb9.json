  "title": "#65 - The Death Of Black Superman - The Debaucherousness of Billy Ray Bates",
  "description": "<p>This week, we look at a man who always lives in the moment, and never learns from his mistakes. His drinking, drug use, and general shenanigans were legendary, even among the party crowd of the 1980s. He ruined his chances at fame & fortune, and even screwed up enough to be escorted from the Philippines. A beloved figure, on the court, due to his wild antics, and uncanny ability for producing excitement. A mess, off the court, where he never met any trouble he didn't fall head over heels for. It's a sad tale of making something from nothing, then returning it right back to nothing. You know... Hilarious!
