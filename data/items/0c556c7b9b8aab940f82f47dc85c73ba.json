  "description": "Do you find yourself talking to the same people about bourbon every day and realize you talk to them more than your best friends? In fact, maybe they are your new best friends. We're all in that situation now and that's what today's episode is all about. Bourbon has a magical element that seems to bring people together across every demographic to share a common bond. Perhaps you're getting started and want to figure out, how do you find your bourbon people? We sit down with Jeremy Mandel, he's an admin and founder of a few online communities and one of our Patreon supporters. We go through what it takes to find connections with other like minded individuals that can be done online with people around the world or perhaps in your own backyard with meet-up groups, bourbon societies, and much more. You'll come away at the end of this realizing you probably followed some of these same steps without realizing it.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about money.\n\nHow did you get into bourbon?\n\nWhat was your introduction to the online bourbon communities?\n\nDo you ever have events with your bourbon friends?\n\nDo certain groups create more bonds than others?\n\nWhat about your local society?\n\nDo you think raffle groups encourage camaraderie?\n\nWhat did you think of the Bob Dylan whiskey?\n\nWould you rather go to someone's house to drink bourbon or a bar?\n\nCan these bourbon networks get bigger?\n\nHow can people find a bourbon community?\n\nWhat relationships have gotten you a really good bottle of bourbon?",
