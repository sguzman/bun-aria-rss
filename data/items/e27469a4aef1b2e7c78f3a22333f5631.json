  "description": "A book on psychoanalytic theory that you read with a lump in your throat: theory that taps into some deep currents. We interview Dr. Amy Schwartz Cooney and Rachel Sopher about their edited volume Vitalization in Psychoanalysis: Perspectives on Being and Becoming (Routledge, 2021).\nAmy tells us about psychoanalytic transformation and … the New York Knicks (?!)\nRachel reflects on an image she had: “I imagined with great clarity an image of [her patient] Jennie and me sitting together in my office, an inert body laid out between us. Gray, corpselike, it rested on a block with intravenous (IV) tubes coming out of each of its arms. One of the IVs ran from the prostrate body to Jennie’s arm, and the other to mine, each of us connected to this lifeless mass, infusing it with our own blood, each of us feeding it, sustaining it, keeping it on life support in some limbo state between life and death.”\nThis is a powerful, timely volume.\nAmy Schwartz Cooney, Ph.D., is on faculty at the New York University (NYU) Post-Doctoral Program in Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy. She is on the Board of Directors and is faculty/supervisor at the National Institute for the Psychotherapies (NIP) and at the Stephen Mitchell Center for Relational Studies. She is Joint Editor in Chief of Psychoanalytic Dialogues and is in private practice in New York City.\nRachel Sopher is Board Director, Faculty and Supervisor, National Institute for the Psychotherapies (NIP) Training Institute; Faculty and Supervisor, National Training Program for NIP; and Faculty, Stephen Mitchell Center for Relational Studies. She is Editor-in-Chief of Psychoanalytic Perspectives and maintains a private practice in New York City.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
