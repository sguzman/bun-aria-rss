  "description": "<p>Spoke to a military veteran last night who has agreed to come on the show. He shares an encounter he had in Oregon. He has also experienced some very strange things in Iraq during the war.</p> <p>A small portion of the show will be Sasquatch related but I believe he has earned the right to come on and share whatever he wants to share. He said “I am sure I ran into a Jinn over in Iraq. I have no other explanation for what I saw, this thing…guy walking straight up a wall.”</p>",
