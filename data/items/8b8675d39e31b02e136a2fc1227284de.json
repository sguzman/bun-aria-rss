  "title": "179 - Ruby Ridge",
  "description": "<p>The 1992 Ruby Ridge armed standoff between the Weaver family and the federal government. Three people died and the American modern militia movement was born. Did the government use excessive force in dealing with Randy Weaver, who refused to show up to court and face weapons charges? Or did Randy Weaver's own consistently paranoid and terrible decisions bring the wrath of Big Brother to his door? This one got me fired up! I heard way too much about this incident growing up in Idaho, and after doing the research I felt like I'd been lied to. Will you agree? Sorry about my terrible voice and Hail Nimrod! </p>\n<p>Check out Lynze and I's new horror podcast <strong>Scared to Death.</strong> Listen on Spotify, Stitcher, iTunes, Youtube, and more!
