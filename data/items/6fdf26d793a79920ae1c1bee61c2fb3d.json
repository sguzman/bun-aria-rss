  "description": "<p>The book that has had the biggest impact on Vitaliy this past year is Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. He loved this book so much he read it twice – that was not enough. Then he listened to it twice on Audible. But to really understand it, he felt he needed to write about it - so he did. Vitaliy's review is the size of five football fields – okay, no, it’s 7,000 words, the length of five articles. Actually it is more than just a review: It has turned into a personal manifesto.</p> <p>You can read this personal manifesto at: <a href= \"https://contrarianedge.com/my-personal-manifesto/\">https://contrarianedge.com/my-personal-manifesto/</a></p>",
