  "description": "<p>This year, 2018, the Jewish community observes Yom HaShoah starting at sundown on April 11th. Yom HaShoah is Holocaust Remembrance Day, a day that the country of Israel observes to commemorate the extermination of approximately six million Jews and five million others who perished in the Holocaust. Concentration camps were built in several areas of Europe to accomplish what the Nazis referred to as \"The Final Solution.\" A few of them still stand today as reminders of a very dark time in history. With the energy created by the torture and death that occurred in these camps, it is easy to believe that haunting activity would be experienced at them. No official paranormal investigations have taken place at any camp out of respect and because such investigations would seem sacrilegious, but there are many reports of weird things being reported by people who have visited. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Nazi Death Camps of the Holocaust. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Mari Cruz Aponte-Veliz and features Sedlec Ossuary, the Bone Church.
