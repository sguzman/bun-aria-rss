  "description": "<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Eleven - Inerrancy. </strong></em>Today, we're jumping back into our series on the Bible to discuss everyone's favorite buzzword: <strong>Inerrancy.</strong> What does it mean for something to be 'inerrant?' Where did the term come from? How do we qualify something to be inerrant? What are we to do with this in our pursuit of understanding the text? How does genre, context, interpretation etc. play into the inerrancy? How does the human &nbsp;/ divine dance play into this conversation? There is a lot to unpack in here...</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
