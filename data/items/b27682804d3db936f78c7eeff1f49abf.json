  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! With all the noise surrounding the internet these days, it's difficult to find a good financial research platform. And as some listeners have noticed, Yahoo Finance is not what it was 5 years ago. To start off today's episode, I give listeners a list of my favorite online financial sites... Sites I generally use for my own research. Some come with a cost and some are free, however, each of these sites have their own strength. Remember, this podcast is about you, not me. I highly recommend you check them out. Then, my next question covers a stock I am getting tons of feedback on - KKR & Co. LP (KKR). I recommended this stock just two weeks ago on my educational segment. And since then, it appears many subscribers are hesitant or concerned. Today, I'll be jumping back into the numbers - and will explain why there's still massive upside potential. Also... I can't win them all. A couple months ago I made a mistake. I recommended a retailer just as the holiday season was picking up. And since then, the brick & mortar sector has been crushed. I'll admit my losses. However, I still believe this particular company is in way better shape than its competitors. Although I'm expecting a little more \"pain\" in the short-term, I still love their long-term position. Switching gears, I then dive into the uranium sector. Prices have finally reached over $20/lb. In fact, uranium is trading at prices not seen since 2004. What does this mean going forward? To end the episode, I revisit a few more stocks on my radar. This includes Delta Airlines (DAL), Amazon (AMZN), and Northern Dynasty (NAK). Special thanks to Kurt, Scott, Christopher, Kris, Daniel, and John. Other stocks mentioned: Cameco (CCJ), Uranium Energy Corp (UEC), Skyharbour Resources (SYH.V), Uranium Resources (URRE), Stratasys (SSYS) Good Investing, Frank Curzio",
