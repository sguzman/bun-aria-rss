  "description": "<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #14</strong>, my guest is social change activist, writer, blogger, and photographer <strong>Sash Milne</strong>, who joins me to discuss the <strong>Nothing New Project</strong> <em>(no new things bought for a year)</em>, her <strong>TEDxPerth</strong> talk about the project, and what she calls the <strong>Economy of Human Connection</strong>.</p>\n<p>About: <strong>Sash Milne</strong> is a social change activist, writer, blogger, photographer and all 'round hunter of the good life. In her early 20s she decided that a life lived inside the box was not one she wanted to live. She ran away from her mainstream life in search of something simpler. She lived in a very remote village in Indonesia for three years, where she learned some fundamental lessons about community, connectedness and most importantly, happiness. While living with nothing but the basics , she completed her Masters in Social Change and transformed the course of her life, for good.</p>\n<p><strong>Sash</strong> then returned to Australia as the single mum of one, with a need to incorporate her passion for community, simplicity and sustainability into a life lived down under. She continually challenges social norms and consumer trends by creatively connecting with other people. She launched her <strong>Nothing New</strong> project at the beginning of 2014 and soon discovered that buying nothing new is perhaps the best way of gaining everything that really matters.</p>\n<p>To learn more about <strong>Sash's</strong> work, visit: <a href=\"http://www.inkedincolour.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.inkedincolour.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.inkedincolour.com/category/nothing-new/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.inkedincolour.com/category/nothing-new/</a>.</p>",
