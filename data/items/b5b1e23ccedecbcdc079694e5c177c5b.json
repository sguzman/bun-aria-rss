  "description": "Bills take down the Titans on Monday Night Football. Josh Allen and Stefan Diggs put on a show. Is this the team to beat and will Jalen and Jacoby make it to a game to a game this year to join the Bills Mafia? Also, the Eagles take down the Vikings in the second game of the double header. Is it safe to bet on Jalen Hurts for the rest of the season or will the guys jinx it by talking about it? And should NFL players apologize for not performing on Sunday? With all the money on the line it’s a new world and saying sorry might be the right thing to do.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
