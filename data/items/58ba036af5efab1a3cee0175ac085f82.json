  "description": "Seana Shiffrin is Professor of Philosophy and Pete Kameron Professor of Law and Social Justice at UCLA. She defends the “thinker theory” of freedom of speech, which holds that a central reason for upholding a moral and legal system of free speech is that such a system is necessary for free thought and reflective action. This view is articulated in her book, Speech Matters:On Lying, Morality, and the Law (Princeton 2014).\nThe \"Why We Argue\" podcast is produced by the Humanities Institute at the University of Connecticut as part of the Humility and Conviction in Public Life project.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
