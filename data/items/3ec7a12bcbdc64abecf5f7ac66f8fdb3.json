  "description": "<p>On this week's episode of the Bear Grease [Render], Clay has flown the coop and left Misty in charge of the normal ne'er do well Bear Grease Crew as they navigate the second portion of Holt Collier's life, but not before: Brent questions why everyone is so angry in the kitchen. Josh gives us the 4 things to expect while Clay is gone. Misty clarifies, once again, that she is not against tattoos. Isaac shares some choice Bear Grease Bargain Barn listings. And our honored guest, old friend, and general great guy, Dr. Malachi Nichols, instigates a discussion on the ease or difficulty of having more kids. Make sure you stay tuned for Gary \"Believer\" Newcomb's take on what drove Holt to greatness.
