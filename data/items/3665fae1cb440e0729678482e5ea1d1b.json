Justin takes us inside his decision to transition from being a professional racing driver to becoming an entrepreneur and owner of the NASCAR Cup Series team Trackhouse Racing Team. \n\nAfter 80 NASCAR starts, former NASCAR Driver Justin Marks started a new Cup Series Team called Trackhouse Racing Team in 2021. He shares that he loves racing more than anything else in the world behind his wife and kids but realized that he wanted to be successful but felt he could be more successful on the business and ownership side of NASCAR to do that. \n\nRocko takes us down memory lane and shares what Justin was like as a racer. He described Justin as a driver with a chip that liked to look good and play good. He explains that there are a lot of team owners that were former drivers but there aren’t a lot of owners that were good drivers outside of Justin.\n\nBrandon jokingly proposes that Channing becomes a driver for Justin after wining a couple of GoKart races against Chad Johnson and himself earlier this year. Channing responds that if he were to race for any one he would love the opportunity to race for Justin because he’s young and progressive. Justin says with all of the changes happening around NASCAR within the last 2 years that now is the time to be progressive and embrace the changes and build his business around that vision. \n\nJustin shares that he believes success for Trackhouse Racing starts with ownership. He wants to be the owner that is involved with his team on and off the track. He is committed to hiring the best people and providing them with the necessary tools to be effective at their role. He also believes that in order to be a good owner he has to be present and being there with his team on all levels. \n\nWrapping things up, Channing and Brandon ask Justin what the future of Trackhouse and NASCAR looks like. Justin responds NASCAR looks a lot different within its fanbase in the last 2-3 years. He adds that Trackhouse has the most diverse pit crew in the sport and it important to him because he wants to win races and amplify their voices. He shares that it is his mission to find a way to make a difference and that NASCAR is a sport that can be for everybody but all owners need to be pushing in that direction to accomplish this with NASCAR’s support. \n\n\nI AM ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://iamathletetv.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/iamathlete\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamathletep...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpod\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@iamathlete_po...\n\nHOUSE OF ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://houseofathlete.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thehouseofa...\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/houseofathlete\nApparel Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/houseofathl...\nHoA Supplements on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/houseofathlete\n\n#IAANascar\n#IAMATHLETE\n#BrandonMarshall\n#ChanningCrowder\n#JustinMarks\n#RockoWilliams\n#MoreThanAPodcast\n\n\nDRAFTKINGS:\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL).\n\nGambling problem?
