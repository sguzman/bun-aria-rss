  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, this election is about the American people versus the Democrats and the media. The media won't go after the facts on Hunter Biden but they will go after Rudy Giuliani who was the 3rd highest ranking in DOJ under Ronald Reagan, they will go after the owner of the computer repair shop just to delegitimize them. The information was not hacked, or stolen it was shared with Giuliani's attorney. As of this broadcast, the New York Times and Washington Post have not even asked for copies of the emails on the hard drive. Former VP Biden insists that he never asked or knew anything about his son Hunter’s overseas business dealing, but the emails show that this isn't true and the media and silicon valley are covering up for the Biden’s. Unfortunately, Hunter Biden's signature is on the contract for the computer repair and his signature is easily verifiable. However, Biden's campaign simply denies that there was any such encounter, but would not rule out any informal meetings. If Biden ever becomes president this hard drive filled with DNA should be the basis for his impeachment. Afterward, Sen. Martha McSally joins the program and shares that her opponent in the Arizona senate race is still employing a spokesperson who called police \"F-ing pigs.\" Finally, Congressional candidate Troy Nehls calls in with an update from his campaign for Texas 22nd district.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
