  "itunes:summary": "Tuesday&#8217;s runoffs in Georgia will determine which party will control the Senate in the new Congress.  Greg Bluestein of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution tells us what&#8217;s at stake and how early voting seems to be breaking all records.  The following day, Congress is going to vote on certifying Joe Biden&#8217;s victory.  Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, says he will vote no, arguing that rules were broken in several states.  And, besides, Democrats, such as Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, did the same thing in 2005 and no one made a big deal of it.  Well, Barbara Boxer is on the program this week to explain the vast differences between what she was trying to accomplish and what Hawley is doing.<br />\nMusic in this episode<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNIZofPB8ZM\">Don&#8217;t Stand So Close to Me by The Police</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrCDdm2yjXY\">Know Your Enemy by Green Day</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cvljfwAyXQ\">The Army Song by the United States Army Band</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRu5wxl5frk\">Bad Reputation by Joan Jett</a><br />",
