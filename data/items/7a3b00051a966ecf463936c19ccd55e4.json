  "description": "<p>During these tough times, Rick Rubin wanted to have a chat with an artist he finds inspiring. Top of mind was John Legend. So he called him up via Zoom, while both were sheltering in place, for a quick chat about his career and the creative process behind two of his biggest songs. Plus they discuss the song Legend is currently obsessed with. This is our first remote recording, so it's a little shorter and a little more lo-fi than usual.</p><p>Make sure to listen to John Legend's new single \"Actions\" and check for a new album later this year: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/0KGgFs3yJ1aHGnEU8nHCqR?si=3Q_Er2R7T1WQk_W8L1g1tg\">https://open.spotify.com/track/0KGgFs3yJ1aHGnEU8nHCqR?si=3Q_Er2R7T1WQk_W8L1g1tg</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
