  "description": "<p>The sparsity-ranked lasso (SRL) has been developed for model selection and\nestimation in the presence of interactions and polynomials. The main tenet of\nthe SRL is that an algorithm should be more skeptical of higher-order\npolynomials and interactions *a priori* compared to main effects, and hence the\ninclusion of these more complex terms should require a higher level of\nevidence. In time series, the same idea of ranked prior skepticism can be\napplied to the possibly seasonal autoregressive (AR) structure of the series\nduring the model fitting process, becoming especially useful in settings with\nuncertain or multiple modes of seasonality. The SRL can naturally incorporate\nexogenous variables, with streamlined options for inference and/or feature\nselection. The fitting process is quick even for large series with a\nhigh-dimensional feature set. In this work, we discuss both the formulation of\nthis procedure and the software we have developed for its implementation via\nthe **srlTS** R package. We explore the performance of our SRL-based approach\nin a novel application involving the autoregressive modeling of hourly\nemergency room arrivals at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. We\nfind that the SRL is considerably faster than its competitors, while producing\nmore accurate predictions.\n</p>",
