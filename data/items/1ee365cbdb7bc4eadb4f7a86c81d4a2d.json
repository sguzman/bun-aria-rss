  "description": "<p>Get ready because who knows what the hell is going on in this episode. First off, Em covers the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel, one of Canada’s most popular haunted locales. It features several ghosts, including one named Sam who may or may not wear a kilt, a phantom bride who fell down the stairs to her death on her wedding night, and three shadow people that were once the victims of a tragic murder-suicide. Christine’s story, though just as dark, takes a weird turn when she covers famous 90s Club Kid Michael Alig, who bashed his friend in the head with a hammer, poured Draino down his throat, and then decapitated him. What a (horrifying) world we live in.
