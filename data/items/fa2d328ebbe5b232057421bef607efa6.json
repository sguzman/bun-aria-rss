  "description": "<p>THE GAMES ARE COMING BACK TO AUSTRALIA! Yes, that's right, the Olympics will officially be hosted in Australia for the third time, with Brisbane being awarded the right to host the 2032 Olympics! We break down the news and talk about just what it means to Australia to have the Olympics back and how these games will be different compared to others. We also talk about just how the announcement went down, whether or not waiting for 11 years instead of 7 years is a good or bad thing and try and work out some long term predictions for the ceremonies, sports and even the person who will light the cauldron. Added to this we discuss some early Olympic results and give our final thoughts ahead of the Opening Ceremony in just two days time. It's one big episode you can't miss!</p>",
