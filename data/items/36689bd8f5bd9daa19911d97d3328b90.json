  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">At a time when nearly 250 million Americans are overweight or obese, we need to come to an understanding that our approach to this deadly epidemic is not working. In fact, it seems that our citizens are only getting sicker and fatter with each passing year. So how do we end the unproductive conversations about calories, food choices, and willpower and instead pivot to a model that actually helps people understand their brains and their biology?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">Today’s guest, Mark Schatzker, is the author of the new book, <em>The End of Craving</em>. He’s back on The Model Health Show to share powerful insights on our society’s dysfunctional relationship with food and how our brain drives our cravings. Mark is sharing powerful insights on the infamous low fat vs. low carb debate, the psychology of obesity, and what we can do to reset our body’s innate intelligence when it comes to food.</p> <p class=\"p1\">On this episode, you’re going to hear about the science of pleasure, how to eat in a healthy and sustainable way, and how some of the biggest myths in the dieting world have failed our citizens. Mark’s insights are brilliant, thought-provoking, and fascinating.
