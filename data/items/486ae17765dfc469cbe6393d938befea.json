  "description": "<p>Savanna LaFontaine Greywind was about to enter such an exciting time of life. She had just gotten a new job, was working on getting a new apartment with her longtime boyfriend and the two of them together were getting ready to welcome their sweet baby girl, Haisley Jo into the world. Unfortunately, two human garbage piles of muck would take Savanna's life and attempt to take her baby as well. Savanna and her family are Native American people and Savanna's story is sadly another example of how often Indigenous and Native American people, specifically women, are treated and how their stories are not covered in mainstream media. To help fight against this here are some websites with calls to action that we can all get ourselves involved in.
