We invite you to celebrate the official beginning of summer by immersing yourself in the magnificent, groundbreaking music of Brian, Carl, Dennis, Mike, and Al (and also Bruce).</p>\n<p>One thing the gang are at pains to make clear, as they lovingly cover the scope of The Beach Boys’ first five years of existence (from 1961 through to <i>Pet Sounds</i>) is that, even given the Legend of Brian Wilson, Lonely Genius, the band is <i>still</i> somehow underrated compared to their peers. If you thought Brian Wilson’s talents were more or less limited to <i>Pet Sounds</i>, “that lost album,” and a few songs about cars and surfing, then this show will hopefully be an education for you in what the sudden flowering of musical genius sounds like. If you already know just how good The Beach Boys were, then this show will be a glorious celebration. Catch a wave, ho-daddys.</p>\n",
