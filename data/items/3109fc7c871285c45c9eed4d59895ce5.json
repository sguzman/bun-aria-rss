  "description": "<p>Changing the conversation around diet is no easy feat. Our society is appearance-obsessed, always looking for the next quick fix, and constantly immersed in a toxic diet culture. Too many people fall prey to this system, but there’s a better, more-sustainable approach.</p> <p>For many of us, the solution to finding peace with food isn’t found in the newest diet book or achieving a certain number on the scale—it lies in our mindset. Health is a life-long journey, and a process that is meant to be enjoyed.</p> <p>On today’s show, Noelle Tarr of Coconuts and Kettlebells is here to share her experience with overcoming diet culture and finding balance in a health-centered approach. Her story is full of insight about how to shift the paradigm around food and exercise, finding your worth, and what it truly means to be healthy.</p> <h2>In this episode you’ll discover:</h2> <ul> <li>The importance of shifting your focus away from the number on the scale.</li> <li>Why the concept of “falling off the wagon” is toxic for our well-being.</li> <li>How to stop thinking of health as a destination.</li> <li>Why it’s so important to stop giving food morality.</li> <li>How health and fitness marketing often perpetuates a cycle of shame.</li> <li>The role of mental and emotional health in weight loss.</li> <li>What it means to set minimums for your macros.</li> <li>How to stop restricting and start creating a diet plan that works for you.</li> <li>The four foods that could potentially be problematic for your body.</li> <li>Why focusing on a goal weight is often arbitrary (and unsustainable!)</li> <li>How undereating can stop you from reaching your goals.</li> <li>The importance of managing stress.</li> <li>How cortisol can contribute to weight gain and fat storage.</li> <li>Why evaluating calories in/calories doesn’t always work.</li> <li>Noelle’s three favorite recipes from her book.</li> </ul> <h2>Items mentioned in this episode include:</h2> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.com/organifi\">Organifi.com/Model</a> ⇐ Use the coupon code MODEL for 20% off!</li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/thrivemarket\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thrivemarket.com/modelhealth</a>⇐ 25% off your entire 1st order + free shipping!</li> <li><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Coconuts-Kettlebells-Personalized-Long-Term-Happiness-ebook/dp/B074DTJ9BM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1535632957&sr=8-1&keywords=coconuts+and+kettlebells\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coconuts and Kettlebells by Noelle Tarr and Stefani Ruper</a></li> <li><a href= \"http://coconutsandkettlebells.com/well-fed-women-podcast/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Well-Fed Women Podcast</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://strongfromhome.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Strong From Home</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/20-ways-to-use-coconut-oil/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20 Ways to Use Coconut Oil for Wellness – Episode 227</a></li> <li>Connect with Noelle <a href= \"http://coconutsandkettlebells.com/well-fed-women-podcast/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Website</a>/ <a href= \"https://twitter.com/coconutskettles\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter</a>/ <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/coconutsandkettlebells/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a></li> </ul> <p>* <a href= \"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/themodelhealthshow/Episode+306.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download The Transcript</a></p> <p>Thank you so much for checking out this episode of The Model Health Show.
