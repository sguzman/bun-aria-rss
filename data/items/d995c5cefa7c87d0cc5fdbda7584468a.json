  "description": "In this episode, Sharon chats with Julie Bogart, creator of the award-winning Brave Writer program. Sharon and Julie talk about the benefits of leaving behind our information safety nets–the communities that only reinforce our own opinions–to explore information in new and open ways. Julie emphasizes that the best way to understand and care about each other is to be open to, and become fascinated with, different viewpoints. Being a critical thinker, and raising critical thinkers, does not mean we need to dismiss new technology all-together, but rather, find our “technological optimism.” If we’re going to be critical thinkers, we need to get in the habit of asking questions to understand instead of listening to argue.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
