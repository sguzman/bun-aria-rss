  "description": "<p>On another solo installment in the \"Korean War 70th Anniversary\" series, Avery picks up with the second part of the Chinese Spring Offensive that took play in April-May of 1951. After the intense Chinese assaults at the end of April, there was a temporary lull in the fighting between May 1-14 where both sides consolidated their forces and defenses for the next phase. 175,000 Chinese and North Korean troops struck at the right flank of the U.S. Eighth Army on the eastern front of the peninsula. Those six days of fighting saw the Communist forces have initial success, but eventually smash against hardened U.N. defenses, especially those of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division. By the end of May, the Chinese and North Korean forces were in full retreat and the steps toward the truce talks beginning were finally taking shape. Enjoy!</p>",
