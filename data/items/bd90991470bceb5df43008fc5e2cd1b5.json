    "media:description": "In this tutorial, I discuss all the new CMYK features that rolled out with GIMP 2.99.12 - the latest development release version of GIMP. I demonstrate the new soft proofing features, including the soft proofing icon at the bottom of the image canvas, plus show how GIMP can now open CMYK files and export to CMYK. While these new features are not full CMYK support, including editing in CMYK color space, they are a major milestone for GIMP offering CMYK compatible features and getting to full CMYK support.\n\n0:00 - Intro & Resources\n0:38 - Adding a CMYK Color Profile\n2:56 - New Soft Proofing Toggle\n5:19 - Add CMYK Soft Proofing Profiles to New Images\n5:55 - Export Images with CMYK Color Profile\n7:16 - Late Binding CMYK vs Early Binding CMYK\n7:59 - Import Images with CMYK Color Profiles\n8:55 - Color Tools Accurately Display CMYK Colors\n9:55 - Final Thoughts\n\nWhere to Download CMYK Color Profiles for GIMP:\nhttps://daviesmediadesign.com/where-to-download-cmyk-color-profiles-for-gimp/\n\nWhat Are Out of Gamut Colors and How to Fix Them Tutorial:\nhttps://youtu.be/vSjPcM1OOL8\n\nVisit our website for more text and video tutorials:\nhttps://www.daviesmediadesign.com/tutorials/\n\nEnroll in Our GIMP Photo Editing Masterclass:\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/gimp-photo-editing/?referralCode=418C294E695EA3962465\n\nBecome a DMD Premium Member for More GIMP Content:\nhttps://daviesmediadesign.com/premium-membership/\n\nWant to make your GIMP theme look like mine?
