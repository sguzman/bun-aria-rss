  "title": "Myanmar’s Disciplined Democracy and the 2020 Elections: A Discussion with Dr Roger Lee Huang",
  "description": "Myanmar is scheduled to hold general elections in November 2020. While the country has experienced political liberalisation since 2011, the latest Freedom House Report ranked Myanmar as “not free.” Dr Roger Lee Huang talks with Dr Natali Pearson about Myanmar's ongoing regime transition, arguing that the country’s \"disciplined democracy\" contains features of democratic politics, but at its core remains authoritarian.\nDr Roger Lee Huang is Lecturer in Political Violence with the Department of Security Studies & Criminology at Macquarie University. Roger has broad research interests in the politics, international relations, and security of East and Southeast Asian states. He has previously researched and worked in political and policy circles in Myanmar, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.\nRoger recently published 'The Paradox of Myanmar's Regime Change' with Routledge.
