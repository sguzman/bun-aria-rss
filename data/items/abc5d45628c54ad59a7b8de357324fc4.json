  "description": "<p>After the highs of yesterday it's time to calm ourselves down for a quieter day as we are back to cover all the action of day 10 of Tokyo 2020! How are we feeling about the legend that is Andrew Hoy claiming another couple of sneaky medals? Is Canada set to explode after their massive win in the soccer? Are we missing the swimming already? How are we reacting to the Hockeyroos choking? Can we still believe an Italian won the 100m yesterday? How can we make golf exciting by commentating over it? And can we work out who is competing for Australia in the javelin? It's all here and more on another action packed day which you simply can't miss!</p>",
