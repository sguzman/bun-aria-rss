  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the Supreme Court of Philadelphia has seized authority which it arguably does not have under the federal Constitution to change existing election laws, something that only the state legislature can do. The US Supreme Court agreed to review if they'll take up this case, but not on an emergency basis. Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh opined that the case should be brought and that the schedule should be shortened. Then, today's hearings on the oligopoly that big technology has become, revealed the bias that tech CEO's have for dissenting political opinions. When questioned by Senators, Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey admitted that calls for violence from the Ayatollah were not against Twitter's terms of service but the NY Posts reporting on Hunter Biden was. Dorsey also said the NY Post was able to tweet from their account, this statement is not supported by fact. Later, the materials submitted to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security by Tony Bobulinski have been vetted and are considered to be credible. This documentary evidence includes the creation of a shell corporation and an unsecured forgivable loan to the Biden’s, which is in effect a gift. Afterward, Blaze TV videographer, Elijah Schaffer, calls in to describe his coverage of the Philadelphia race riots. Schaffer was attacked by a mob of looters and explains how he feared for his life during the attack.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
