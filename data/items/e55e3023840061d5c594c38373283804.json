  "title": "Markus Zehnder, \"The Bible and Immigration: A Critical and Empirical Reassessment\" (Pickwick Publications, 2021)",
  "description": "Questions relating to immigration are among the most heated topics on both sides of the Atlantic. Western societies have changed dramatically because of large-scale immigration in the last decades. Christians are also engaged in the discussion, attempting to find direction from the biblical texts. Overwhelmingly, persons in leading positions (both in the secular world and in churches and faith-based organizations) support the concept of “welcoming the stranger.” The Bible is seen by them as urging us to open the borders as wide as we can. In the broader population, however, reservations remain. Markus Zehnder, a Bible professor who has witnessed mass-migration first-hand, both in Europe and in the U.S., and who has been a migrant himself for over twenty years, attempts to step back and look at the whole of the complex biblical witness, instead of cherry-picking passages that further a specific agenda. Join us as we talk with Markus Zehnder about his recent book: The Bible and Immigration: A Critical and Empirical Reassessment (Pickwick Publications, 2021)\nMarkus Zehnder is Professor of Old Testament and Semitics at Talbot School of Theology, Professor of Old Testament at ETF Leuven in Belgium, and Professor of Biblical Studies at Ansgar Theological Seminary in Norway. He is the author of numerous publications, including New Studies in the Book of Isaiah.\nMichael Morales is Professor of Biblical Studies at Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the author of The Tabernacle Pre-Figured: Cosmic Mountain Ideology in Genesis and Exodus (Peeters, 2012), Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord?: A Biblical Theology of Leviticus (IVP Academic, 2015), and Exodus Old and New: A Biblical Theology of Redemption (IVP Academic, 2020).
