  "description": "<p>There is seemingly more collaboration going on in the workplace than ever before. People are working and talking across teams, and within teams, using a wide array of communication channels. As a result, employees, managers, and CEOs alike can feel pulled in a ton of different directions, by a ton of different asks, and find their actual productivity shot to pieces as a result.</p><p>My guest figured there had to be a better way for folks to work together, and interviewed the most efficient collaborators to find out what they did differently to get back up to a quarter of their collaborative time. His name is Rob Cross, and he's a professor of leadership, a business consultant, and the author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3r2VGno\"><i>Collaboration Overload</i></a>. Rob and I begin our conversation with a big picture overview of the organizational and individual factors that are driving the problem of collaboration overload. We then shift to talking about the concrete tactics he learned from efficient collaborators that can help others avoid getting pulled into every conversation and project. We discuss how to limit the productivity-sapping power of meetings by scheduling reflective time, and ways to put more buffer between you and those who ask you to collaborate, including creating a transparent clearinghouse of priorities. We then discuss how to reduce collaboration overload in communication, manage people's expectations for response times, and identify the microstressors that may be contributing to your burnout.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/podcast-689-email-is-making-us-miserable-heres-what-to-do-about-it/\">AoM Podcast #689: Email Is Making Us Miserable — Here's What to Do About It</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/monotasking-podcast/\">AoM Podcast #768: Become a Focused Monotasker</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/podcast-743-how-to-get-time-priorities-and-energy-working-in-your-favor/\">AoM Podcast #743: How to Get Time, Energy, and Priorities Working in Your Favor</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Rob Cross</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.robcross.org/\">Rob's Website</a></li><li><a href=\"https://connectedcommons.com/\">The Connected Commons</a></li></ul><p> </p>\n",
