  "description": "In late 2001 Finland became the darling of the education and policy communities, as its students toped the reading literacy, mathematics, and science PISA test rankings. While these results were somewhat of a surprise to Finns, the outcomes persisted throughout subsequent cross-national examinations. Policymakers and educators from across the world have since been fascinated as to how the Scandinavian country created such a successful system. Was it the teachers? The students? The schools? In Finnish Lessons 2.0: What Can the World Learn from Educational Change in Finland? (Teachers College Press, 2014), Dr. Pasi Sahlberg, visiting professor at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, explains the nuances of his homeland’s educational system and even its historical foundations in this new updated version. The book offers lessons that can be understood by policymakers in other systems, but also provides a strong counter to the Global Education Reform Movement (GERM), which, dubbed by Dr. Sahlberg, is led by calls for increased standardized testing, school competition, and privatization. Above all, Dr. Sahlberg hopes that this book and the Finnish experience can put faith back into the idea of public education.\n\nDr. Sahlberg joins New Books in Education for the interview and you can follow him on Twitter at @pasi_sahlberg or find his website at pasisahlberg.com.
