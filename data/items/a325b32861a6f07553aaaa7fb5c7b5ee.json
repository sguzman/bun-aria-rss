  "description": "<p>Imagine this, your 12 years old again and your mom dropped you off at a friends earlier in the evening. The wind is howling, the sounds of bats flying around, and sticks falling to the ground are sneaking in through the backdoor of the basement you just cracked open as quiet as possible. Did anyone hear? Let's hope not ... because it's<strong> 1 AM</strong> and you <strong>can't get caught sneaking out</strong>. Especially because tonight is a big deal, it's your <strong>first time</strong> getting high. You can't f*ck this up. Next thing you know your lips are inside a musty Gatorade bottle and you're inhaling like your life depends on it. \"I need more!\" you demand. Thoughts are calm inside your head because <em>\"No one gets high they're first time\" </em>At least that's what you were told. F*ck were those kids wrong. <strong>YOU'RE BAKED ...&nbsp;</strong></p>\n",
