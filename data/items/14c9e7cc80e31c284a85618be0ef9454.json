  "description": "Listen to the debut episode of 'All Things Covered with Patrick Peterson and Bryant McFadden' with special guest Tyrann Mathieu. ﻿\nWeek 2 just wrapped up in the NFL but it's Week 1 for the All Things Covered podcast. On this debut episode, co-hosts Patrick Peterson and Bryant McFadden catch up on the Cardinals season (8:30), injuries around the league and their beloved Lakers before welcoming a very special guest and former teammate of Pat's, Tyrann Mathieu (36:30). First, meet your hosts beyond the football field. Now that that's settled, the Cardinals are off to a 2-0 start and Kyler Murray is firmly in the MVP discussion. How is P2 and the squad feeling? Plus, let's address it now...Pat's in a contract year and with lots of recent DB deals, there's speculation about his future in the desert. What's his mentality this season? The guys discuss the injuries that were suffered around the league before jumping outside of football into the world of basketball and golf. For this week's 'Memory Lane' segment we revisit the famous moment where Pat struck the Heisman pose in the endzone while at LSU. '21 Questions' features a prompt about which wide receivers he wishes he had the chance to match up against. Then it's time for Honey Badger. Pat and Tyrann go back a long ways and explain their relationship from their time at LSU to Arizona to now. Who's the real DBU? After talking to these guys, it seems like there's no room for debate. The Chiefs are also 2-0, after barely clinging onto an overtime victory vs. the Chargers this past weekend. But can you ever doubt a comeback when you have Patrick Mahomes on your side? Tyrann continues on to discuss Kansas City's title defense and upcoming Monday Night Football matchup vs. Lamar Jackson and the Ravens. He shares the best games of his career before answering Superlatives with us.\n\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
