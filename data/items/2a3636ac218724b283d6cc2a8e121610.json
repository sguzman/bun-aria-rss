  "description": "<p>In this episode we're chatting about what it feels like to allow ourselves to be fully seen, to be vulnerable and raw. And we're talking about life in small-town America... how moving to a place that needs you and your skills and your talents might be a great option for you. <br/><br/>Let's break down the reasons you might wanna consider some of the off-the-beaten-path towns that don't check all the boxes but just might be a perfect backdrop for starting your own unconventional homestead.
