  "description": "<p>Kilmainham Gaol is an immense structure found in Dublin, Ireland that holds a place in the annals of Ireland's fight for independence and has a history that spans over two centuries. Today, it is the largest unoccupied prison in the country and is now a museum, but at one time it was home for hundreds of prisoners and was the scene of many executions. Those prisoners included not only notable revolutionaries, but also ordinary men, women and yes, children. And now it seems to be home for the spirits of several of these former occupants. Kilmainham Gaol is rumored to be haunted. The Moment in Oddity features the Legend of the Ourang Medan (very strange story) and This Day in History features the first female pharmacist Susan Hayhurst.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/03/hgb-podcast-34-kilmainham-gaol.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/03/hgb-podcast-34-kilmainham-gaol.html</a></p>",
