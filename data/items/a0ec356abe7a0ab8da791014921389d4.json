  "description": "We've got a PACKED show today. First, SB Champion, Pro Bowler, and 6th pick of the 1994 NFL Draft, Trent Dilfer joins the show. Pat and Trent put to rest some disparaging comments Trent has made about The Brand in the past, Trent walks us through his training with Tua and why he knew he was going to be successful, what kind of involvement he had in pitching Tua to prospective NFL teams, and whether he plans to continue this type of training in the future (00:00:38-17:01). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where AJ and Pat discuss everything going on in the NFL including the market for Jadeveon Clowney, this potentially being Drew Brees' last year, Jameis Winston getting Lasic and whether or not the Saints envision him as their potential quarterback of the future, if selecting your number is a big deal in the NFL, and their thoughts on Mike Tyson coming out of retirement to potentially box in some exhibition matches and who the ideal opponents would be (19:13-1:33:05). Next, National Champion and the 22nd pick of this year's NFL Draft, new Minnesota Vikings WR, Justin Jefferson joins the show. Pat and Justin chat about what his experience was like at LSU, if the perception of Coach O is the same as the reality, what he's looking forward to in Minnesota, his workout plans to stay in shape during quarantine, and what he thinks his first purchase will be with his new money (1:35:19-1:45:49). Closing out the show is Pittsburgh radio stalwart and host of The Mark Madden Show on 105.9 The X, former WCW color commentator, Super Genius, and the best heel in the business, Mark Madden. Pat and Mark chat about why he thinks sports won't be coming back for a long time, and it might be a different reason than you think. They also discuss his time in WCW and whether or not he would entertain offers from the WWE or AEW, his thoughts on the report that Jameis Winston was offered a more lucrative contract with the Steelers that he turned down, and what Mark would do if he were in Aaron Rodgers' shoes (1:48:14-2:12:16). Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch, and have a safe and relaxing weekend. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
