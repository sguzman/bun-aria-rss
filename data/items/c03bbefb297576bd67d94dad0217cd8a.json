  "description": "<p><a href=\"http://cruxwinery.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Crux Winery</a> owners Brian Callahan and Steven Gower (some of the nicest dudes you ever want to meet) craft small lots of Rhône varietals–Grenache, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Mourvèdre, Grenache Blanc and Viognier–with some Zinfandel and Sauvignon Blanc. Their wines capture the unique characteristics of Sonoma County’s Russian River Valley and are rich, complex and balanced, without excessive alcohol levels or overripe fruit flavors.</p> <p> </p> <p>One amazing thing about these guys (there are a few): This is their <em>other</em> job. They each hold down big corporate jobs in the health sector and have given up all spare time to dedicate their lives to making insanely good wine farmed in a sustainable and earth-friendly manner. Their grapes are sourced from their own vineyards and other select vineyard sites owned by growers with a similar philosophy who have also embraced environmental practices in vineyard management.</p> <p> </p> <p>Some topics we cover:</p> <ul> <li>How they wound up finding each other and getting into winemaking</li> <li>How they decided to take the business to the next level</li> <li>The balancing act of holding down corporate jobs and running a winery -- holding down 2 full time jobs! </li> <li>The business of wine versus their corporate jobs</li> <li>Terroir, native yeast, and doing Rhône in Russian River Valley</li> <li>The grapes and the wine -- how they grow or source the fruit, how they make wine, and why the stuff is so outstanding! </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>A fantastic look at these guys are hustling, making fantastic wine, and keeping their dream alive to eventually give up their day jobs and be winemakers and winegrowers full time.  </p> <p>They, of course, will be at <a href= \"https://undergroundwineevents.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Sonoma Underground on February 24, 2018 at Longboard Vineyards in Sonoma</a>. </p> <p>  </p> <p><strong>Thanks to our (delicious) sponsor, HelloFresh:</strong><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/hellofresh-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"112\" height=\"103\" /></p> <p>A meal kit delivery service that shops, plans and delivers your favorite step-by-step recipes and pre-measured ingredients so you can just cook, eat and enjoy!
