    "media:description": "Fleeting Time is a film about two friends who must face their differences in lifespan. \n\nAfter two and a half weeks of hard work, the film is finally completed! This is one of the most complex films I have made to date. I hope you enjoy!\n\nA MASSIVE thank you to @Kuri_Woo for composing the entire film score!!! You are awesome to work with and you somehow captured the mood perfectly despite my absurdly vague feedback, haha. Without your help, this film would not have been nearly the same.\nhttps://twitter.com/Kuri_Woo\n\nAnd thank you to my viewers who helped me create the environments and bits of storytelling for this little world! I hope we can continue creating stories together ðŸ˜Ž\n\nWebsite, for all of my artworks and content:\nhttps://myxoch.com\n\nTwitter, to keep up to date:\nhttps://twitter.com/CrashLandStudio\n\nDiscord, to get more involved:\nhttps://discord.gg/FkWtKHc3V2\n\nThanks for stopping by!",
