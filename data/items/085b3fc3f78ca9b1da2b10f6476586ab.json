  "description": "<p>Let the pressure from your day become a warm sleepy steam. Scoots will cook up a meander filled dinner just in time for St. Paddy’s Day.   If you’re a fan of Sleep With Me, you probably enjoy myths, legends, and folklore. Well, let me tell you about a new podcast I love called Tales. Each episode of Tales presents the original Fairy Tale— not the popular, watered-down versions you are accustomed to hearing. You think you know the story, but do you really?   Visit Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Spotify, GooglePlay, or where ever you listen to podcasts and search for Tales.     Or visit <a href=\"https://www.parcast.com/tales\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.parcast.com/tales</a> to start listening now.   Commission a Song from Jonathan Mann @ <a href=\"http://song.jonathanmann.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">song.jonathanmann.net</a>   Thanks to all the listeners who barter pizzas and coffees for a month a good sleep by becoming patrons @ <a href=\"http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/patron\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/patron</a>   Get an Instapot on Amazon using our affiliate link! <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2FKMHQV\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://amzn.to/2FKMHQV</a></p>",
