    "media:description": "Minecraft Speedrunner VS 2 Assassins You asked for it. This was INCREDIBLE.\nDownload Monster Legends now: https://monsterlegends.onelink.me/X4Sc/SuperDream\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nMerch: https://www.dreams.is\n\nGeorge:   @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap:   @Sapnap \n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt Assassins. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is not one hunter but TWO instead of just one.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\nThis video, my friends can one shot me in Minecraft. If they hit me at all, I die, and I lose. If I look at them, they are frozen with lazer beams on them. They can't move or hit me at all. They have to sneak up on me.\n\nIf this video gets 2,000,000 likes we'll do a rematch!\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\n#MinecraftManhunt #Assassins",
