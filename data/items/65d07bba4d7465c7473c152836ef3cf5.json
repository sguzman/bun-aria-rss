  "description": "Matthew Sullivan is a pioneer of the security token industry. He’s CEO of QuantmRE, a platform where homeowners can tokenize a stake in their homes in exchange for loan-free cash.    This incredible business model could revolutionize the way we think about home ownership. But it undoubtedly leaves homeowners and investors alike with lots of questions. I ask them all on today’s show, and you’ll be impressed with Matthew’s answers. This multitrillion-dollar industry is low-hanging fruit for the digital security industry [19:10].   Long-time listeners know Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday. So in an effort to keep my podcast short this week, I don’t have an educational segment. Happy Thanksgiving! Enjoy your family, food, and football—and thanks for being a listener. -------------------------------- Enjoyed this episode?   Get Wall Street Unplugged delivered FREE to your inbox every Wednesday: https://www.curzioresearch.com/wall-street-unplugged/   --------------------------------   Wall Street Unplugged podcast is available at: --: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wall-street-unplugged-frank/ -- : https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/curzio-research/wall-street-unplugged-2 -- : https://www.curzioresearch.com/category/podcast/wall-street-unplugged/   : https://twitter.com/frankcurzio :. https://www.facebook.com/CurzioResearch/ : https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-curzio-690561a7/ : https://www.curzioresearch.com",
