Listen to more here: https://scishow-tangents.simplecast.com\n\nWhen we started recording this episode about pee, it occurred to us that we had a perfectly good YouTube channel dedicated to Pee just gathering dust! So we recorded our Google Hangout and are posting an entire, uncut SciShow Tangents recording session for the first time ever! \n\nYou can help support the show (and get a ton of bonus goodies, like exclusive episodes)  by becoming a patron on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/SciShowTangents",
