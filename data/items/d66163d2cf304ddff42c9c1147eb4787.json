Moreover, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to a intoxicated man in Turkey, who decided to join a search party for someone who had been reported missing. He, however, didn't realize that he was the \"missing\" person in question. Also, we opened up the phone lines for \"Freaky Friday\" to see what our listeners do to make them last longer in the bedroom, after a clip from \"Lip Service\" podcast surfaced.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
