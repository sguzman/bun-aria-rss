  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">The CEOs of Facebook and Twitter testified before Congress this week about the toxic spread of misinformation on their platforms and the harm it causes to society. Sadly, many Christians are complicit in this trend. Daniel Darling is back to talk about how Christians must change the way we engage social media if there’s any hope of redeeming it. Also this week, Trump’s favorite television preachers have made a spectacle of praying for a miraculous election victory, but when does Christian prayer deteriorate into pagan magic? The crew discusses a new study about megachurches, why they’re growing even larger, how fewer are identifying as “evangelical,” and whether the pandemic will cause anyone to rethink the model. Also, Canada experiments with giving money to homeless people, and R.I.P. Sausage King of Russia.</p> <p class=\"p1\"><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-leaf-project-results-1.5752714\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-leaf-project-results-1.5752714\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-leaf-project-results-1.5752714</a></p> <p class=\"p1\"><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"http://hirr.hartsem.edu/megachurch/megachurches.html\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"http://hirr.hartsem.edu/megachurch/megachurches.html\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">http://hirr.hartsem.edu/megachurch/megachurches.html</a><br />  <br /> <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2020/september-web-only/single-women-manhood-church-growth-gender-ratios-church.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2020/september-web-only/single-women-manhood-church-growth-gender-ratios-church.html\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2020/september-web-only/single-women-manhood-church-growth-gender-ratios-church.html</a></p>",
