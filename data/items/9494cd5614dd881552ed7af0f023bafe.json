  "description": "<p>Griff Green is a builder and community manager in the Ethereum space. He is also a hippie, a former chemical engineer, and Seattle Supersonics super-fan. A true individual, Griff opted out of society after becoming disillusioned with modern institutions, traveling in a van with gold and silver until he heard about Bitcoin.</p> <p>Falling down the crypto rabbit hole led Griff to become a deep Ethereum community member, eventually launching The DAO. The story of the DAO's beginnings, hack, and eventual hard for are the stuff of Sci-Fi. Filled with countless stories, this episode follows the life and times of a deeply fascinating member of Layer Zero.</p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 📣 DHARMA | Trade on Polygon!<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Dharma\">https://bankless.cc/dharma</a> <br />  ------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>💰 GEMINI | FIAT & CRYPTO EXCHANGE<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/go-gemini%E2%80%8B\">https://bankless.cc/go-gemini​</a> </p> <p>💧LIDO | DECENTRALIZED STAKING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Lido\">https://bankless.cc/Lido</a> </p> <p>👻 AAVE | LEND & BORROW ASSETS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/aave\">https://bankless.cc/aave</a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 4:00 Griff Green & the SuperSonics<br /> 13:34 Chemical Engineering<br /> 18:20 Bankless with Gold<br /> 21:51 Bitcoin & Traveling<br /> 29:44 Into the Crypto World<br /> 35:07 Crypto Masters Degree<br /> 38:00 Ethereum Arrives<br /> 44:43 Entering the Community<br /> 51:29 Culture vs Price<br /> 56:00 Early Ethereum Culture<br /> 1:02:43 The DAO<br /> 1:07:20 Coming up with the DAO<br /> 1:13:25 Exploits<br /> 1:16:46 The DAO Token Creation<br /> 1:23:20 Explosion & Speculation<br /> 1:27:29 The Hack & Hard Fork<br /> 1:36:00 Dark DAO and Ethereum Classic<br /> 1:40:12 Hard Fork & Edge Cases<br /> 1:46:58 Lessons Learned<br /> 1:49:24 The Next 4 Years & Giveth<br /> 2:02:10 Closing</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Griff on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/thegrifft?s=20\">https://twitter.com/thegrifft?s=20</a> </p> <p>Giveth:<br /> <a href=\"https://giveth.io/\">https://giveth.io/</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
