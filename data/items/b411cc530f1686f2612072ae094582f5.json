  "description": "<p>We investigate modifications of hadron masses at finite quark chemical\npotential in two-flavor and two-color QCD, of which the data are available from\nlattice simulations, within a linear sigma model based on approximate\nPauli-Gursey $SU(4)$ symmetry. The model describes not only ground-state scalar\ndiquarks and pseudo-scalar mesons but also the excited pseudo-scalar diquarks\nand scalar mesons; each ground-state diquark (meson) has the corresponding\nexcited diquark (hadron) with opposite parity as a chiral partner. Effects of\nchiral symmetry breaking and diquark condensates are incorporated by a\nmean-field treatment. We show that various mixings among the hadrons, which are\ntriggered by the breakdown of baryon number conservation in the superfluid\nphase, lead to a rich hadron mass spectrum. We discuss the influence of\n$U(1)_A$ anomaly on the density dependence of the mass spectrum and also\nmanifestations of the chiral partner structures as density increases in the\nsuperfluid phase. The predicted hadron masses are expected to provide future\nlattice simulations with useful information on such symmetry properties in\ndense two-color QCD.\n</p>",
