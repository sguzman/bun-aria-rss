Deb & Karen turn into vandals, Peyton gets a break from the weepies, and Haley is making us all cringe. </p>\n<p>Memories are the theme of this episode as they're being made, erased, grieved and it's all tied together with a cameo from The Notebook. A film which, incidentally, featured our very own Paul Johnasson. AND, fun fact, Joy was so inspired by The Notebook when she first saw/read it that she couldn't rest until she had turned it into a full-fledged, produced, staged musical (which starred OTH \"movie Lucas\" Paul Teal as Noah). </p>\n<p>We'll share 5 demos of Joy's original songs inspired by this epic story!!</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
