  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking. Today's stream of questions start with one concerning a stock I recommended over a year ago - Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co (CTO). Odds are - you've never heard of this company. The business is boring. And you won't find much news on it. But I've seen this company grow firsthand - practically in my own backyard. One year later, I still see upside potential. Tune in as I break down the details... Also, my newsletter, Curzio Venture Opportunities, is approaching just its fourth month since launching in November. And it’s been a wild ride ever since. However, I've been recently getting tons of questions on how to access the newsletter. Well, for those interested, I'll be giving away everything you need to know on how to join. But I'll warn you... Not everyone is qualified. And if the price is too high, please, don't worry. I might of spoke too much already. But today I announce that we have something else in the works... My next question covers today’s main segment [17:16]. Since the Trump election, we’ve spent a lot of time focusing on a variety of small-caps. But there are stocks we simply cannot forget, regardless of new policies... Most of these companies have been around for decades. Whether the market is up or down, these management teams have been through it all. I can guarantee it. More importantly, markets are cyclical. Which means plenty of well-known, safe stocks are still out there - just weeks away from rebounding. Today I share a few names I have in mind. Other questions covered include; Northern Dynasty's (NAK) recent capital raise, the CES, and my formula for investing dangerous small-cap biotechs. Special thanks to Michael, Joel, Brian, Paul, and Greg. Keep the questions coming!",
