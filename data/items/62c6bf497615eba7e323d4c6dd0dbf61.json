  "description": "Markets are in wait-and-see mode ahead of today’s Federal Reserve announcement, which is expected to include a 75-point (0.75%) interest rate hike. Frank and I (Daniel) will go over the Fed’s decision in detail on tomorrow’s podcast. I start today’s show with some drastic advice from Jeff Gundlach, the “Bond King”... who wants the Fed to raise rates dramatically at its meeting today. I also break down some recent government policies that could have a big effect on gas prices and investment returns in the energy sector.  Plus, I share some of the characteristics of the best stocks to buy in a bear market… and a few companies that should be on every investor’s watchlist right now. In this episode:  What the “Bond King” thinks the Fed should do [1:15] Why politics are pushing up energy prices [7:10]  How companies can fight back against anti-energy policies [12:45]  Fundamentals matter again… Here’s what to look for [17:25] Stocks that belong on your watchlist [19:30]  Enjoyed this episode?
