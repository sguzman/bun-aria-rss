  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, despite a laundry list of criminal charges the domestic terrorist arrested for mailing 13 bombs cannot be a registered Republican if his voting rights were stripped due to his felony convictions. Without clemency from the State of Florida this individual can't be registered as anything since he should be removed from the voter rolls and barred from voting. Yet the media is touting the idea that he was a registered republican despite giving a pass to domestic terrorists.  It's surprising that someone with criminal record this long, dating back to 1991, isn't in prison. Thankfully the excellent work of local, state, and federal law enforcement will put this person behind bars.  Also, the left media continues to blame President Trump's rhetoric for everything, yet are silent when letters with Ricin are mailed to Republicans including the First Family, Senator Susan Collins, Gen Mattis and others.  Later, we have a solution to the illegal alien caravan: since Justin Trudeau has opened Canada to illegal aliens, Trump can ask Trudeau how many caravan travelers he wants and put them on Greyhound buses to Canada. Finally, Rep Barbara Comstock calls in to update us on her campaign for Virginia’s 10th Congressional District.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
