    "media:description": "What are the origins and genetic makeup of the Vietnamese, Cambodians and other Austroasiatic people? Vietnam and Cambodia have a very ancient history that is linked to many major civilizations of East, South and Southeast Asia, and today, we're going to see how they have impacted and been impacted by these groups in the past several thousand years. We're also going to be taking a look at some of the smaller Austroasiatic groups related to the larger Kinh and Khmer that you've probably never heard of such as the Mon, Nicobarese, Orang Asli and Munda, who are all scattered far and wide.\n\nIn today's video, we're going to be discussing just how and why they got there and why they all have such a diverse array of appearance, culture and genetics.
