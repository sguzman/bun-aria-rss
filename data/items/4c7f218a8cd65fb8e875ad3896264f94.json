  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, some parts of the media are repulsive with their reporting on the Mueller report. The Democrats love the slanted reporting because it helps their attacks on President Trump. Despite the fact that Robert Mueller found no collusion and made no charges, under seal or otherwise, on the allegations of obstruction of justice. Yet Trump and his legal team made a million documents available, waived executive privilege and allowed Mueller to interview his White House lawyer. If Mueller were a regular U.S. Attorney he'd be disbarred for writing such political fiction. A prosecutor's report is always confidential but Mueller's was made public by AG William Barr at Trump's request to be transparent and set the record straight. Then, according to Germen-American propagandist Edward Bernays, \"[T]he new propaganda...takes account not merely of the individual, nor even of the mass mind alone, but also of the anatomy of society, with its interlocking group formations and loyalties... Touch a nerve at a sensitive spot and you get an automatic response from certain specific members of the organism.\" Lamentably, this describes many in our media today. Later, if Congress gets away with subpoenaing 10 years of the personal tax returns of a sitting president, and that of his businesses, and his children—then they will get away doing the same to a supreme court justice or even worse, to you and me and our children! This is the tyranny that the Democrats are pushing. Afterward, the media has had laser-focus on the Australian man that slaughtered beautiful Muslims praying in New Zealand, because they tried to tie Trump to it, but the Islamist suicide bombings of Christians in Sri Lanka on Easter seems to be of less consequence since Trump isn't their scapegoat this time.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
