  "description": "<p>Being born into poverty does not usually relegate someone into a life of opulence and superstardom; a fame so great that everyone knows the person by just one name. Such was the life of Elvis Presley. It was a life cut short 38 years ago this month, but the legacy of Elvis lives on whether it be his influence on music, style or entertainment. After his death, it was popular for there to be sightings of Elvis. Some thought he faked his death so he could live a normal life. While many sightings have been of fully alive people who happened to look like the man dubbed \"The King of Rock and Roll,\" other sightings have been of a ghostly image of Elvis. On this episode, we explore the life and afterlife of Elvis Presley. The Moment in Oddity features La Pascualita (a life-like mannequin) and This Day in History features the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/08/hgb-podcast-ep-63-life-and-afterlife-of.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/08/hgb-podcast-ep-63-life-and-afterlife-of.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer for the podcast for as little as $1 a month!
