  "description": "<p>Robotics is used to foster creativity. Humans can perform jobs in their\nunique manner, depending on the circumstances. This situation applies to food\ncooking. Robotic technology in the kitchen can speed up the process and reduce\nits workload. However, the potential of robotics in the kitchen is still\nunrealized. In this essay, the idea of FOON, a structural knowledge\nrepresentation built on insights from human manipulations, is introduced. To\nreduce the failure rate and ensure that the task is effectively completed,\nthree different algorithms have been implemented where weighted values have\nbeen assigned to the manipulations depending on the success rates of motion.\nThis knowledge representation was created using videos of open-sourced recipes\n</p>",
