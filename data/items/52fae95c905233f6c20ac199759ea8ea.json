  "description": "<p>Have you ever experienced the radiant states of consciousness that is available to you through Breathwork? It is one of the most incredible experiences I’ve had and truly one of the missing links to full integration. In this weeks episode, I’m joined by Hellé Weston on this deep dive into the higher stages of consciousness available to you through breath. We talk about how trauma is stored in the body, the balance between accepting and transforming circumstances in your life, acceptance vs transformation, how trauma is stored in the body and how she came to begin channeling a group of intergalactic beings called the Arcturians through breathwork. She then live channels a message for them for us on the episode.
