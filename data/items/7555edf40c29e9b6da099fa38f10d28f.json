  "description": "<p>What we are able to have, give, do and become in our lives is largely determined by how we choose to spend our time. Seneca said, “It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested.”</p> <p>A big secret to success in life is learning how to focus on what really matters. And at no other point in human history has focus been such a hugely scarce commodity. If you can reacquire your focus, and place it intently on the thing that matters most, then there’s absolutely no limit to what you can achieve. That’s why I had to talk with Jay Papasan.</p> <p>Jay is the co-author of the bestselling, mega-hit book The One Thing. Today he’s here to share with you some priceless wisdom to help you live the life you want, break through your mental barriers, and become the best version of yourself.
