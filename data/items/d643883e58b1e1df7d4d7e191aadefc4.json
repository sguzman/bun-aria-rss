  "description": "When your child says something like \"I just saw a komodo dragon in my room!\" or \"I drove the bus home from school today!\", your first impulse might be to say, \"Sweetie, that's not true.\" But here's the thing: There's always a truth in every lie. In this week's episode, Dr. Becky talks to three parents about a new approach to lying - one that involves responding with curiosity so you can find out what's really going on with your child. She explores how to unpack a child's imaginative stories and respond in ways that build connection... without encouraging dishonesty. From engaging in play to modeling recovery from a lie, you'll learn multiple different strategies for getting to the kernel of truth your child is trying to communicate.\n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
