  "description": "Young climate activists from nations bearing the brunt of climate change speak out. In this <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2293938-cop26-news-daily-updates-from-the-global-climate-summit-in-glasgow/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">COP26 special</a>, hear the moving and impassioned words of the young voices representing the plight of the Global South, as they demand action and reparations. As the climate summit comes to an end, the team in Glasgow reflect on their experiences of the event, and unpack the pledges and <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2297225-cop26-new-alliance-commits-to-ending-oil-and-gas-extraction/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commitments </a>that have been made. Ahead of the release of the official cover decision - the document that will outline the main outcome of the event - the team explains what we know so far. This includes a joint declaration put out by the US and China - an unexpected but welcome message of hope. They also discuss the developed world’s attempts to make up for breaking the promise made in Paris - the payment of $100 billion that was meant to help developing countries tackle climate change. The team ends by looking to the positives, and discussing the post-Glasgow path ahead. On the pod are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rowhoop\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rowan Hooper</a>, Penny Sarchet, Richard Webb, Adam Vaughan and special guest, climate scientist Emily Shuckburgh of the University of Cambridge. Finally, Paris 2015 legend Christiana Figueres pops up to give a message of optimism.
