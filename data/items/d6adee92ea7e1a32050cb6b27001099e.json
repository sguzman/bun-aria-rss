DeepMind&#8217;s <strong>AlphaFold 2</strong> has been said to &#8220;solve&#8221; a longstanding problem in molecular biology, known as protein structure prediction. Recently, <strong>DALL-E 2</strong> demonstrated the ability to generate amazing art and photo-realistic images based only on simple text prompts. Imagine that &#8211; creating a realistic image out of just an idea!</p>\n<p>Just within the past week, <strong>DeepMind</strong> introduced &#8220;<strong>Gato</strong>&#8220;, which is what they call a &#8220;generalist agent&#8221;, an AI that can do multiple things, like chat (i.e. do NLP!), play Atari games, caption images (i.e. computer vision!), manipulate a real, physical robot arm to stack blocks, and more!</p>\n<p>Gato does all this by converting all the usual inputs from other domains into a sequence of tokens, so that they can be processed just like how we do in NLP. This is a great example of my oft-repeated rule, &#8220;all data is the same&#8221; (and also, another great reason to learn NLP since it would be a prerequisite to understanding this).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 3 []\">The course is split into 3 major parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Using Transformers (Beginner)</li>\n<li>Fine-Tuning Transformers (Intermediate)</li>\n<li>Transformers In-Depth (Expert &#8211; VIP only)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">In part 1, you will learn how to use transformers which were trained for you. This costs millions of dollars to do, so it&#8217;s not something you want to try by yourself!</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll see how these prebuilt models can already be used for a wide array of tasks, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>text classification (e.g. spam detection, sentiment analysis, document categorization)</li>\n<li>named entity recognition</li>\n<li>text summarization</li>\n<li>machine translation</li>\n<li>question-answering</li>\n<li>generating (believable) text</li>\n<li>masked language modeling (article spinning)</li>\n<li>zero-shot classification</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is already very practical.</p>\n<p>If you need to do sentiment analysis, document categorization, entity recognition, translation, summarization, etc. on documents at your workplace or for your clients &#8211; you already have the most powerful state-of-the-art models at your fingertips with very few lines of code.</p>\n<p>One of the most amazing applications is &#8220;zero-shot classification&#8221;, where you will observe that a pretrained model can categorize your documents, even without any training at all.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">In part 2, you will learn how to improve the performance of transformers on your own custom datasets. By using &#8220;transfer learning&#8221;, you can leverage the millions of dollars of training that have already gone into making transformers work very well.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll see that you can fine-tune a transformer for many of the above tasks with relatively little work (and little cost).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">In part 3 (the VIP sections), you will learn how transformers <em>really</em> work. The previous sections are nice, but a little too nice. Libraries are OK for people who just want to get the job done, but they don&#8217;t work if you want to do anything new or interesting.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: this is very practical.</p>\n<p>How practical, you might ask?</p>\n<p>Well, this is where the big bucks are.</p>\n<p>Those who have a deep understanding of these models and can do things no one has ever done before are in a position to command higher salaries and prestigious titles. Machine learning is a competitive field, and a deep understanding of how things work can be the edge you need to come out on top.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll also look at how to implement transformers from scratch.</p>\n<p>As the great Richard Feynman once said, &#8220;what I cannot create, I do not understand&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NOTES:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As usual, I wanted to get this course into your hands as early as possible! There are a few sections and lectures still in the works, including (but not limited to): <del>fine-tuning for question-answering, more theory about transformers, and implementing transformers from scratch</del>. As usual, I will update this post as new lectures are released. <strong>Update: all planned content has been released.</strong></li>\n<li>Everyone makes mistakes (including me)! Because this is such a large course, if I forgot anything (e.g. a Github link), just email me and let me know.</li>\n<li>Due to the way Udemy now works, if you purchase the course on deeplearningcourses.com, I cannot give you access to the Udemy version. It hasn&#8217;t always been this way, and Udemy has tended to make changes over the years that negatively impact both me and you, unfortunately.</li>\n<li>If you don&#8217;t know how &#8220;VIP courses&#8221; work, check out my post on that <a href=\"https://lazyprogrammer.me/how-do-vip-courses-work\">here</a>. Short version: deeplearningcourses.com always houses all the content (both VIP and non-VIP). Udemy will house all the content initially, but the VIP content is removed later on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>COMPLETED UPDATES:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fine-tuning for question-answering</li>\n<li>Transformers theory</li>\n<li>Transformers implementations from scratch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So what are you waiting for?
