    "media:description": "I was in Minneapolis, MN to file a series of Streetfilms but I was able to get away on a short excursion to see St. Paul for the first time (via the light rail and a MN Nice Ride bike share bike).\n\nOn short notice I met up with a nice group of riders in the know organized by Zach Menninger (the @PedalingProfessor) to take me to see some quick highlights in two hours. Although behind it's Twin City Minneapolis in bike infrastructure the city has begun to make progress on more bike improvements and dedicating itself to building protected bike lanes and not use paint on pavement any longer.",
