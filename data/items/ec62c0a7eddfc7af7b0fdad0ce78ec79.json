  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane's birthday is tomorrow and we have one state left in the 50 State Challenge. Barstool Nate pulls a dirtbag move against Blind Mike and Minihane erupts at... Chaps. Minihane reacts to the hilarious collapse of Deadspin and Dave Portnoy saying the Activists name on Barstool Sports Radio. Shagmag founder Julia Rose,  better known as the 25-year-old who showed off her boobs at the World Series game the other night, joins the show to talk about her stunt and her fundraising for cancer awareness. Blind Mike nails North Dakota good and hard, but South Dakota remains elusive. Rich Kelleher's continued descent into madness threatens to pull us all down with him. Dave Cullinane checks in for an update on the Gerry Callahan Show. The prayer vigil is still on... for now. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
