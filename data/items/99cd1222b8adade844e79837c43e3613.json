  "description": "<p>Today I sit down with the very amazing Noah Cyrus. Noah is a Grammy award-nominee, multi platinum, Nashville-born and Los Angeles-based singer and songwriter. Emerging in 2016 at the age of 16, she immediately captivated audiences with platinum singles \"Make Me (Cry)\" and Again. Noah teamed up with PJ Harding for the People Don't Change EP in 2021. Along the way, she performed at Coachella twice, while Billboard named her among its \"21 Under 21\" for three straight years. She also shined on The Late Late Show with James Corden, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Ellen, and The Today Show. Now, she introduces the next chapter with the \"I Burned LA Down\".</p><p>Noah shares to us a vulnerable side of her and how music has helped her heal from her past. Growing up she mentioned that self-love and self-acceptance was something that she never really practiced and is still a difficult thing to do at the present but she is a work in progress and even though life is full of ups and downs, she is moving forward. We also exchanged our thoughts on why change is inevitable for people and how we can be comfortable with it. Noah herself experienced a life changing experience and I am so honored to hear her story. </p><p>Checkout her latest album here: <a href=\"https://noahcyrus.lnk.to/thp\">https://noahcyrus.lnk.to/thp</a></p><p>What We Discuss:</p><ul><li>00:00:00 Intro</li><li>00:03:53 “I just wish the days are longer”</li><li>00:07:02 Healing our inner child</li><li>00:10:23 Self-acceptance and self-love</li><li>00:13:57 Healing through music</li><li>00:19:03 Falling out of love</li><li>00:23:27 Do people change?</li><li>00:28:23 Life changing experience</li><li>00:34:11 Worshiping other people</li><li>00:38:53 “I can” mentality</li><li>00:42:40 Noah on Many Sides To Us</li></ul><p>Episode Resources</p><ul><li>Noah Cyrus | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/noahcyrus/\">Instagram</a></li><li>Noah Cyrus | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/noahcyrus\">Twitter</a></li><li>Noah Cyrus | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NoahCyrus\">Facebook</a></li></ul><p>Do you want to meditate daily with me?
