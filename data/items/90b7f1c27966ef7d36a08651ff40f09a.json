  "description": "<p>Love them or hate them, protests are as American as apple pie. Each year thousands of people exercise their right to free speech and assembly, often to publicly denounce a policy, project or phenomenon. This is entirely legal, so long as the protestors have the right permits and things don't turn violent. However, many veteran protestors will tell you there's more going on behind the scenes. Most protestors, they argue, don't want things to devolve into physical conflict. However, those people wearing facemasks, throwing bricks and antagonizing the police aren't part of the actual gathering... instead, they're agents of something much more sinister. Tune in to learn more about how protests get infiltrated and compromised.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://static.macmillan.com/static/fib/stuff-you-should-read/\" rel=\"payment\">They don't want you to read our book.: https://static.macmillan.com/static/fib/stuff-you-should-read/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
