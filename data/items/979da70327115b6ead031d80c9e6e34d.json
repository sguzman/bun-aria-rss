  "description": "<p>What do you do when everything goes as you hoped, or perhaps even better than you hoped?  While it’s great to be able to produce our own food on the homestead, sometimes we find ourselves with a perishable bounty that needs to be dealt with.  On today’s episode, I explain how I’m dealing with an excess of eggs.  While selling some is always an option, listen to find out how I use this abundance in order to inspire new dishes.  I also share some of my favorite preservation techniques so you can still enjoy your eggs when they’re off-season.  If you have chickens on your homestead, this episode is a must listen! </p><p><br/></p><p>Links from show: </p><p>>> <a href='https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2016/03/ways-use-extra-eggs.html'>https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2016/03/ways-use-extra-eggs.html</a><br/>>> Butterscotch Pudding Recipe: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lu5bgXg0eo'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lu5bgXg0eo</a><br/>>> Hard Boiled Eggs in the Instant Pot: <a href='https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2016/04/instant-pot-hard-boiled-eggs.html'>https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2016/04/instant-pot-hard-boiled-eggs.html</a><br/>>> Homemade Pasta Recipe: <a href='https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2015/02/homemade-pasta-recipe.html'>https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2015/02/homemade-pasta-recipe.html</a><br/>>> Puffy Pancake Recipe: <a href='https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2015/10/apple-puff-pancake-recipe.html'>https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2015/10/apple-puff-pancake-recipe.html</a><br/>>> How to Freeze Eggs: <a href='https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2011/10/how-to-freeze-eggs.html'>https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2011/10/how-to-freeze-eggs.html</a></p><p><br/></p><p>>> Head over to <a href='http://www.theprairiehomestead.com/'>www.theprairiehomestead.com</a> for from-scratch recipes, homestead inspiration, and old-fashioned tutorials.<br/><br/>>> Get your Old-Fashioned on Purpose Swag at <a href='http://www.homesteadswag.com/'>www.homesteadswag.com</a><br/><br/>>> Follow Jill on YouTube: <a href='http://youtube.com/theprairiehomestead'>http://youtube.com/theprairiehomestead</a><br/>>> Follow Jill on Instagram: <a href='http://instagram/'>http://instagram</a>.com/theprairiehomestead<br/>>> Follow Jill on Facebook: <a href='http://facebook.com/theprairiehomestead'>http://facebook.com/theprairiehomestead</a></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>",
