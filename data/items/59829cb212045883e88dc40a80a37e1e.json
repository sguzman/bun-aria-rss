  "description": "<p>Darkness Radio presents Holzer's Ghosts: The Haunting of Lambert Castle Season with guests Barbara Davide & April Busset.</p>\n\n<p>Dave Schrader, lead investigator of The Holzer Files revisits this strange case from Patterson, NJ. A case that eluded Hans Holzer in life. Dr. Holzer was made aware of the case through a letter he had received from Barbara Davide. Ms. Davide stumbled upon the castle quite by accident and was stupefied to realize that she had been there before, but only in her dreams. She knew and understood the layout of the house as though she had lived there her whole life, she also knew some of it's secrets but had no way to account for that knowledge, that is why she sought the help of Dr. Holzer.</p>\n\n<p>Try as he might, Dr. Holzer was never able to make it to Lambert Castle, things would always happen to keep him from getting to his destination and uncovering the truth. Dave, Cindy and Shane set their sights on finishing what Dr. Holzer could not seem to get started and were blown away by the accounts of activity, the strange family history, and the mystery that would tie Barbara Davide to this house. Tonight, we discuss this case with Barbara Davide, and a witness of the ghostly antics of the house, April Busset. This is a case of hauntings, forbidden memories, possible reincarnation and unsettled spirits.</p>\n\n<p>For more info on Lambert Castle: <a href=\"http://www.lambertcastle.org/\">www.LambertCastle.org</a></p>\n\n<p>Visit April here: <a href=\"http://www.intuitiveapril.com/\">www.IntuitiveApril.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Order Barbara Davide's book: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1686796730?ref=exp_darknessradiodave_dp_vv_d&fbclid=IwAR182wcDes0C1swezcHYiobfaxylsZ7C_6__Zmc4b0PITLdpNwvHzhsJcuM\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1686796730?ref=exp_darknessradiodave_dp_vv_d</a> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n",
