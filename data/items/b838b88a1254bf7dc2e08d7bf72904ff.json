He saw: 1) A God who is not boring; 2) A God who is holy; and 3) A God who is on a mission.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 11, 2011. Series: Theophany: Anticipations of Jesus in the Old Testament. Scripture: Isaiah 6:1-8.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
