  "title": "73 - Digital Immortality",
  "description": "<p>I recently watched the new 4th season of Black Mirror on Netflix, and, if this season has a theme, I’d say it’s the concept of digital immortality. Can human consciousness be transferred into digital form? And, if so, is this digital version of ourselves as alive as the old carbon-based model? I keep thinking about this possibility, because, for the first time in human history, it does seem possible. And I’m not the only person who thinks so. We talk a lot about the past here on Timesuck, and we will again, but, we’re going to talk about the future. A future of very exciting and mind-bending possibilities. Dissected and discussed today, on Timesuck! </p>\n<p>Today's Timesuck is brought to you by Leesa Mattresses.
