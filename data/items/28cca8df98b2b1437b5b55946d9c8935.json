  "description": "<p>Moms hear a lot of messages when they scroll through their news feeds; \"You are doing enough. If you just love your kids, you're doing a good job. It's okay to be falling apart, we all are.\" While those messages might offer some temporary help, are they the whole truth? In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss what it looks like to give moms an injection of lasting hope and how to discern messages that are contrary to the gospel. Moms need more than just sips from the water-bucket of mom culture, they need help and encouragement from the eternal, life-giving well of Jesus.</p> <p>Like what you hear?
