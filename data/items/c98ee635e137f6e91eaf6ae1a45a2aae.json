  "description": "\n<img src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.png?id=28133682&width=980\"/><br/><br/><p>Join Teledyne SP Devices for an introduction to our Pulse Detection Range eXtension (PDRX) technology. It achieves a dynamic range equivalent to 16-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) while exceeding the sampling rate supported by commercially available devices. It is ideal for pulse capture in applications such as mass spectrometry. <a href=\"https://go.teledynelecroy.com/pdrx_webinar_ieee\" target=\"_blank\">Register now for this free webinar!</a><br/></p><hr/><p><strong>Topics covered in this webinar:</strong></p><ul><li>PDRX principles and architecture</li><li>Real-time digital signal processing overview</li><li>Challenges and solutions associated with increased dynamic range</li><li>ADQ32-PDRX – the first digitizer based on PDRX with 2.5 GSPS sampling rate</li></ul><p><strong>Who should attend?</strong> Developers working with high-speed time-domain data acquisition where dynamic range is important.</p><p><strong>What attendees will learn?</strong> The underlying principles of the PDRX technology and how it can help improve the dynamic range.
