  "description": "<p>In episode three of this five-part miniseries on the Iowa caucuses, we dive into the all-important race to lock down the state’s key endorsements. These campaign surrogates, always critical, loom particularly large for the five US Senators running who may have to spend the bulk of January in impeachment hearings. We’ll also dig into all the criticisms of the Iowa caucuses, from the demographics of the state to the charge that the caucuses themselves are undemocratic. Plus: a ukulele. The series is hosted by Tommy Vietor and produced by Pineapple Street Studios.</p><p> </p><p></p>\n",
