  "description": "This week Alaina’s got a two parter, pretty close to home for us! Tony Costa, a hippie living around Provincetown in the 60’s, was a real shady character from the start. When he was a teenager he straight up broke into the home of a girl two years younger than him, proceeded to drag her down the stairs, and later told police he, “just wanted to talk to her!” Ok, Tony. It only gets weirder from there. Patricia Walsh and Mary Ann Wysocki head to the cape for a relaxing weekend getaway and meet Tony during their stay. Interestingly enough, they never return home and Tony is the last person to see them.\n<br>\n\nAlaina recommends the book, In His Garden by Leo Damore \n<br>\n\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors\n<br>\n\nSquareSpace: Check Out <a href=\"http://Squarespace.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">Squarespace.com/MORBID</a> for a free trial!
