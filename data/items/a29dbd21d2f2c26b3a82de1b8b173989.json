  "description": "<p>Do you feel your art needs to be beautiful? And if so, what do you mean by beauty? We dive into this topic because we are both thinking about this idea as our work morphs and changes. We discuss the role of beauty in art history and how much of the art that we love is NOT beautiful - and yet how we are still drawn to creating beauty in our own work. In the beginning, perhaps, we both aimed for beauty because it was a measure of our skill level - but once we attained those skills, we seem drawn to pushing the boundaries. But how much imperfection can we allow in? How much raw expression is too much? Of course these questions are personal to each one of us, and we hope this discussion helps you think about beauty in your own work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Drew Steinbrecher on Instagram <a href=\"\">https://www.instagram.com/drewsteinbrecher/?hl=en</a></p>\n<p>Dead Eyes podcast <a href=\"\">https://headgum.com/dead-eyes</a></p>\n<p>Creative Pep Talk podcast <a href=\"\">https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/zdqvn-3717c/Creative-Pep-Talk-Podcast</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
