  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Should the United States compensate the descendants of African slaves? If so, what should that compensation look like? And what does Christian faith have to say about repentance and reparation for wrongs committed by prior generations?

Also this week, a church in Indiana is paying off medical debts. For the first time ever, Canada has surpassed the U.S. as the most welcoming country to refugees. That launches Phil and Skye into a history of U.S. immigration policies.
