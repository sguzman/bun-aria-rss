  "description": "In today's Daily Podcast we discuss the international response to ISIS, and the terror group's latest info ops. We cover the news from cyber gangland (and bid Paunch farewell as he enters a Russian prison) including malware developments and the latest criminal approaches to making their infrastructure resilient. We learn some things about competitions as a way of building the rising cyber labor force from Raytheon's Jack Harrington, and we hear about the challenges of cloud data security from University of Maryland's Jonathan Katz. It seems privacy is in tension not only with security, but with transparency as well. And we talk about what the metaphorical hat you wear says about you (you hacker, you).",
