  "description": "<p>Jerry and Susan McFalls split their time between two homes that they owned. One was in Littlefield, Arizona and the other was in West Jordan, Utah. Since they were retired, they spent most of the winter months at the Arizona property. On January 11, 2018, Susan texted her daughter-in-law, Meridee, letting her know they were going to be making the trip back to Utah that weekend. Jerry and Susan never made it back and were never seen again. When no one heard from them for several days, they began trying to track them down. They realized that no one had seen them during the time they planned to be in Utah. Meridee contacted law enforcement in Arizona to go check on them. A deputy went out to their home and all of their belongings, including vehicles, were there. Music was playing outside, the television was on, it appeared as though Susan was in the middle of cooking dinner. Despite many searches, no trace of Jerry and Susan has been found.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: On October 18, 2018, two sets of remains were located near the Virgin River Gorge.
