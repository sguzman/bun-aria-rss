  "description": "<p>If you choose to be in a relationship —long or short term— how do you go about picking the right person to spend your time with? And once you are in that relationship, how can you be a good partner? Can you avoid it ending badly? George Blair-West is a relationship expert, researcher, and doctor specializing in psychiatry with a private practice in Brisbane, Australia. He co-authored the book \"How to make the biggest decision of your life: Unlocking the secrets to a healthy lasting relationship” (Hachette Australia, 2021) with his daughter, a millennial dating coach. Today, he shares what he’s learned in his 25 years as a relationship therapist, debunks myths about love (is there such a thing as “The One”?), and suggests practices that can help build long-lasting relationships. In 2021, George and his wife celebrated 33 years of marriage.</p>",
