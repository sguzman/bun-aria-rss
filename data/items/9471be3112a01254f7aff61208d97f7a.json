  "description": "<p>Janet Mock, the transgender advocate, television host and New York Times best-selling author, discusses her powerful journey, the importance of speaking your truth, and becoming the person you know you were always meant to be. Janet offers insight into not only her transgender experience but also the importance of creating a vision for what is possible, and shows us how to see and accept one another through love. Janet's first memoir, \"Redefining Realness,\" details her bold and inspiring perspective on being young, multicultural and transgender in America. Janet says her journey is similar to that of many people: \"I think that we're all searching for the truth. I was constantly, as a person, going through this society trying to figure out who I was in relation to what people were telling me I should be. And so, for me, 'Redefining Realness' was about tapping into my most authentic self. Who am I to me?\"</p>\n",
