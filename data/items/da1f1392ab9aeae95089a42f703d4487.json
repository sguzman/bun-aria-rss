  "description": "<p>In today's special Books with Hooks, <b>Carly </b>and <b>CeCe </b>are joined by guest literary agent, <b>Jenni Ferrari-Adler</b> who represents Susie Yang (whose novel, <em>White Ivy, </em> was the #BookswithHooksBC pick for June).  Jenni helps Carly and CeCe evaluate three query letters, in the process discussing leaning into specificity;  sprinkling backstory info rather than dumping it in;  setting up your bombshell moments with the right information; and the importance of emotionality in sample pages. CeCe and Jenni also illustrate how subjective agent opinions can be when reading pages and how the process works when an editor is evaluating a manuscript.<br/><br/>After which, <b>Bianca</b> chats with author, <b>Kath Jonathan</b>,  and freelance editor, <b>Lisa Rivers</b>,  about how an author can maximize their interaction with a freelance editor. In the chat, they discuss what kind of info an editor likes to see from the author; breaking up a book into quarters for edits; making point-form notes for each chapter; handling the emotional turmoil after getting edits back; how editors push for the emotional truth and elevation of a manuscript; determining if a scene really needs to be there (get out your highlighter!); how to know when you’re ready to approach an editor; and how endurance and fight can help you meet your goals. <br/><br/>Find us on our socials:<br/>Twitter: @TSNOTYAW @BiancaM_author @carlywatters @ceciliaclyra<br/>Instagram: @biancamarais_author @carlywatters @cece_lyra_agent @ the_shit_about_writing<br/>Facebook: @tsnotyaw<br/>Website: <a href='http://www.biancamarais.com/'>www.biancamarais.c</a>om and www.theshitaboutwriting.com<br/>Kath can be found on Instagram at @wolverleighgardens<br/>Lisa can be found on Instagram at @ lisarivers.editorial and you can email her at thewriterstrek@gmail.com<br/><br/></p><p> </p><p><br/></p>",
