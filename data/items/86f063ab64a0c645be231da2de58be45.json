  "description": "<p>r/Choosingbeggars In today's episode, we have this bizarre, unhinged rant from a Karen. She goes on and on about how she wants to change the world by creating some sort of kid's book? Or kid's movie? Or kid's museum? It's not exactly clear because this lady is off her rocker. She expects OP to help her make a free movie/book/museum out of the goodness of his heart. OP tries to give her some constructive criticism, but this causes her to spiral even more.</p>\n<p>Get $90 off and a free gift at Sunbasket!
