  "description": "<p>Catching up with friends after a long summer is one of the great joys of life. In this first episode of Season 4, Kevin, Collin, and Justin chat about some of their summer activities as well as some of the events that are currently happening in our world. They range from the serious (How should we pray for the Church in Afghanistan?) to the silly (Cornhole must become an Olympic sport!) You will discover some intriguing book recommendations too.</p>\n<p>Life and Books and Everything is sponsored by Crossway, publisher of <a href=\"https://www.crossway.org/articles/crossway-special-rediscover-church/\"><em>Rediscover Church: Why the Body of Christ Is Essential</em></a>, by Collin Hansen & Jonathan Leeman.  </p>\n<p>In <em>Rediscover Church</em>, Collin and Jonathan discuss why church is essential for believers and God’s mission.
