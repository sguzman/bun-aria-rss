    "media:description": "Title: Towards a Categorical Treatment of Economics\nSpeaker: Fernando Tohme\n\nAbstract: Economics has been late in adopting the formalisms of Category Theory. But if we understand the discipline broadly as the study of interactions among intentional entities, categorical formalisms can contribute to clarify relevant issues arising in goal-oriented exchanges. In this talk we use CT to study the structure of problems of decision-making by a single agent, detecting settings in which non-locality and contextuality lead to obstructions to the compatibility of different models of agenthood. We then consider an operadic treatment of local interactive problems (known as games) showing the restrictive conditions that are required for the preservation of equilibria. We end with a speculation about how to develop a general dynamic model of interactions as a category enriched in the bicategory Org.\n\nTopos Institute Berkeley Seminar\nSeptember 15, 2022",
