Taking a deeper look at my level of awareness led me to study Buddhism in college and though I changed course to pursue a career in medicine, spiritual growth has always remained a passion for me. I think as humans we need a mass recognition that we are all one; we need to see that inside we’re all the same. Learning from others is a key part of the journey to greater awareness and there are so many teachers I’ve found throughout my life that have helped me do that.

Ramesh has worked as an artist, photographer, environmentalist, and writer. He has collaborated on many projects with Ram Dass over the years, including the original <em>Be Here Now,</em> and the <em>Love Serve Remember</em> recordings, and is co-author with Ram Dass on three books, <em>Be Love Now</em>, <em>Polishing the Mirror</em>,<em> </em>and<em> Being Ram Dass</em>.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Paleovalley, Joovv, and Athletic Greens.</p><br><p>Paleovalley is offering 15% off your entire first order.
