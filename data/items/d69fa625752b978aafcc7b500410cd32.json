  "description": "Nancy Pelosi's January 6th Committee is conducting such a trial in their prime-time hearing. America has never seen such a committee where there is no representation from the minority, but for the never-Trumpers hand-picked by Pelosi. Pelosi is criminalizing political disagreements. The committee has nine former federal prosecutors and U.S attorneys focused on painting Trump as a seditious criminal, while Trump isn't allowed any representation and the witnesses can't call even respond by calling their own witnesses or cross-examinations. It's simply political theater, but instead of state-run media, it's our own complicit press that will broadcast this sham. If and when Republicans gain control, they must investigate this committee and determine who can be legally held accountable. Al Gore challenged in 2000. The Florida legislature was set to intervene with a special session and name a slate of presidential electors, however, then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist took the case and didn't sit on his hands as Chief Justice Roberts did in 2020. The Republican legislatures in the battleground states that were in question had every right to name their electors if they felt that their authority under Article II of the Constitution was seized. Then, news reports indicate that a former employee of Media Matters for America, Timothy Johnson, tweeted that higher-ups knew that their colleague Ben Dimiero was a sexual predator who went after other employees. This program has invited Media Matters to respond to these allegations on the air. With thousands of witnesses interviewed by the January 6th committee, they didn't reveal much of anything. Ivanka Trump's testimony wasn't unusual given that she's left the White House at the time and wasn't plugged into campaign operations. No one questioned what information Bill Barr had seen, especially since most election issues are handled at the state level, not the federal level. A court of law would never allow a one-sided process like this committee.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
