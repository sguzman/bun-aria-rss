  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, most Sunday shows are propaganda operations, including Chuck Todd, a former Democrat operative, and George Stephanopoulos, a former communications person for President Bill Clinton. Todd makes it his business to anticipate the counterpoints that don't go along with the Democrats' agenda and he never pushes back against radical Marxists. Todd never invites dissidents like Professor John McWhorter, who calls tactics like Todd's, a debate team stunt. Then, critical race theory is a bigoted racial ideology that is like Farrakhan dressed as learning. Meanwhile, Sheldon Whitehouse is pressed by a reporter for his membership in an all-White beach club. The Washington Post is reporting on activists who encourage Whites to have \"White accountability groups\" and feel a deep sense of shame for being White. Later, the media ensures that one cannot even ask questions of whether the Constitution is being followed in the hundreds of cases of the January 6th rioters who are still being held in solitary confinement. This same incurious media hasn't even peeked into whether their civil rights are being honored. Afterward, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy joins the show to highlight what the forefathers fought for, what the young man stood up for in Tiananmen Square, and what Americans are voting for in 2022. Finally, Sen. Mike Lee calls in to discuss how S 1 won't make it easier to vote, but rather would make it easier to vote illegally.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
