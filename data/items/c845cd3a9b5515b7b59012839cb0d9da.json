Libraries have been quite the necessity during 2020 and 2021, and they can be a great place that provide space for study or alone time where you can go to ponder and think. You want to make your library reflect you and your family, so whatever it is you do or love, that’s how we’ll decide to space plan. For the aesthetic of your library you generally want it to feel like a serious place. You want it to feel “smart.” <br /><br />About Cori 0:36<br />How our podcast is doing 1:17<br />The library 2:24<br />Space planning 4:08<br />Telling your story 7:11<br />The aesthetic of your library 10:22<br />A woman’s office/library we’re creating 13:13<br /><br />“You could even put a piano in this room depending on how big it is, or a keyboard.” “Yeah if music is your thing, you’ll have a music library. That’s probably something that you’d do, Cori, because you’re a musician. So that makes more sense than having like Harvard Law books everywhere. You would have Rolling Stones and cool stuff, instruments on the wall, which would be way cooler.” 5:41<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
