  "description": "<p>Episode 201 is one linguine all the way to the top! Mostly because we discover that if we die under strange circumstances and there's not a ouija board session with us entered as witness testimony, we'll be pissed. This week Em covers the Fox Sisters, whose claim to fame is foot cracking and accidentally founding American Spiritualism. Then Christine takes us to Australia for the wildly mysterious death of Phoebe Handsjuk and a deep dive on the science of trash shoots. And maybe we're just a product of our times, but we're not sure we would recognize the specific sounds of coffin-making... and that's why we drink! </p><p><br /></p><p>Please consider supporting the companies that support us! </p><p>Don’t wait.
