  "description": "<p>For our last episode of 2021, we decided to look back over the year. We look at what went well, we assess what we learned, and we start to think about what we might like to change next year. We both feel that it's important to take this time out each year and to think about these things before w start making plans for the next year. As the conversation evolves, we cover the importance of looking at the whole year and examining where we are out of balance and also where we might be seeing things with a negative slant. We also discuss the areas of life where we would like to make strides next year. This is an honest conversation that we hope will help you feel less alone and also inspire you to find the lessons in your 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>The Beatles Get Back documentary <a href=\"\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auta2lagtw4</a></p>\n<p>Essentialism <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/books/essentialism-the-disciplined-pursuit-of-less/9780753558690?gclid=Cj0KCQiA-qGNBhD3ARIsAO_o7ykRhTiAhzJJRGX8Yk3C9kt_y49oMEqu7CsBHJymG7D4zpJacX_oLQ4aAn9pEALw_wcB\"><u>https://uk.bookshop.org/books/essentialism-the-disciplined-pursuit-of-less/9780753558690?gclid=Cj0KCQiA-qGNBhD3ARIsAO_o7ykRhTiAhzJJRGX8Yk3C9kt_y49oMEqu7CsBHJymG7D4zpJacX_oLQ4aAn9pEALw_wcB</u></a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
