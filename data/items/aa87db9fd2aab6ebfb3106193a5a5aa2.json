It’s an online forum (a subreddit, but I’ll\nexplain that later) where people (usually men) espouse an ideology predicated\nentirely on gender. “Swallowers of the red pill”, as they call themselves,\nmaintain that it is <em>men</em>, not women, who are socially marginalized; that feminism\nis something between a damaging ideology and a symptom of societal retardation;\nthat the patriarchy should actively assert its dominance over female\ncompatriots.</p>\n<p>Despite being shunned by the world (or perhaps, because of it), <code>/r/TheRedPill</code>\nhas grown into a sizable community and evolved its own slang, language and\nculture. Let me give you an example.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>Cluster #14:\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>Cluster importance: 0.0489376285127\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>shit: 2.433590\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>test: 1.069885\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>frame: 0.396684\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>pass: 0.204953\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>bitch: 0.163619\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is a snippet from a text clustering of <code>/r/TheRedPill</code> — you don’t really\nneed to understand the details right now: all you need to know is that each\ncluster is simply a bunch of words that frequently appear together in Reddit\nposts and comments. Following each word is a number indicating its importance in\nthe cluster, and on line 2 is the importance of this cluster to the subreddit\noverall.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, this cluster has picked up on a very specific meme on\n<code>/r/TheRedPill</code>: the concept of the <em>shit test</em>, and how your frame can <em>pass</em> the\n<em>shit tests</em> that life (but predominantly, <em>bitches</em>) can throw at you.</p>\n<p>There’s absolutely no way I could explain this stuff better than the swallowers\nof the red pill themselves, so I’ll just quote from a post on <code>/r/TheRedPill</code> and\na related blog.</p>\n<p>The concept of the shit test very broad:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip; when somebody “gives you shit” and fucks around with your head to see how\nyou will react, what you are experiencing is typically a (series of) shit\ntest(s).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A shit test is designed to test your temperament, or more colloquially,\n<em>“determine your frame”</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Frame is a concept which essentially means “composure and self-control”.</p>\n<p>&hellip; if you can keep composure/seem unfazed and/or assert your boundaries\ndespite a shit test, generally speaking you will be considered to have passed\nthe shit test. If you get upset, offended, doubt yourself or show weakness in\nany discernible way when shit tested, it will be generally considered that you\nfailed the test.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, not only do shit tests test your frame, but they also serve a specific,\ncritical social function:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When it comes right down to it shit tests are typically women’s way of\nflirting.</p>\n<p>&hellip; Those who “pass” show they can handle the woman’s BS and is “on her\nlevel”, so to speak. This is where the evolutionary theory comes into play:\nyou’re demonstrating her faux negativity doesn’t phase you [sic] and that\nyou’re an emotionally developed person who isn’t going to melt down at the\nfirst sign of trouble. Ergo you’ll be able to protect her when threats to\nher safety emerge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you want to learn more, I took all the above quotes from\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/22qnmk/newbies_read_this_the_definitive_guide_to_shit/\">here</a>\nand <a href=\"https://illimitablemen.com/2014/12/14/the-shit-test-encyclopedia/\">here</a>:\nfeel free to toss yourself down that rabbit hole (but you may want to open those\nlinks in Incognito mode).</p>\n<p>Clearly though, the cluster did a good job of identifying one topic of\ndiscussion on <code>/r/TheRedPill</code>. In fact, not only can clustering pick up on a\ngeneral topic of conversation, but also on specific memes, motifs and vocabulary\nassociated with it.</p>\n<p>Interested? Read on! I’ll explain what I did, and describe some of my other\nresults.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Reddit is — well, it’s pretty hard to describe what Reddit <em>is</em>, mainly because\nReddit comprises several thousand communities, called <em>subreddits</em>, which center\naround topics broad (<code>/r/Sports</code>) and niche (<code>/r/thinkpad</code>), delightful\n(<code>/r/aww</code>) and unsavory (<code>/r/Incels</code>).</p>\n<p>Each subreddit is a unique community with its own rules, culture and standards.\nSome are welcoming and inclusive, and anyone can post and comment; others, not\nso much: you must be invited to even read their front page. Some have pliant\nstandards about what is acceptable as a post; others have moderators willing to\nremove posts and ban users upon any infraction of community guidelines.</p>\n<p>Whatever Reddit is though, two things are for certain:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>It’s widely used. <em>Very</em> widely used. At the time of writing, it’s the <a href=\"https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US\">fourth\nmost popular website in the United\nStates</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.alexa.com/topsites\">sixth most popular\nglobally</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where there is free speech, there is hate speech. Reddit’s hate speech\nproblem is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/08/reddit-mods-handle-hate-speech/\">well\ndocumented</a>,\nthe <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/article/43611-reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-hate-speech\">center of recent\ncontroversy</a>,\nand even <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/\">the subject of statistical\nanalysis</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, there are many well-known hateful subreddits. The three that I decided to\nfocus on were <code>/r/TheRedPill</code>, <code>/r/The_Donald</code>, and<code>/r/CringeAnarchy</code>.</p>\n<p>The goal here is to understand what these subreddits are like, and expose their\nculture for people to see. To quote <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/article/43611-reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-hate-speech\">Steve Huffman, Reddit’s\nCEO</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I believe the best defense against racism and other repugnant views, both\non Reddit and in the world, is instead of trying to control what people\ncan and cannot say through rules, is to repudiate these views in a free\nconversation, and empower our communities to do so on Reddit.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And there’s no way we can refute and repudiate these deplorable views without\nknowing what those views are. And instead of spending hours of each of these\nsubreddits ourselves, let’s have a machine learn what gets talked about on these\nsubreddits.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Now, how do we do this? This can be done using <em>clustering</em>, a machine learning\ntechnique in which we’re given data points, and tasked with grouping them in\nsome way. A picture will explain better than words:</p>\n<figure>\n<a href=\"https://www.georgeho.org/assets/images/clusters.png\"><img src=\"https://www.georgeho.org/assets/images/clusters.png\" alt=\"Illustration of clustering\"></a>\n</figure>\n<p>The clustering algorithm was hard to decide on. After several dead ends were\nexplored, I settled on non-negative matrix factorization of the document-term\nmatrix, featurized using tf-idfs. I don’t really want to go into the technical\ndetails now: suffice to say that this technique is <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html\">known to work well for this\napplication</a>\n(perhaps I’ll write another piece on this in the future).</p>\n<p>Finally, we need our data points: <a href=\"https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/fh-bigquery:reddit_comments\">Google\nBigQuery</a>\nhas all posts and comments across all of Reddit, from the the beginning of\nReddit right up until the end of 2017. We decided to focus on the last two\nmonths for which there is data: November and December, 2017.</p>\n<p>I could talk at length about the technical details, but right now, I want to\nfocus on the results of the clustering. What follows are two hand-picked\nclusters from each of the three subreddits, visualized as word clouds (you can\nthink of word clouds as visual representations of the code snippet above), as\nwell as an example comment from each of the clusters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rtheredpill\"><code>/r/TheRedPill</code></h2>\n<p>You already know <code>/r/TheRedPill</code>, so let me describe the clusters in more detail:\na good number of them are about sex, or about how to approach girls. Comments in\nthese clusters tend to give advice on how to pick up girls, or describe the\nsocial/sexual exploits of the commenter.</p>\n<p>What is interesting is that, as sex-obsessed as <code>/r/TheRedPill</code> is, many\nswallowers (of the red pill) profess that sex is <em>not</em> the purpose of the\nsubreddit: the point is to becoming an “alpha male”. Even more interesting,\nthere is more talk about what an alpha male <em>is</em>, and what kind of people\n<em>aren’t</em> alpha, than there is about how people can <em>become</em> alpha. This is the\nfirst cluster shown below, and comprises around 3% of all text on\n<code>/r/TheRedPill</code>.</p>\n<p>The second cluster comprises around 6% of all text on <code>/r/TheRedPill</code>, and\ncontains comments that expound theories on the role of men, women and feminism\nin today’s society (it isn’t pretty). Personally, the most repugnant views that\nI’ve read are to be found in this cluster.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>I feel like the over dramatization of beta qualities in media/pop\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>culture is due to the fact that anyone representing these qualities is\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>already Alpha by default.\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>The actors who play the white knight lead roles, the rock stars that\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>sing about pining for some chick... these men/characters are already\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>very Alpha in both looks and status, so when beta BS comes from their\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>mouths, it’s seen as attractive because it balances out their already\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>alpha state into that &#34;mostly alpha but some beta&#34; balance that makes\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>women swoon.\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>...\n</span></span></code></pre></div><figure>\n<a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eigenfoo/reddit-clusters/master/wordclouds/images/TheRedPill/13_3.21%25.png\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eigenfoo/reddit-clusters/master/wordclouds/images/TheRedPill/13_3.21%25.png\" alt=\"/r/TheRedPill cluster #13\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eigenfoo/reddit-clusters/master/wordclouds/images/TheRedPill/06_6.41%25.png\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eigenfoo/reddit-clusters/master/wordclouds/images/TheRedPill/06_6.41%25.png\" alt=\"/r/TheRedPill cluster #6\"></a>\n</figure>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>...\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>Since the dawn of humanity men were always in control, held all the\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>power and women were happy because of it.

Their morally grey jokes run\nthe gamut of delicate topics: gender, race, sexuality, nationality&hellip;</p>\n<p>In some respects, the clustering provided very little insight into this\nsubreddit: each such delicate topic had one or two clusters, and there’s nothing\nreally remarkable about any of them.
