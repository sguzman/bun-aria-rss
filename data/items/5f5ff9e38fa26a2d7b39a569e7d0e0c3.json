  "description": "<p>I know it may seem like I said this a lot, but this episode is a huge one for me. Brian McTernan is the vocalist from <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/7MlVSrN1UclvhmDbHlCOf9?si=7d-N9x8vRny-caaZ_Ygfvw\">Battery</a>, guitarist from Ashes and more recently, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3kxM2aJZV05zhPIrQS5qyz?si=MM7zOjUtQJ21USxa1OZyaw\">Be Well</a> and his art has definitely impacted me in a deep way. He's also an incredibly prolific producer as well helping bands like Texas Is The Reason, Bane, Thrice and many more create some of their most important records. We go LONG with so many things like depression, touring Europe and being the \"it\" producer and the pressure that comes with it. This conversation went so incredibly well and I am proud to share it with you.
