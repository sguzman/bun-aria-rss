A backlash isn’t just a political formation. It’s also a new structure of feeling that makes utopian social projects seem ridiculous.”</p><p>It wouldn’t be fair to blame the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization and the ensuing wave of draconian abortion laws sweeping the nation on a failure of persuasion, or on a failure of the women’s movement. But signs of anti-feminist backlash are permeating American culture: Girlbosses have become figures of ridicule, Amber Heard’s testimony drew a fire hose of misogyny, and <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/news/2022/06/01/poll-finds-support-great-replacement-hard-right-ideas\" target=\"_blank\">recent polling</a> finds that younger generations — both men and women — are feeling ambivalent about whether feminism has helped or hurt women. A movement that has won so many victories in law, politics and public opinion is now defending its very existence.</p><p>Goldberg is a columnist for Times Opinion who focuses on gender and politics.
