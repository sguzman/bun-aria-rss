  "description": "The future is now, Throw Gang. We withdrew our last slap from the chune bank last week, so The Only Podcast That Matters™ had no choice but to get active remotely. This week we’re dialing in the meme queen herself, Patia of Patia’s Fantasy World, for an entire BDSM session behind the paywall. Quarantine can’t stop us now! We’re turning to video games in times of great tragedy, analyzing the economics of Animal Crossing, the lawlessness of quarantine fits, approaching the post-sneaker world as a female, the apocalypse that is Instagram’s Explore Page, white people reposting the n-word, dressing like a felon, the art of curating hood auntie Facebook memes, getting relationship advice on the TL, copping blue checks, letting Aaron Hernandez murder your cheeks, partying with Cuba Gooding Jr., being the queen of toxicity, the superiority of southern hip-hop, finding God and much more. Please bear with us.\nFor more Throwing Fits, check us out on Patreon: www.patreon.com/throwingfits.\n",
