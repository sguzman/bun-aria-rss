  "title": " Best Art Year Ever? A Look Back at 2020 [99]",
  "description": "<p>Last year we ran a special event called Your Best Art Year Ever, in which we led 3,500 people through a planning process to ensure that 2020 would indeed be their best year ever. Of course then Covid came along and threw everything up in the air. Nevertheless, life continued and this week, we’re looking back on our plans to see where they went well, where we had to change course, and whether we learned anything that we can take into 2021. Our conversation spans dreaming big dreams, setting clear goals, understanding your motivation, and the need for flexibility when things change. We also answer a listener question from Jennifer, who is struggling with how to stay authentic in her work.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>The Practice by Seth Godin <a href=\"//\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Practice-Seth-Godin/dp/0241470048</a></p>\n<p>Buy the Purely Abstract artist lesson bundle <a href=\"https://kelleewynnestudios.simplero.com/products/118350-Melange-Purely-Abstract?ref=21052-Alice-Sheridan\">HERE</a></p>\n<p>Find the full Artist bundle including Alice's lesson <a href=\"https://kelleewynnestudios.simplero.com/products/118778-Melange-Bundle?ref=21052-Alice-Sheridan\">HERE</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
