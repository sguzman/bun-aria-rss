We opened up the phone lines to see if our listeners were still supporting Keaton or against him now with all these accusations. We also opened up the phone lines to see what our listeners would do if put in the situation Meek Mill was, when it came to exposing his judge. Moreover, Charlamagne also gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to the organization \"America First Project\" for having a 12 year old girl interview Roy Moore. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
