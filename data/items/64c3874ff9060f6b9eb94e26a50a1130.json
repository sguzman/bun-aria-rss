  "description": "<p>We got some special guests for you on this one, jeans!</p> <p>Judd Apatow is in the MommyDome and he's brought his friend, comedian Wayne Federman! Judd Apatow is a comedian who has become a mogul as a television/film producer and writer. He's most recently been working on the Pete Davidson movie and gives us some stories from the set, including Bill Burr stories. After reminiscing about Judd's life for a bit, we show Judd some audition tapes from our Cool Guys to see which one he would cast in a film. We also play a few rounds of Horrible or Hilarious to see what Judd thinks.</p> <p>Brian Simpson is a hilarious comedian who you may have seen at The World Famous Comedy Store or on Lights Out with David Spade. Brian grew up in foster care and found himself getting into a lot of trouble, including shooting a person (on accident.) Brian then found his way into the Marine Corps which turned things around. Brian also helps us get to the bottom of SooWoo and gives some advice to listeners who have recently sent in emails to Tom and Christina.</p>\n",
