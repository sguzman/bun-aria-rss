  "description": "Looking at investor returns, European equities are trailing U.S. peers while beating emerging-market stocks in 2018. As part of our closer look at emerging economic and market themes in Europe, Sharon Bell of Goldman Sachs Research discusses the factors that explain this performance, zeroing in on U.K., German and French stocks. Bell breaks down investors' preference for growth companies over value stocks that trade at cheaper prices, particularly against a backdrop of ongoing political uncertainty and a slower pace of economic growth in the region. As for her outlook for the rest of the year, Bell says European companies look poised to deliver decent earnings growth of around 10 percent in 2018 and equities' performance could improve if political concerns subside.\n\t\n\n\tThis podcast was recorded on August 1, 2018.\n\t\n\n\tAll price references and market forecasts correspond to the date of this recording.\n\t\n\n\tThis podcast should not be copied, distributed, published or reproduced, in whole or in part.
