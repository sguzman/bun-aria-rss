  "description": "I describe a fitness protocol that maximizes all the major sought-after aspects of physical fitness, including strength, endurance and flexibility. I discuss fundamentals of resistance training protocols, including repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods and periodization of intensity and volume to improve strength and hypertrophy. I also explain how to integrate this with endurance training across the week by controlling the duration, timing and intensity of cardiovascular workouts. I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery. Further, I tackle a range of real-world issues that can affect a consistent training schedule, such as whether you should train if you are sick, have had a poor night of sleep or had a stressful event and how to start training again after a break and whether you should train in a fasted or fed state. Physical fitness is a key variable for immediate and long-term health. This episode provides a modifiable “foundational” template that can be adjusted based on your current fitness level, goals, time constraints, and access to different types of equipment.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Foundational Protocol for Fitness\n(00:03:35) Huberman Lab Premium\n(00:04:35) Tool: Soleus (Calf) Push-Ups, Glucose Utilization & Metabolism\n(00:14:42) InsideTracker, ROKA, Helix Sleep, Momentous Supplements\n(00:18:53) Core Principles of Fitness & Modifiable Variables\n(00:23:37) Day 1: Long Endurance Workout\n(00:34:38) Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy\n(00:38:09) Athletic Greens (AG1)\n(00:39:22) Key Principles of Resistance Training\n(00:51:10) Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery\n(01:00:35) Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training\n(01:09:55) Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives\n(01:16:43) Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate\n(01:24:10) Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training\n(01:28:45) Flexibility of Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing\n(01:33:00) Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs \n(01:37:10) Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts\n(01:38:32) Tool: Stress or Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR\n(01:41:20) Should You Train Fasted or Fed?\n(01:43:58) Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training\n(01:49:10) Tool: Hanging from a Bar & Fitness Metric \n(01:50:16) Should You Train Sick?, Ramping Training\n(01:53:33) Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery\n(01:55:00) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
