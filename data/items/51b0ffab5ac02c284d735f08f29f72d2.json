  "description": "<p>My mother died Monday night. She was 74.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, I began writing a memorial for her. I know I haven't talked much about Mom here at Get Rich Slowly, but she probably played the biggest role in molding me into the person I am today. After writing 2500 words, I realized I have a lot to process. And maybe Get Rich Slowly isn't the place to publish a tribute to her. I don't know.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.getrichslowly.org/wp-content/uploads/mom-bw.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"705\" alt=\"[My mother when she was probably 15 years old]\" title=\"My mother when she was probably 15 years old\" class=\"aligncenter green-border\" />",

And while I'm taking time away from Get Rich Slowly to handle these things, it feels like a good opportunity to tackle a few big projects I've been putting off — including the &#8220;de-design&#8221; of this blog.</p>\n<p>My plan is to take a three-month sabbatical. I may indeed publish a bit here and there — and I'll regularly update the &#8220;Spare Change&#8221; section on the front page <em>and</em> send the GRS Insider email newsletter — but my intention right now is to step away from Get Rich Slowly until the end of the year.</p>\n<p><strong>I'll be back on 01 January 2023.</strong></p>\n",
