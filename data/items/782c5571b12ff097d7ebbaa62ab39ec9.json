  "description": "The 2020 NFL season ended just a few days ago, but we're already starting to turn our attention to 2021. It promises to be an eventful one with multiple star quarterbacks presumably on the move. On this episode, Ryan Wilson and John Breech set the table for what to expect in the coming months. Last year, the league calendar was hit by COVID-19, impacting the draft, offseason workouts, the preseason and more. Will we get some sense of normalcy this year? Breech shares his thoughts on the salary cap and the probable 17-game season. Yes, we said we're looking ahead but we had to briefly look back at the epic Bucs' Super Bowl parade. Then, the guys shift their attention to player movement as Carson Wentz and Deshaun Watson have yet to be traded. And we have to welcome a new name to the mix. Could Russell Wilson legitimately be available? Let's not forget about Dak Prescott who leads a packed free agency class.
