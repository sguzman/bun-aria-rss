  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin show, President Donald J. Trump calls in to update us on his final push to elect Republicans in tomorrow's midterm election. Trump spoke of an “electricity in the air” on the campaign trail that “reminds me very much of November ’16; there’s an electricity that’s incredible.” He predicted that Republicans will do better in the House, more than anybody expects and that they’re going to have tremendous success. Later, this midterm election is a race between liberty and tyranny. The media continues to call the President a racist, yet it’s the left in fact that are bigoted. Trump has never called anyone in the media Hitler like they have. All nations have a duty to defend their borders, this is a magnificent country and we have to defend it. We must turn out to vote with 5 or 6 friends, family members, neighbors, and/or colleagues. Let's win tomorrow! If not the left will vote in ways that will prevent us from liberty in Congress, and on the Supreme Court. The left is destroying our basic institutions; they constantly attack the police . We need to vote for our country, our families and our future. Finally, Ron DeSantis and Chip Roy call into discuss their elections as well.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
