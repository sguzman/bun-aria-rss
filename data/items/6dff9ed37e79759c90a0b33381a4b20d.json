We’re ready to set the trap and go on SnapChat (well, we’d send Kristin’s friend on SnapChat) to try to lure him into doing something inappropriate so we could expose him as the dirty cheater he is (or, to be fair, expose him as the great guy and boyfriend that he is).\nShe absolutely HATES the man her sister is about to marry in a few weeks. She is certain that he is unfaithful and wants proof to help stop her sister from making a big mistake. \nCan we help her? We'll try! \nLearn more about your ad choices.
