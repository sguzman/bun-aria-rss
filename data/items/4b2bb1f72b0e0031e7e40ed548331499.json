  "description": "<p>OVERWORKING ISN’T THE GOAL. So often, we get a pat on the back when we run ourselves into the ground. We get recognition for always staying late at work. We answer emails at night and on the weekend. People ask us, “Wow, how do you manage to DO IT ALL?!” But what we’re really doing is destroying our minds and our bodies. We can only operate at 110% for so long. Professional athletes know the importance of rest and recovery. They work it into their schedule, and they never skip it. Why shouldn’t the rest of us do the same? For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Arianna Huffington where she shared how she reshaped her life and health after collapsing from burnout. Arianna Huffington is the founder of The Huffington Post, the founder and CEO of Thrive Global, and the author of fifteen books. She’s no stranger to hard work, but a life-changing event made her drastically change her approach. Learn how to thrive and stop being exhausted in Episode 891.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nWhy Arianna collapsed from exhaustion (1:30)<br />\nWhat athletes know better than most people (2:30)<br />\nWhat Arianna implemented at Huffington Post (3:00)</p>\n",
