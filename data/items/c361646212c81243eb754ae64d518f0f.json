  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">This week, Ashley explores the concept of leadership with Drew Dudley, voted one of the 50 Most Inspirational TED Talkers of our time. Drew destroys the flawed definition of leadership that we have been taught, insisting that we step away from evaluating our accomplishments over blocks of time, and instead narrow down leadership through the lens of our daily existence. Once we can reframe what moments of leadership are, then we can recognize that there is no such thing as a “little” impact, and we can truly understand the importance of self-respect, keeping obligations to ourselves, and recognizing our insights, experience, and knowledge as it relates to our happiness. At the end of the interview, Drew shares a clear set of questions you can ask yourself each day so that when the future arrives, you will be the type of person you want to be.</p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>LINKS:</strong> </p> <p class=\"p1\">Drew’s website: <a href= \"http://www.drewdudley.com/\"><span class= \"s1\">www.drewdudley.com</span></a>  </p> <p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Drew’s Book: <a href= \"https://amzn.to/2ytiwsu\"><span class=\"s3\">This is Day One – A Practical Guide To Leadership That Matters</span></a> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">Follow Drew on Instagram & Twitter: @dayonedrew </p> <p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Book Mentioned:</strong> <a href= \"https://amzn.to/2CYKb8z\"><span class=\"s3\">“Turning Pro” by Steven Pressfield</span></a> </span></p>",
