  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, The Council of American Islamic Relations (CAIR) is now demanding that Fox News drop Jeanine Pirro and Tucker Carlson or ask their advertisers to walk away from Fox News. This is blackmail by CAIR and we'll call out the media and CAIR for who they really are. Also, veteran news anchor Ted Koppel has come out again saying that the media is no longer the reservoir of objectivity that it once was. Stating that becoming the enemy of the President is not the role of the press. The immediate rise of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a prime example of how the media uses their influence to shape the truth instead of report on it objectively. Nihad Awad from CAIR has ties to Hamas and the Muslim brotherhood. CAIR has long been considered a front group for Hamas and was named an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holyland federal court case. Then, there are new calls for additional Supreme Court seats and a continued effort to undermine the electoral college. Afterwards, the Trump Administration wins another Supreme Court victory upholding the government's position on detention. Lastly, our educational system is indoctrinating our youth under the guise of social activism, promoting the ideas of collectivism over Americanism. Suggesting that destruction of our institutions is necessary in order to appropriately rebuild our nations institution.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
