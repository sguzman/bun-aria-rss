This inflammation creates insulin resistance and pre-diabetes, which causes your body to deposit fat not just in your liver but also all around your organs and in your belly. So what is driving fatty liver and the whole cascade of issues it causes? And how do you fix it?</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Shawn Stevenson and Dr. Shebani Sethi Dalai about the various mechanisms that are at work when our bodies process food. They also discuss how non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is on the rise in our country due to the overconsumption of sugar, starch, and ultra-processed food.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Shawn Stevenson is the author of the international bestselling book <em>Sleep Smarter</em> and creator of <em>The Model Health Show,</em> featured as the number #1 health podcast in the U.S. with millions of listener downloads each year. A graduate of the University of Missouri–St. Louis, Shawn studied business, biology, and nutritional science, and went on to found Advanced Integrative Health Alliance, a company that provides wellness services for individuals and organizations worldwide. Shawn has been featured in <em>Forbes</em>, <em>Fast Company</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Muscle & Fitness</em>, ESPN, and many other major media outlets. He is also an in-demand keynote speaker for numerous organizations, universities, and conferences.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Shebani Sethi Dalai is a double board-certified physician in Obesity Medicine and Psychiatry. She is the Founding Director of Stanford University's Metabolic Psychiatry program and Silicon Valley Metabolic Psychiatry, a new center in the San Francisco Bay Area focused on optimizing brain health by integrating low-carb nutrition, comprehensive psychiatric care, and treatment of obesity with associated metabolic disease. She is clinical faculty at Stanford University School of Medicine, where she leads a number of clinical trials investigating the important relationship between nutrition, metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, and mental health. She is the author of multiple peer-reviewed publications, a recipient of numerous professional awards from organizations including the American Psychiatric Association, the Association of Women Psychiatrists, and the Obesity Treatment Foundation, and a widely featured speaker and thought leader.
