    "media:description": "Creator Music helps you find and use mainstream music in your videos while still being able to monetize. Creators in the YouTube Partner program can browse and access music for use in their content from a growing catalog of tracks - all within YouTube Studio. Songs have different usage terms within Creator Music -- for some, you can buy a license up front. Others you can share revenue with the artist or rights holder. And we'll also show when a track is not available for licensing or revenue sharing, and instead would have visibility or monetization restrictions on your video if you use it. \n\nFor more info, check out these articles:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/topic/12754676\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11610212\n\n0:00 What is Creator Music?\n0:26 Creator Music Catalog\n1:08 Song Usage Terms\n1:28 Upfront Licenses\n2:04 Revenue Sharing\n2:20 Songs with Restrictions\n2:40 Purchasing a License\n2:52 Downloading & Adding Song to Video\n3:02 Add License During Upload\n3:42 Creator Music FAQs\n\nSubscribe and hit the bell to see new videos: https://goo.gl/So4XIG\n\nâ–º Check out our Help Center: https://goo.gl/fBzr7",
