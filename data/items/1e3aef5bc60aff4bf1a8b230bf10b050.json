  "description": "<p>College instructor Mitchel Townsend reported on his research paper which he believes proves that a Bigfoot-like creature resides in the Mount St. Helens area of Washington state. In 2013, he came upon a stack of deer bones, and noticed they had giant teeth marks notched into them– the markings did not fit any predator profile and were too large to have been made by humans. Further, large footprints with a length of 16 inches were found near the bones. Extrapolating the teeth and footprint measurements, Townsend concluded that the creature is around 8 ½ feet tall, with a wide stride. Mitchel was recently on Coast to Coast talking about his research.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Blake who is a researching in Texas and talks about how he really did not believe in this creature but has always had an interest. All of that changed when he had one vocalize at him. He shares with us his encounter.</p>",
