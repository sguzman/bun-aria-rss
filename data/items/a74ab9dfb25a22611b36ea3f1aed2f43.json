  "description": "<p>Tucked into a small corner of southeast Spain is one of the greatest sources for delicious, multi-layered, and decadent reds you’ll find. In the province of Murcia, at latitude 39˚N lay two regions of Monastrell (Mourvèdre) production that have quietly churned out wine for more than 3,000 years: Jumilla (joo-ME-yah) and Yecla (YAY-clah).</p> <p>Today, these regions are magnificent but receive so little press that we can get exquisite bottles that have the fullness, richness and depth for less than US$20.</p> <p> </p> <p>In the podcast, we take you through the wine history of the region --from the early days with the Phoenicians to the Romans and then the Moors, and then a few strange brushes with the phylloxera root louse that at first propelled the region’s wines, then decimated the land and ultimately saved this area from a fate of nasty bulk production to make it a quiet haven of powerful reds.</p> <p> </p> <p>We discuss the conditions in Murcia, discuss Bullas, a small Denominacíon de Origen and then we move to the big guns of this area: Jumilla and Yecla.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style= \"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Jumilla</strong> </span></p> <p>Jumilla is the best area quality in Murcia and also makes the most wine. Vineyards are spread across a wide valleys and plateaus surrounded by mountains. A few geological and climate facts:</p> <ul> <li>The high elevation of the vineyards -- between 1,300 -2,600 ft (400 -800 m) make it possible for grapes to cool at night and maintain acidity.</li> <li>The soils here are dark and have a high limestone content. They’re permeable but have good moisture retaining properties, allowing the vines during the harsh summer droughts.</li> <li>This is a very difficult place to grow things – it’s a harsh, dry, continental climate that is tempered a bit by Mediterranean breezes but is brutal in its dry heat.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Jumilla is one of Spain’s oldest DOs – its historical legacy as a high-quality wine producer is well known in its native land. It now makes whites, reds, and rosés, although the reds are the flagship for the region.</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Red grapes include</em></strong>: Monastrell, Tempranillo (called Cencibel here), Garnacha Tinta, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Petit Verdot. The French varietals were added to the Monastrell to create more dimension in the finished wine (read: international appeal). This has been critically acclaimed, however some of it muddies the character of the grape.</li> <li><strong><em>White grapes include</em></strong>: Aíren, Macabeo, Pedro Ximenez, Malvasia, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Mosacatel de Grano Menudo</li> <li>Although not mentioned in the podcast, the Jumilla DO has several areas it draws from: Jumilla, Montealegre, Fuenteálamo, Tobarra, Hellín, Ontur, and Albatana. 40% of the wine is from Jumilla proper.</li> </ul> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/vino-do-lamancha-jumilla.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"143\" /></p> <p>Monastrell represents 85% of the vines planted and 80% of any blend must be this grape. The character of the wine is superb:  it tastes like dark fruit, earth, and minerals with a brambly, gamy character. With age, these flavors mellow to be more like dark soil, coffee and spice.</p> <p> </p> <p>Although it isn’t prevalent, Jumilla makes rosé from 80% Monastrell too -- in the best versions it’s similar to the rosé of Bandol, in Provence, France with some acidity and tannin and, from a careful producer, the opportunity to potentially have a longer life than 1 year.</p> <p> </p> <p>Modern technology, good farming and a consistent climate mean there isn’t a lot of vintage variation here although the region does have aging classifications similar to Rioja:</p> <ul> <li>Vino joven (\"young wine\") or Sin crianza: little, if any, wood aging.</li> <li>Crianza: <ul> <li>Reds: aged for 1 year total -- at least 6 months in oak, 6 months in the bottle.</li> <li>Whites and rosés: at least 1 year with at least 4 months in oak.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Reserva: <ul> <li>Reds: aged for at least 2 years -- at least 12 months in oak, 12 months in the bottle.</li> <li>Whites and rosés: aged at least 18 months with at least 6 months in oak.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Gran Reserva: Made only above average vintages. <ul> <li>Reds: 4 years aging, 12 months of which in oak and a minimum of 36 months in the bottle.</li> <li>Whites and rosés: aged for at least 4 years with at least 6 months in oak</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/WFNP_Maps_Spain.jpg\" alt=\"Wine Map of Spain\" width=\"350\" height=\"259\" /></p> <p><span style= \"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Yecla</strong></span></p> <p>Towards the end of the show, we discuss the smallest and northernmost wine zone in Murcia, Yecla. This area is landlocked by other DOs: Jumilla DO to the southwest, Almansa DO to the north, and Alicante DO to the east. It’s 50 miles (80km) inland and represents a transition from more coastal Mediterranean influences to hotter, arid continental conditions.</p> <p> </p> <p>Yecla is similar to Jumilla in that its altitude allows the grapes to maintain acidity at night, creating balance in the wines.</p> <ul> <li><strong>White grapes:</strong> Airen, Macabeo, Merseguera, Malvasia, Moscatel de Grano Menudo, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay. These wines are usually blended. A small amount of sparkling wine is also made here.</li> <li><strong>Red grapes:</strong> similar to those of Jumilla, but the blends must have a least 85% Monastrell. The area has transitioned from making a light, very fruity red to making more serious reds with spice mineral and red fruit notes, after seeing the success Jumilla has enjoyed.</li> </ul> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/img2017737480.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"140\" height=\"50\" /></p> <p>If you haven’t tried these wines yet, get on it.
