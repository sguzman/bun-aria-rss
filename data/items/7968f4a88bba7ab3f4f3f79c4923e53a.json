  "title": "PMS 2.0 171 - TOM BRADY CONTROLS THE WORLD.. OT Nate Solder Stops By & Incredible Chatter About Life. Let's Have A Thursday",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys react to the news that the 49ers are making a late push to bring Tom Brady to the Bay, a scenario which would see the Patriots trading for Jimmy Garoppolo, and reiterate the fact that Tom Brady has played free agency like an absolute genius. Pat and the guys also look at the plethora of quarterbacks that will be hitting the open market within the next few weeks and try to figure out where some of them will wind up, despite the fact that many teams are waiting for the Tom Brady domino to fall. Also joining the show is 2x Super Bowl Champion, #17 overall pick of the 2011 NFL draft by the New England Patriots and current offensive tackle for the New York Giants, Nate Solder. Pat and Nate talk about his positive thoughts towards the CBA and why he is going to vote yes, and how he is trying to be more of a voice for some of the core players who don't have as big of a social media following as some of the other players who have been vocal. He explains his thoughts on the whole process and what he's been hearing in his locker room. Nate also sheds some light on what it's like to be teammates with both Tom Brady and Jimmy Garoppolo and what their relationship was like, and whether or not he has any clue as to where Brady is going this offseason (34:05-46:16). Also included is News with Nick to round out what else we missed in the sports world. As always, send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat when listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch, and enjoy today's closing song by our very own Boston Connor. Today's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
