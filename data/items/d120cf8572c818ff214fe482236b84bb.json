  "description": "<p>We’ve completed the final weekend without football until February (00:02:25-00:06:06). We name some NFL Players on new teams to get our brains going (00:06:06-00:17:01). UFC Saturday night was wild (00:17:01-00:26:49) . Who’s back of the week including Josh Rosen and Tom Brady maybe going to the Raiders (00:26:49-00:39:32). Liver King joins us in studio to talk about his lifestyle, try some liver, the tenets to living a healthier life and other weird things (00:39:32-01:38:09). We finish with Mt Rushmore of ways to subtlety emasculate someone and it almost breaks the podcast apart (01:38:09-02:04:44).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
