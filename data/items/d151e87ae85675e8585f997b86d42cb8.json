  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the Supreme ruled on the Obamacare tax case and effectively upheld it despite Justice Alito's brilliant dissent. Justices Coney Barrett, Kavanaugh, and Thomas voted on the wrong side of this issue. Then, a US Navy Admiral is insisting that all sailors read Professor Ibrahim X. Kendi's book which contends that capitalism is effectively racist. Military leaders that uphold these destructive teachings should be booted from the US military. Should we expect more divergent views, like racial supremacy, in the future? Later, the Court now says that the State of Texas cannot build its own border wall because it has no jurisdiction over federal issues like immigration. However, the Kelo decision written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor allows states to use the 'takings clause' to obtain property for public purposes including the protection of a state's sovereignty. Afterward, President Trump's Advisor Stephen Miller calls in to explain that AG Merrick Garland is taking a series of steps to change the US immigration system through courts run by the US Department of Justice. Garland recently overruled two Trump policies on asylum, making anyone across the globe suffering from crime or gang violence eligible for asylum in the US. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
