  "description": "Another request was given to us to talk about wallpaper, which is one of our favorite topics right now and we haven’t focused on in the podcast yet, so today we want to discuss this fun topic. There are various different types of wallpaper, such as murals, which can evoke a unique scene in each room and give your space a greater sense of adventure or specific emotion you want brought out, and then we talk about what you can do to wallpaper your ceiling, why you’d want to do that, and how to go about it. Another fun or unique place you can wallpaper is in the smaller rooms, such as your kids’ clothes closet where they can hang up all their cute clothes in a cute room.<br /><br />Different types of wallpaper 3:05<br />Cori’s Gucci wallpaper 7:07<br />Finding good murals 9:12<br />Wallpaper your ceilings 15:21<br />The party pantry/small print 22:05<br />Vinyl 25:54<br />Almost every company sells, ships, and prices their wallpaper differently 28:15<br /><br />“One other thing I wanted to say about murals that's just so magical is that it’s an escape. It is larger than life, like it is life size if not larger and it’s just such a fun party trick. It’s fun for you to get to use every day. This isn’t a mural, but your tiger wallpaper, you said that if you have to go to the bathroom, you will trek it down the stairs to use the tiger bathroom because it’s so much fun.” 13:38<br /> <br />grove.co/dearalice<br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
