  "description": "<p>For this New Sounds, hear new indie chamber works from the NYC-based group, NOW Ensemble and the Australian chamber band Nonsemble. Plus, music by composer/bandleader/singer Becca Stevens, from her daring and captivating record, “Perfect Animal.”  </p>\n<p>From the NOW Ensemble, hear “City Boy,” by NYC-based composer Judd Greenstein, who is also a co-founder of New Amsterdam Records, and the founder of the annual Ecstatic Music Festival. Greenstein’s “City Boy” is full of lifting, pulsing musical patterns changing over time, allowing one instrument after another in the NOW Ensemble’s arsenal - of flute, clarinet, electric guitar, double bass, and piano -to shine brilliantly. Then there’s a work by composer, singer/songwriter and bandleader Becca Stevens which recruits folk-associated instruments in the service of chamber-jazz art songs.</p>\n<p>Also, listen to music by Australian composer Chris Perren for his septet, Nonsemble. His large 30-minute work “Go Seigen vs. Fujisawa Kuranosuke,”is based on the surrounding patterns from a 1950’s championship game of go. (Go Seigen was a Chinese-born Japanese 20<sup>th</sup> century  master of the game; Fujisawa Kuranosuke was his opponent.) Go is an ancient Chinese strategy game, of great complexity, where one must surround and capture a greater territory on a playing board than one’s opponent. That, and more. </p>\n<p>PROGRAM #3734–  Postminimalist Music (First aired on 06/04/2015)             </p>\n<table width=\"95%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>ARTIST(S)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>RECORDING</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>CUT(S)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>SOURCE</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>NOW  Ensemble</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dreamfall</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Greenstein: City Boy, excerpt [1:30]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>New Amsterdam 64<br><a href=\"http://newamrecords.com/now-ensemble-dreamfall\" target=\"_blank\">newamrecords.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Nonsemble</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Go Seigen vs. Fujisawa Kuranosuke</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Chris Perren:Go Seigen vs. Fujisawa Kuranosuke, Part III [9:46]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"http://bigoandtwigetti.bandcamp.com/album/go-seigen-vs-fujisawa-kuranosuke\">bigoandtwigetti.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>NOW  Ensemble</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dreamfall</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Judd Greenstein: City Boy [11:15]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>New Amsterdam 64<br><a href=\"http://newamrecords.com/now-ensemble-dreamfall\" target=\"_blank\">newamrecords.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>NOW  Ensemble</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dreamfall</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sarah Kirkland Snider: Pale as Centuries [6:09]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>New Amsterdam 64<br><a href=\"http://newamrecords.com/now-ensemble-dreamfall\" target=\"_blank\">newamrecords.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Becca Stevens Band</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Perfect Animal</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Be Still [5:05]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Universal / Universal Music Classics and Jazz - #4724275<br>Available at Amazon.com,  iTunes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Arizal</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Booster Pack: Jellowstone Sampler by Jellowstone Records</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Under Water [4:32]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"https://jellowstone.bandcamp.com/album/booster-pack-jellowstone-sampler\" target=\"_blank\">jellowstone.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Nonsemble</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Go Seigen vs. Fujisawa Kuranosuke</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Chris Perren:Go Seigen vs. Fujisawa Kuranosuke, Part II [8:52]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"http://bigoandtwigetti.bandcamp.com/album/go-seigen-vs-fujisawa-kuranosuke\">bigoandtwigetti.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
