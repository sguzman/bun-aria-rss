  "description": "<p>We are interested in predicting failures of cyber-physical systems during\ntheir operation. Particularly, we consider stochastic systems and signal\ntemporal logic specifications, and we want to calculate the probability that\nthe current system trajectory violates the specification. The paper presents\ntwo predictive runtime verification algorithms that predict future system\nstates from the current observed system trajectory. As these predictions may\nnot be accurate, we construct prediction regions that quantify prediction\nuncertainty by using conformal prediction, a statistical tool for uncertainty\nquantification. Our first algorithm directly constructs a prediction region for\nthe satisfaction measure of the specification so that we can predict\nspecification violations with a desired confidence. The second algorithm\nconstructs prediction regions for future system states first, and uses these to\nobtain a prediction region for the satisfaction measure. To the best of our\nknowledge, these are the first formal guarantees for a predictive runtime\nverification algorithm that applies to widely used trajectory predictors such\nas RNNs and LSTMs, while being computationally simple and making no assumptions\non the underlying distribution. We present numerical experiments of an F-16\naircraft and a self-driving car.\n</p>",
