We met on Ko Phayam, Thailand, where he’s spent a lot of time with the Moken people (aka “Sea Gypsies”) who have been living on shore since the tsunami swept away their boats in 2004. Greg leads small groups on trips in India, Nepal, Laos, and elsewhere, recording songs and languages that are in danger of being lost forever.</p> <p>You can learn more about Greg’s work <a href=\"https://www.soundexpeditions.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pozible.com/profile/greg-simmons/campaign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p> <p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.mudwtr.com/\">Mud/Wtr</a></p> <p>Find me on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\">Instagram</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/tangentiallyspeaking\">Please consider supporting this podcast on Patreon.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</a></p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
