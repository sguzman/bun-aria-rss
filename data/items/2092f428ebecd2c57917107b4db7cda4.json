  "description": "Today we wanted to introduce our Home Furnishing Design Team, which we developed specifically for those people that live in a home and just need furniture. Often we will present the client with about 2 options and they’ll ask why we’re only presenting two, but we go through a whole process of looking at multiple options, and then narrowing them down until we have 2 that are curated for their unique style. We only work one room at a time as this will ensure everything will be planned and completed correctly and of the highest quality, whereas if we’re focusing on more than one space at a time, things can get mixed up or mistakes can be made. Some people worry that their choices will go out of style, but if you love it and it is totally and completely you, even if it doesn’t quite go with current trends, it’ll never go out of style. <br /><br />Team introductions 1:35<br />What sparked creating the home furnishings design team 3:32<br />What brings clients to call this team 5:57<br />Narrowing down the right options 14:00<br />Timeline 15:35<br />One space at a time 18:55<br />Example of custom pieces 24:33<br />How to go about this process 29:23<br />Helping clients all over virtually 36:01<br />What is your why? 39:55<br />Staying inspired 43:00<br />How to access our services 46:40<br /><br />“This is a team of designers that just work specifically on furnishing your home.
