  "description": "<p>Today's guest is <a href=\"http://www.daviddfriedman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">David Friedman</a> of Santa Clara University. Our discussion centers around his upcoming book, <a href= \"http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Legal%20Systems/LegalSystemsContents.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Legal Systems Very Different From Ours</a>, which you can read in draft form at his website.</p> <p>David became interested in this topic when he became interested in the decentralized legal system of saga-period Iceland. This interest has since expanded into a full book covering everything from Imperial Chinese Law to the customary legal system of Somaliland in northern Somalia. We discuss some of these chapters, with a focus on Somalian, Jewish, Icelandic, and 18th-century British law. We also discuss some of the major themes of the book, such as feud law and embedded or polylegal systems.</p> <hr /> <p><strong>Related links:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2jD7jO5\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">I.
