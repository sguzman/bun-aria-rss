  "description": "We're going to be up front: this show is all about Jalen's appearance on Celebrity Jeopardy. It was an all-time performance, but not for the good reasons. We do a deep dive on the experience, why his buzzer wasn't buzzing, why he kept using words from the questions in his answers, and whether or not Mayim Bialik personally threw him out of the arena. A must listen. Now, of course Jalen & Jacoby also break down MNF, next week's Chiefs/Bills game, and we begin our string of NBA Previews, with breakout players for the upcoming season... but don't care about that.
