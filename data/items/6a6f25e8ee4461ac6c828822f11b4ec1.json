A 15-year-old boy is killed – and two of his friends are arrested and sentenced to life in prison, where they remain today. An evil teenage plot? Or a blatant miscarriage of justice? In this first season of PROOF, Susan Simpson and Jacinda Davis drive the back roads of Rome, searching for the truth.</p>\n",
