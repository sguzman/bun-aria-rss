  "description": "<p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 1:</p><p>Almost nobody showed up to see Obama in Philadelphia. Trump needs to remain calm, just get a tie at the debate. Nervousness on Democrat side, dam beginning to break on Hunter Biden story. More evidence piling up that backs up the information on Hunter's laptop. Trump must focus on the \"Big Guy\" Joe Biden at the debate. Business partner confirms Joe Biden is the \"Big Guy\" in the emails. FBI subpoenaed Hunter's laptop in 2019 in connection of money-laundering investigation. FBI not interested in rooting out corruption, interested in obtaining leverage over people in power. Trump's basement strategy, ghost candidacy is a rope-a-dope, forcing Trump to provide Biden's side of the argument and his own. Dems rerunning 2016 campaign, think they've won, America will register its hatred for Trump. If Trump wins, left will go berserk, take to the streets. Pelosi refuses to answer Hunter Biden question. TIME editor Ian Bremmer tweets about Biden corruption, said same thing back in 2019 when Biden looked like a sure loser in the primaries. Trump supporter nervous about the debate. Biden says America was an idea and we never lived up to it. He's running against America, speaks of it in the past tense.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>60 Minutes accuses Trump of \"unprecedented breach\" of agreement. Lesley's Stahl's bigoted question for Rush. Biden and the left want to erase the Constitution, fundamentally change the country as founded. Election is about sticking with the Founders' vision or going with Karl Marx. Trump should say that Hunter Biden is not above the law. Grandmother worries if the left wins they'll take down the Statue of Liberty. Biden will never be prosecuted. Biden's shadow campaign. Former CBS News journalist Connie Chung endorses Biden.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p>Trump releases full 60 Minutes interview on Facebook. Caller goes against the conventional wisdom, doesn't want to be presidential, wants Trump not to hold back at debate, stay on the attack. By running a phantom campaign, Dems have deprived Trump of somebody to bounce off of and react to, like Rush does with callers. Trump releases 60 Minutes video, arguing with Lesley Stahl over Biden story, Obama \"spying on his campaign\". Trump talks about \"spying on his campaign\" as if everyone knows the rest of the story. The spying was the least of what happened. It was a coup, an attempt to overturn the election based on the phony Russia hoax. Trump doesn't explain things he assumes people already know. The Silent Majority stayed Silent and allowed the radical left to speak unopposed. Obama did much more than spy on Trump's campaign.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
