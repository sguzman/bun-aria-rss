  "description": "<p>Meditation: Cultivating a Kind Attention (2019-08-07) - Using the image and felt sense of a smile, we scan through the body, and awaken a sense of aliveness, presence and tenderness. The practice then extends to mindfully include all sounds, sensations, and feelings; and when difficult experience arises, to intentionally offer care. We close with an offering of loving kindness to our own being, to others who are suffering and to all life everywhere.</p> <p>Join Tara's email community at <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=vr6RcUWppXe40kS0wc62R_8qMz98MTU1OTcwMzIzNEAxNTU5NjE2ODM0&q=http%3A%2F%2Feepurl.com%2F6YfI&v=Q2OuTLK8kKE&event=video_description\"> http://eepurl.com/6YfI</a>, to receive exclusive updates, events, and meditations.<br /> - Get a free download of Tara’s 10 min meditation: “Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease,\"<br /> - plus a bonus gift: \"8 Essential Tips to Nourish Your Meditation Practice.\"</p>",
