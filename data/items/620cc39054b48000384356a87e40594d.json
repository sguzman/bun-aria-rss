What role does pain tolerance play in addiction? Is a plant-based diet really that restrictive?<br /><br />For endurance athlete, author, and podcaster Rich Roll, these kinds of questions are just the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />In today’s episode of Impact Theory, Rich and I explore the landscape of ideas ranging everywhere from spirituality and his experience with 12 Steps, all the way to plant-based protein, vegan bodybuilders, and everywhere in between.<br /><br />So whether you or someone you love is struggling with addiction, you’re feeling out of touch with your purpose, or you simply want to know where to find the best vegan cheese on the planet, then this episode is for you.<br /><br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br />00:00 | Introduction<br />00:56 | Spirituality and Trusting Your Intuition<br />08:16 | Solving Problems by Letting Go<br />21:21 | The Importance of Creative Constraints<br />27:26 | Hubris and Self-Understanding<br />47:53 | Relapse and Dealing With Failure<br />58:36 | The Path to Recovery From Addiction<br />1:05:36 | SriMu and Rich’s Experience With Veganism<br />1:17:52 | Plant-Based Dietary Choices and Longevity<br /><br /><br />QUOTES:<br />“The biggest leaps that I've made in terms of personal growth, and in terms of my career, the beautiful things that I've been able to accomplish, I think are part and parcel attributable to having an interior spiritual life.” [02:56]<br /><br />“There were plenty of times when I wanted to jump ship and do the prudent, rational thing, because that's how I was raised. And that's what my education was all about. But having kind of come out the other side of it, I have a deeper appreciation for… the beauty in not always knowing.” [07:43]<br /><br />“I think most people are walking around, totally unconnected from themselves. They don't understand why they do what they do. They continue to do the same things over and over and over again, they flog themselves, and yet decline the opportunity to really deconstruct that.” [34:28]<br /><br />“If you have a very high pain tolerance, which a lot of addicts do, the fear or the pain associated with the change always exceeds the pain of their current situation. And it's not until or unless the pain of their current situation is so great, that overshadows the fear of doing something different.” [1:03:11]<br /><br />“First of all, nobody should go on a diet, they should be trying to change their lifestyle habits in a manner that is sustainable.” [1:15:57]<br /><br />Follow Rich Roll:<br />Website - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/1lTmUBQ\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/1lTmUBQ</a> <br />Twitter - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/1Rpn19v\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/1Rpn19v</a> <br />YouTube - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2ROrM2G\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2ROrM2G</a> <br />Instagram - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2PuIWAU\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2PuIWAU</a> <br />Facebook - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2A9vDAB\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2A9vDAB</a> <br />LinkedIn - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2A9Pbop\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2A9Pbop</a>",
