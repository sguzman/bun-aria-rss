  "description": "<p>We are very vocal about this episode, and that’s because it’s all about voices. We look into how our bodies produce sound and talk to a voice recognition expert. And we find out what’s happening when helium enters the equation. Plus, humans don’t have the voice market cornered -- what about other animals? We’ll drop in on a few creatures and find out how they make sounds too. All that plus a brand new Mystery Sound and berry delicious Moment of Um.     Today’s episode is sponsored by Quip (getquip.com/brainson), KiwiCo (kiwico.com/brainson), and Bombas (bombas.com/brains). You can support Brains On at brainson.org/donate</p>\n",
