  "description": "<div>In the past week one of our most loyal listeners and contributors to our show Glenn Ewing. Glenn was known to many as “Glenn the Security Guard,” as he told us his adventures and horror stories in the building that he was a security guard at. Glenn was always extremely authentic and real when he called into Real Ghost Stories Online. Most importantly, Glenn is a father. A father that loved his children and would do anything for them. In this horrible time for his family and children, we are asking if you could find it in your heart to help Glenn’s family get by. Here is the link to the Go Fund Me Page that is working to raise money to help his family:<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/glenn-ewing-family?utm_source=messenger&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=p_cf%20share-flow-1&fbclid=IwAR0Kp63LTohC_RxnLMSwpTrJ5-jSVannwX86pCImyzfipztPc9rwaXnqz2g\">https://www.gofundme.com/f/glenn-ewing-family?utm_source=messenger&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=p_cf%20share-flow-1&fbclid=IwAR0Kp63LTohC_RxnLMSwpTrJ5-jSVannwX86pCImyzfipztPc9rwaXnqz2g<br>\n</a><br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Please do what you can to help.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>RIP Glenn Ewing<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
