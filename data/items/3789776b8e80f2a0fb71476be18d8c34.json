  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show with Drew pitching Adam on the idea of making an Adam Carolla bobblehead toy to match his own (for sale now at drdrew.com). Adam also discusses diversity and the possible byproducts of ending up with Kamala Harris as President simply  because Joe Biden wanted a woman of color on the ticket. They then speak to a caller who has found a real medical syndrome that bears a striking resemblance to Restless Cock Syndrome, also known as RCS. Later they spend some time discussing The Love Boat before going back to the phones to speak to a caller who is concerned about a swollen lymph node on the heels of a Covid booster shot.\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nJordan Harbinger Show\nTenThousand.CC, code ADS\nSugarBreak.com/ADS, code ADS",
