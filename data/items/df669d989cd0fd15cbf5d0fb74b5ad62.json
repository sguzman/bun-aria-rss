  "description": "Hey HBs! We're here with part 1 of THE ROOMMATE by Rosie Danan! We each read this book over hiatus and LOVED IT, so we decided to cover it for y'all! We've got Clara, an East Coast blue blood who is completely scandal-averse, showing up in LA to finally woo her life-long crush. Great plan! Except that he's going on tour with his band (whoops!) and he's found her a roommate on craigslist. The roommate Josh turns out to be a mainstream porn star, utter dreamboat, and the man of her destiny! Y'all. This book. Heart eyes don't begin to cover it. \n Bonus Content: \n Erin’s bad decisions for celebrity friends regarding Crash Landing On You, tour van smells, goose sperms, we are on the record saying we’re NOT inviting dirty letters (!!), whimpers, sleepy boys, black hats/lists/balls/lists on hats?, calling sex \"balling\" *hork!*, being overly competitive, and so much more!\n Lady loves: \n Erin: In this time of great upheaval as we enter the vaccine stage of the pandemic, apply the rehab theory “do the next right thing.” It’s going to be harder, but it will work out better in the end. \n Melody: *sobs* be kind to yourself.
