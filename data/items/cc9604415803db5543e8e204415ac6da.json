  "description": "<p>TREAT OTHERS HOW YOU WANT TO BE TREATED. Kindness seems like a basic idea, but when you’re a champion it’s not high on your list. The Golden Rule isn’t always easy. Especially when you’re focused on yourself. But you can be the best and be good to others. It takes discipline. It takes mentorship. And it takes a commitment to what’s important in life. No matter what you’ve done in your past, you can always reinvent yourself. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I dive deep into never giving up from a champion who went through dark times: Mike Tyson. Tyson is a former undisputed heavyweight champion of the World and won his first 19 professional bouts by knockout, 12 of them in the first round. He holds the record as the youngest boxer to win the WBC, WBA and IBF heavyweight titles at 20 years, four months, and 22 days old. Mike Tyson is learning to forgive himself and be grateful. He also shares his feelings about discipline and how visualization helped him believe he could be a champion. So get ready to learn how to be a champion and why it’s never too late for a comeback on Episode 829.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nDid you know who you were at 25? (6:00)<br />\nWhat was your biggest fear in your early 20s? (10:00)<br />\nIf your 25 year-old self was sitting here, what would you tell him? (14:00)<br />\nWhat are you most proud of? (36:30)<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nAbout Mike Tyson’s spiritual journey (4:30)<br />\nThe power of visualization (19:00)<br />\nWhen Mike started to feel more peace in his heart (32:00)<br />\nWhy you should think outside the box (42:30)<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode, check out the video, show notes and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/829 and follow at insagram.com/lewishowes.</p>\n",
