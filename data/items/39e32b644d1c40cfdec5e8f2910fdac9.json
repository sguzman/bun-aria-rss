    "media:description": "Humanoid is probably the largest abandoned project of mine.  It was a retro-style adventure game, but it was eventually scrapped when I started moving on to other projects.  So this video aims to at least document this otherwise unknown project.\n\nQ: \"Can I download or play this game?\"\nA: It's not a finished game, and a lot of scenes from the video had to be hacked to access different rooms or events.  It's not in a 'demo-able' state, and I don't have the time yet to get it there.  I may open source the engine at some point, but I don't know if it's really that useful with no support or documentation, and I would not recommend anyone to use it anyway (that's already a hard lesson learned for me).\n\nQ: Hyperbolica?\nA: Yes.  Still working on it, and I still don't have an expected release date yet.  It will be ready when it's done.\n\nMusic By Razerek\n\"Suspended In Midair\" https://soundcloud.com/razerek/suspended-in-mid-air\n\"Rattlesnake Pond\" https://soundcloud.com/razerek/rattlesnake_pondit-s3xmoditmania-round-1\n\"Aftermath Of The Tremors At Vinegar Lake\" https://soundcloud.com/razerek/aftermath-of-the-tremors-at-vinegar-lake\nhttps://razerek.bandcamp.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/Razerek_",
