  "description": "As everyone likes to notice, The Second Epistle of Clement is neither an epistle nor by Clement. So why does this early second-century Christian document matter so much? Second Clement: An Introductory Commentary (Wipf and Stock, 2020) by William Varner, professor of Greek and New Testament at the Master's University, Santa Clarita, California, opens up key themes in the text, highlights its significance as a receptor of canonical and non-canonical textual traditions, and shows how it reflects organisational trends in the early Christian movement.  \n Crawford Gribben is a professor of history at Queen’s University Belfast.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
