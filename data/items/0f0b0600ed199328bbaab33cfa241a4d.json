  "title": "222: How to Become a Regular Meditator (and More) | Alexis Santos",
  "description": "While in medical school in the mid-90's, Alexis Santos found himself in the midst of a spiritual crisis. At one of the top medical schools in the country, he felt unfulfilled and disillusioned by the stress and unhappiness around him and in his fellow students. After two years, he changed course and travelled to India, where he was first introduced to insight meditation on a 10-day retreat in the S.N. Goenka tradition. Interested to deepen his meditation practice, he happened across Sayadaw U Tejaniya, an unknown meditation teacher in Burma at the time. Recognizing his good fortune, Alexis decided to stay on, where he ordained as a Buddhist monk for two years. At the encouragement of Sayadaw U Tejaniya, Alexis began teaching and in 2016 he completed the Spirit Rock/Insight Meditation Society teacher training program with Joseph Goldstein, Jack Kornfield and others. He now teaches meditation retreats at centers throughout North America, Europe and Australia. In this episode, the conversation gets an interesting start with Alexis sharing his views on sleepiness and meditation, and then moving on to his time in Burma with Sayadaw U Tejaniya, the masculine and feminine approach to meditation and habit formation and how to use all our waking hours to practice meditation in daily life.\nWebsite: https://www.alexissantos.io/about\nAlexis courses in the app: https://10percenthappier.app.link/Alexis-Santos\nAlexis Santos on Dharma Seed: https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/525/\nPodcast Insiders Feedback Group: https://10percenthappier.typeform.com/to/vHz4q4\nTen Percent Happier Discount:\nwww.tenpercent.com/2020\nHave a question for Dan?
