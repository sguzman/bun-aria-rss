  "description": "<p>Many leaders think that leadership flows in one direct: from top to bottom. But if leadership is influence––nothing more, nothing less––then leadership can flow from bottom to top and from side to side. That’s called leading across. Leading across means leading your colleagues, your peers––people you don’t have positional leadership over. In today’s lesson, John Maxwell is going to teach the 7 phases of the leadership loop, which every leader who wishes to lead across must embrace.</p> <p>After John’s lesson, Mark Cole will be joined by Chris Goede to discuss what they’ve learned as they’ve embraced these principles to lead across within the Maxwell Leadership organization.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the “Leadership Loop Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Loop and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.maxwellleadership.com/The-360-Degree-Leader-Paperback_p_3013.html\"> <em>The 360° Leader</em> by John C.
