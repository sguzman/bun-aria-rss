  "description": "<p>Welcome back to The Literary Life Podcast and the second episode of our series on George MacDonald's <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/3oMBNhp\">Phantastes</a></em>, covering chapters 5-9. Angelina and Thomas kick off the book chat sharing some thoughts on the Duessa-type character in this section. Cindy mentions the connection she made to James Russell Lowell's poem, \"The Vision of Sir Launfal.\" They go on to discuss the parallels between this section and the Pygmalion myth. Other mythological references abound throughout the story, as we will see. Our hosts go deep exploring the themes of deception, the fall, doppelgangers and spiritual death in these chapters.</p> <p>Don’t forget to check out the Advent and Christmas resources our hosts have ready for your holiday season. As mentioned before, Cindy’s new edition of <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/3lnyUBe\">Hallelujah: Cultivating Advent Traditions with Handel’s Messiah</a></em> is available now, and she has a live celebration even happening on November 19, 2020.

Also, Thomas and Angelina have a sale going on for an <a href= \"https://houseofhumaneletters.com/product/advent-bundle/\">Advent Bundle</a> of their popular webinars, Charles Dickens’ <em>A Christmas Carol</em> and The Poetry of Advent. Additionally, Kelly Cumbee will be teaching a webinar series called “<a href= \"https://houseofhumaneletters.com/product/seeking-the-discarded-image-nature/\">Seeking the Discarded Image: Nature</a>.”</p> <p>Be back next week when we will cover chapters 10-14.

Hence <em>Paradise Lost</em> is a series of interlocking visions, Adam warned by the cathartic contrapuntal vision of satanic fall, and fall through vision of Eve. To fall is to choose an illusion, not a wrong reason.</p> <cite>Northrup Frye</cite></blockquote> <h3>When I have Fears That I May Cease to Be</h3> <p><em>by John Keats</em></p> <p>When I have fears that I may cease to be <br />    Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain, <br /> Before high-pilèd books, in charactery, <br />    Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain; <br /> When I behold, upon the night’s starred face, <br />    Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance, <br /> And think that I may never live to trace <br />    Their shadows with the magic hand of chance; <br /> And when I feel, fair creature of an hour, <br />    That I shall never look upon thee more, <br /> Never have relish in the faery power <br />    Of unreflecting love—then on the shore <br /> Of the wide world I stand alone, and think <br /> Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">(Amazon affiliate links)</span></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3f2q0qL\">Last Child in the Woods</a></em> by Richard Louv</p> <p><em>Notebooks on Renaissance Literature</em> by Northrup Frye</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2UzijPm\">The Silver Chair</a></em> by C.
