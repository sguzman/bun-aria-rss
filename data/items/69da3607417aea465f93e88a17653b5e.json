  "description": "Every parent we know wants their kids to feel good about their bodies. But here's the tricky thing about body confidence: It has little to do with feeling good about our appearance, and much more to do with feeling good inside. In this episode, Dr. Becky talks with three parents striving to break intergenerational cycles around body image. She not only shares practical strategies for helping your child feel worthy from the inside out, but also explores how to mindfully engage with society's beauty ideals. As she highlights, raising our kids differently doesn't mean protecting them from these ideals, but helping them learn to pause, get curious, and form their own ideas.\n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
