We&#8217;ve come so far together since then!</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So it looks like my 15-year-old is officially a high-school dropout. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Halfway through ninth grade, emboldened perhaps by the taste of freedom that Covid-era remote learning had provided, he realized that the whole system was just too slow and inefficient for him, and was &#8220;Getting in the way of his work.&#8221; So as it looks now, he&#8217;ll probably never return to any sort of in-person schooling, and I will be surprised if he ever attends college. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, he is technically &#8220;home schooling&#8221; and will still end up with a high school diploma of sorts, but in reality he is pretty much winging it. And needless to say, I have mixed feelings about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll start with the worries and the negative stuff, because as a parent I of course want the best for my child. And when I look back on my own childhood, it feels like school was a fountain of formative experiences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, the education itself was slow and crappy &#8211; I was always craving more advanced material and more creative learning formats which just weren&#8217;t there in my small town high school. But isn&#8217;t enduring crappy and antiquated systems a critical part of getting ready to live in a modern society where things don&#8217;t always go your way? After all, the only way to renew a drivers license or a passport (or a medical license for that matter) is to dive head first into the ridiculousness and grin and bear it for the sake of the end goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course there were plenty of good parts: I had <em>so many </em>amazing experiences and friendships and adventures through high school and university. Beginner romances and heartbreaks, brushes with the law, late nights around the campfire, terrible minimum wage jobs at gas stations and convenience stores that I thought were amazing, all bathed in a swirling Marijuana-tinged soundtrack of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, Soundgarten and Primus and Tool. Doing reverse snow donuts in my mom&#8217;s 1988 Dodge Caravan filled with eight friends and then getting out to dance crazily in the headlights to the Wayne&#8217;s World soundtrack blasting from the giant stereo system I had built into the minivan with my own 16-year-old hands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How will my son grow up as a well-adjusted adult without the 2020s equivalent of such experiences?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when I obsess over these thoughts, I know I am falling into the oldest of parenting traps: <strong>assuming I know what&#8217;s best for my child</strong>, and that his own desires and thoughts are not valid, even though he&#8217;s on the verge of adulthood himself. So I remind myself of the <em>positive </em>side of this situation:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world of 2021 is a very different place from my equivalent perch in 1991. And my son happens to be sitting in an unusual but still promising (I hope) little corner of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Because of the Internet, and to be honest a damned large dose of privilege due to having two educated parents always available because we were retired before he was even born, he has been able to feed his thirst for knowledge with incredible efficiency. This is an advantage that is still not available to most people today, let alone to what people of my generation had to work with in 1989. So he has already gone beyond college level in the standard fields that they cover in school.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So <em>of course </em>he has noticed that the existing school system is not as efficient as his custom-crafted alternative. Like me, he feels frustration with many of our institutions. But it&#8217;s a frustration born of love and a desire to help out, rather than just a complainypants attitude and a desire to criticize. Public school for all is a <strong>great<em> </em></strong>thing and a great idea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like everything in life, we can only improve by first <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/07/10/to-achieve-greatness-you-must-first-acknowledge-that-you-suck/\" target=\"_blank\">acknowledging that we currently suck</a></span>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing that little MM did upon retiring from formal schooling, is to<strong> </strong>create this entire 48 minute mini-documentary about the system he just left: <br><br><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/0Qi36WcylLs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">https://youtu.be/0Qi36WcylLs</a></span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>(click that link to get to get the full experience on YouTube itself and see the description, show notes and comments. I&#8217;ll include an embedded version below for lazier people<br><br>also, a hint for <em>any </em>YouTube creator you want to reward: their algorithm heavily recommends and promotes videos which people watch for longer. So, let it roll and enjoy the epic soundtrack!)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Qi36WcylLs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Seeing him work so hard on this production definitely helped ease my fears about whether or not he will grow up to be a contributing member of society. He spent about three months researching the US school system, writing himself a script, composing a 16-track orchestral music score which is timed <em>to the second </em>to align with the appropriate parts of the film, creating 3-D models and animations in Blender to illustrate the main points, running multiple high-end computers overnight, night after night to render the complex scenes in 4K resolution, turning my house into a miniature version of a Pixar animation studio. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Then </em>he practiced up his reading, set up a bright professional recording studio in my basement, recruited me to help build a teleprompter, and narrated his own script into the camera. And finally brought it all back to the editing software to cut it all together, with pretty stunning results from my admittedly biased perspective as his Dad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But equally important, the danged kid has a point: schools really could be a lot better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it could happen very quickly with just one main change as he explains in the documentary: <strong>switching from bland and repetitive teacher-led instruction, to extremely high quality videos instead. </strong>This would accelerate learning because the video content could be <em>much </em>more compelling than watching a human stand at the front of a room. But it would also free up the teachers to help individual students rather than just using their valuable time to repeat the same material, year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even better: most of these videos already exist. Through some sort of miracle, my son has chosen to invest the past five years of his free time seeking out astoundingly good YouTube channels, watching most of their back catalogs, and absorbing the contents of almost every episode. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m often shocked at his level of knowledge in so many fields, so I sat him down and interviewed him on his top recommendations in some of the key ones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The list below is what we came up with. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of these myself, and I can vouch for their quality. If you&#8217;re looking for places to send your own hungry-brained child, or for things to watch together, check out the following list.<br><br><strong>Flipping the Classroom:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a context for all of this, you absolutely <em>must </em>know about Khan Academy first. This is a free video education in all major subjects, that is higher quality than most in-school lessons. Many teachers are already using this system to &#8220;flip the classroom&#8221;, and my own boy and I used Khan Academy to help him cover second through eighth grade math in only a month. That&#8217;s how efficient video learning can be! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>because we were so impressed and thankful, I also donated </em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"$9000 to Khan academy in 2016 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/10/26/notes-on-giving-away-100000/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>$9000 to Khan academy in 2016</em></a><em>.

It might go well, but there will surely be some pitfalls and downsides as well. Neither of us is perfect and we make errors in judgement sometimes. But this feels right and promising right now, so we are running with it. We will learn from our mistakes and develop ourselves along the way, and make the most of it. Which is really a good plan for life itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congratulations my not-so-little MM, I am proud of you and I wish you the best in this next crazy chapter!</p>\n",
