  "description": "Hooked is an in-depth analysis of how to build habit-forming products that allow for customer retention. Following the 'Hook Model' consisting of a trigger, action, reward and investment, product forming companies have a model to develop and market in our current system. The book centres on the 'Hook Model' explaining in detail how it can apply in the real world and how it has helped companies such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat to amass such a large following. It goes onto explain habit forming in more depth developing on the 'Habit Loop' made famous by Charles Duhigg. It's a technical book, explicitly made for product developers, to create and distribute exceptional products. I enjoy reading about habit formation, so this book gave me insights that I didn't know before. If you have the same curiosity in habit formation, especially in business, then I highly suggest you read this book. I rate it four stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
