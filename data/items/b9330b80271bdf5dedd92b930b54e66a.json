Beneath surface-level tariffs, the value chains that would be broken by a hard border in the English Channel could have far-reaching consequences.

Our calculations specify the gap to be filled if the UK were to stop contributing immediately, as well as the spread of the additional burden across the EU's member countries.&#13;\n&#13;\nFor further reading on this subject, consider Guntram Wolff's Policy Contribution on [how well prepared the EU might be for a no-deal Brexit scenario](http://bruegel.org/2019/01/the-implications-of-no-deal-brexit-is-the-european-union-prepared/), as well as Zsolt Darvas' full breakdown of [the implications for the EU budget of the UK 'crashing out' of the union](http://bruegel.org/2019/01/eu-budget-implications-of-a-no-deal-brexit/).",
