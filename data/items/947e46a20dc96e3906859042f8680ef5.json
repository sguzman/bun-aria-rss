From the toilet, to the sewers, to a treatment plant, our waste travels quite a distance only to end up cleaner by the end. We'll hear from a \"PooTube\" star about her experience with \"the flush.\" We'll also hear about ancient sewers, a \"fatberg\" under London and a toilet that cleans waste on site. Plus, our Moment of Um answers why you can feel your heart beating in your neck of all places.</p>\n<p>Sponsors for this episode include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The new Kevin Henkes book, \"Sweeping Up The Heart‚Äù </p></li>\n<li><p>Panama City Beach (visitpanamacitybeach.com)</p></li>\n<li><p>Calm (Calm.com/brainson) for 25% off premium subscription</p></li>\n<li><p>Quip (getquip.com/brainson) to get your first refill pack free.</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>And you can support the show at brainson.org/donate !</p>\n",
