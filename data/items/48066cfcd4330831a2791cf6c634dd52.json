  "description": "<p>Commuting to work sucks! It’s likely one of your least favorite things to do everyday assuming you’re an individual commuter, driving along in your own metal box that costs you thousands to own and operate. It’s stressful dealing with traffic and not to mention our cars encourage us to be lazy and perpetuate the lifestyle of excess and consumption. I mean does it really require a $15,000+ luxury vehicle that weighs over 4,000 lbs to transport a single individual to work and back?! In this episode we discuss the alternatives to traditional commuting, and specifically how these alternatives benefit employees, employers, cities as a whole, and obviously the environment. Listen to the entire episode to learn what steps you can take today, regardless of your situation.</p><p>At the beginning of this episode we each cracked open a couple beers from John, a local home brewer here in Atlanta- sorry, you won't be finding this one on your local grocery store shelf. It is called A Splinter in the Mind by Little Cottage, a flanders red which we've dubbed our favorite beer of 2018!
