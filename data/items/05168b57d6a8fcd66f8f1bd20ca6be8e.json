  "description": "<p>It's been a few weeks since Kirk's announcement but on the advice of his therapist, he's back... At least for today. Kirk reviews the Quantum Week Live show and dinner beforehand. He has concluded that Harrison is talented but a zero. Two Minifans behind Kirk irritated him and possibly ruined the entire evening.  Greg Hill brags about being in second place. Mike wants to move to Texas but Alba won't do it.  Was Lou Merloni banned from the Red Sox Playoff booth because of Sean McDonough?</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
