  "description": "We are so thrilled to welcome renowned and veteran architect Peter Pennoyer to the show. Over the last 30 years, he has grown his business, Peter Pennoyer Architects, to a 50-person firm of architects, interior designers, and related professionals with projects completed all over the world. He has co-written seven (!!!) books including most recently the introduction for Rowdy Meadow: House - Land - Art available now. We talk in-depth about the house in the book, the many details involved, and Peter’s approach to this and every project.\nAlso, be sure to take our survey at the end of the episode!\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nTrials & Triumphs with a basement turned art studio, communicating with a builder and architect, hosting visitors, falling in love with a hallway, modern sconces, gardening fails, robot vacuums, and maternity leave!\n\nBackground on the house and property in Peter’s new book Rowdy Meadow: House - Land - Art.\n\nWere all of the craftsmen on the house based locally in Cleveland?\n\nPeter gives a description of what the Czech Cubism of the house looks like and its origin.\n\nHow long was the design process?\n\nWas it difficult to make the house feel like home while also being museum-quality?\n\nMore about the incredible tilework of the house.\n\nHow was it mixing antique pieces with modern pieces?\n\nWhat it was like coordinating with so many people on a project.\n\nWhat it was like working with all the landscaping and incorporating it into the design.\n\nWhat is Peter’s favorite part of the house?\n\nDid Peter approach this project the same as his other projects?\n\nCreating a 16-sided room!\n\nWhat is Peter’s favorite part of any building process?\n\nWhy Peter recommends every design professional visits Prague.\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Consuela,\nI think you’re very lucky that your apartment is facing South on a high floor, is full of light, and that the living room has windows on the long side. There are two ways to do this. One is to place an L-shaped couch in the Northeast corner of the room with maybe a club chair facing into the corner. Then place the TV to the left of the window on the other wall. This will give you more space to have a larger desk which could also double as a table to host friends to eat in that room instead of the small breakfast room. With this option, you would have to take that door off the hinges. It’s taking up too much room and I don’t think you’ll ever close that. The other way is to have the TV on the narrow, East end of the room. And then place a sofa and two chairs in a more conventional set up around the fireplace facing the TV. It would also give you plenty of room to put the desk against the West wall. With either option, I think you could hang a fabric panel or identical large-size mirrors on the niches of the fireplace wall. I think the radiator would look better if you take that large box off of it (if you don’t have small children) and you could pay someone to clean it up and paint it.\nThis is a really great NYC apartment with a beautiful view. Good luck and please send us after photos! We want to see if you chose option 1 or 2… or neither! As always, we recommend using our Room Planner.\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nPeter Pennoyer Architects\nPeter Pennoyer on Instagram\nRowdy Meadow: House - Land - Art\nStray Dog Designs \nA Year at Clove Brook Farm by Christopher Spitzmiller",
