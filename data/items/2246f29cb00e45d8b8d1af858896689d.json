  "description": "Chris Parnell's long comedy career has taken him through a surprising number of venerable comedy institutions. He started out in the improv troupe The Groundlings. He was a major player on Saturday Night Live for years, appearing in some of the show's best sketches. And after SNL, he played the batty Dr. Spaceman on 30 Rock, as well as appearing in almost every other one of your favorite 21st century sitcoms. At present, he's a major part of the voice casts for FXX's Archer and adult swim's Rick and Morty. He joins Todd to talk about why great comedy requires great acting, working with his friends who've become megastars, and why he's glad he didn't get that part in Homeland.\n      \n      \n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
