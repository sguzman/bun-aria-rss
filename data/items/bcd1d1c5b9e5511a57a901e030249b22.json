  "title": "95 - Pancho MFN' Villa: Mexico's Robin Hood",
  "description": "<p>Pancho Villa! Pancho Villa was a revolutionary fighter who despised the wealthy landowners who had subjugated the impoverished farming class, comprised of mostly indigenous people, since long before he was born. He stole from the rich and gave to the poor. He also stole from the rich to fuel the various wars he fought in, all of which had the same goal - to topple Mexico’s existing power structure and redistribute the wealth the upper 1% possessed amongst the poor. He was one of the world’s first movie stars, and he wasn’t an actor. In a way, he was the world’s first reality TV star, because at one point he allowed actual battles he fought in to be filmed. And we’re gonna learn all about him, and a lot about Mexico along the way, in another power to the people edition of Timesuck</p>\n<p>Want to help Harmony Vellekamp?
