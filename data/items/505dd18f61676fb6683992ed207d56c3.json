  "title": "Crush It by Gary Vaynerchuk",
  "description": "This book is a practical guide to executing on your passion in the digital social media age. As a successful entrepreneur, Gary predicates his brand on bringing the most value to his followers, he does this exceptionally well in Crush it, the first of five best-selling books. The key message that derives from the book is that passion is everything. Regardless of race, gender or background, if your passion has a deeper personal meaning then the chances are you will be able to monetize it in some way. Even though the book is written in 2009, the concepts and actions that are described in this book still hold true. The reason why I like this book so much is unlike most practical business books it doesn’t leave the reader asking questions, Gary tell you what you need and must do for your dreams to become reality. For these reasons, I give this book a five-star rating.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
