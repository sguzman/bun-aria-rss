  "description": "<p>Dave Dameshek is in Dallas for the 2018 NFL Draft and is first joined by Move The Sticks podcast host Daniel Jeremiah to preview Thursday night (4:19). First, Shek asks DJ which players have the highest bust potential (8:41), DJ then explains why Sam Darnold is a better fit for the Browns and playing in the AFC North than Josh Rosen (10:58). Lastly Shek asks DJ who each of the 32 NFL teams would take first overall if they had the chance (17:07). Next, NFL Network analyst Steve Mariucci and Stanford Cardinal head football coach Dave Shaw join the DDFP (35:42). Shek asks Coach Shaw how he game planned against Josh Rosen and Sam Darnold when his Stanford teams faced UCLA and USC (41:48). The coaches answer would you rather the cerebral game manager or the gunslinger to which Mooch talks about his time with Brett Favre and Steve Young (44:47). Coach Shaw also gives an update on Andrew Luck's status and Mooch says why the NFL needs Andrew Luck (1:01:55). </p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
