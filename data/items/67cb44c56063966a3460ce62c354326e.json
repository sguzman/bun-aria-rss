  "description": "To the Left, “unity” means “destroy everyone we disagree with.” But Dr. Ben Carson has another message: “We are not each other’s enemies.” As the Biden administration insists America is systemically racist, Dr. Carson’s life proves just how far we’ve come. Despite facing poverty as a child, he became a renowned neurosurgeon, a candidate for president, and former secretary of Housing and Urban Development — one of the only Cabinet members to survive all four years of the Trump administration. He joins Glenn to review his time in the administration, including as part of the White House’s coronavirus task force, and how he discovered “the swamp is deeper and wider than I expected.” But above all, he urges Americans to take courage and stand for our freedoms — and previews his newest venture to do just that as founder and chairman of the American Cornerstone Institute: “What version of America do we want?”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
