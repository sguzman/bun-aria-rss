  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the idea that former President Trump stole documents when he has the utmost authority to declassify records that are classified or otherwise is moronic. He is not subject to criminal charges because the Presidential Records Act anticipates the nuance of any president leaving office and retaining documents, this is absurd. The government had less-intrusive options but opted for the most aggressive means possible because it allowed them to seize as much as they felt like. It's clear that in this case, Donald Trump is below the law as he's been treated worse than any other citizen would be. Then, a full-fledged operation in Fairfax Virginia is underway to push transgenderism on kids. This would not happen in Florida as Governor Ron DeSantis and the parents are working together to prevent it. Afterward, Congressman Lee Zeldin, candidate for Governor of New York, calls in to discuss New York Governor Kathy Hochul's comments about conservatives not being real New Yorkers and banishing the to Florida. Zeldin added that crime is rampant in New York and a change in leadership is needed now. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
