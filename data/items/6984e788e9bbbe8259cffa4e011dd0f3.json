  "description": "Today’s show is highlighted by two incredible interviews. First, Pat welcomes 4x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, former Heisman Trophy winner, NFL Offensive ROY, and Titans/Oilers Ring of Honor member, Eddie George. Pat and Eddie chat about this weekend’s Titans/Ravens game and why he thinks that Mark Ingram is the key to getting the Ravens going, and why he has hope for the Titans with Ingram being hobbled by a calf injury. Eddie also explains why he loved running the football in snow and cold weather, and if he thinks the terrible weather in Baltimore this weekend is going to play a factor. Eddie also talks a little bit about his time in Dallas and whether he thinks the Cowboys will ever be able to be successful again with Jerry being more important than the Head Coach, and Eddie gives his College Football Playoff championship game pick (2:40-19:55). Also joining the program is Super Bowl Champion, 5th pick of the 2006 NFL Draft for the Green Bay Packers, friend of the show, and one of the most hilarious humans on the face of the earth, AJ Hawk. Pat gets the pulse of the Packers from AJ who has had contact with Aaron Rodgers very recently and see’s where his head is at going into this weekend against the Seahawks at Lambeau. AJ breaks down what we should be looking for in that game, and why exactly Rodgers ramps it up during these types of games when everyone in the media is taking shots at him. Pat and AJ also catch up and take a few shots at one another in the process (24:39-39:38). Pat and the boys also react to Mike McCarthy’s first press conference as Head Coach of the Dallas Cowboys and also chat about Matt Rhule being introduced as the newest Head Coach of the Carolina Panthers and whether his coaching style will translate to the NFL. Pat also takes a phone call from someone who has a very interesting take on where Tom Brady may end up. Stick around to learn how you can potentially win $1,000 in another massive giveaway. Today’s show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
