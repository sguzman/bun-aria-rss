  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show breaking down a video wherein The Young Turks were berating Adam for his thoughts on school breakfast while not really making any cohesive points. Dr. Drew talks about a revelation he had about some places in his life where he feels he has been falling short and feels he needs to atone for and the strange feeling that he got in the process. The guys go to the phones where a caller is wondering if he can date someone he know through AA before Drew explores why it took him so long to see 'The Shining'.",
