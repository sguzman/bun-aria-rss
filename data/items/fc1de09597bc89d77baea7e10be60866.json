  "title": "Ep 69 | Leftists Need Black America, but Candace Owens Doesn’t Need the Left | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "The leftist media has tried to whitewash her, paint her as privileged, and call her a traitor to her race. But conservative activist and BLEXIT founder Candace Owens has had enough of the games and victimization. Once a leftist herself, she watched as the Left demonized cultural icons like Donald Trump and Kanye West and realized how dependent the Left is on black America. She has experienced firsthand how desperately the Left insists that black Americans are victims in the Trump era, especially when they disagree. But her rough upbringing and strong work ethic have led her to a different calling: to free black America from the bondage of progressivism. And like Kanye and Trump, she’s not letting any politician tell her what to believe.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
