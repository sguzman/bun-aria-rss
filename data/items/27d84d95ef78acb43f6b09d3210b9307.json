  "description": "<p>In this Candid Conversation with John C. Maxwell and Mark Cole, John shares five principles for how to lead when you’re in over your head. These are principles John has gleaned throughout his career as he has taken on challenges necessary to accomplish a vision bigger than himself.</p> <p>John points out: “The principles of survival are not the same as the principles of success.” Too often, leaders resort to the former in times of stress, and they allow obstacles and situations to stall progress and growth.
