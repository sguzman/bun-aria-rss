  "description": "<p>“I describe it as a fantasy novel about the real world we live in, or a realistic novel about the fantasy world we live in.” <em>Anthem</em> is Noah Hawley’s terrific, page-turning sixth novel, and his first after his Edgar Award-winning bestseller, <em>Before The Fall</em>—it’s also our January 2022 Barnes & Noble Book Club pick. Noah joins us on the show for a wide-ranging, spoiler-free conversation about breaking the fourth wall, the death of satire, how we can use fiction to help us make sense of a nonsensical world (even when our brains are working overtime “to maintain the illusion we believe in.”), writing for the screen vs. writing for the page, and more, including the ways Kurt Vonnegut’s <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em> and J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings inspired <em>Anthem. </em>Featured books: <em>Anthem</em> by Noah Hawley, <em>Slaughterhouse Five</em> by Kurt Vonnegut, <em>Lord of the Rings</em> by J.R.R. Tolkien, <em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em> by Milan Kundera, <em>Song of Solomon </em>by Toni Morrison, <em>The Virgin Suicides</em> by Jeffrey Eugenides, <em>White Noise</em> by Don DeLillo, and <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.</p> <p> </p> <p><em>Poured Over</em> is produced and hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang. Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays (and occasional bonus eps on Saturdays).</p>",
