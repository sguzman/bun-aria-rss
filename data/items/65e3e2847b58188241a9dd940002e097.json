  "title": "Tears & Tantrums: What to Do When Things Don’t Go as Planned [30]",
  "description": "<p>Things haven’t gone to plan chez Alice and Louise this week. Alice’s much anticipated summer break was swamped by rain, meaning a lot of wet walks and NONE of the planned sketchbook days out. To compound the situation, she also lost internet which meant she couldn’t catch up on important work. Louise worked for months on an online course, only to be let down by Zoom, YouTube and Mailchimp all on the same evening. The result was less than pretty!</p>\n<p>Given these mini-disasters, we discuss how we react when things go wrong. It’s easy to say ‘put things into perspective’ but do we need to feel that emotion first? And if so, is there a way to feel the emotion, but also keep things in perspective?</p>\n<p>We also answer a question about art degrees. One listener is considering whether to go for an MA. &nbsp;We acknowledge that being an artist is about learning and stretching yourself, but we wonder whether taking an advanced degree is a safe option that simply postpones the inevitable time when you have to do this for yourself anyway.</p>\n<p>We would love to hear you views on this topic too, if you’ve taken an MA, what did you feel it gave you?</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Louise's course - </strong><a href=\"https://thispaintinglife.mykajabi.com/sign-up\"><strong>Find Your Joy</strong></a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.dots.co/twodots/\">Two Dots</a> - you really don’t want to waste your time on this (unless you are only human!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\"><strong>Buy us a coffee and support the podcast here&nbsp;</strong></a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\"><strong>bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram: </strong>@alicesheridanstudio&nbsp; @louisefletcher_art &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>See fuller show notes on our websites: </strong><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\"><strong>www.alicesheridan.com</strong></a> <a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\"><strong>www.louisefletcerart.com</strong></a></p>\n<p><u><strong>Credits</strong></u></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
