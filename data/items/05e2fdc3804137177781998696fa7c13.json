  "description": "<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Netflix will give investors a glimpse of its growth Tuesday with the release of its quarterly earnings report. It’s been hard to sustain the pace of 2020, when the world was stuck at home on the couch. But now the company is chasing a new market: video games. And it&#8217;s a big one. Mobile gaming generated an estimated $90 billion in 2021. Over the last year, Netflix has bought up small, independent gaming studios— it acquired a third one last month. The company now offers multiple titles free to subscribers, including a card game, bowling, an upcoming first-person shooter and two based on its popular show &#8220;Stranger Things.&#8221; Leveraging a company&#8217;s intellectual property for games is nothing new, but how well can Netflix play this game? Michael Pachter is a research analyst with Wedbush Securities. He told &#8220;Marketplace Tech&#8217;s&#8221; Meghan McCarty Carino that Netflix&#8217;s catalog of hit shows might not lend itself to this strategy.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n",
