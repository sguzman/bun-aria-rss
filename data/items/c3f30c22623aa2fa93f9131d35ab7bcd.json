  "description": "<div>Julie Bindel is a radical feminist, journalist and activist. Growing up in Darlington, she left school aged 15, and at 16 moved to Leeds in search of – in her own words – 'scary-sounding feminists'. In the 90s, she founded Justice For Women, a feminist campaigning organisation that supports, and advocates on behalf of, women who have fought back against or killed violent men. On the podcast, Julie talks about her upbringing in the North East, her fight in the gender ideology debate, and she shares her thoughts on Pretty Woman. <br>\n<br>\nTo read more on Julie Bindel, visit her Substack page <a href=\"https://substack.com/profile/91305008-julie-bindel\">here</a>. </div>\n",
