  "description": "<p>Southwest of Salem: The Story of the San Antonio Four excavates the nightmarish persecution of Elizabeth Ramirez, Cassandra Rivera, Kristie Mayhugh, and Anna Vasquez - four Latina lesbians wrongfully convicted of gang-raping two little girls in San Antonio, Texas. The film begins its journey inside a Texas prison, after these women have spent nearly a decade behind bars. They were 19 and 20 years old at the time the allegations surfaced. Using the women's home video footage from 21 years ago combined with recent verit√© footage and interviews, the film explores their personal narratives and their search for exculpatory evidence to help their losing criminal trials.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> WHO COULD BLAME YOU! <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Join our Patreon fam</a> and instantly get over <strong>80 FULL BONUS episodes to BINGE RIGHT NOW!</strong> Including our episode-by-episode coverage of <strong>\"Serial,\" \"The Jinx,\" \"Making A Murderer,\" \"The Staircase\"</strong> and so many more!
