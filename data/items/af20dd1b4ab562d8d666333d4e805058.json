  "description": "<p>Raising beef can seem like a difficult and daunting task on the surface, but suprisingly it's one of the easiest methods of producing food on the homestead.  While we've had issues in the past with other food sources, that's never been the case with beef.  In today's episode I cover the essentials you'll need to begin growing beef of your own.  Learn about the different fencing options, the differences bewtween heifers and steers, how to determine the type of animal you need, and so much more.  Also, if you happen to be one of those individuals that simply don't have the space to grow your own beef don't fret.  There's still a number of ways you can get into the beef game and stop relying on the mass producers.  If you've ever thought of raising your own beef, this is a podcast you won't want to miss.</p><p>I am so thrilled to have Mason Jars Makerplace as our July sponsor! I have been using their ReCap lids & mason jar accessories non-stop this year as I work on beefing up our pantry.  These lids come in a variety of styles-- flip top, pour spout, shaker inserts, and even sprayers and soap pumps.
