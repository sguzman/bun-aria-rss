  "description": "Enough about the 'Word of the Year.' How about the 'Word of the Decade'? Bailout? Google? Martha and Grant discuss some candidates. Also in this episode, does speaking a different language make you feel different emotion'? What did Don Draper on 'Mad Men' mean when he called Betty a 'Main Line brat'? And why do we talk about 'throwing someone under the bus'?  Where'd we get the expression 'mind your p's and q's'? A Barcelona native wants help understanding exactly what it means, and shares a few other English idioms that caught her up short.  A die-hard fan of television's 'Mad Men' is puzzled when Don calls Betty a 'Main Line brat.'  Grant's been collecting contenders for 2009's 'Word of the Year,' including 'Dracula sneeze,' 'Government Motors,' and...'unumbium'?  Quiz Guy John Chaneski sums up the events of 2009 in the form of limericks, all with a blank to be filled. Here's one:  NASA really put on a great show A new lunar crater did blow To the glee of mankind The rocket did find That the moon contains much __________.  A dogsledder in Vermont wonders why he and his fellow mushers direct their furry packs by shouting 'gee' for 'right' and 'haw' for 'left.'  If you ask a salesclerk for change in the form of a 'case quarter,' what are you asking for?  An upstate New York woman says her British husband makes fun of her for saying 'lookit!'  Does speaking a particular language make you feel certain emotions? The hosts talk about a blog post http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/a-language-of-smiles/ by evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson musing about whether this might be true.  A woman from Indianapolis is trying to convince her grandmother that it's okay for restaurant servers to refer to both male and female customers as you guys. Grandma says it's sexist. Our caller maintains it's fine, drawing an analogy with Spanish, where the masculine pronoun 'ellos' encompasses both sexes.  Why do we describe the sudden abandonment of someone as 'throwing him under the bus'?  A Dallas man says his grandmother used to carry around washcloth a plastic bag in her purse. When he and his siblings would get their hands dirty, she'd say to them, 'Show me your 'paddywackers,''' and they'd hold out their hands to be wiped clean. He wonders if she made up the word 'paddywhacker.'  Two more expressions that characterized 2009: 'El Stiffo' and 'drive like a Cullen.'  --  Get your language question answered on the air!
