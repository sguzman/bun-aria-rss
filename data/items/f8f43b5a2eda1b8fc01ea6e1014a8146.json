  "description": "<p>We first featured The Queen Mary all the way back on episode 13 in November of 2014. I had the opportunity to visit this magnificent ship recently (January 2019) and so on this episode, we revisit the history and hauntings and share our own experiences from visiting the ship. Construction on the liner began in 1930 under John Brown & Company and was named for King George V's wife Queen Mary. It would serve under various capacities over the decades and find its final home in Long Beach, California where it now serves as a hotel. Historical tours are offered as well as ghost tours and investigations. Join us as we board the Queen Mary and seek out her elusive spirits!
