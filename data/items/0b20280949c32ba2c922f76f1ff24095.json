  "description": "<p><p>ROUND 1: It feels like we can finally take a little bit of a deep breath about the situation in Iran and Iraq and we are gonna tell you why and where we go from here. </p><p>ROUND 2: Our social media guy Kyle asked you guys, “What is the most disgusting thing you witnessed a fellow service member do?” and my God… you nasty, nasty little worms… Your answers made us throw up in our mouths a little bit, but we can't wait to share them.</p><p>ROUND 3: There was geolocation Drrrr-RAMA after a Lance Corporal's cell phone gave away the position of his entire Marine unit during an op. Nobody wants to be that guy. </p><p>ROUND 4: It was good vibes all around when103-year-old WWII veteran, Peter Fantasia, finally received his combat medals a whopping 75 years after his heroic actions as a medic on the front lines of France. Peter Fantasia, that's music to our ears. (lololol)</p><p>ROUND 5: Courage is not the absence of fear but rather moving forward despite fear. Does the ZBT squad have the courage to take on a challenge the likes of which have never been seen?
