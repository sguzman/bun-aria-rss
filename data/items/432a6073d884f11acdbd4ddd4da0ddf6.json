  "description": "<p>Trust is crucial at a hybrid workplace. But it’s often hard to find between colleagues. According to the Citrix Work Balanced report, 8 in 10 employees say it’s important to have an employer they can trust. However, less than half the workforce says they actually trust their bosses. Meanwhile, a growing number of employers are turning to monitoring software to ensure productivity – often unaware or ignorant of the negative impacts of stealthy supervision tactics. (There are, of course, industries such as banking where monitoring workers’ online activity is necessary due to compliance issues.) This can lead to resentment and loss of morale among employees, and ultimately the decision to call it quits.</p><p>In this episode, we hear some anonymized accounts of workers who were told to come into the office because their employers wouldn’t trust them to be actually working from home or were asked to use employee monitoring software to ensure they were actually fulfilling their tasks. Later on, Curtin University research fellow Caroline Knight talks about outdated concepts such as \"presentee-ism\" that are hard to break, and why managers and employees need to learn how to trust each other and build empathy.
