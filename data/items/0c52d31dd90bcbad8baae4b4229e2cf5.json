In 2014, in an exclusive collaboration with Dwell Magazine, Joel launched the Axiom Series, a line of modern houses that combine sleek modern design with all the benefits of prefab construction. Now he lives in one! </p> <p><strong>Anthony Poon</strong> is an architect, concert pianist, artist, and author. He created new ways to build and promote Modernist home developments while maintaining design integrity and construction quality. His entertaining talk at Modernism Week was about architects in popular culture - TV and movies.  There are many more than you might think! </p> <p>Wrapping up, we talk with <strong>Jacques Caussin,</strong> associated with Modernism Week from the very beginning and this year’s speaker on how Modernism got started and made itself popular in the US.</p>",
