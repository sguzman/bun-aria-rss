  "description": "<p>We know we should be grateful for the gifts God has given us in motherhood. But instead, we may find ourselves battling discontentment, anxiety, and stress over our inability to keep up with even the simplest tasks. In this episode, Emily and Laura talk with author Hannah Anderson about her book <em>Humble Roots</em>. Hannah applies gospel-truth to challenging topics like postpartum body image, vocational or ministry calling, and dealing with the temptation to live for our ideal version of motherhood instead of God's plan for us. This conversation is candid, challenging, and leaves much to be considered as Hannah offers an opportunity for weary moms to rest by accepting their limitations and letting God be God.</p> <p>We’re grateful to <a href= \"https://shop.wellwateredwomen.com/\">Well-Watered Women,</a> creators of the <a href= \"https://shop.wellwateredwomen.com/collections/give-me-jesus-collection/products/give-me-jesus-journal-2?rfsn=2991137.db21fa\"> Give Me Jesus Journal</a>, for making this week’s show possible.
