  "description": "<p>Stance detection is typically framed as predicting the sentiment in a given\ntext towards a target entity. However, this setup overlooks the importance of\nthe source entity, i.e., who is expressing the opinion. In this paper, we\nemphasize the need for studying interactions among entities when inferring\nstances. We first introduce a new task, entity-to-entity (E2E) stance\ndetection, which primes models to identify entities in their canonical names\nand discern stances jointly. To support this study, we curate a new dataset\nwith 10,619 annotations labeled at the sentence-level from news articles of\ndifferent ideological leanings. We present a novel generative framework to\nallow the generation of canonical names for entities as well as stances among\nthem. We further enhance the model with a graph encoder to summarize entity\nactivities and external knowledge surrounding the entities. Experiments show\nthat our model outperforms strong comparisons by large margins. Further\nanalyses demonstrate the usefulness of E2E stance detection for understanding\nmedia quotation and stance landscape, as well as inferring entity ideology.\n</p>",
