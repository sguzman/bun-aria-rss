A company decided to have its employees walk on coals at a party. 12 ambulances were involved. \n\nRound 2: You all know we love science, but do we love science enough to start breathing out of our butts? Or into our butts. We’ll find out in round 2. \n\nRound 3: Tactical toilets: they are a thing and they are glorious.\n\nRound 4: China was supposed to do a joint training event with Russia. China backed out because Russia was trying to be too fetch and flashy.
