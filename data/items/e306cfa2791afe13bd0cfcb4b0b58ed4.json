  "description": "<p>Welcome back to another Zane and Heath: Unfiltered, where this week we are talking scams and scares. Insurance scams and pregnancy scares, that is! And the scares don’t stop there! We go into our most terrifying experiences with natural disasters. But what disaster went down at this theme park to make Heath never want to return!? You’ll have to tune in to find out! At least it’s not all bad though, right? Zane is reunited with a prized possession he has been missing. And when we find an old picture of Mariah in a gang LIVE ON AIR it recalls a hidden part of her past none of us saw coming! So prepare yourself for one roller coaster of an episode, and just try not to spill your coffee when we go around that first loopdy loop!</p>\n",
