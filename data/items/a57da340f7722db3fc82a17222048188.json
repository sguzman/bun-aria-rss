Heather watched nearly 1,500 episodes of William F. Buckley’s pioneering TV show Firing Line, and though she still doesn’t agree with Buckley, she admires how he created a place for high-minded argument. Then we will listen to some bonus content from Mike’s Thursday interview with David Priess, former CIA intelligence briefer and current Publisher of Lawfare about the work of the January 6th Committee.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist \nLearn more about your ad choices.
