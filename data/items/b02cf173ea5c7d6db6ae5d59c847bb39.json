  "description": "In Episode #226, I’m joined by Drs Ayesha and Dean Sherzai to examine how exercise impacts brain health. We focus on two main considerations: what we know about the relationship between exercise and cognition, and how we can explain this relationship from an evolutionary lens. We discuss how movement impacts cognition, engaging your brain while exercising, and aging and brain health. We also cover neurogenesis, brain trauma, exercise and mood disorders, and motivation versus discipline.\nDrs Dean and Ayesha Sherzai are no strangers to The Proof Podcast. As community favourites, we’ve previously covered topics focusing predominantly on the relationship between nutrition, neurodegenerative disease, aging, and other factors of brain health. In today’s episode, we step away from food to focus on the way exercise can impact our brain’s functioning and health.\nSpecifically, we discuss:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nDefining Exercise & Cognition (7:51)\n\nStudies on Exercise/ Brain Power (13:16)\n\nNormal vs Pathological Aging (16:34)\n\nAging: What’s Possible (22:30)\n\nEvolution of the Brain (27:31)\n\nCombining Thinking & Movement (42:23)\n\nImproving Brain Function (50:40)\n\nMild Cognitive Impairment (58:27)\n\nExercise for Brain Health (1:01:05)\n\nVO2 max & brain health (1:09:53)\n\nDanger of Exercise (1:12:36)\n\nCan you reverse pathology? (1:24:51)\n\nMood Disorders (1:29:00)\n\nMotivation vs Discipline (1:31:06)\n\nOutro (1:37:35)\n\n\nTo hear more from Drs Ayesha and Dean Sherzai, you can listen to their previous episodes #65, #78, #97, #117, #126, and #188.
