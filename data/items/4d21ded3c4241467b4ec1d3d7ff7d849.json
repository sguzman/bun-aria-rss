  "description": "<p>Globally women are leading the way when it comes to caring for biodiversity, water quality and quantity, soil health, and other aspects of consciously producing food for an ever-growing population. They are also producing 43% of the world’s food, despite lesser accessibility to own land, receive loans, and other essential components of farming. In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman talks with Danielle Nierenberg and Paul Hawken about the potential for women to fundamentally improve our broken global food system, and in doing so, significantly contribute to the reversal of global warming.</p><br><p>Danielle co-founded the non-profit Food Tank in 2013, an organization focused on building a global community for safe, healthy, nourished eaters. Prior to starting Food Tank, Danielle spent two years traveling to more than 60 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, meeting with farmers and farmers’ groups, scientists and researchers, policymakers and government leaders, students and academics, along with journalists, documenting what’s working to help alleviate hunger and poverty, while protecting the environment at the same time.</p><br><p>Paul Hawken is an environmentalist, entrepreneur, author, and activist who has dedicated his life to environmental sustainability and changing the relationship between business and the environment.
