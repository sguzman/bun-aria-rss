  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat discusses PMI potentially being at war with the USGA after his video featuring Patrick Reed snapping a wedge over his knee at the US Open was given a DMCA strike on Twitter by the USGA social media team. He pleads his case for why he did nothing wrong, why he feels like this was nothing more than a personal attack on him, and looks ahead at what some of the outcomes could potentially be. Pat also discusses his new sauna based workout that he's been getting into as of late and why he thinks he might be a permanent sauna workout guy now. The guys also chat about OJ Simpson and Bill Cosby both making questionable comebacks on Twitter this weekend, and the group wonders where things will go from here. Finally, Gorms gives all the details about Jim Irsay's 60th birthday party over the weekend including who some of the headlining acts were, what kind of food was served, what the overall atmosphere was like, and what some of the most memorable moments were including Gorman's gift to Mr. Irsay. Today's a good time, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
