  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrat Party hates America, they want to destroy our country as we know. They hate the country that has lifted up people of all backgrounds; Blacks, Hispanics, Whites, Asians can all prosper without asking for government handouts. Then, Joe Biden has been silent on the riots. That's the Democrats partys America and now they want to steal the election! The diabolical genius of Marxist socialism is that it provides the emotional and intellectual roadmap for autocrats to persuade millions of people to support their own enslavement to government. This is why we fight for liberty and individualism. Later, the rise of Anti-Semitism in the Black community is shocking. Jacob Blakes's father has made some loathsome, bigoted comments about Jews, yet Joe Biden met with him anyway. Can anyone name one positive thing that Biden has done for the Black community in his 5 decades in Washington? Afterward, Donald Trump Jr. calls in to discuss his new book, Liberal Privilege: Joe Biden And The Democrats' Defense Of The Indefensible. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
