  "description": "<div>Poppy O'Toole (known online as Poppy_Cooks) is a Michelin-trained chef who lost her job in March of 2020 due to Covid. To pass the time during lockdown she started posting cooking videos on TikTok. Her potato series made her a viral sensation, garnering millions of views. This success has led to her publishing her first cookbook, <em>Poppy Cooks: The Food You Need. </em>On the podcast Poppy talks to Lara and Olivia about learning from a very young age how to cook with her grandma, the pressures of cooking in a bank, and what is needed to make the perfect TikTok food video.</div>\n",
