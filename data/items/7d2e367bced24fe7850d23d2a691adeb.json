  "description": "<p>Wildfires are a disastrous phenomenon which cause damage to land, loss of\nproperty, air pollution, and even loss of human life. Due to the warmer and\ndrier conditions created by climate change, more severe and uncontrollable\nwildfires are expected to occur in the coming years. This could lead to a\nglobal wildfire crisis and have dire consequences on our planet. Hence, it has\nbecome imperative to use technology to help prevent the spread of wildfires.\nOne way to prevent the spread of wildfires before they become too large is to\nperform early detection i.e, detecting the smoke before the actual fire starts.\nIn this paper, we present our Wildfire Detection and Alert System which use\nmachine learning to detect wildfire smoke with a high degree of accuracy and\ncan send immediate alerts to users. Our technology is currently being used in\nthe USA to monitor data coming in from hundreds of cameras daily. We show that\nour system has a high true detection rate and a low false detection rate. Our\nperformance evaluation study also shows that on an average our system detects\nwildfire smoke faster than an actual person.\n</p>",
