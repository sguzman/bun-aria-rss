  "description": "Children are like plants, rocks, and flowers in this sense: they don't know how to be something that they are not. They haven't yet learned to lie, dissemble, pretend, or to seek to be someone they are not meant to be. We are all, right now, being created by God for God's purposes. Childlike joy returns to us the moment we put aside all our games of self-promotion and self-deception and live in accord with God's deepest desire for us.",
