  "description": "<div>In the 1990s, boy bands were king. Groups like N'SYNC and the Backstreet Boys were international sensations. But that wasn't the whole story. To tell the whole story, you have to talk about Lou Pearlman--the producer behind the pop explosion of the early 90s. Produced by Lance Bass, \"The Boy Band Con\" features interviews and never-before-told stories about how Pearlman conned the young artists--and countless others--out of hundreds of millions of dollars before becoming an international fugitive.Â <br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?
