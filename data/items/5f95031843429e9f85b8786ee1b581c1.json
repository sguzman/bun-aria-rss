  "description": "<p>I usually end my talks with a Q&A. It's a good way for me to level with the crowd and answer people's questions on a 1-to-1 basis. Truthfully, I'd rather do Q&As than keynotes because I believe there's so much more value there. Anyways, this is one of those events where I just didn't want to leave the stage. Great discussion. Great people .. And it doesn't hurt that they tried testing me on my baseball card knowledge and I absolutely CRUSHED that game ;) </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5002345.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
