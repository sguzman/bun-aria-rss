  "description": "We’re going on hiatus! But before we go…we spend a little time with our favorite TV couples from our quarantine binge rewatches… you know, the ones that make us blush or sigh or yearn. So shoutout to Leslie and Ben from Parks & Rec, the original nerdy love match as well as Ruby and Stan from Good Girls, the couple that makes major sacrifices for their family. And from New Girl, a twofer: Nick & Jess, of course, but also Schmidt and Cece, whose love affair was perfectly breadcrumbed across seasons.\nSlate Plus members get a bonus segment on Thirst Aid Kit each week. Sign up now to listen and support our show.\nIn this week’s Slate Plus, it’s the TRIUMPHANT return of dear friend of the show, Gena-mour Barrett (@smilegena). She’s filthy and hilarious and so we brought her back to talk a little more about the animated characters she thinks are hot: Thanos (WHY, GENA!), and Guy, the “dark-skinned bison” from BoJack Horseman. Plus, we give her a new toon-boo to lust after too.\nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit. Our music is by Tanya Morgan.
