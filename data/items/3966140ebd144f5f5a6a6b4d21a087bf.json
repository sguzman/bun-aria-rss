  "description": "<p>Every once in a while a really cool tool comes along and I like to show everyone the fun I had with it.  In this video episode I show how I easily made an interactive image of a neuron and an interactive map containing videos and locations for some of the major studies in psychology.  Do you know where, for example, \"Bobo doll\" study was done?  How about the spot where \"Marion Keech\" received her message from the alien race called the \"Clarion\" which revealed the inner workings of cognitive dissonance? Find out how to make your own fun and easy interactive image in this episode of The Psych Files.</p>",
