  "description": "<p>Brooklyn Nets General Manager Sean Marks joins Scott Soshnick and Eben Novy-Williams to discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the team's qualifying for the National Basketball Association playoffs for the first time since 2015. Marks, who previously worked for the San Antonio Spurs, also talks about the influence his former bosses -- Gregg Popovich and R.C. Buford -- had on his career as a player and executive. Marks also discusses how a sports executive goes about changing the culture of a franchise, a makeover that in Brooklyn's case included not only attitudes but physical space, too. Marks also touches on the roles of his billionaire owners, Mikhail Prokhorov and Joe Tsai, and why a free agent should pick the Nets over the New York Knicks.  </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick and Eben Novy-Williams</p><p>Producer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
