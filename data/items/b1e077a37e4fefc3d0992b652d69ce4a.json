The Church Fathers did not separate Scripture and spirituality but saw the form of the spiritual life within the Scripture. As the key of the Scriptures, Christ is the key to the spiritual life. This course delves into the riches of how the Church reads Scripture, greatly inspired by the writings of Origen and St. Augustine.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Get the rest of the lessons by joining the Word on Fire Institute at <strong><a href=\"https://wordonfire.institute\" target= \"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer noopener\">https://wordonfire.institute</a></strong>.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:separator --></p> <hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> <p><!-- /wp:separator --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do you like this podcast? <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/bishopbarron\">Become a patron</a> and get some great perks for helping, like free books, bonus content, and more.
