  "description": "<p>If you’ve never talked about your sex life with your partner before, there’s a good chance they’ll push back. Why? Because most of us go into fight or flight mode when talking about sex: it’s not normalized in our culture, we get defensive, we feel like we’re being criticized. But never fear – you can create a culture of sex communication in your relationship, one talk at a time. Be the change, is what I’m saying.</p><br><p>On today’s hotline show, I take your calls about having a sex talk. Like: telling your wife you want her to massage your prostate. Or telling a partner you want your vanilla sex to be a little spicier. How to relax into oral and give your partner tips to make you scream, and how to tell your partner: “you know what? I need to be seduced a little before we jump into penetration.” If we can talk about sex like we talk about dinner, everyone wins! So take a listen to this episode, and see if your next sex talk isn’t a little bit easier.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/5-benefits-of-living-a-radically-embodied-life/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Embodied is The New Sexy: 5 Benefits of Living a Radically Embodied Life&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/a-oral-sex-for-vulvas/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A+ Oral Sex for Vulvas</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/everybody-loves-oral/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Everybody Loves Oral</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/enjoying-oral-sex/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ask Emily: How Do I Better Enjoy Oral Sex?&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/oral-kivin-method/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mind-Blowing Oral Sex in Under 5 Minutes: The Kivin Method</a></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
