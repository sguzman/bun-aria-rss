We are more isolated, divided, and sick than ever before. Personally, I always turn to nature when I’m feeling lost.

Wade Davis is a writer, photographer, and filmmaker. Explorer-in-Residence at the National Geographic Society from 2000 to 2013, he is currently Professor of Anthropology and the BC Leadership Chair in Cultures and Ecosystems at Risk at the University of British Columbia. He is the author of 23 books, including <em>One River, The Wayfinders</em>, and<em> Into the Silence</em>, and he was the winner of the 2012 Samuel Johnson prize, the top nonfiction prize in the English language.
