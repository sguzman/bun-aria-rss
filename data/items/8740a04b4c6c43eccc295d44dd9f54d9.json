  "itunes:summary": "Investigating listening practices and extractive industries in Australia, Quandamooka artist Megan Cope’s ‘Untitled (Death Song)’ comprises of sound sculptures constructed from discarded mining and industrial equipment accompanied by a soundtrack made in collaboration with musician and instrument builder Isha Ram Das. It takes its first note from the haunting cries of the yellow-eyed Bush Stone-curlew, an endangered species within New South Wales known for its distinctive call, a ghost-like “weer-lo” sound.\n\nhttps://disclaimer.org.au/contents/unsettling-scores/untitled-death-song\n\nImage: Saul Steed\n\nTranscript: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HzFchHyYk-QGFaFpOYVCFCyskKMSPb8wY_wqUuF-WC8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
