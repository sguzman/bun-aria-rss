  "description": "On this episode of the New Books Network, Dr. Lee Pierce (s/t) interviews editors Donovan Conley and Justin Eckstein about their new book Cookery: Food Rhetorics and Social Production (University of Alabama Press, 2020), which explores the rhetoric of contemporary food production and consumption with a focus on social boundaries.\nCookery explores how food mediates both rhetorical influence and material life through the overlapping concepts of invention and production. The essays in this volume probe the many ways that food informs contemporary social life through its mediation of bodies—human and extra-human alike.\nEach chapter explores food’s persuasive nature through a unique prism that includes intoxication, dirt, “food porn,” strange foods, and political “invisibility.” Each case offers new insights about the relations between rhetorical influence and embodied practice through food.\nAs a whole, Cookery articulates new ways of viewing food’s powers of persuasion, as well as the inherent role of persuasion in agricultural production\nDonovan Conley is Berman Chair in Language and Thought and associate professor of communication studies at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\nJustin Eckstein is assistant professor and director of forensics in the communication department at Pacific Lutheran University.\nWe hope you enjoyed listening as much as we enjoyed chatting about this fascinating book.
