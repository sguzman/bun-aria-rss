  "description": "I don’t ordinarily find myself scrambling to write down article ideas during these conversations, but almost everything Raj Chetty says is worth a feature unto itself. For instance:\n- Great Kindergarten teachers generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in future earnings for their students\n- Solving poverty would increase life expectancy by more — far more — than curing cancer\n- Public investment focused on children often pays for itself\n- The American dream is more alive in Canada than in America\n- Maps of American slavery look eerily like maps of American social mobility — but not for the reason you’d think\nChetty is a Harvard economist who has been called “the most influential economist alive today.” He’s considered by his peers to be a shoo-in for the Nobel prize. He specializes in bringing massive amounts of data to bear on the question of social mobility: which communities have it, how they got it, and what we can learn from them.\nWhat Chetty says in this conversation could power a decade of American social policy. It probably should.\nReferences: \nAtlantic profile \nVox profile \nBooks: \nScarcity:The New Science of Having Less and How It Defines Our Lives by Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir\nEvicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City by Matt Desmond \nHow to Catch a Heffalump\nWant to contact the show?
