  "description": "<p>From pearl clutching \"think of the children\" to terfdom to the reign of momfluencers, we've decided to get sentimental about the nuclear family again. This can be seen as heavily on the left (\"social reproduction,\" my god) as on the right. Cameron Steele, writer and editor and mother, and Jessa, barely any of these, discuss the way we have decided to stop thinking about families and create halos around motherhood.</p> <p>Support this podcast: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/publicintellectual\">http://patreon.com/publicintellectual</a></p> <p>http://jessacrispin.com</p>",
