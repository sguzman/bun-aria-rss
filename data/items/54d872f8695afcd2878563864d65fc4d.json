  "description": "<p>This week we are joined by legendary actor and comedian Matt Walsh, who you may know from his work with Upright Citizens Brigade, his role as Mike McLintock on \"Veep\" or a million other hilarious appearances. Together we discuss the career trajectory of Steven Seagal from actor to cop to guy who gets mocked in Brian Cox's memoir, the time Jonah and his friends threw a block of ice on his car engine, and Matt's experiences using a sock as a gas cap. Vanessa also gives her thoughts on the return of thin eyebrow and together we debate the merits of artificial grape flavoring and our hopes for the \"Quantum Leap\" reboot. Whether you want to learn about Walsh's cameo \"The Conners\" or hear three people who've never lived in condos discuss the pros and cons of Homeowner's Associations, you'll find something to laugh about on this hilarious episode of the podcast.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
