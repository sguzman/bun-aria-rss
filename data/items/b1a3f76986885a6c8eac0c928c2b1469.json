    "media:description": "Japan has long struggled with corrupt ties between its politicians and businesses. It is said that they experience one such major scandal every ten years - every time leading to calls for reform. \n\nAt the end of the 1980s, Japan experienced one of their most serious such scandals - the Recruit Scandal. \n\nIt touched all of Japanâ€™s political, economic, and social elites. Its widespread nature signaled a deeply corrupt system - going all the way up to the Prime Minister himself. \n\nLinks:\n- The Asianometry Newsletter: https://asianometry.substack.com\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Asianometry\n- The Podcast: https://anchor.fm/asianometry\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/asianometry",
