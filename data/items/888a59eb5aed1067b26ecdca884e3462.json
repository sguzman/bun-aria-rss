  "description": "DoorDash on Monday began offering 10- to-15-minute deliveries in the New York City neighborhood of Chelsea and if this works out they plan to put the hammer down to compete with some of the services like GoPuff and other younger upstarts that are starting to put some pressure on the top dog in delivery.<br /><br />Jack in the Box has entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Del Taco for $575 million, or $12.51 per share in cash, the companies announced Monday. This I think was a perfect acquisition for JIB with similar but not identical markets. The biggest issue we see is the potential to grow a demographic - Our Foodable Labs data revealed that Del Taco has a crossover rate of 23.8% of Jack in the Box customers one of the lower crossover demos in fast food!<br /><br />McDonald's is pulling a celeb play with Mariah Carey with 12 days of deals, plus fans have even more reasons to celebrate the Mariah Menu with free, limited-edition merch and a holiday-themed TV commercial.<br /><br />NFT's for restaurants may be closer than you think! - Make sure to listen to the full podcast to get the inside on how Blockchain and NFT's may be the next gold rush in restaurant technology - similar to the era of social media adoption by restaurants in 2007!",
