  "description": "There will always be something trying to get us to pull up our anchor of hope—bad breaks, delays, disappointments. In these tough times, when life doesn’t make sense, when your prayers haven’t been answered as quickly as you’d like, it’s easy to throw in the towel and give up, but you have to make sure to keep your anchor down and  hope in the Lord.Let Joel show you how to have hope during all things in this empowering message.  When you’re anchored to hope, God will make things happen that you could never make happen on your own. When you have your hope in Him, the scripture says you’ll never be disappointed. You may have some temporary setbacks, but when it’s all said and done, you’ll come out better than you were before if you don’t give up your hope!<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
