  "description": "<p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Does all of the time, effort, and heart we put into motherhood really make a difference? When we make meals that end up on the floor, wash load after load of laundry, and discipline our children for the same behaviors day after day, it’s easy to wonder if motherhood makes an eternal impact. In this episode, Emily and Laura talk with Elyse Fitzpatrick and Eric Schumacher (authors of <em>Worthy: Celebrating the Value of Women</em>) about how moms matter in the redemptive story of the Bible. They help us see how God used the ordinary faithfulness of moms in scripture to lead to the birth of Jesus, and they encourage us that God is still working through moms just like us to carry out his plan of redemption in the lives of our children and beyond.</p> <p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">We’re grateful to Harvest House for making this week’s show possible.
