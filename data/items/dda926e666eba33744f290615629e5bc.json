  "description": "Forecasting is concerned with making predictions about future observations by relying on past measurements. In this article, I will give an introduction how ARMA, ARIMA (Box-Jenkins), SARIMA, and ARIMAX models can be used for forecasting given time-series data.\nPreliminaries Before we can talk about models for time-series data, we have to introduce two concepts.\nThe backshift operator Given the time series \\(y = \\{y_1, y_2, \\ldots \\}\\), the backshift operator (also called lag operator) is defined as"
