  "description": "Embracing a multi-perspectival authorial voice, Managing Madness: Weyburn Mental Hospital and the Transformation of Psychiatric Care in Canada (University of Manitoba Press, 2017), tells the story of the “last and largest” asylum in the British Commonwealth. From its founding in the 1920s until the age of deinstitutionalization, Weyburn Mental Hospital was central to the changing landscape of psychiatric care in Canada and beyond. Using a wide variety of documentary sources, Erika Dyck and Alex Deighton explore Weyburn’s rise and fall, from its role in Canada’s nation-building project to new experiments with LSD and the move towards community care. They also give voice to the often forgotten experience of patients, psychiatric nurses, and mental health activists.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
