It can be incredibly hard spending time alone with your inner self, but it’s always rewarding. That’s what today’s conversation with my good friend Colin O’Brady is all about. Colin is a ten-time world record breaking explorer, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, entrepreneur, speaker, and expert on mindset.</p><br><p>He is focused on sharing his hard-won wisdom to encourage others to step outside of their comfort zone and unlock their best lives. Colin’s highly publicized expeditions have been seen by millions and his work has been featured by <em>The New York Times, The Tonight Show, BBC, Forbes, </em>and<em> Today. </em>His world-renowned feats include the world’s first solo, unsupported, and fully human-powered crossing of Antarctica, speed records for the Explorers Grand Slam and the Seven Summits, as well as the first human-powered row across Drake Passage.
