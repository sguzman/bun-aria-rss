Second listens brought new insights—and more reminders that these evergreen exchanges continue to both inspire and inform.</p><p>For long-time listeners, approach this episode as a refresher to launch you into 2022 with renewed vigor. For those new to the podcast, my hope is this anthology will stir you to peruse the back catalog and explore episodes you may have missed.</p><p>Guests featured in this first of two total anthology episodes (hyperlinked to their respective episodes) are listed here: <a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/the-best-of-2021-part-ii-651\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Rich Roll Podcast: Best Of 2021: Part Two</a></p><p>Compiling this auditory yearbook is both a joy and a challenge.
