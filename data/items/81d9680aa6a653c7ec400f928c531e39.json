  "description": "\n<p>Deep learning, despite its remarkable successes, is a young field – perhaps ten years old. While models called artificial neural networks have been studied for decades, much of that work seems only tenuously connected to modern results.</p>\n\n<p>It’s often the case that young fields start in a very ad-hoc manner. Later, the mature field is understood very differently than it was understood by its early practitioners. It seems quite likely that deep learning is in this ad-hoc state...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/\">Read more.</a></p>\n",
