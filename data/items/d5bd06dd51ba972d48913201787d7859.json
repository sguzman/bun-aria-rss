  "description": "<p>Investigating the investigators today! Talking about the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit. Looking into how a small group of special agents introduced the term \"serial killer\" into our lexicon, and then studied infamous serial killers like Ed Kemper, Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer and others to try and understand the minds of some of the sickest, most dangerous members of society, in an attempt to keep the body counts of future serial killers as low as possible by predicting where and how and who they'd try and kill next. Also looking into how the FBI itself involved over the year into a massive federal law enforcement agency that created not only the BSU but multiple other crime-fighting units. There's a lot of info and hopefully, a lot of laughs coming your way, today, on Timesuck.  <br /><br /><strong>Donating $6600 to the YWCA's Idaho County Fund!</strong> <br /><br />My childhood friend and former classmate Kristy Dewitt-Beckstead has been a YWCA advocate for the past nine years. She helps victims of domestic violence, who are almost always women who have been isolated in the extremely rural area I grew up, where they feel trapped by abusive partners.
