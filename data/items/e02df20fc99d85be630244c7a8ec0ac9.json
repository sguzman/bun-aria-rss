But the families of three young girls from the Swansea area, killed 30 years before, needed to be told for certain if this was the man who killed their daughters.<br>\n<br>\nThis two-part episode of the UK True Crime looks at the terrible murders of Geraldine Hughes, Pauline Floyd and Sandra Newton in 1973 and the efforts made to bring their killer to justice.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Reference</strong><br>\nFor this episode, I am indebted to the following article by Kevin Toolis in The Guardian newspaper:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/18/wales.kevintoolis\">https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/18/wales.kevintoolis</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Links</strong>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.uktruecrime.com/\">https://www.uktruecrime.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/UKTrueCrime\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/UKTrueCrime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/UKTrueCrime\">https://www.patreon.com/UKTrueCrime</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
