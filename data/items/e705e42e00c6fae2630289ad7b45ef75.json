  "description": "<p>The price of college has gotten so incredibly expensive that we’re wondering if college is even worth it anymore. With the current total outstanding student loan debt totaling over $1.6 trillion, the return on your investment isn’t as obvious as it was decades ago. Now is the time to ask: Is getting a degree from a traditional academic institution the best course going forward? The answer isn’t going to be the same for everyone, but we’ll touch on the important things to consider before you decide to go back to school or as you have that conversation with your high schooler as they weigh college options.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Mexican Lager by St. Archer- a big thanks to our friends at St. Archer for donating the beers to the show this week!
