  "description": "<p>Comedian, actor, producer Seth Rogen is not going to sugarcoat things for you, so when he and Tig meet for the first time over Zoom, he delivers his unfiltered two cents on issues like what to say if your mother asks you for sex advice and what to do about old material that just isn't funny anymore. They also talk about their favorite comedic role models and ideas for how to tell that someone special you've been \"around the block\" with other guys before.  <br><br><strong>OUR SPONSORS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Betterhelp</strong> - <a href=\"http://betterhelp.com/tig\">betterhelp.com/tig</a> </p>\n<p>Need advice?
