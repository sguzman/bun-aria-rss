  "description": "<p>Penn State University is a part of the Big Ten East and has 24 campuses across the state of Pennsylvania. Not bad for a school that had small beginnings and only 64 undergraduate students. Penn State was one of the first land grant universities in America and was founded as an agricultural school. The main campus is situated in the Nittany Valley between Nittany Mountain and Muncy Mountain. The university sits on a limestone shelf, which lends itself to capturing energy and it is said that this may be one of the most haunted universities in America. Matt Swayne, author of America's Haunted Universities, joins us to share stories of spirits that continue here in the afterlife. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Penn State! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Kelly Helter and features Lord Tod Wadley and This Month in History features Nazi General Rudolf Freiherr von Gersdorff's attempt to assassinate Hitler.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/03/hgb-ep-192-penn-state-university.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/03/hgb-ep-192-penn-state-university.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:<br /> <br /> Vanishing from http://purple-planet.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (Outro)<br /> <br /> Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>",
