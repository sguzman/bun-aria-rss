  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys chat about last night's thrilling National Championship game that saw Kansas mount a historic comeback to beat North Carolina 72-69, Tiger Woods' Masters press conference where he stated that he's feeling like he's going to be able to play in the Masters this week, how we knew Tiger would be back all along, some of the major news stories that have come out of the NFL over the last few days including whether or not Gronk is going to go back to Tampa Bay next year, the reported money of Bobby Wagner's new contract, and they announce a massive giveaway at the end of the show. Joining the progrum is 9 year NFL vet at Defensive Back, Everything DB, host of the Man-To-Man podcast, friend of the show, Darius Butler. Pat and Darius chat about Bobby Wagner's contract and why agents want those inflated numbers to keep being reported, why guys like Stephon Gilmore and the Honey Badger haven't been signed yet, if he likes Sauce Gardner saying he's the best player in the draft and if that puts a target on his back, what current WR who might be available for a trade he would want, and more (24:13-49:06). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show and listen on Sirius XM Channel 82, Mad Dog Radio.
