  "description": "In this week’s installment of Best Of The Gist, and with the tragic news of the mass shooting in Buffalo still echoing through the daily news, we listen back to Mike’s March 7, 2018 interview with the president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, Richard Aborn on why gun control has worked for NYC. Then, in Mike’s Spiel from this past Monday (May 16, 2022), he acknowledges the complexity of the problem of mass shootings, but floats the idea that guns and tactical gear are the part of the problem we can do something about now.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist\nLearn more about your ad choices.
