  "description": "<p>Learning to Respond, Not React - When stressed, we often react with looping fear-thoughts, feelings and behaviors that cause harm to ourselves and/or others. This talk offers three interrelated strategies that can serve us when we’re triggered by stress, and help us find our way back to our natural wisdom, empathy and wholeness of being. By de-conditioning habitual reactivity, we are increasingly able to respond to our life circumstances in ways that serve healing and awakening.</p> <p>Please enjoy this remastered audio version of one of Tara's most popular talks, originally published on 09/02/2015.</p>",
