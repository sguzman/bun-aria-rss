  "description": "<p>Anthony and Gregg discuss the Steelers loss to the Browns in the Playoffs and how Anthony put the loss into perspective. Gregg is really into Koalas all of a sudden and Anthony talks about not being able to travel to Thailand. A guy got too drunk and changed his name to Celine Dion, Armie Hammer is 100% a cannibal and a girl is robbed at gunpoint&nbsp;for a dog. It's not creepy to have a sex doll, but it's very creepy to break it.&nbsp;</p>",
