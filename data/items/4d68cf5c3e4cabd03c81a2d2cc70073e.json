  "description": "<p>My HoneyDew this week is YMH producer, Enny! Enny is mixed and was raised by his white mom. He grew up extremely sheltered but his dad would take him now and then to the night club he owned, the legendary Dublins, where Enny would buy drinks for the ladies and rub elbows with the stars - when he was 8! It was two totally different worlds. Enny’s dad gave him some parting advice and has never spoken to him again. Enny also shares a story about getting catfished by a girl he lost his virginity to and the trauma that came along with it. This was such a great episode!
