We do our best not to overanalyze the people who go out of their way to write today's reviews, mainly because we ourselves don't seem to know the difference between a large candle and a Disney villain. So throw on your Easter best, return any and all hamsters, and enjoy another exploration of awful reviews and the people who write them.</p>\n<p>Buy our merch! <a href=\"https://store.dftba.com/collections/beach-too-sandy-water-too-wet\">https://store.dftba.com/collections/beach-too-sandy-water-too-wet</a></p>\n<p>Logo by Courtney Aventura.
