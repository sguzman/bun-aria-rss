    "media:description": "In this Lambda World 2019 presentation, Tianyu Pu provides an introduction to ReasonML, and explains the benefits of using it.\n\nPresentation Description:\n\nJavaScript is a critical part of today's programming landscape, and not just for web applications. However, its lack of static typing has given lots of developers grief over the years as they struggled with cryptic runtime error messages such as 'cannot find property X of undefined' (I've been there, too). With the introduction of ReasonML, we're now able to write statically typed, simpler and faster JavaScript. In this talk, we'll cover what ReasonML is, what it isn't, why it's worth paying attention to, how it works, and how it can be used in your applications.\n\n------\nFollow: \n-https://www.twitter.com/lambda_world \n-https://www.twitter.com/47deg\n-https://twitter.com/tianyupu\n\nVisit: \n-https://www.47deg.com/events for more details\n-http://www.lambda.world",
