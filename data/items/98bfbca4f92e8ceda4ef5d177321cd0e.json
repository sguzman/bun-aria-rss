  "description": "On this season of Working, we visit the city of Baltimore, to talk to people about their jobs there. We're hoping to learn about how the city informs their work, and how they are shaping Baltimore itself, by working.\nJordan Smith is a captain of the Pride of Baltimore II, a recreation of a 19th century Baltimore Clipper. He tells us about the ship's history, his duties as captain, and how the crew supports each other to keep the ship in top shape. He also took us on a tour of the Pride and showed us how he uses both modern and traditional equipment to sail, race, and educate. \nIn a Slate Plus Extra, Smith tells us about racing the Pride, and the combination of strategy and proficiency that goes into winning a sailing race.
