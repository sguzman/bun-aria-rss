  "description": "<p>Today our focus is on what politicians say – and on processes for analysing what politicians say. Politicians’ speech is, of course, a fundamental part of politics. We can think of it as a product of – and therefore a window into – deeper political forces. And in itself it also helps to <i>constitute</i> the political realm and how we think of all the parts of that realm. </p><p>Analysis of what politicians say – and, indeed, of what others say, but we’re focusing today on politicians – is a tool that many political scientists use to explore a whole range of different aspects of politics. Many approaches are used in doing so. And these include increasingly sophisticated techniques for analysing vast bodies of speech systematically. </p><p>We’re showcasing the work of some of our PhD students here on the podcast at the moment and this week our host <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/about-us/people/professor-alan-renwick\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Professor Alan Renwick</strong></a> welcomes <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science/people/mphil-phd-students/lotte-hargrave\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Lotte Hargrave</strong></a>, who is looking at whether female and male MPs speak differently from each other and and <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science/markus-kollberg\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Markus Kollberg</strong></a>, who is examining how parliamentarians use populist rhetoric.</p>\n",
