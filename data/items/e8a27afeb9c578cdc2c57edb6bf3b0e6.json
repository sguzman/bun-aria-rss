  "description": "Mia explains to Clarrie how Brad asked her out, and now he’s shutting her down and won’t talk. She blames George. Clarrie reckons kids like George can be full of themselves but might be hiding insecurities. She takes Mia to the Stables to distract her. Mia’s not keen, but Alice shows her how well treated the horses are, and how good they are to be around. Afterwards Clarrie thanks Alice – she doesn’t know what she said to Mia but it’s really cheered her up. Alice comments Mia’s a nice kid: bright, interested and highly principled. Alice takes the opportunity to apologise to Clarrie for her behaviour at Nic’s funeral. Clarrie concedes this is hard for Alice to say, and thanks her for her effort. It means a lot that’s she’s tried.\nAlistair thinks Paul’s withholding of his identity as Denise’s son was deliberate, to get one over on them. Jakob disagrees; maybe it was so that he could be judged on his own merits. Later Paul does well with a sick dog, and Alistair relents. He apologises for being overly formal, and the two seem to reach concord. But then Paul returns to quipping, and Alistair complains to Jakob that he doesn’t like the way Paul conducts himself. Jakob suggests Alistair seeks a replacement.\nPrior to the meeting about the church window, Alan makes clear to Natasha that it’s precisely that – the church’s window. He won’t be supporting any application for a redesign. He doesn’t agree with the plans and means to do anything he can to stop them.",
