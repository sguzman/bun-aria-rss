  "description": "<p><strong>Introducing the Band:</strong><br />Your hosts Scot Bertram (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScotBertram\" target=\"_blank\">@ScotBertram</a>) and Jeff Blehar (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EsotericCD\" target=\"_blank\">@EsotericCD</a>) are joined by guest Steve Miller. Steve is a veteran journalist and a reporter at <a href=\"https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RealClearInvestigations</a>. He's also the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Detroit-Rock-City-Uncensored-Americas/dp/B00P2PEVLW\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Detroit Rock City: The Uncensored History of Rock 'n' Roll in America's Loudest City</i></a><i>.</i><br /> </p><p><strong>Steve's Music Pick: </strong>Mott The Hoople<br />Do you remember the Saturday gigs? We do, we do! Mott The Hoople are known outside of specialist rock audiences these days either as \"one of those weird bands from That Weird Era with one of those memorably weird names\" or as a putative 'one-hit wonder' performing a song most people associate with David Bowie. </p><p>So that's where you're wrong, kiddo. </p><p>Mott The Hoople was a band that managed to set Britain (and particularly London) afire during the early Seventies, even as they consistently eluded chart success. They were brought together by famed rock & roll madman/record-jobber/A&R man/heavy drinker Guy Stevens, who realized his dream of creating a band that sounded like both The Rolling Stones AND Bob Dylan simultaneously by pairing a chubby Dylanesque vocalist/pianist (Ian Hunter, hiding his insecurity behind enormous shades) with a workaday gigging band that hailed from within spitting distance of the Welsh border (the Doc Thomas Group, with Mick Ralphs).  </p><p>From that fusion came Mott The Hoople, and their 1969 self-titled debut album. The pure rock & roll energy -- gruff, with zero pretensions, utterly <i>available</i> to the fans and the audience, yet strangely literate and aspirational as well -- was there from day one. The only question was whether Mott could ever properly harness it in the studio. The gang argues that they actually did quite a good job during their pre-Bowie years (especially on <i>Brain Capers</i>, an album of such loopily memorable hard-rock ferocity that it must be heard to be believed), but the record-buying public certainly didn't agree.</p><p>Which is where David Bowie stepped in, rushing to save the band after they'd announced their own dissolution in the UK music press. His song \"All The Young Dudes\" became their most famous number, and yet on this episode everyone is at pains to argue that neither the song nor its namesake album are the real highlight of Mott's career. So let us explain to you how a band you've more or less never heard of recorded one of the greatest albums of the entire decade <i>after</i> their involvement with David Bowie as we sing you the ballad of Mott The Hoople. And if it seems we've lost just a little bit on the journey, then please treat us kindly. </p>\n",
