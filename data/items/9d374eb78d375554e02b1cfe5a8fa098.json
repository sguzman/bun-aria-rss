The peoples of Eurasia are now welded into an enormous network of competing, innovative, and \"globalised\" states and societies ranging from England in the West to Japan in the East. And as the Sultanate of Delhi unravels and collapses after its Deccan misadventures, two empires rise south of the Narmada river: the Bahmani Sultanate, the first Sultanate ever seen in the Deccan, and the famous empire of Vijayanagara, City of Victory, one of the most remarkable of all Indian states.
