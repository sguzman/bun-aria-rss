  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, WREC Radio Host Ben Ferguson fills in for Mark. Prosecutors withheld exculpatory video evidence in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, acting as if he was presumed guilty until he could prove his innocence. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time will never eliminate one's right to protect their life after being chased and attacked. The biased media and prosecutors can't help but infuse politics into everything as they ignore the truth and slander Rittenhouse. The prosecution smeared Rittenhouse for exercising his right to remain silent. The gun charge was dropped because he was over-charged, yet the media claims he was a vigilante. Don Lemon says that although the Judge was following the law, he didn't quite like how he said things. Later, Congress discovered that the FBI created a threat-tag for 'threats' to school board meetings. Liberal media started targeting conservative opposition back in the Obama administration, and now targeting parents seems to be the priority for the Attorney General and the left within the DOJ. Afterward, the mob dictates who gets held to account and who doesn't. Aaron Rodgers is getting trashed for not receiving a Covid vaccine, while other athletes that have committed actual crimes like domestic violence get far less scrutiny. The double standard of the Covid mob is sickening.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
