Pete's co-writer and director for all the videos he's ever made (College Humor's Badman, Doctor, etc) and field producer for The Daily Show Oren Brimer is the first guest! Followed by the hilarious Kurt Metzger (Ugly Americans, Comedy Central), Hari Kondabolu (Conan! Comedy Central), Gabe Liedman (writer for upcoming Amy Schumer show, comedy duo Gabe and Jenny), and Yannis Pappas (Comedy Central, Best Week Ever) rounding out the panel with Chelsea Peretti there to ruin the show. Enjoy, weirdos!",
