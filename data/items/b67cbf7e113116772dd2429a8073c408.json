  "description": "<p>Most folks are paying more than twice as much as they need to for cell phone service! The biggest reason for that is because they haven't shopped around- they're blindly paying the overpriced plans from 5 years ago. The average monthly cell phone bill is $73 and by the end of this episode, you’ll know how to get that down drastically- closer to the $25 per month mark which is the new golden standard. Plus, you’ll be able to do that without having to be on a massive friends and family plan like we are (seriously, it’s like we’re playing a game of sardines!).</p><p>And during this episode we enjoyed a Zarza Marrón by Casa Agria Specialty Ales which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. A big thanks to our friend Josh for trekking this beer all the way to Atlanta.
