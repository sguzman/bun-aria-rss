  "description": "<p>March 25, 1965. The US is bombing North Vietnam. On the University of Michigan’s campus, students and professors are gathered for a first-of-its kind protest event. They’re holding a “teach-in,” staying up all night to discuss what’s going on in Vietnam. How did the classroom become a powerful tool for protest? And what impact did this “teach-in” have in shaping the antiwar movement on college campuses—and around the world?</p><br><p>Special thanks to our guests: Zelda Gamson, Alan Haber, Susan Harding, Richard Mann, Stan Nadel, Gayl Ness, Jack Rothman, Howard Wachtel, and Michael Zweig. Thanks also to Ellen Schrecker, author of <em>The Lost Promise: American Universities in the 1960s</em>, and to Greg Kinney at the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
