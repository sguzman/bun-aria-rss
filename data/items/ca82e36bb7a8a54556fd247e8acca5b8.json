  "description": "<p>It seems, every time I sit down with my friend, illustrator, fine artist, and author Lisa Congdon, she’s in a moment of transformation. Truth is, it’s a bit of a perpetual state for her. Lisa is best known for her colorful, graphic drawings and hand lettering. Her work appears in private collections, merchandise, textiles, apparel, and a wide array of collaborations with clients around the world including Method, Target, Comme des Garçons, Crate and Barrel, Facebook, MoMA, REI, and Harvard University among many others. She is the author of nine books, including <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gTeNLt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Art Inc: The Essential Guide to Building Your Career as an Artist</em></a>; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qxhZjd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Find Your Artistic Voice: The Essential Guide to Working Your Creative Magic</em></a>; and her latest book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2T9uDbM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>You Will Leave a Trail of Stars: Inspiration for Blazing Your Own Path.&nbsp;</em></a></p><p>Lisa teaches in the Applied Craft & Design MFA program at Pacific Northwest College of Art. She lives and works in Portland, Oregon, and is also a devout cyclist, having just finished an intense ride to Crater lake and, as we talked, was getting ready to complete the Gravel Grinder race, where she would climb more than 30,000 feet in elevation on her bike, on gravel.
