  "description": "<p>You may know Andy Richter as the longtime sidekick for Conan O'Brien, but he's also a very accomplished actor, writer, comedian and podcaster. Andy came by HDWGW this week to discuss the difficulties of fish taxidermy, his Chicago comedy roots and some of his favorite Late Night With Conan O'Brien musical acts ranging from The Breeders to Tony Bennett. We also recall fond memories of hanging out at our local shopping malls in the 80s and 90s and our favorite food court picks. Along the way, Vanessa laments the demise of the Original Cookie Company and Jonah talks about buying a Body Count CD at Record Town thanks to their lax parental advisory policy. Finally, we have an impassioned round of change.org where we debate whether our collective energy should be directed toward the return of PB&J Oatmeal Cream Pies, accountability for the Lethal Weapon TV series or the availability Twinkies in a high school cafeteria. How could you not want to listen to this episode?&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
