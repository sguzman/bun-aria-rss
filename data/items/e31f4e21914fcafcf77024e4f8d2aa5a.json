  "description": "Contributor(s): Dr Stephen Roberts, Dr Leeza Osipenko, Professor Barbara Prainsack, Dr James Somauroo | With more and more information about us available electronically and online, this episode of LSE IQ asks, ‘Is big data good for our health?’\nAdvances in bio-medical technologies, along with electronic health records and the information we generate through our mobile phones, Smart Watches or Fit bits, our social media posts and search engine queries, mean that there is a torrent of information about our bodies, our health and our diseases out there.\nAlongside this, the tremendous growth in computing power and data storage means that this ‘Big Data’ can be stored and aggregated and then analysed by sophisticated algorithms for connections, comparisons and insights.\nThe promise of all of this is that big data will create opportunities for medical breakthroughs, help tailor medical interventions to us as individuals and create technologies that will speed up and improve healthcare.\nAnd, of course, during the COVID-19 pandemic we’ve also seen some countries use data, generated from people’s mobile phones, to track and trace the disease.\nAll of this poses opportunities for the tech giants and others who want to be part of the goldrush for our data -  and to then sell solutions back to us\nWhat are the risks in handing over our most personal data? Will it allow big data to deliver on its hype? And is it a fair exchange?\nIn this episode, Oliver Johnson speaks to Dr Leeza Osipenko, Senior Lecturer in Practice in LSE’s Department of Health Policy; Professor Barbara Prainsack, Professor of Comparative Policy Analysis at the University of Vienna and Professor Sociology at King’s College London; Dr Stephen L. Roberts, LSE Fellow in Global Health Policy in LSE’s Department of Health Policy; and Dr James Somauroo, founder of the healthtech agency somX and presenter of The Health-Tech Podcast.\n \nResearch \nBlockchain’s potential to improve clinical trials by Leeza Osipenko\nBig Data, Algorithmic Governmentality and the Regulation of Pandemic Risk by Stephen Roberts\nPersonalized Medicine: Empowered Patients in the 21st Century? by Barbara Prainsack\n \n \nContributors\nDr Leeza Osipenko\nProfessor Barbara Prainsack\nDr Stephen L.
