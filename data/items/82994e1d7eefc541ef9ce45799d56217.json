Autoimmune conditions continue to rise to record numbers, not to mention all of the chronic mystery illnesses that so many people struggle with daily. I’ve experienced this firsthand, along with the corresponding frustration and fear. There is an intriguing hypothesis about these conditions that I get into with my guests, Dana Parish and Dr. Steven Phillips, today on <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>: underlying infections. Sneaky tick-borne diseases like Lyme, parasitic infections, and certain viruses can be extremely hard to diagnose. Meanwhile, they can contribute to an immune system collapse and other life-threatening breakdowns throughout the entire body.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Phillips and Dana Parish share their incredible stories of overcoming chronic stealth infections after numerous doctors couldn’t help them. Lyme was a common factor for both of them, while Dr. Phillips was also able to diagnose Bartonella in Dana. At their worst, they both had extremely limited mobility and felt their lives were at risk. Dana shares that in addition to recovering her mobility and strength, treating these infections also had a profound impact on her mental health by reducing her anxiety and depression. Dr. Phillips’ journey not only forced him to be his own detective to find healing, but also showed him how much discordance there is among conventional medicine in treating diseases like Lyme.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by TrueDark, Essentia, and Tushy.</p><br><p>TrueDark Daylights help prevent eye strain and headaches from overexposure to junk light and TrueDark Twilights collection for nighttime helps you get deeper sleep.
