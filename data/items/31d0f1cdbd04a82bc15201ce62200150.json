  "title": "Kirk Minihane on NBC and the Persistence of Traditional Masculinity in News Media (Also Gerry Callahan Calls In)",
  "description": "<p><p>NBC News was triggered by a few comments on a Barstool Sports story about Antonio Brown. In response to that hit piece, Kirk Minihane would like to remind you that NBC is the former home of Bill Cosby, Matt Lauer, Mark Halperin, and other well-known feminist heroes. He'd also like to remind you that NBC News President Noah Oppenheim spiked Ronan Farrow's story about Harvey Weinstein because he wanted to sell a screenplay. So who has the toxic office culture? Also on today's show: Gerry Callahan makes his first appearance, Blind Mike has a groupie, and Bob Hearts Abishola.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
