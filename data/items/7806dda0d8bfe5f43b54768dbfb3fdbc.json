  "description": "<p>This week on Trillions, Joel and Eric record the podcast equivalent of a double-album with Barry Ritholtz, an ETF-using financial advisor as well as a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, host of the Bloomberg podcast \"Masters in Business,\" and overall deep thinker. In addition to ETFs, the trio discusses investing, the economy, the role of the modern financial adviser, tariffs, Trump, and even God. We're calling this special body of work \"Use Your Disillusion I & II,\" a nod to the seminal Guns N' Roses album. Why? Because - according to Barry - disillusionment is a major driver behind the rise of ETFs and passive investing.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
