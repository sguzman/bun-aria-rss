  "description": "Today we’re going to get a deep take on the old cliche, “You are what you eat.” Usually that expression speaks to the impact of food on our bodies, but what is often overlooked is the impact nutrition has on our minds. Dr. Mark Hyman is the author of a book called Food Fix. He studied Buddhism in college and then went on to become a practicing family physician and a leader in the field of Functional Medicine. He’s written thirteen New York Times Bestselling books, including his new one, and is also the host of a podcast called The Doctor’s Farmacy. In this episode, we talk about the impact of food on our mental health, and Dr. Hyman’s view that food is a social justice issue that impacts everything from chronic diseases to climate.\nWhere to find Dr. Mark Hyman online:\nWebsite: https://drhyman.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drmarkhyman\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drmarkhyman\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drmarkhyman/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/ultrawellness\nBooks:\nFood Fix by Mark Hyman, MD: https://foodfixbook.com/\nOther Books: https://drhyman.com/about/#section-6\nWe care deeply about supporting you in your meditation practice, and feel that providing you with high quality teachers is one of the best ways to do that.
