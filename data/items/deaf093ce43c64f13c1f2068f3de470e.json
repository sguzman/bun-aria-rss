  "description": "No one has provided the insight into the pathologies that define Donald Trump and his presidency like Trump's niece, Mary L. Trump. Her book, \"Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man\" is a brilliantly written, harrowing tale of familial dysfunction and how it produced the most corrupt president in U.S. history. Join David Sanger of the New York Times and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center as they explore with Mary how we got where we are, why the president is so easily manipulated by foreign despots and how much worse things can yet become. From denying the election outcome to a second term in which he so unfettered that as Mary warns, it may well lead to the end of the American experiment. Essential listening. Download this episode now.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
