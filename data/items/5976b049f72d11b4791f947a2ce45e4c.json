We knew that John was responsible for  developing some seriously impressive camera hardware at Replay what we didn't know was that his father was one of the founders of B&M and that he grew up at the height of drag racing in the San Fernando Valley. John shares his stories of racing, fabrication, running several successful businesses and how those endeavors ultimately culminated in the creation of Replay XD Cameras</p>\n",
