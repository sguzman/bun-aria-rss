  "description": "<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, OP works as a security guard at a large facility. He notices a Karen park her car in a reserved space, and then sneak in through a back door without paying for her ticket! OP doesn't really care about the stolen ticket, but he approaches her to get her to move her car. She assumes that he's there about the stolen ticket, so she quickly shuts OP down. OP just shrugs, walks off, and tows the Karen's car!</p>\n",
