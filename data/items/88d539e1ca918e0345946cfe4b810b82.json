  "description": "<p>A full blown epidemic in the developed world, diabetes currently afflicts an astonishing 30 million people in the US alone, despite the fact that 1 out of 4 don’t even know they have it.</p><p>Even more bewildering, over one-third of all U.S. adults have prediabetes. That's more than 84 million people, 90% of whom are unaware of their condition.</p><p>Not enough? Over the last 20 years, the number of adults diagnosed has more than doubled, with no end in sight.</p><p>For purposes of clarity, 90-95% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes are the Type 2 form. The good news is that Type 2 isn’t just treatable, it’s actually reversible -- often to the point of undetectability. And for those suffering from Type 1, certain diet and lifestyle changes render the illness more manageable than ever.</p><p>To learn more about the nature of diabetes, how to avoid it and the many things you can do if you have it, I sat down with&nbsp;<strong>Cyrus Khambatta, PhD</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Robby Barbaro MPH</strong>&nbsp;-- the team behind&nbsp;<em>Mastering Diabetes</em>,&nbsp;an online coaching platform for people living with all forms of diabetes that focuses on low-fat, plant-based, whole-food nutrition.&nbsp;</p><p>Living with Type 1 diabetes since 2002, Cyrus received a degree in&nbsp;mechanical engineering from Stanford University and a PhD in nutritional biochemistry from UC Berkeley.
