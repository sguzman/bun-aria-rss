  "description": "<p>Regenerative farming takes a clear approach to agriculture, in that it’s not just about sustaining the land in its current state, it’s about bringing it back to its original, vibrant state. This creates greater biodiversity, more nutrients, stronger soils, and healthier food. Regenerative farming encompasses numerous practices that benefit the soil in which crops are being farmed. It is about being minimally invasive and supporting natural symbiotic relationships, so that bacteria in the soil, grazing cattle, and everything in between, are working together. In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Miriam Horn as she shares the story of a midwest soil farmer who is using regenerative practices to restore his land back to its original Prairie state.</p><br><p>Miriam Horn works at the Environmental Defense Fund and is a New York Times best-selling author. Her books include, Rebels in White Gloves, Coming of Age with Hillary's Class, Wellesley '69, Earth: The Sequel, The Race to Reinvent Energy Stop Global Warming, which was co-authored with the Environmental Defense Fund president Fred Krupp, and Rancher, Farmer, Fisherman: Conservation Heroes of the American Heartland.</p><br><p>Tune into Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation with Miriam Horn: <a href=\"https://drmarkhyman.lnk.to/MiriamHorn\" target=\"_blank\">https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/MiriamHorn</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
