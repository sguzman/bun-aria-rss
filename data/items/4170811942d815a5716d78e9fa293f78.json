  "description": "For today’s episode we will be answering all of your questions you’ve asked and sent us in recent months. We do an episode like this about once every quarter in which we answer the questions that have a shorter answer, but we sometimes do whole episodes around one question if it requires a lot more explanation. Send in your questions to <a href=\"mailto:dearalice@alicelane.com\">dearalice@alicelane.com</a><br /><br />Walls and trim color 3:13<br />Favorite wood tone for furniture 5:47<br />Pattern curtains vs rugs 9:46<br />Jess’s front door and home 12:09<br />Questions for Sue and picking art 19:20<br />Questions on windows 24:53<br />One thing that every room needs 32:11<br />Best tip for warming up white walls 37:04<br />Kelvin/light temperature 39:38<br />What to put on a 9 foot dining table 46:20<br />Styling a very large basement wall with a TV, but no fireplace 51:45<br /><br />“I think we’re done with that day where people are painting their walls just white. It looks like a white piece of paper. That’s not cool anymore. I think you want something that looks more organic, more artisan, and has a little bit of warmth to it. It doesn’t have to be beige, it doesn’t have to be taupe, but there is a white that is a lot more special.” 37:16<br /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
