  "description": "<p>r/Idontworkherelady Today's story is really crazy! OP was walking down a stairwell in a building, minding his own business, when a woman confronted him and started shouting demands at him. When he refused to help her, she claimed that he assaulted her! The police show up, but luckily OP has video evidence that proves his innocence. Without that video, there's a good chance that the woman's lies would have put him in jail.
