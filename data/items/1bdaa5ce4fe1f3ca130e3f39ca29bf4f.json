Learn vocabulary related to places in a city while also practicing common descriptions and dialogues using high frequency verbs, such as ser, estar, ir, poder, tener, y ver. \n\nThrough storytelling, as well as \"storyasking,\" you will have moments to practice speaking Spanish and responding to questions in the target language as we explore some of the common vocabulary for places you can visit in a city. \n\nTPRS (Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling) has been proven to be an effective and engaging way to learn a new language.
