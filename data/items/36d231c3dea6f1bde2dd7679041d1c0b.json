  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as rioters continue to destroy Minneapolis over the death of Daunte Wright, the full truth about Wright’s death, and his life, is finally coming out. Wright was wanted by police after robbing a woman at gunpoint and choking her. Does that detail matter? I say it does, and I’ll explain why. Plus our Five Headlines, including the mayor of Brooklyn Center suggesting that cops who do traffic stops shouldn’t have guns. What could go wrong? And the AP declares that the term “mistress” is no longer acceptable because it stigmatizes floozies. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about something called “Neo-pronouns.” If you thought the Left couldn’t make a bigger mess of pronouns, you were mistaken. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
