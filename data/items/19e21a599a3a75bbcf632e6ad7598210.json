How To Move Forward When We’re Divided (About Basically Everything)</em>. While we all want the next step to be solving conflict together, it’s not a realistic approach. Instead, think of asking “Now what?” as a catalyst for connecting with people in a more heartfelt way. The goal isn’t to fix other people, the goal is to strengthen our understanding about the complexities of human relationships. Seeking peaceful solutions looks like honoring other people’s stories, giving them the benefit of the doubt, and authentically showing our own beliefs and joys. The ways in which we live our beliefs is often varied; we show up in different ways during different stages of our lives.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
