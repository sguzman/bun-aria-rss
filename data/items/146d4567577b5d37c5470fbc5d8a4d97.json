And its creation took more than a <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/#1991-2002-a-decade-of-basic-science'>decade of my life</a>. Almost every day of my thirties, and a little beyond, I tenaciously worked on it. Figuring out more and more science. Developing new kinds of computational diagrams. Crafting an exposition that I wrote and rewrote to make as clear as possible. And painstakingly laying out page after page of what on May 14, 2002, would be published as <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em>.</p>\n<p>I’ve written before (even <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>in the book itself</a>) about the intellectual journey involved in the creation of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. But here I want to share some of the more practical “behind the scenes” journey of the making of what I and others usually now call simply “the NKS book”. Some of what I’ll talk about happened twenty years ago, some more like thirty years ago. And it’s been interesting to go back into my archives (and, yes, those backup tapes from 30 years ago were hard to read!) and relive some of what finally led to the delivery of the ideas and results of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> as truckloads of elegantly printed books with striking covers.<span id=\"more-36459\"></span></p>\n<p>It was late 1989—soon after my 30th birthday—when I decided to embark on what would become <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. And at first my objective was quite modest: I just wanted to write a book to summarize the science I’d developed earlier in the 1980s. <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>We&#8217;d released Version 1.0</a> of <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>Mathematica</a> (and what’s now the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>) in June 1988, and to accompany that release I’d written what had rapidly become a <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematica-book/'>very successful book</a>. And while I’d basically built Mathematica to give me the opportunity to do more science, my thought in late 1989 was that before seriously embarking on that, I should spend perhaps a year and write a book about what I already knew, and perhaps tie up a few loose ends in the process.</p>\n<p>My journey in science began in the early 1970s—and by the time I was 14 I’d already written <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/early-books/'>three book-length &#8220;treatises&#8221; about physics</a> (though these wouldn’t see the light of day for several more decades). I worked purely on physics for a number of years, but in 1979 this led me into my <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/smp-symbolic-manipulation-program/'>first big adventure in technology</a>—thereby starting my (very productive) long-term personal pattern of alternating between science and technology (roughly five times so far). In the early 1980s—back in a “science phase”—I was fortunate enough to make what remains my <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>all-time favorite science discovery</a>: that in cellular automaton programs even with extremely simple rules it’s possible to generate immense complexity. And from this discovery I was led to a series of results that began to suggest what I started calling a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/'>general &#8220;science of complexity&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<p>By the mid-1980s I was quite well positioned in the academic world, and my first thought was to try to build up the study of the “science of complexity” as an academic field. I <a href='https://www.complex-systems.com/'>started a journal</a> and a research center, and collected my papers in a book entitled <em><a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1986-a-first-collection-of-cellular-automaton-papers/'>Theory and Applications of Cellular Automata</a></em> (later reissued as <em><a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/cellular-automata-complexity/'>Cellular Automata and Complexity</a></em>). But things developed slowly, and eventually I decided to go to “plan B”—and just try to create the tools and environment that I would need to personally push forward the science as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>The result was that in late 1986 I started the development of Mathematica (and what’s now the Wolfram Language) and founded <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/'>Wolfram Research</a>. For several years I was completely consumed with the challenges of language design, software development and CEOing our rapidly growing company. But in August 1989 we had released <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/quick-revision-history.html'>Mathematica 1.2</a> (tying up the most obvious loose ends of <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v1/'>Version 1.0</a>)—and with the intensity of my other commitments at least temporarily reduced, I began to think about science again. </p>\n<p><em><a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematica-book/'>The Mathematica Book</a></em> had been comparatively straightforward and fast for me to write—even as a “side project” to architecting and developing the system. And I imagined that it would be a somewhat similar experience writing a book explaining what I’d figured out about complexity.</p>\n<p>My first working title was <em>Complexity: An Introduction to the Science of Complex Phenomena</em>. My first draft of a table of contents, from November 1989, begins with “A Gallery of Complex Systems” (or “The Phenomenon of Complexity”), and continues through nine other chapters, capturing some of what I then thought would be important (and in most cases had already studied):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg2.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg2.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"402\" /></a></p>\n<p>I wrote a few pages of introductory text—beginning by stating the objective as:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg3.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg3.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"78\" /></a></p>\n<p>My archives record that in late December I was taking a more computation-first approach, and considering the title <em>Algorithms in Nature: An Introduction to Complexity</em>. But soon I was submerged in the intense effort to develop Mathematica 2.0, and this is what consumed me for most of 1990—though my archives from the time reveal one solitary short note, apparently from the middle of the year: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg3-a.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg3-a.png\" width=\"396\" height=\"278\" /></a></p>\n<p>But through all this I kept thinking about the book I intended to write, and wondering what it should really be like. In the late 1980s there’d been quite a run of unexpectedly successful “popular science” books—like <em>A Brief History of Time</em>—that mixed what were at least often claimed to be new results or new insights about science with a kind of intended-to-entertain “everyman narrative”. A sequence of publishers had encouraged me to “write a popular science book”. But should the book I was planning to write really be one of those? </p>\n<p>I talked to quite a few authors and editors. But nobody could quite tell a coherent story. Perhaps the most promising insight came from an editor of several successful such books, who opined that he thought the main market for “popular science” books was people who in the past would have read philosophy books, but now those were too narrow and technical. Other people, though, told me they thought it was really more of an “internal market”, with the books basically being bought by other scientists. And in the media and elsewhere there continued to be an undercurrent of sentiment that while the books might be being bought, they mostly weren’t actually getting read.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t there actual data on what’s going on?” I asked my publishing industry contacts. “No”, they said, “that’s just not how our industry works”. “Well”, I said, “why don’t we collect some data?” My then-publisher seemed enthusiastic about it. So I wrote a rather extensive survey to do on “random shoppers” in bookstores. It began with some basic—if “1990-style”—demographic questions, then got to things like</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322bpplsurvey4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"801\" /></a></p>\n<p>and rather charmingly ended with</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg4-a.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg4-a.png\" width=\"501\" height=\"396\" /></a></p>\n<p>(and, yes, in reality it took almost the longest time I could imagine for electronic books to become common). But after many months of “we’ll get results soon” it turned out almost no surveys were ever done. As I would learn repeatedly, most publishers seemed to have a very hard time doing anything they hadn’t already done before. Still, my then-publisher had done well with <em>The Mathematica Book</em>. So perhaps they might be able to just “follow a formula” and do well with my book if it was written in “popular science” form. </p>\n<p>But I quickly realized that the pressure to add sensationalism “to sell books” really grated on me. And it didn’t take long to decide that, no, I wasn’t going to write a “formula” popular science book. I was going to write my own kind of book—that was more direct and straightforward. No stories. Just science. With lots of pictures. And if nothing else, the book would at least be helpful to me, as a way of clarifying my own thinking.</p>\n<h2 id='beginning-to-tool-up'>Beginning to Tool Up</h2>\n<p>In January 1991 we announced <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1991-mathematica-2-is-released/?iframe=true'>Mathematica 2.0</a>—and in March and June I did a <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/1991/03/03/mathematica2-tour-thumb/?iframe=true'>35-city tour of the US and Europe</a> talking about it. Then, finally, at the beginning of July we delivered final floppy disks to the duplicator (as one did in those days)—and Mathematica 2.0 was on its way. So what next? I had a long roadmap of things we should do. But I decided it was time to let the team I’d built just get on with following the roadmap for a while, without me adding yet more things to it. (As it turns out, we finally finished essentially everything that was on my 1991 to-do list just a few years ago.)</p>\n<p>And so it was that in July 1991 I became a remote CEO (yes, a few decades ahead of the times), moved a couple thousand miles away from our company headquarters to a place in the hills near San Francisco, and set about getting ready to write. Based on the plan I had for the book—and my experience with <em><a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematica-book/'>The Mathematica Book</a></em>—I figured it might take about a year, or maybe 18 months, to finish the project.</p>\n<p>In the end—with a few trips in the middle, notably to <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/08/when-exactly-will-the-eclipse-happen-a-multimillenium-tale-of-computation/\">see</a> a <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=total+solar+eclipse+1991'>total solar eclipse</a>—it took me a couple of months to get my remote-CEO setup figured out (with a swank computer-connected fax machine, email getting autodelivered every 15 minutes, etc.). But even while that was going on, I was tooling up to get an efficient modern system for visualizing and studying cellular automata. Back when I had been writing my <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/cellular-automata/'>papers in the 1980s</a>, I’d had a C program (primarily for Sun workstations) that had gradually grown, and was eventually controlled by a rather elaborate—but sensible-for-its-time—hierarchical textual menu system</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"550\" /></a></p>\n<p>which, yes, could generate at least single-graphic-per-screen graphics, as in this picture of my 1983 office setup:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5c.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5c.png\" width=\"556\" height=\"329\" /></a></p>\n<p>But now the world had changed, and I had <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica'>Mathematica</a>. And I wanted a nice collection of Wolfram Language functions that could be used as streamlined “primitives” for studying cellular automata. Given all my work on cellular automata it might seem strange that I hadn’t built cellular automaton functionality into the Wolfram Language right from the start. But in addition to being a bit bashful about my personal pet kind of system, I hadn’t been able to see how to “package” all the various different kinds of cellular automata I’d studied into one convenient superfunction—and indeed it took me a decade more of understanding, both of language design and of cellular automata, to work out <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CellularAutomaton.html'>how to nicely do that</a>. And so back in 1991 I just created a collection of add-on functions (or what might today be a paclet) containing the particular functions I needed. And indeed those functions served me well over the course of the development of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>.</p>\n<p>A “staged” screen capture from the time shows my basic working environment:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5a.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5a.png\" width=\"503\" height=\"409\" /></a></p>\n<p>Some printouts from early 1991 give a sense of my everyday experience:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img6.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img6.png\" width=\"607\" height=\"380\" /></a></p>\n<p>And although it&#8217;s now more than 30 years later, I&#8217;m happy to say that we&#8217;ve successfully maintained the compatibility of the Wolfram Language, and those same functions still just run! The .ma format of my Version 2.0 notebooks from 1991 has <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/Developer/ref/NotebookConvert.html'>to be converted to .nb</a>, but then they just open in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/12/launching-version-13-0-of-wolfram-language-mathematica/'>Version 13</a> (with a bit of automatic style modernization) and I’m immediately “transported back in time” to 1991, with, yes, a very small notebook appropriate for a 1991 rather than a 2022 screen size: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img7.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img7.png\" width=\"420\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n<p>(Of course the cellular automata all look the same, but, yes, this notebook looks shockingly similar to ones from our recent <a href='https://twitter.com/stephen_wolfram/status/1420206573096513539' target=_blank rel=noopener>cellular automaton NFT-minting event</a>.)</p>\n<p>We’d invented <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/notebooks/'>notebooks</a> in 1987 to be able to do just the kinds of things I wanted to do for my science project—and I’d been itching to use them. But before 1991 I’d mostly been doing core code development (often in C), or using the elaborate but still textual system we had for authoring <em>The Mathematica Book</em>. And so—even though I’d demoed them many times—I hadn’t had a chance to personally make daily use of notebooks.</p>\n<p>But in 1991, I went all in on notebooks—and have never looked back. When I first started studying cellular automata back in 1981, I’d had to display their output as text. But soon I was able to start using the bitmapped displays of workstation computers, and by 1984 I was routinely printing cellular automaton images in fairly high resolution on a laser printer. But with Mathematica and our notebook technology things got dramatically more convenient—and what had previously often involved laborious work with paper, scissors and tape now became a matter of simple Wolfram Language code in a notebook.</p>\n<p>For almost a decade starting in 1982, my primary computer had been a progressively more sophisticated Sun workstation. But in 1991 I switched to NeXT—mainly to be able to use our notebook interface, which was by then <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/1989/04/03/1989_mathematicaarrivesnext-2/?iframe=true'>well developed for NeXT</a> but wasn’t yet ready on X Windows and Sun. (It was also available on Macintosh computers, but at the time those weren’t powerful enough.) </p>\n<p>And here I am in 1991, captured “hiding out” as a remote CEO, with a NeXT in the background, just getting started on the book:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img7a.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img7a.png\" width=\"283\" height=\"193\" /></a></p>\n<p>Here’s a picture showing a bit more of the setup, taken in early 1993, during a short period when I was a remote-remote-CEO, with my computer set up in a hotel room:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img8.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img8.png\" width=\"423\" height=\"438\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id='september-1991:-beyond-cellular-automata'>September 1991: Beyond Cellular Automata</h2>\n<p>Throughout the 1980s, I’d used cellular automata—and basically cellular automata alone—as my window into the computational universe. But in August 1991—with my new computational capabilities and new away-from-the-company-to-do-science setup—I decided it’d be worth trying to look at some other systems.</p>\n<p>And I have to say that now, three decades later, I didn’t remember just how suddenly everything happened. But my filesystem records that in successive days at the beginning of September 1991 there I was investigating more and more kinds of systems (.ma’s were “Mathematica notebook” files; .mb’s were the “binary forks” of these files):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img9.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img9.png\" width=\"286\" height=\"308\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/#sect-3-3--mobile-automata'>Mobile automata</a>. <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-4--turing-machines'>Turing machines</a>. <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-7--tag-systems'>Tag systems</a>. Soon these would be joined by <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-9--register-machines'>register machines</a>, and more. The first examples of these systems tended to have quite simple behavior. But I quickly started searching to see whether these systems—like cellular automata—would be capable of complex behavior, as my 1991 notebooks record:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img13a.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img13a.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"618\" /></a></p>\n<p>Often I would run programs overnight, or sometimes for many days. Later I would recruit many computers from around our company, and have them send me mail about their results:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img10-v2.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img10-v2.png\" width=\"404\" height=\"237\" /></a></p>\n<p>But already in September 1991 I was starting to see that, yes, just like cellular automata, all these different kinds of systems, even when their underlying rules were simple, could <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/'>exhibit highly complex behavior</a>. I think I’d sort of implicitly assumed this would be true. But somehow actually seeing it began to elevate my view of just how general a “science of complexity” one might be able to make.</p>\n<p>There were a few distractions in the fall of 1991. Like in October a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_firestorm_of_1991' target=_blank rel=noopener>large fire</a> came within about half a mile of burning down our house: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img11.png\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img11.png\" width=\"359\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n<p>But by the spring of 1992 it was beginning to become clear that there was a very general principle around all this complexity I was seeing. I had <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/undecidability-intractability-theoretical-physics.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>invented the concept of computational irreducibility</a> back in 1984. And I suppose in retrospect I should have seen the bigger picture sooner. But as it was, on a pleasant afternoon (and, no, I haven’t figured out the exact date), I was taking a short break from being in front of my computer, and had wandered outside. And that’s when the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> came to me. Somehow after all those years with cellular automata, and all those months with computer experiments on other systems, I was primed for it. But in the end it all arrived in one moment: the concept, the name, the implications for computational irreducibility. And in the three decades since, it’s been the single most important guiding principle for my intuition. </p>\n<h2 id='what-should-the-pages-look-like?'>What Should the Pages Look Like?</h2>\n<p>I’ve always found it difficult to produce “disembodied content”: right from the beginning I typically need to have a pretty clear idea how what I’m producing will look in the end. So back in 1991 I really couldn’t produce more than a page or two of content for my book without knowing what the book was going to look like.</p>\n<p>“Formula” popular science books tended—for what I later realized were largely economic reasons—to consist mainly of pages of pure text, with at most line drawings, and to concentrate whatever things like photographs they might have into a special collection of “plates” in the middle of the book. For <em>The Mathematica Book</em> we’d developed a definite—very functional—layout, with text, tables and two-column “computer dialogs”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img14.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img14.png\" width=\"612\" height=\"348\" /></a></p>\n<p>For the NKS book I knew I needed something much more visual. And at first I imagined it might be a bit like a high-end textbook, complete with all sorts of structured elements (“Historical Note”, “Methodology”, etc.). </p>\n<p>I asked a talented young designer who had worked on <em>The Mathematica Book</em> (and who, 31 years later, is now a very senior executive at our company) to see what he could come up with. And here, from November 1991, is the very first “look” for the NKS book—with content pretty much just flowed in from the few pages I’d written out in plain text:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img15.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img15.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"743\" /></a></p>\n<p>I knew the book would have images of the kind I’d long produced of cellular automata, and that had appeared in <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/cellular-automata'>my papers</a> and <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/cellular-automata-complexity/'>book</a> from the 1980s:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img16.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img16.png\" width=\"999\" height=\"1128\" /></a></p>\n<p>But what about “diagrams”? At first we toyed with drawing “textbook-style” diagrams—and produced some samples:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img17a.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img17a.png\" width=\"559\" height=\"366\" /></a></p>\n<p>But these seemed to have way too much &#8220;conceptual baggage&#8221;, and when one looks closely at them, it&#8217;s easy to get confused. I wanted something more minimal—where the spotlight was as much as possible on the systems I was studying, not on &#8220;diagrammatic scaffolding&#8221;. And so I tried to develop a &#8220;direct diagramming&#8221; methodology, where each diagram could directly &#8220;explain itself&#8221;—and where every diagram would be readable &#8220;purely visually&#8221;, without words.</p>\n<p>In a typical case I might <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p71--mobile-automata/'>show the behavior of a system (here a mobile automaton)</a>, next to an explicit “visual template” of how its rules operate. The idea then was that even a reader who didn’t understand the bigger story, or any of the technical details, could still “match up templates” and understand what was going on in a particular picture:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img18.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img18.png\" width=\"493\" height=\"277\" /></a></p>\n<p>At the beginning of the project, the diagrams were comparatively simple. But as the project progressed I invented more and more mechanisms for them, until later in the project I was producing very <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p768--undecidability-and-intractability/'>complex &#8220;visually readable&#8221; diagrams like this</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img19.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img19.png\" width=\"548\" height=\"325\" /></a></p>\n<p>A crucial point was that all these diagrams were <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--pictures-in-the-book/'>being produced algorithmically</a>—with Wolfram Language code. And in fact I was developing the diagrams as an integral part of actually doing the research for the book. It was a lesson I’d learned years earlier: don’t wait until research is “finished” to figure out how to present it; work out the presentation as early as possible, so you can use it to help you actually do the research.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of our first “textbook-like” style for the book was the idea of having additional elements, alongside the “main narrative” of the book. In early layouts we thought about having “Technical Notes”, “Historical Notes”, “Implementation Notes”, etc. But it didn’t take too long to decide that no, that was just going to be too complicated. So we made the decision to have one kind of note, and to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-for-chapters/'>collect all notes at the back of the book</a>.</p>\n<p>And that meant that in the main part of the book we had just two basic elements: text and images (with captions). But, OK, in designing any book a very basic question is: what size and shape will its pages be? <em>The Mathematica Book</em> was squarish—like a typical textbook—so that it accommodated its text-on-the-left code-on-the-right “dialogs”. We knew that the new book should be wide too, to accommodate the kinds of graphics I expected. But that posed a problem.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Mathematica Book</em> ordinary text ran the full width of the page. And that worked OK, because in that book the text was typically broken up by dialogs, tables, etc. In the new book, however, I expected much longer blocks of pure text—which wouldn’t be readable if they ran the full width of the page. But if the text was narrower, then how would the graphics not look like they were awkwardly sticking out? Well, the pages would have to be carefully laid out to appropriately anchor the graphics visually, say to the tops or bottoms of pages. And that was going to make the process of layout much trickier.</p>\n<p>Different pages were definitely going to look different. But there had to be a certain overall consistency. Every graphic was going to have a caption—and actually a caption that was sufficiently self-contained so that people could basically “read the book just by looking at the pictures”. Within the graphics themselves there had to be standards. How should arrays of cells be rendered? To what extent should things have boxes around them, or arrows between them? How big should pictures that emphasized particular features be?</p>\n<p>Some of these standards got implemented basically just by me remembering to follow them. But others were essentially the result of the whole stack of Wolfram Language functions that we built to produce the algorithmic diagrams for the book. At the time, there was some fiddliness to these functions, and to making their output look good—though in later years what we learned from this was used to tune up the general look of built-in graphics in the Wolfram Language. </p>\n<h2 id='the-technology-of-images'>The Technology of Images</h2>\n<p>One of the striking features of the NKS book is the crispness of its pictures. And I think it’s fair to say that this wasn’t easy to achieve—and in the end required a pretty deep dive into the technology of imaging and printing (as I’ll describe more in a later section).</p>\n<p>Back in the 1980s I’d had plenty of pictures of things like cellular automata in <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/cellular-automata'>my papers</a>. And I’d produced them by outputting what amounted to pages of bitmaps on laser printers, then having publishers photographically reproduce the pictures for printing.</p>\n<p>Up to a point the results were OK:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img20.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img20.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"198\" /></a></p>\n<p>But for example in 1985 when I wanted a 2000-step picture of rule 30 things got difficult. The computation (which, yes, involves 8 million cells) was <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/random-sequence-generation-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>done on a prototype Connection Machine parallel computer</a>. And at first the output was generated on a large-format printer that was usually used to print integrated circuit layouts. The result was quite large, and I subsequently laminated pictures like this (and in rolled-up form they served as engaging hiding places for my children when they were very young):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img21.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img21.png\" width=\"192\" height=\"311\" /></a></p>\n<p>But when photographically reproduced and printed in a journal the picture definitely wasn’t great:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img22.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img22.png\" width=\"357\" height=\"391\" /></a></p>\n<p>And the NKS book provided another challenge as well. While the core of a picture might just be an array of cells like in a cellular automaton, a full algorithmic diagram could contain all sorts of other elements.</p>\n<p>In the end, the NKS book was a beneficiary of an important design decision that we made back in 1987, early in the development of Mathematica. At the time, most graphics were thought about in terms of bitmaps. On whatever device one was using, there was an array of pixels of a certain resolution. And the focus was on rendering the graphics at that resolution. Not everything worked that way, though. And “drawing” (as opposed to “painting”) programs typically created graphics in “vector” form, in which at first primitives like lines and polygons were specified without reference to resolution, and were then converted to bitmaps only when they were displayed.</p>\n<p>The shapes of characters in fonts were something that was often specified—at least at an underlying level—in vector form. There’d been various approaches to doing this, but by 1987 <a href='https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>PostScript</a> was an emerging standard—at least for printing—buoyed by its use in the Apple LaserWriter. The main focus of PostScript was on fonts and text, but the PostScript language also included standard graphics primitives like lines and polygons. </p>\n<p>Back when <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/'>I had built SMP in 1979–1981</a> we’d basically had to build a separate driver for every different display or printing device we wanted to output graphics on. But in 1987 there was an alternative: just use PostScript for everything. Printer manufacturers were working hard to support PostScript on their printers, but PostScript mostly hadn’t come to screens yet. There was an important exception though: the NeXT computer was set up to have PostScript as its native screen-rendering system. And partly through that, we decided to use PostScript as our underlying way to represent all graphics in Mathematica.</p>\n<p>At a high level, graphics were described with the same <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/SymbolicGraphicsLanguage.html'>symbolic primitives as we use in the Wolfram Language today</a>: <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Line.html'>Line</a></tt>, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Polygon.html'>Polygon</a></tt>, etc. But these were converted internally to PostScript—and even stored in notebooks that way. On the NeXT this was pretty much the end of the story, but on other systems we had to write our own interpreters for at least the subset of PostScript we were using. </p>\n<p>Why was this important to the NKS book? Well, it meant that all graphics could be specified in a fundamentally resolution-independent way. In developing the graphics I could look at them in a notebook on a screen, or I could print them on a standard laser printer. But for the final book the exact same graphics could be printed at much higher resolution—and look much crisper.</p>\n<p>At the time, the standard resolution of a computer screen was 72 dpi (dots per inch) and the resolution of a typical laser printer was 300 dpi. But the typical basic resolution of a book-printing pipeline was more like 2400 dpi. I’ll talk later about the adventure of actually printing the NKS book. But the key point was that because Mathematica’s graphics were fundamentally based on PostScript, they weren’t tied to any particular resolution, so they could in principle make use of whatever resolution was available.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, there were plenty of complicated issues. One had to do with indicating the cells in something like a cellular automaton. Here’s a picture of the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>first few steps of rule 30</a>, shown as a kind of “macro bitmap”, with pure black and white cells:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: 3px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051222img1.png\" alt='ArrayPlot' title='ArrayPlot' width='253' height='134' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051222img1A_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1A_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1A_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But often I wanted to indicate the extent of each cell:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051222img2.png\" alt='ArrayPlot' title='ArrayPlot' width='284' height='140' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051222img2A_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2A_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2A_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And in late 1991 and early 1992 we worried a lot about how to draw the “mesh” between cells. A first thought was just to use a thin black line. But that obviously wouldn’t work, because it wouldn’t separate black cells. And we soon settled on a <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/GrayLevel.html'>GrayLevel</a></tt><tt>[.15]</tt> line, which was visible against both black and white. </p>\n<p>But how is such a line printed? If we’re just using black ink, there’s ultimately either black or white at a particular place on the page. But there’s a standard way to achieve the appearance of gray, by changing the local density of black and white. And the typical method used to implement this is (<a href=\"https://writings.internal.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/#how-to-publish-a-book\">as we’ll discuss later</a>) <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-7--halftoning/'>halftoning</a>, in which one renders the “gray” by using black dots of different sizes.</p>\n<p>But by the time one&#8217;s using very thin gray lines, things are getting very tricky. For example, it matters how much the ink on either side of the line spreads—because if it&#8217;s too much it can effectively fill in where the line was supposed to be. We wanted to define standards that we could use throughout the NKS book. And we couldn&#8217;t tell what would happen in the final printed book except by actually trying it, on a real printing press. So already in early 1992 we started doing print tests, trying out different thicknesses of lines and so on. And that allowed us to start setting graphics standards that we could implement in the Wolfram Language code used to make the algorithmic diagrams, that would then flow through to all renderings of those diagrams.</p>\n<p>Back in 1991 we debated quite a bit whether the NKS book should use color. We knew it would be significantly more expensive to print the book in color. But would color allow seriously better communication of information? Two-color cellular automata like rule 30 can be rendered in pure black and white. But over the years I’d certainly made many striking color pictures of cellular automata with more colors. </p>\n<p>Somehow, though, those pictures hadn’t <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1984-the-business-of-cellular-automata-commemorative-postcards/?iframe=true'>seemed quite as crisp</a> as the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2003/12/cellular-automata-from-christmas-1983/?iframe=true'>black and white ones</a>. And there was another issue too, having to do with a problem I’d noticed in the mid-1980s in human visual perception of arrays of colored cells. Somewhat nerdily, I ended up including a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--using-color/'>note about this in the final NKS book</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img25.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img25.png\" width=\"448\" height=\"299\" /></a></p>\n<p>But the final conclusion was that, yes, the NKS book would be pure black and white. Nowadays—particularly with screen rendering being in many ways more important than print—it’s much easier to do things in color. And, for example, in our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> it’s been very convenient to <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/additional-material/appendix-graph-types/' target=_blank rel=noopener>distinguish types of graphs, or nodes in graphs, by color</a>. But for the NKS book I think it was absolutely the right decision to use black and white. Color might have added some nice accents to certain kinds of diagrams. But the clarity—and visual force—of the images in the book was much better served by the perceptual crispness of pure black and white. </p>\n<h2 id='how-to-lay-out-the-book'>How to Lay Out the Book</h2>\n<p>The way most books with complex formats get produced is that first the author creates “disembodied” pieces of content, then a designer or production artist comes in and arranges them on pages. But for the NKS book I wanted something where the process of creation and layout was much more integrated, and where—just as I was directly writing Wolfram Language code to produce images—I could also directly lay out final book pages.</p>\n<p>By 1990 “desktop publishing” was commonplace, and there were plenty of systems that basically allowed one to put anything anywhere on a page. But to make a whole book we knew we needed a more consistent and templated approach—that could also interact programmatically with the Wolfram Language. There were a few well-developed “full-scale book production systems” that existed, but they were complex “industrially oriented” pieces of software, that didn’t seem realistic for me to use interactively while writing the book.</p>\n<p>In mid-1990, though, we saw a demo of something new, running on the NeXT computer: a system called FrameMaker, which featured book-production capabilities, as well as a somewhat streamlined interchange format. Oh, and especially on the NeXT, it handled PostScript graphics well, inserting them “by reference” into documents. By late 1990 we were building book layout templates in FrameMaker, and we soon settled on using that for the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--book-production-system/'>basic production of the book</a>. (Later, to achieve all the effects we wanted, we ended up having to process everything through Wolfram Language, but that’s another story.</p>\n<p>We iterated for a while on the book design, but by the end of 1991 we’d nailed it down, and I started authoring the book. I made images using Mathematica, importing them in “<a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/EPS.html'>Encapsulated PostScript</a>” into FrameMaker. And words I typed directly into FrameMaker—in the environment reconstructed here using a virtual machine that we saved from the time of authoring the book:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img25a.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img25a.png\" width=\"570\" height=\"494\" /></a></p>\n<p>I composed every page—not only its content, but also its visual appearance. If I had a cellular automaton to render, and it was going to occupy a certain region on a page, I would pick the number of cells and steps to be appropriate for that region. I was constantly adjusting pictures to make them look good on a given page, or on pairs of facing pages, or along with other nearby pictures, and so on. </p>\n<p>One of the tricky issues was how to refer to pictures from within the text. In technical books, it&#8217;s common to number &#8220;figures&#8221;, so that the text might say &#8220;See Figure 16”. But I wanted to avoid that piece of &#8220;scaffolding&#8221;, and instead always just be able to say things like &#8220;the picture below&#8221;, or &#8220;the picture on the facing page“. It was often quite a puzzle to see how to do this. If a picture was too big, or the text was too small, the picture would get too far ahead, and so on. And I was constantly adjusting things to make everything work.</p>\n<p>I also decided that for elegance I wanted to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--hyphenation/'>avoid ever having to hyphenate words</a> in the text. And quite often I found myself either rewording things, or slightly changing letter spacing, to make things fit, and to avoid things like &#8220;orphaned&#8221; words at the beginnings of lines.</p>\n<p>It was a strange and painstaking process getting each page to look right, and adjusting content and layout together. Sometimes things got a little pathological. I always wanted to fill out pages, and not to leave space at the bottom (oh, and facing pages had to be exactly the same height). And I also tried to start new sections on a new page. But there I was, writing <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond/'>Chapter 5</a>, and trying to end the section on &#8220;<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-4--substitution-systems-and-fractals'>Substitution Systems and Fractals</a>”—and I had an empty bottom third of a page. What was I to do? I decided to invent a whole new kind of system, that <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p192--substitution-systems-and-fractals/'>appears on page 192</a>, just to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p191--substitution-systems-and-fractals/'>fill out the layout for page 191</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/swimg051322img26.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/swimg051322img26.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"366\" /></a></p>\n<p>Looking through my archives, I find traces of other examples.

So it should be easy to find examples of them—that one could go out and take nice, consistent photographs of. </p>\n<p>And starting in late 1991, that’s just what we did.

But I was in the Chicago area, and it was the middle of the winter, with no local leaves to be found. What was I to do? I contacted an employee of ours in Australia. Conveniently it turned out he lived just down the street from the Melbourne botanical gardens. And there he found all sorts of interesting leaves—making <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p403--growth-of-plants-and-animals/'>my final page</a> a curious mixture of Californian and Australian fauna:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section8img21.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section8img21.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='314' height='375' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section8img21_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='21_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='21_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As it turned out, by the next spring I hadn’t yet finished the book, and in fact I was still trying to fill in some of what I wanted to say about leaves.

(And it was very convenient that this was a plant-related question, because I’m horribly squeamish when it comes to dissecting animals, even for food.)</p>\n<p>Some of what I wanted to photograph was out in the world. But some was also collectible. Ever since I was a kid I had been gradually acquiring interesting shells, fossils, rocks and so on, sometimes “out in the field”, but more often at shops. Working on the NKS book I dramatically accelerated that process.

So at first I simply called the book <em>The Science of Complexity</em>, adding the explanatory subtitle <em>A Unified Approach to Complex Behavior in Natural and Artificial Systems</em>. But after a while I began to feel that this sounded a bit stodgy—and like a textbook—so to spruce it up a bit I changed it to <em>A New Science of Complexity</em>, with subtitle <em>Rethinking the Mechanisms of Nature:</em></p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='224' height='298' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Pretty soon, though, I dropped the “New” as superfluous, and the title became <em>A Science of Complexity</em>. I always knew computation was a key part of the story, but as I began to understand more about just what was out there in the computational universe, I started thinking I should capture “computation” in the name of the book, leading to a new idea: <em>Computation and the Complexity of Nature</em>. And for this title I even had a first cover draft made—complete with an eye, added on the theory that human visual perception would draw people to the eye, and thus make them notice the book:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='347' height='429' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But back in 1992 (and I think it would be different today) people really didn’t understand the term “computation”, and it just made the book sound very technical to them. So back I went to <em>A Science of Complexity</em>. I wasn’t very happy with it, though, and I kept on thinking about alternatives. In August 1992 I prepared a little survey:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='520' height='538' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The results of this survey were—like those of many surveys—inconclusive, and didn’t change my mind about the title.

And when I said that—at least among non-technical people—the reaction was essentially always the same “Oh, that sounds very complicated”. And that would be the end of the conversation.</p>\n<p>By September 1994 this had happened just too many times, and I realized I needed a new title. So I thought to myself &#8220;How would I describe the book?&#8221;. And there it was, right in the flap copy: &#8220;a new kind of science”. I made a quick note on the back of my then business card:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img6.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img6.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='567' height='483' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='6_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And soon that was the title: <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. I started trying it out. The reaction was again almost always the same. But now it was “So, what’s new about it?” And that would start a conversation.</p>\n<p>I liked the title a lot. It definitely said what by then I thought the book was about. But there was one thing I didn’t like. It seemed a bit like a “meta title”. OK, so you have a new kind of science. But what is that new kind of science called? What is its name? And why isn’t the book called that?</p>\n<p>I spent countless hours thinking about this. I thought about word roots. I considered comp- (for “computation”), prog- (for “program”), auto- (for “automata”, etc.). I went through Latin and Greek dictionaries, and considered roots like arch- and log- (both way too confusing). I wrote programs to generate “synthetic words” that might evoke the right meaning. I considered names like “algonomics”, “gramistry”, “regulistics” (but not “ruliology”!), and “programistics”—for which I tried to see how its usage might work:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img7.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img7.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='459' height='625' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But nothing quite clicked. And in a sense my working title already told me why: I was talking about “a new kind of science”, which involved a new way of thinking, for which there were really no words, because it hadn’t been done before.</p>\n<p>I’d had a certain amount of experience inventing words, for concepts in both science and technology. Sometimes it had gone well, sometimes not so well. And I knew the same was true in general in history. For every “physics” or “economics” or even “cybernetics” there were countless names that had never made it. </p>\n<p>And eventually I decided that even if I could come up with a name, it wasn’t worth the risk. Maybe a name would eventually emerge, and it would be perfectly OK if the “launch book” was called <em>A New Kind of Science</em> (as yet unnamed). Certainly much better than if it gave the new kind of science a definite name, but the name that stuck was different.</p>\n<p>During the writing of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I didn’t really need to “refer in the third person” to what the book was about. But pretty much as soon as the book was published, there needed to be a name for the intellectual endeavor that the book was about. During the development of the book, some of the people working on its project management had started calling the book by the initials of its title: ANKOS. And that was the seed for the name of its content, which almost immediately became “NKS”.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I’ve returned quite a few times to the question of naming. And very recently I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>started using the term &#8220;ruliology&#8221;</a> for one of the key pursuits of NKS: exploring the details of what systems based on simple computational rules do. I like the name, and I think it captures well the ethos of the specific scientific activity around studying the consequences of simple rules. But it’s not the whole story of “NKS”. <em>A New Kind of Science</em> is, as its name suggests, about a new kind of science—and a new way of thinking about the kind of thing we imagine science can be about. </p>\n<p>When the book was first published, some people definitely seemed to feel that the strength and simplicity of the title “<em>A New Kind of Science</em>” must claim too much. But twenty years later, I think it’s clear that the title said it right. And it’s charming now when people talk about what’s in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, and how it’s different from other things, and want to find a way to say what it is—and end up <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiOnolbVYs8&#038;t=4727s' target=_blank rel=noopener>finding themselves saying it&#8217;s &#8220;a new kind of science&#8221;</a>. And, yes, that’s why I called the book that!</p>\n<h2 id='the-cover-of-the-book'>The Cover of the Book</h2>\n<p>We started thinking about the cover of the book very early in the project—with the “eye” design being the first candidate.

We patiently explained that we had quite a large and good art department, which happened to have even recently won some national awards for design. </p>\n<p>But the publisher was sure they could do better.

That would have been interesting. But another 400 pages?</p>\n<h2 id='ten-years-of-writing'>Ten Years of Writing</h2>\n<p>By the end of 1991 the basic concept of what would become <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was fairly clear. At the time, I still thought—as I had in the 1980s—that the best “hook” was the objective of “explaining complexity”. But I perfectly well understood that from an intellectual and methodological point of view the most important part of the story was that I was starting to truly take seriously the notion of computation—and starting to think broadly in a fundamentally computational way. </p>\n<p>But what could be figured out like this? What about systems based on constraints? What about systems that adapt or learn? What about biological evolution? What about fundamental physics? What about the foundations of mathematics? At the outset, I really didn’t know whether my approach would have anything to say about these things. But I thought I should at least try to check each of them out. And what happened was that every time I turned over a (metaphorical) rock it seemed like I discovered a whole new world underneath.</p>\n<p>It was intellectually exciting—and almost addictive. I would get into some new area and think “OK, let me see what I can figure out here, then move on”. But then I would get deeper and deeper into it, and weeks would turn into months, and months would turn into years. At the beginning I would sometimes tell people what I was up to. And they would say “That sounds interesting. But what about X, Y, Z?” And I would think “I might as well try and answer those questions too”. But I soon realized that I shouldn’t be letting myself get distracted: I already had more than enough very central questions to answer.</p>\n<p>And so I decided to pretty much “go hermit” until the book was done. An email I sent on October 1, 1992, summarizes how I was thinking at the time: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='444' height='139' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But that email was right before I discovered yet more kinds of computational systems to explore, and before I’d understood applications to biology, and physics, and mathematics, and so on. </p>\n<p>In the early years of the project I’d had various “I could do that as well” ideas. In 1991 I thought about dashing off an <em>Introduction to Computing</em> book (maybe I should do that now!).

And while I held off as long as I could, by 1996 there was no choice: I had to jump into finishing Mathematica 3.0.</p>\n<p>From the beginning until now I’ve always been the ultimate architect of what’s now the Wolfram Language. And back in the 1990s my way of defining the specification for the language was to write its documentation, as a book. So getting <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/1996/07/07/1993_itshere-2/?iframe=true'> Mathematica 3.0</a> out required me writing a <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematica-book/'>new edition of <em>The Mathematica Book</a></em>. And since we were <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v3/'>adding a lot in Version 3</a>, the book was long—eventually clocking in at 1403 pages. And it took me a good part of 1996 to write it.</p>\n<p>But in September 1996, Mathematica 3.0 was released, and I was able to go back to my intense focus on science and the NKS book. In many ways it was exhilarating. With <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> as a tool, I was powering through so much research. But it was difficult stuff. And getting everything right—and as clear as possible—was painstaking, if ultimately deeply satisfying, work. On a good day I might manage to write one page of the book. Other times I might spend many days working out what would end up as just a single paragraph in the notes at the back of the book.</p>\n<p>I kept on thinking “OK, in just a few months it’ll be finished”. But I just kept on discovering more and more. And finding out again and again that sections in the table of contents that I thought would just be “quick notes” actually led to major research projects with all sorts of important and unexpected results. </p>\n<p>A 1995 picture captured my typical working setup:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='543' height='389' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A year or so later, I had the desk I’m still sitting at today (though not in the same location), and a (rarely used) webcam had appeared:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img4.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img4.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='543' height='333' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A few years after that, the computer monitor was thinner, two young helpers had arrived, and I was looking distinctly unkempt and hermit-like:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img5.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='572' height='419' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In 2000 a <a href='https://aguilerahellweg.com' target=_blank rel=noopener>photographer for Forbes</a> captured my “caged scientist” look</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img6.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img6.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='383' height='469' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='6_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>along with a rather nice artistically lit “still life” of my working environment (complete with a “from-the-future” thicker-than-real-life mockup of the NKS book):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img7.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img7.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='383' height='441' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But gradually, inexorably, the book got closer and closer to being finished. The floor of my office had been covered with piles of paper, each marked with whatever issue or unfinished section they related to. But by 2001 the piles were disappearing—and by the fall of that year they were all but gone: a visible sign that the book was nearing completion. </p>\n<h2 id='tracking-everything-down:-a-decade-of-scholarship'>Tracking Everything Down: A Decade of Scholarship</h2>\n<p><em>A New Kind of Science</em> is—as its title suggests—a book about new things. But an important part of explaining new things is to provide context for them. And for me a key part of the context for things is always the story of what led to them. And that was something I wanted to capture in the NKS book.</p>\n<p>Typically there were two parts: a personal narrative of how I was led to something—and a historical narrative of what in the past might connect to it. The academic writing style that I’d adopted in the 1980s really didn’t capture either of these. So for the NKS book I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--writing-style/'>needed a new style</a>. And there were again two parts to this. First, I needed to “put myself into the text”, describing in the first person how I’d reached conclusions, and what their importance to me was. And second, I needed to “tell the story” of whatever historical developments were relevant.</p>\n<p>Early on, I made the decision not to mix these kinds of narratives. I would talk about my own relation to the material. And I would talk about other people and their <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--historical-notes/'>historical relation to the material</a>. But I didn’t talk about my interactions with other people. And, yes, there are lots of wonderful stories to tell—which perhaps one day I’ll have a chance to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/historical-perspectives'>systematically write down</a>. But for the NKS book I decided that these stories—while potentially fun to read—just weren’t relevant to the absorption and contextualization of what I had to say. So, with a bit of regret, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--autobiographical-elements/'>I left them out</a>.</p>\n<p>In typical academic papers one references other work by inserting pure, uncommented citations to it. And deep within some well-developed field, this is potentially an adequate thing to do. Because in such a field, the structure is in a sense already laid out, so a pure citation is enough to explain the connection. But for the NKS book it was quite different. Because most of the time the historical antecedents were necessarily done in quite different conceptual frameworks—and typically the only reasonable way to see the connection to them was to tell the story of what was done and why, recontextualized in an “NKS way”.</p>\n<p>And what this meant was that in writing the NKS book, I ended up doing a huge amount of “scholarship”, tracking down history, and trying to piece together the stories of what happened and why. Sometimes I personally knew—or had known—the people involved. Sometimes I was dealing with things that had happened centuries ago. Often there were mysteries involved. How did this person come to be thinking about this? Why didn’t they figure this-or-that out? What really was their conceptual framework?</p>\n<p>I’ve always been a person who tries to “do my homework” in any field I’m studying. I want to know both what’s known, and what’s not known. I want to get a sense of the patterns of thinking in the field, and “value systems” of the field. Many times in working on the NKS book I got the sense that this-or-that field should be relevant. But what was important for the NKS book was often something that was a footnote—or was even implicitly ignored—by the field. And it also didn’t help that the names for things in particular fields were often informed by their specific uses there, and didn’t connect with what was natural for the NKS book.</p>\n<p>I started the NKS book shortly after the web was invented, and well before there was substantial content on it. So at least at first a lot of my research had to be done the same way I’d done it in the 1980s: from printed books and papers, and by using online and printed abstracting systems. Here’s part of a “search” from 1991 for papers with the keyword “automata”:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='328' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>By the end of writing the NKS book I’d <a href='https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/resources/Entity-Store-of-Books-in-Stephen-Wolframs-Library' target=_blank rel=noopener>accumulated nearly 5000 books</a>, a few of them pictured here in their then-habitat circa 1999 (complete with me at my I’ve-been-on-this-project-too-long lifetime-maximum weight):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='355' height='494' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I had an online catalog of all my books, which I <a href='https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/resources/530eb09e-4e71-4493-8983-157089aeb917/' target=_blank rel=noopener>put online</a> soon after the NKS book was published. I also had file cabinets filled with more than 7000 papers. Perhaps it might have been nice when the NKS book was published to be able to say in a kind of traditional academic style “here are the ‘citations’” (and, finally, 20 years later we’re about to be able to actually do that). But at the time it wasn’t the simple citations I wanted, or thought would be useful; it was the narrative I could piece together from them. </p>\n<p>And sometimes the papers weren’t enough, and I had to make requests from document archives, or actually interview people. It was hard work, with a steady stream of surprises. For example, in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/u/?search=Ulam'>Stan Ulam</a>’s archives we found a (somewhat scurrilous) behind-the-scenes interaction about me. And after many hours of discussion <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/con-cp/?search=Conway'>John Conway</a> admitted to me that his usual story about the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--history-of-cellular-automata/'>origin of the Game of Life wasn&#8217;t correct</a>—though I at least found the true story much more interesting (even if some mystery still remains). There were times when the things I wanted to know were still entangled in government or other secrecy. And there were times when people had just outright forgotten, often because the things I now cared about just hadn’t seemed important before—and now could only be recovered by painstakingly “triangulating” from other recollections and documents.</p>\n<p>There were so many corners to the scholarship involved in creating the NKS book. One memorable example was what we called the “People Dates” project. I wanted the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/names/'>index to include</a> not only the name of every person I mentioned in the book, but also their dates, and the primary country or countries in which they worked, as in “Wolfram, Stephen (England/USA, 1959&#8211; ).”</p>\n<p>For some people that information was straightforward enough to find. But for other people there were challenges. There were 484 people altogether in the index, with a roughly exponentially increasing number born after about 1800: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='465' height='237' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For ones who were alive we just sent them email, usually getting helpful (if sometimes witty) responses. In other cases we had to search government records, ask institutions, or find relatives or other personal contacts. There were lots of weird issues about <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--people-in-the-index/'>transliterations, historical country designations, and definitions of &#8220;worked in&#8221;</a>. But in the end we basically got everything (though for example <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/s-sg/?search=Sch%C3%B6nfinkel'>Moses Schönfinkel</a>’s date of death remained a mystery, as it does even now, after all <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/a-little-closer-to-finding-what-became-of-moses-schonfinkel-inventor-of-combinators/'>my recent research</a>). </p>\n<p>Most of the historical research I did for the NKS book wound up in notes at the back of the book. But of all the 1350 notes spread over 348 small-print pages, only <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/'>102 were in the end historical</a>. The other notes covered a remarkable range of subject matter. They provided background information, technical details and additional results. And in many ways the notes represent the highest density of information in the NKS book—and I, for example, constantly find myself referring to them, and to their pithy (and, I think, rather clear) summaries of all sorts of things.</p>\n<p>When I was working on the book there were often things I thought I’d better figure out, just in case they were relevant to the core narrative of the book. Sometimes they’d be difficult things, and they’d take me—and my computers—days or even weeks. But quite often what came out just didn’t fit into the core narrative of the book, or its main text. And so the results were relegated to notes. Maybe there’ll just be one sentence in the notes making some statement. But behind that statement was a lot of work. </p>\n<p>Many times I would have liked to have had “notes to the notes”. But I restrained myself from adding yet more to the project. Even though today I’ve sometimes found myself writing <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/after-100-years-can-we-finally-crack-posts-problem-of-tag-a-story-of-computational-irreducibility-and-more/'>even hundreds of pages</a> to expand on what in the NKS book is just a note, or <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>even a part of a note</a>.</p>\n<p>The 1990s spanned the time from the very beginning of the web to the point where the web had a few million pages of content. And by the later years of the project I was making use of the web whenever I could. But often the background facts I needed for the notes were so obscure that there was nothing coherent about them on the web—and in fact even today it’s common for the notes to the NKS book to be the best summaries to be found anywhere. </p>\n<p>I figured, though, that the existence of the web could at least “get me off the hook” on some work I might otherwise have had to do. For example, I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--citations-and-references/'>didn&#8217;t think there was any point in giving explicit citations to documents</a>. I made sure to include relevant names of people and topics. Then it seemed as if it’d be much better just to search for those on the web, and find all relevant documents, than for me to do all sorts of additional scholarship trying to pick out particular citations that then someone might have to go to a library to look up. </p>\n<h2 id='finishing-the-book'>Finishing the Book</h2>\n<p>I’m not sure when I could say that the finishing of the NKS book finally seemed in sight. We’d been making bound book mockups since early 1994. Looking through them now it’s interesting to see how different parts gradually came together. In July 1995, for example, there was already a section in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics/'>Chapter 9</a> on &ldquo;<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-6--the-nature-of-space'>The Nature of Space</a>&rdquo;, but it was followed by a section on the “Nature of Time” that was just a few rough notes. There’s a hiatus in mockups in 1996 (when I was working on Mathematica 3.0) but when the mockups pick up again in January 1997—now bound in three volumes—there’s a section on “The Nature of Time” containing an early (and probably not very good) idea based on <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-11--uniqueness-and-branching-in-time'>multiway systems</a> that I’d long since forgotten (later “The Nature of Time” section would be broken into different sections): </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='416' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Already in 1997 there’s a very rough skeleton of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Chapter 12</a>—with a fairly accurate collection of section headings, but just 18 pages of rather rough notes as content. Meanwhile, there’s a post-Chapter-12 “Epilog” that sprouts up, to be dropped only late in the project (see below). Chapter 12 begins to “bulk up” in late 1999, and in 2000 really “takes off”, for example adding the long section on &ldquo;<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-9--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations'>Implications for the Foundations of Mathematics</a>&rdquo;. At that point our rate of making book mockups began to pick up. We’d been indicating different mockups with dates and colored labeling (“the banana version”, etc.) But, finally, dated February 14, 2001, there’s a version labeled (in imitation of software release nomenclature) “Alpha 1”.</p>\n<p>And by then I was starting to make serious use of the machinery for doing large projects that we’d developed for so many years at Wolfram Research. The “NKS Project” started having project managers, build systems and internal websites (yes, with garish web colors of the time):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='574' height='421' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We’d had the source for the book in a source control system for several years, but as far as I was concerned the ultimate source for the book was my filesystem, and a specific set of directories that, yes, are still there in my filesystem all these years later: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='543' height='353' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Everything was laid out by chapter and section. <span class=\"input\">Text</span> contained the FrameMaker files. <span class=\"input\">Notebooks</span> contained the source notebooks for all the diagrams (with long-to-compute results pre-stored in <tt>Results</tt>):</p>\n<p></a></p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img4.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img4.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='418' height='402' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The workflow was that every diagram was created in Wolfram Language, then saved as an EPS file. (<a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/EPS.html\">EPS or &#8220;Encapsulated PostScript&#8221;</a> was a forerunner of <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/PDF.html\">PDF</a>.) And gradually, over the course of years, more and more EPS files were generated, here reconstructed in the order of their generation, starting around 1994:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/3-eps-array-@2x.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/3-eps-array-@2x.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='645' height='682' /></a></p>\n<p>In creating all these EPS files, there was lots of detailed tweaking done, for example in the exact (programmatically specified) sizes for the images given in the files.  We&#8217;d built up a whole diagram-generating system, with all sorts of detailed standards for sizings and spacings and so on. And several times—particularly as a result of discovering quirks in the printing process—we decided we had to change the standards we were using. This could have been a project-derailing disaster. But because we had everything programmatically set up in notebooks it was actually quite straightforward to just go through and automatically regenerate the thousand or so images in the book.</p>\n<p>Each EPS file that was generated was put in a <tt>Graphics</tt> directory, then imported (“by reference”) by FrameMaker into the appropriate page of the book. And the result was something that looked almost like the final NKS book. But there were two “little” wrinkles, that ended up leading to quite a bit of technical complexity.</p>\n<p>The first had to with the fragments of Wolfram Language code in the notes. At the time it was typical to show code in a simple monospaced font like Courier. But I thought this looked ugly—and threw away much of the effort I’d put into making the code as elegant and readable as possible. So I decided we needed a different code font, and in particular a proportionally spaced sans serif one. But there was a technical problem with this. Many of the characters we needed for the code were available in any reasonable font. But some characters were special to the Wolfram Language—or at least were characters that for example we’d been responsible for being included in the <a href='https://home.unicode.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Unicode standard</a>, and weren’t yet widely supported in fonts. </p>\n<p>And the result was that in addition to all the other complexities of producing the book we had to design our own font, just for the book:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img5.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='567' height='394' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But that wasn’t all. In Mathematica 3.0 we had invented an elaborate typesetting system which carefully formatted Wolfram Language code, breaking it into multiple lines if necessary. But how were we to weave that nicely formatted code into the layouts of pages in FrameMaker? In the end we <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--book-production-system/'>had to use Wolfram Language to do this</a>. The way this worked is that first we exported the whole book from FrameMaker in “Maker Interchange Format” (MIF). Then we parsed the resulting MIF file in Wolfram Language, in effect turning the whole book into a big symbolic expression. At that point we could use whatever Wolfram Language functionality we wanted, doing various pattern-matching-based transformations and typesetting each of the pieces of code. (We also handled various aspects of the index at this stage.) Then we took the symbolic expression, converted it to MIF, and imported it back into FrameMaker.</p>\n<p>In the end the production of the book was handled by an automated build script—just like the ones we used to build Mathematica (the full build log is 11 pages long):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img6.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='' width='' height='228' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='6_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But, OK, so by early 2001 we were well on the way to setting all these technical systems up. But there was more to do in “producing the book”—as indicated for example by the various column headings in the project management internal website. “Graphics regenerated” was about regenerating all the EPS files with the final standards for the book. “Microtweaking” was about making sure the placement of all the graphics was just right. Then there were various kinds of what in our company we call “document quality assurance”, or DQA—checking every detail of the document, from grammar and spelling to overall consistency and formatting. (And, yes, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--writing-style/'>developing a style guide that worked with my sometimes-nonstandard</a>—but I believe highly sensible!—writing conventions.)</p>\n<p>In addition to checking the form of the book, there was also the question of checking the content. Much of that—including extensive fact checking, etc.—had gone on throughout the development of the book. But near the end one more piece of checking had to do with the code that was included in the book itself. Our company has had a long history of sophisticated software quality assurance (“SQA”), and I applied that to the book—for example having extensive tests written for all the code in the book.</p>\n<p>Much like for software, once we reached the first “Alpha version” of the book we also started sending it out to external “alpha testers”—and got a modest but helpful collection of responses. We had several pages of instructions for our “testers” (that we called “readers” since, after all, this was a book):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img7.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img7.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='527' height='514' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After the “Alpha 1” version of the book in February 2001, there followed six more “Alpha” versions. In “Alpha 1” there were still XXXX’s scattered around the text, alignment and other issues in graphics—and some of the more “philosophical” sections in the book were just in note form, crossed out with big X’s in the printout. But in the course of 2001 all these issues got ironed out. And on January 15, 2002, I finished and dated the preface.</p>\n<p>Then on February 4, 2002, we produced the &#8220;Beta 1&#8221; version of the book—and began to make final preparations for its printing and publication. It had been a long road, illustrated by the sequence of intermediate versions we’d generated, but we were nearing the end:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img8.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img8.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='254' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img8_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='8_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='8_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id='the-joy-of-indexing'>The Joy of Indexing</h2>\n<p>I like indices, and the index to the NKS book—with its 14,967 entries—is my all-time favorite. In these times of ubiquitous full-text search one might think that a book index would just be a quaint relic of the past (and indeed some younger people don’t even seem to know that most books have indices!). But it definitely isn’t with the NKS book. And indeed when I want to find something in the book, the place I always turn first is the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/0/'>index (now online)</a>. </p>\n<p>I started creating the index to the NKS book in the spring of 1999, and finished it right before the final version of the book was produced in February 2002. I had already had the experience of creating indices to five editions of <em>The Mathematica Book</em>, and had seen the importance of those indices in people’s actual use of Mathematica. I had developed various <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--index/'>theories about how to make a good index</a>—which sometimes differed from conventional wisdom—but seemed to work rather well. </p>\n<p>A good index, I believe, should list whatever terms one might actually think of looking up, regardless of whether it’s those literal terms—or just synonyms for them—that appear in the text. If there’s a phrase (like “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=finite+automata'>finite automata</a>”) explicitly list it in all the ways people might think of it (“<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=finite+automata'>finite automata</a>”, “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=finite+automata'>automata, finite</a>”), rather than having some “theory” (that the users of the index are very unlikely to know) about how to list the phrase. And perhaps most important, generously include subterms, “subdividing” until each individual entry references at most a few pages. Because when you’re looking for something, you want to be able to zero in on a particular page, not be confronted with lots of “potentially relevant” pages. And well-chosen subterms immediately give a kind of pointillistic map of the coverage of some area.</p>\n<p>I’ve always enjoyed creating indices. For me it’s an interesting exercise in quickly organizing knowledge and identifying what’s important, as well as engaging in rapid “what are different ways to say that?” association. (And, yes, a similar skill is needed in linguistic curation for the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/natural-language-understanding/'>natural language understanding system</a> of <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>.) For the NKS book (and other indices) my basic strategy was to go through the book page by page, adding tags for index entries. But what about consistency? Did I just index “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Fig+leaves'>Fig leaves</a>” in one place, and somewhere else index “Leaves, fig” instead? We built Wolfram Language code to identify such issues. But eventually I just generated the alphabetical index, and read through it. And then had Wolfram Language code that could realign tags to correct the source of whatever fixes I made—which most often related to subterms.</p>\n<p>At first I broke the index into an ordinary “Index” and an “Index of Names”. But what counted as a “name”? Only a person’s name? Or also a place name? Or also “rule 30”? Within a couple of months I had combined everything into an “Index of words, names, concepts and systems”—which soon became headed just “Index” (with a pointer to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--index/'>a note about what was in it</a>). </p>\n<p>The final index is remarkably eclectic—reflecting of course the content of the book. After “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Field+theory+(Physics)'>Field theory (physics)</a>” comes “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Fields+(agricultural)'>Fields (agricultural)</a>”, followed by “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Fifths+(musical+chords)'>Fifths (musical chords)</a>” and so on: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section15img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section15img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='555' height='614' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section15img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the end the index—even printed as it was in 4 columns—ran to 80 pages (or more than 6% of the book). It was obviously a very useful index, and it could even be entertaining to read, not only for its eclectic jumps from one term to the next, but also for the unexpected terms that appeared. What’s “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Flash+photography'>Flash photography</a>” or “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Flint+arrowheads'>Flint arrowheads</a>” doing there, or “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/flo-fz/?search=Frogs'>Frogs</a>” for that matter? What do these terms have to do with a new kind of science? </p>\n<p>But for all its value, I was a bit concerned that the index might be so long that it finally made the book “too long”. Even without the index the book ran to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1197--historical-perspectives/'>1197 pages</a>. But why tell people, I thought, that the whole book is really 1280 pages, including the index? If the pages of the index were numbered, then one could immediately see the number of that last page. But why number the pages of an index? Nobody needs to refer to those pages by numbers; if anything, just use the alphabetized terms. So I decided just quietly to omit the page numbers of the index, so we could report the length of the book as 1192 pages.</p>\n<h2 id='how-to-publish-a-book'>How to Publish a Book</h2>\n<p>OK, so <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was going to be a book. But how was it going to be published? At the time I started writing <em>A New Kind of Science</em> in 1991 the second edition of <em>The Mathematica Book</em> had just been released, and its publisher (Addison-Wesley) seemed to be doing a good job with it. So it was natural to start talking about my new book with the same publisher. I was quite aware that Addison-Wesley was primarily a publisher of textbook-like books, and in fact the particular division of Addison-Wesley that had published <em>The Mathematica Book</em> was more oriented towards monographs and special projects. But the success of <em>The Mathematica Book</em> generated what seemed like good corporate interest in trying to publish my new book.</p>\n<p>But how would the details work? There were immediate questions even about printing the book. I knew the book would rely heavily on graphics which would need to be printed well. But to print them how they needed to be printed was expensive. So how would that work financially? (And at that point I didn’t yet even know that the book would also be more than a thousand pages long.) </p>\n<p>The basic business model of publishing tends to be: invest up front in making a book, then (hopefully) make money by selling the book. And for most authors, the book can’t happen without that up-front investment. But that wasn’t my situation. I didn’t need an advance to support myself while writing the book. I didn’t need someone to pay for the production of the book. And if necessary I could even make the investment myself to print the books. But what I thought I needed from a publisher was access to distribution channels. I needed someone to actually sell books to bookstores. I needed there to be a sales team that had relationships with bookstore chains, and that would do things like actually visit bookstores and get books into them.</p>\n<p>And in fact quite a lot of the early discussion about the publishing of the book centered around how salespeople would present it. How would the book be positioned relative to the well-known “popular science” books of the time? (That positioning would be key to the size of initial purchases bookstores might make.) What special ways might the salespeople make the book memorable? Could we get enough textile cone shells that the salespeople could drop one off at every bookstore they visited? (The answer, it was determined, was yes: in the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-8-7--collecting-shells/'>Philippines such shells were quite plentiful</a>.)</p>\n<p>But how exactly would the numbers work? Bookstores took a huge cut (often above 50%). And if the book was expensive to print, that didn’t leave much of a margin. At least at the time, the publishing industry was very much based on formulas. If you spend $x to print a book, you need to spend $y on marketing, and you pay the author $y (yes, same y) as an advance on royalties. For the author, the advance serves as a kind of guarantee of the publisher’s effort—since unless the book sells, the publisher just loses that money.</p>\n<p>Well, I most definitely wanted a guarantee that the publisher would put effort in. But I didn’t need or want an advance; I just wanted the publisher to put as much as possible into distribution. Around and around it went, trying to see how that might work. Exasperated, I found an expert on book deals. They didn’t seem to be able to figure it out either. And I began to think: perhaps I should go to a different publisher, maybe one more familiar with widely distributed books.</p>\n<p>It’s typical for authors not to interact directly with such publishers, but instead to go through an agent. In principle that allows authors not to have to exercise business savvy, and publishers not to be exposed to the foibles of authors. But I just wanted to make what—at least by tech industry standards—was a very simple deal. One agent I’d known for a while insisted that the key was to maximize the advance: “If the book earns out its advance [i.e. brings in more royalties from actual sales than were paid out up front], I haven’t done my job.” But that wasn’t my way of doing business. I wanted both sides in any deal to do well. </p>\n<p>Then there was the question of which publisher would be the right one. “Sell to the highest bidder”, was the typical advice. But what I cared about was successful book distribution, not how much a publisher might (perhaps foolishly) spend to get the book. Particularly at the time, it was a very clubby but strangely dysfunctional industry, full of belief in a kind of magic touch, but also full of stories of confusion and failure. Still, I thought that access to distribution channels was important enough to be worth navigating this.</p>\n<p>And by 1993 quite a bit of time had been spent on discussions about publishing the book. A particular, prominent New York publisher had been identified, and the process of negotiating a contract with them was underway. From a tech industry point of view it all seemed quite Victorian. It started from a printed (as in, on a printing press) 70-page contract that seemed to date from 20 years earlier. Though after not very long, essentially every single clause had been crossed out, and replaced by something different. </p>\n<p>An effort to “show what value they could bring” led to the incident about cover designs mentioned above. And then there was the story about printing, and printing costs. The terms of our potential deal made it quite important to know just how much it would cost to print the book. So to get a sense of that we got quotes from some of our usual printing vendors (and, yes, in those days before the web, a software company like ours did lots of printing). The publisher insisted that our quotes were too high—and that they could print the book much more cheaply. My team was skeptical. But at the center of this discussion was an important technical issue about how the book would actually be printed.</p>\n<p>Most widely distributed (&#8220;trade&#8221;) books are printed on so-called web presses—which are giant industrial machines that take paper from a roll and move it through at perhaps 30 mph. (The term “web” here refers to the “web of paper” on its path through the machine, not the subsequently invented World Wide Web.) A web press is a good way to print a just-read-the-words kind of book. But it doesn’t give one much control for pictures; if everything’s running through at high speed one can’t, for example, carefully inject more ink to deal with a big area of black on a specific page.</p>\n<p>And so if one wanted to print a more “art-quality” book one had to use a different approach: a sheet-fed press in which each collection of pages is “manually” set up to be printed separately on a large sheet of paper. Sheet-fed presses give one much more control—but they’re more expensive to operate. The printing quotes we’d got were for sheet-fed presses, because that was the only way we could see printing the book at the quality level we wanted. (I was sufficiently curious about the whole process that I went to watch a print run for something we were printing. In interacting with our potential publisher, I was rather disappointed to discover that none of the editorial team appeared to have ever actually seen anything being printed.)</p>\n<p>But in any case the publisher was claiming that they knew better than us, and that they could get the quality we needed on a web press, at a much lower price. They offered to run a test to prove it. We were again skeptical: to do the setup for a web press is an expensive process, and it makes no sense to do it for anything other than a real print run of thousands of books. But the publisher insisted they could do it. And our only admonition was “Don’t show us a result claiming it was made on a web press when it wasn’t!”. </p>\n<p>A few weeks went by. Back came the test. “You can’t be serious”, we said. “That’s a sheet from a sheet-fed press; we can see the characteristic registration marks!” I never quite figured out if they thought they could pull the wool over our eyes, or if this was just pure cluelessness. But for me it was basically the last straw. They came back and said “Why don’t we just refactor the contract and give you a really big advance?” “Nope”, I said “you’re profoundly missing the point! We’re done.” And that’s how—in 1995—we came to make the decision to publish <em>A New Kind of Science</em> “ourselves”.</p>\n<p>But when I say “ourselves” there was quite a bit more to that story. Back at the beginning of 1995 we were thinking about the upcoming third edition of <em>The Mathematica Book</em>, and realizing that we needed to re-jigger its publishing arrangements. And while the machinations with publishers about the NKS book had been a huge waste of time, they had helped me understand more about the publishing industry—and made me decide it was time for us to create our own publishing “imprint”, <a href='https://www.wolfram-media.com/'>Wolfram Media</a>.</p>\n<p><a href='https://web.archive.org/web/19961222151452/https://wolfram-media.com' target=_blank rel=noopener>Its website from 1996</a> (I never liked that logo!) highlights our first title—the co-published third edition of <em>The Mathematica Book</em>:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='484' height='588' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This was soon joined by other titles, like our <a href='https://www.wolfram-media.com/products/graphica1.html'>heavily illustrated<em> Graphica </em>books</a>. But it wasn’t until 1999 that I began to think more seriously about the final publishing of the NKS book. In the fall of 1999 we duly listed the book with the large bookstore chains and book distributors, as well as with the already-very-successful Amazon. And in late 2000 we started touting the book on our <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20001018202031/https://www.wolfram-media.com' target=_blank rel=noopener>now-more-attractive website</a> as “A major release coming soon&#8230;”:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='564' height='456' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Particularly in those days, the typical view was that most of the sales of a book would happen in the first few weeks after it was published. But—as we’ll discuss later—printing a book (and especially one like the NKS book) takes many weeks. So that creates a tricky situation, in which a publisher has to make a high-stakes decision about how many books to print at the beginning. Print too few books and at least for a time, you won’t be able to fill orders, and you’ll lose out on the initial sales peak. Print too many books and you’ll be left with an inventory of unsold books—though the more books you print in a single print run, the more you’ll spread the initial setup cost over more books, and the lower the cost of each individual book will be.</p>\n<p>Bookstores were also an important part of the picture. Books were at the time still predominantly bought through people physically browsing at bookstores. So the more copies of a book a bookstore had, the more likely it was that someone would see it there, and buy it. And all this added up to a big focus of publishing being on the size of the initial orders that bookstores made.</p>\n<p>How was that determined? Mostly it was up to the buyers at bookstores and bookstore chains: they had to understand enough about a book to make an accurate prediction of how many they’d be able to sell. There was a complicated dance through which publishers signaled their expectations, saying for example “X copy initial print run”, “X-city promotional tour”, “$X promotional budget”. But in the end it was a very person-to-person sales process, often done by traveling-around-the-country salespeople who’d developed relationships with book buyers over the course of many years.</p>\n<p>How were we going to handle this? It certainly helped that by late 2000 there were starting to be <a href='https://www.forbes.com/asap/2000/1127/162.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>lengthy news articles</a> anticipating the book. And it also helped that one could see that the book was gaining momentum on Amazon. But would a sales manager we had who was used to selling software be able to sell books? At least in this case the answer was yes, and by the end of 2001 there were starting to be substantial orders from bookstores.</p>\n<p>By the time I finished writing the book at the beginning of 2002 we were in full “book-publishing” mode. There were still lots of issues to resolve. How would we handle distribution outside the US? (We’d actually had a UK co-publisher lined up but we eventually gave up on them.) How would we reach the full range of independent bookstores? And so on. Looking at my archives I find mail from April 2002 in which I was contacting Jeff Bezos about a practical issue with Amazon; Jeff responded that he “couldn’t wait to read [the book]”, noting that “For a serious book like yours, we often account for a substantial fraction of sales.” He was right—and in fact the NKS book would reach the #1 bestseller slot on Amazon.</p>\n<p>By the beginning of 2002 we’d had a design for the front cover of the NKS book for six years. But what about the back cover? It’s traditional to put quotes (“blurbs”) on the backs of books that people will browse in bookstores. So, in February 2002 we sent a few draft copies of the book to people we thought might give us interesting quotes. Probably the most charming response was Arthur C. Clarke’s report of the delivery of the book to his house in Sri Lanka:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='444' height='191' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A few days later, he emailed again “Well, I have <looked> at (almost) every page and am still in a state of shock.

My friend HAL is very sorry he hadn’t thought of them first&#8230;”</p>\n<p>Other quotes came in too. At his request, I’d sent <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2011/10/steve-jobs-a-few-memories/'>Steve Jobs</a> a copy of the book—and I asked if he’d like to provide a quote. He responded that he thought I really shouldn’t have quotes on the back of the book. “Isaac Newton didn’t have quotes; nor should you.” And, yes, Steve had a point. I was trying to write a book that would have long-term value; it didn’t really make sense to have moment-of-publication quotes printed on it.</p>\n<p>So—feeling bad for having solicited quotes in the first place—we dropped them from the back cover, instead just putting <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/reference/backcoverimages/'>images from the book that we thought would intrigue people</a>:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img4.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='325' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Still, my team did use Arthur C.

But there’s a standard method for achieving the appearance of gray, which is to use halftoning, based essentially on an array of dots of different sizes.

That was a difficult question, and was only answered by lots of print testing. One of the main points was: even if you effectively specify dots of a certain size, what will be the actual sizes of dots formed when the ink is absorbed into the paper? And similarly: will the ink from black cells spread into the area of the gray line you’re trying to print between them? In printing it’s typical to talk about “dot gain”. If you think you’re setting up dots to give a certain gray level, what will be the actual gray level you’ll get when those dots are made of ink on paper?</p>\n<p>We were constantly testing things like this, with different printing technology, different paper and so on:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img14.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img14.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='538' height='389' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img14_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='14_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='14_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We used a “densitometer” (yes, this was before modern digital cameras) to measure the actual gray level, and deduce the dot gain function.

We considered effectively setting up our own <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-7--halftoning/'>dot placement algorithm</a>, that would for example better align with cells in something like a cellular automaton. But tests didn’t show particularly good behavior, and we soon reverted to considering the “traditional approach”, though with various kinds of tweaking. </p>\n<p>Should the halftone dots be round, or elliptical? What should the angle of the array of dots be (it definitely needed to avoid horizontal and vertical directions)?

Most of the complexity we’ve just been discussing came in converting that PostScript to the image that would actually be printed.

Given that one already has film, one can make the plate essentially photographically—more or less the same way microprocessor layouts and many other things are made. But by the beginning of the 2000s, there was a new technology: direct-to-plate printing, in which an (ultraviolet) laser directly etches the plate (a kind of much-higher-resolution “plate analog” of what a laser printer does). And in order to get the very crispest results, direct-to-plate printing was what we used for the NKS book.</p>\n<p>What’s the actual setup for printing? In the sheet-fed approach that we were using, one combines multiple pages (in our case 8) as a “signature” to be printed from a single plate onto a single piece of paper.

If the paper is glossy, ink won’t spread on it, and it’s easier to get things crisp. But adding a glossy coating to paper makes the paper heavier and thicker, and we quickly determined that it wasn’t going to be practical to print the NKS book on glossy paper. Back in the 1980s it had become quite popular to print books on paper that looked good at first, but after a few years would turn yellow and disintegrate. And to avoid that, we knew we needed acid-free paper.</p>\n<p>Any particular kind of paper will come in different “weights”, or thicknesses. And the thicker the paper is, the more opaque it will be, and the less see-through the pages of the book will be—but also the thicker the book will be with a given number of pages. At the beginning we didn’t know how long the NKS book would be, and we were looking at comparatively thick papers; by the end we were trying to use paper that was as thin as possible.</p>\n<p>Back in 1993 we&#8217;d identified Finch Opaque as a possible type of paper. In 1995 our paper rep suggested as an alternative Finch VHF (“Very High Finish”)—which was very smooth, and was quite bright white. But normally this paper was used in very thick pages. Still, it was possible for the paper mill to produce thinner versions as well. We studied the possibilities, and eventually decided that a 50-lb version (i.e. with the paper weighing 50 lbs per 500 uncut sheets) would be the best compromise between bulk and opacity. So 50-lb Finch VHF paper is what the NKS book is printed on.</p>\n<p>Paper, of course, is made from trees. And as I’ll explain below, during the publishing of the NKS book, I became quite aware of the physical location of the trees from which the paper for the NKS book was made: they were in upstate New York (in the Adirondacks). At the time, though, I didn’t know more details about the trees. But a few years ago I learned that they were <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=eastern+hemlock'>eastern hemlock trees</a>. And it turns out that these coniferous trees are unusual in having long fibers—which is what allows the paper to be as smooth as it is. Talking about hemlock makes one think of Socrates. But no, hemlock the poison comes from the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=poison+hemlock'>&#8220;poison hemlock&#8221; plant</a> (<em><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Conium+maculatum'>Conium maculatum</a></em>), which is unrelated to <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=tsuga'>hemlock trees</a> (which didn’t grow in Europe and seem to have gotten their hemlock name only fairly recently, and for rather tenuous reasons). So, no, the NKS book is not poisonous!</p>\n<p>Once signatures are printed, the next thing is that the signatures have to be folded and cut—in the end forming little booklet-like objects. And then comes the final step: binding these pieces together into the finished book. By the mid-1990s <em>The Mathematica Book</em> had given us quite a bit of experience with the binding of “big books”—and it wasn’t good. Many copies of multiple versions of <em>The Mathematica Book</em> (yes, not printed by us) had basically self-destructed in the hands of customers. </p>\n<p>How were we going to be sure this wouldn’t happen for the NKS book? First, many books—including some versions of <em>The Mathematica Book</em>—were basically “bound” by just gluing the signatures into the “case” of the book (with little fake threads added at the ends, for effect). But to robustly bind a big book one really has to actually sew the signatures to the case, and a standard way to do this is what’s called Smythe sewing. And that’s what we determined to use for the NKS book.</p>\n<p>Still, we wanted to test things. So we sent books to a book-testing lab, where the books were “tumbled” inside a steel container, 1200 times per hour, “impacting the tail, binding edge, head and face” of each book 4800 times per hour. After 1 hour, the lab reported “spine tight and intact”. After 2 hours “text block detached from cover”. But that’s basically only after doing the equivalent of dropping the book thousands of times!</p>\n<p>As we approached the final printing of the NKS book, there were other decisions to be made. The <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--endpapers/'>endpapers</a> were going to have a rule 30 pattern printed on them. But what color should they be? We considered several, picking the goldenrod in the end (and somehow that color now seems to have become the standard for the endpapers of all books I write):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img22.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img22.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='283' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img22_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='22_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='22_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the late stages of writing the NKS book one of the big concerns was just how long the book would eventually be. We’d figured out the paper, the binding, and so on. And there was one hard constraint: the binding machines that we were going to use could only bind a book up to a certain thickness. With our specs the limit was 80 signatures—or 1280 pages. The main text clocked in at 1197 pages; with front matter, etc. that was 1213 pages. But then there was the index. And I was writing a very extensive index, that threatened to overrun our absolute maximum page count. We formatted the index in 4 columns as small and tight as we thought we could. And in the end it came in just under the wire: the book was 1280 pages, with not a single page to spare. (Somewhat simplifying the story, I’ve sometimes said that after a decade of work on the NKS book, I had to stop because otherwise I was going to have a book that was too long to bind!) </p>\n<h2 id='the-great-printing-adventure'>The Great Printing Adventure</h2>\n<p>High-quality printing of the kind needed for the NKS book was then—and is now—often done in the Far East. But anticipating that we might need to reprint the book fairly quickly we didn’t consider that an option; it would just take too long to transport books by boat across the Pacific. And conveniently enough, we determined that there was a cost-effective North American alternative: print the book in Canada. And so it was that we chose a printer in Winnipeg, Canada, to print the NKS book.</p>\n<p>On February 7, 2002, the files for the book (which were now PDF, not pure PostScript) were transferred (via FTP) to the printer’s computers—a process which took a mere 90 minutes. (Well, it had to be done twice, because of an initial glitch.) But then the next step was to produce “proofs” for the book. In traditional printing, where printing plates were made from film, one could produce the film first, then make a photographic print of this, check it, and only then make the plates. But we were going to be making plates directly. So for us, “proofing” was a more digital process, that involved using a separate device from the one that would actually make the plates. Supposedly, though, “the bits were the bits”, and the results would be the same.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of days, the printer had the first proofs made, and a few issues were seen—such as white labels inside black cells simply disappearing. The cause was subtle, though didn’t take a long time to find. Some 3D graphics in the book had generated color PostScript—and in all our tests so far these had just automatically been converted to grayscale. But now the presence of color primitives had made the RIP that was converting from PostScript change its settings—and cause other problems. But soon that was worked around, and generating proofs continued. </p>\n<p>By February 14 we had the first batch of proofs in our hands, and my team and I went to work going through them.

But this problem at least we could understand—and it was our fault. Instead of setting the thickness of the arrow in some absolute way, we’d just set it to be “1 pixel”—which in the final printing was too thin to see.</p>\n<p>But what about the other glitches? What were they? And might there be more of them?</p>\n<p>The signatures from the book were ready to start being bound. Should we hold off and reprint the signatures where we’d found glitches? Could we do this without blowing our (already very tight) schedule? Could we even get enough extra paper in time? My team was adamant that we should try to fix the glitches, saying that otherwise they would “nag at us forever”. But I wanted first to see if we could characterize the bug better.</p>\n<p>We knew it was associated with the rendering of the <a href='https://www.amazon.com/PostScript-Language-Reference-Manual-ADOBE/dp/0201101742' target=_blank rel=noopener>PostScript</a> <span class=\"input\">image</span> operator. Even though PostScript is basically a vector graphics description language, the <span class=\"input\">image</span> operator allows one to include bitmaps. Normally these bitmaps are used to represent things like photographs, and have tiny (“few-pixel”) cells. But in the cellular-automaton-like images we were having trouble with, the cells were much larger; in the case of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p157--continuous-cellular-automata/'>page 157</a>, for example, each one was roughly 75 of the final 2400-dpi pixels across. This was absolutely something the <span class=\"input\">image</span> operator was set up to handle. But somehow something was going wrong.</p>\n<p>And what was particularly surprising is that it seemed as if the problem was happening after the PostScript was converted to a <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/TIFF.html'>TIFF</a>. Could it perhaps be in the driver for both the proofing and the final plate production system? Time was short, and we needed to make a decision about what to do.</p>\n<p>I fired off an email to the CEO of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creo_(company)' target=_blank rel=noopener>company that made the direct-to-plate system</a>, saying: &#8220;We of course do not know the details of your software and hardware systems. However, we have done a little investigation. It appears that the data &#8230; in the case of this image is a bilevel TIFF with <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p565/'>LZW compression</a>. We speculate that the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1072a/'>LZW dictionary</a> contains something close to the actual squares seen in the image, and that somehow pointers to dictionary entries are being corrupted or are not being used correctly in the decompression of the TIFF. The TIFF experts at my company say they have never seen anything like this in developing software based on standard imaging libraries, making us suspect that it may be some kind of buffering or motion optimization bug associated with your actual hardware driver.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The CEO of what was by then quite a large company had personally designed the original hardware, and when we talked by phone he speculated that what we were seeing might be some kind of obscure mechanical issue with the hardware. But his chief of software soon sent mail explaining that “of the several hundred thousand books that go through [their system] each year, there are a couple that have imaging problems like this.” But, he added, “Usually they are books about halftone screening algorithms, which cause an almost-recursive problem&#8230;”. He said the specific issue we were having looked like a “difficult to reproduce problem we have known about for some time but is transient enough that re-imaging the same file can ‘correct’ the problem.” He added that: “Our hypothesis is that it is related to a memory access error in the RIP that manifests only at low-memory conditions, or after many allocation/deallocation cycles of RAM blocks. The particular code path is not one we have source-code access to, and is rumored to be many years old, so not many people on earth are prepared to make substantive changes to it.”</p>\n<p>OK, so what next? The RIP had been developed by Adobe, creators of PostScript. So I emailed <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=john+warnock'>John Warnock</a>, co-founder of Adobe, who I’d met at quite a few software-industry get-togethers before my NKS-book “hermit period”. I commented that “One thing that’s peculiar (at least without knowing how the RIP works) is that the glitch involves overwriting of a column &#8230; even though scanning the underlying PostScript would involve going from one row to the next.” Warnock responded helpfully, copying his team, though saying (in an echo of what we’d already heard) “I don’t know who does PostScript stuff anymore”. </p>\n<p>Well, that seemed like pretty much the end of the road. So we decided to assume that the glitches we’d found were the only ones, and—for perfection’s sake—we’d reprint those signatures, which by that point the printer had helpfully said they could do without blowing the schedule.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, Adobe delivered a new version of the RIP, in which they believed the bug had been fixed, noting that there had been significant code cleanup, and they were now using a newer version of the C++ compiler. Meanwhile, I’d realized another issue: a variety of magazines had requested files from us to be able to print high-resolution images from the book. Would they end up using the same software pipeline, and potentially have the same problem? A general release of any fix was still quite far away. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, with the two “glitch” signatures reprinted, the book was off to be bound. The cover had also been printed, now making use of all four stations of the presses. Under a microscope the characteristic <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1078b/'>&#8220;rosettes&#8221; of 4-color printing</a> are visible:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img17.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img17.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='366' height='291' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img17_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='17_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='17_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Actually, the book in a sense has two covers: a detachable dust jacket (including a dated picture of me!) and a “permanent” hard cover—which I think looks very nice:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/709577304?h=1fb80366b2\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>But as I was just now looking back through my archives I found an email from February 2002, expressing concerns about the fading of ink on the cover. The printer assured us that we had “nothing to worry about unless the books were exposed to direct sunlight for an extended amount of time.” But then they added “The reds and yellows will fade faster that the other pigments, but this is not something that would be noticeable in the first 20–40 years.” Well, it’s now been 20 years, and it so happens that I have a copy of the NKS book that’s been exposed to sunlight for much of that time—and look what’s happened to its spine, right on cue:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img19.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img19.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='319' height='165' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img19_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='19_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='19_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I received a first, hand-bound, finished NKS book on April 22. And very soon books were on their way to bookstores and distribution centers. And people were ordering the book—in large numbers. And that meant that the books we’d printed so far weren’t going to be enough. And on May 12—two days before the May 14 official publication date of the book—another print run was started. </p>\n<p>Fortunately it was possible to reuse the plates from the first print run (well, apart from the one which said “First printing”), so we didn’t have to worry about new glitches showing up. </p>\n<p>But once the book was published, demand continued to be strong, and on June 4 we needed to do another print run. And this time new plates had to be made. Were there going to be new glitches? We decided we should check the plates before we started printing—so we sent the person who’d caught the glitches before on a trip to Canada. Turns out the bug hadn’t yet been fixed, and there it was again on pages <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p583--visual-perception/'>583</a> and <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p979--the-phenomenon-of-continuity/'>979</a>. </p>\n<p>Some time later I heard that the bug was finally found and fixed, and had been lurking in the implementation of the PostScript <span class=\"input\">image</span> operator for well over a decade. Yes, software is hard. And computational irreducibility is rampant. But in the years since the NKS book was published, no other weird glitches like this have ever shown up. Or at least nobody has ever told us about any.</p>\n<p>But as I was writing this, I wondered: what became of that other glitch that was in the first printing—the one with the thin arrows that was our fault? I opened an NKS book from my desk. No problem.

We’d just initiated a second printing, which would be finished in a few weeks. But based on apparent demand that printing wasn’t going to be sufficient. And in fact a single bookstore chain had just offered to buy the whole second printing. We initiated a third printing on June 4, and then a fourth on June 18. But if we were going to keep the momentum of sales, we knew we had to keep feeding books into the channel.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s where things got difficult again. It just didn&#8217;t seem possible to get enough books, quickly enough. But after everything we’d done to this point, I wasn’t going to be stopped here. And I went into full “hands-on CEO” mode, trying to see how to juggle logistics to make things work. </p>\n<p>The paper mill was in Glens Falls, NY. Once the paper had been made, it had to be trucked 2752 km to the printer in Winnipeg, Canada. Then the finished “book blocks” had to go 2225 km to the bindery in Toronto (or maybe there was an alternative bindery in Portland, OR, 2400 km away). And finally the bound books had to come to our warehouse in Illinois, or go directly to book distribution centers. </p>\n<p>My archives contain a diagram I made trying to see how to connect these things together, particularly in view of the impending Canada Day holiday on July 1:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section19img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section19img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='566' height='524' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section19img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I have pages and pages of notes, with details of ink drying times (1 day), sheets of paper per skid (20,000), people needed per shift, and so on. But in the end we made it; with a lot of people’s help, we got the books finished on time—and put on trucks, some of which were going to the distribution center for a major bookstore chain. </p>\n<p>The trucks arrived. But then we heard nothing. Bookstores were reporting being out of stock. What was going on? At last it was figured out: multiple truckloads of books had somehow been misplaced at the distribution center. (How do you lose something that big?) And, yes, some sales momentum was lost. And so we didn’t peak as high on bestseller lists as we might. Though hopefully in the end everyone who wanted an NKS book got one, no doubt oblivious to the logistical challenges involved in getting it to them. </p>\n<h2 id='the-lost-epilog,-and-other-outtakes-from-the-book'>The Lost Epilog, and Other Outtakes from the Book</h2>\n<p>For more than a decade I basically poured everything I was doing into the NKS book. Well, at least that’s the way I remember it. But going through my archives now, I realize I did quite a bit that never made it into the final NKS book. Particularly from the early years of the project, there are endless photographs—and investigations—of examples of complexity in nature, which never made it into <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems/'>Chapter 8</a>. There are also lots of additional results about specific systems from the computational universe—as well as lots of details about history—that could have been notes to the notes, except I didn’t have those.</p>\n<p>Something I didn’t remember is that in 1999—as the book was nearing completion—I considered adding a pictorial “Quick Summary” at the front of the book, here in draft form:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/20.01.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='584' height='680' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I’m not sure if this would have been a good idea, but in the end it effectively got replaced by the textual “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-1--the-foundations-for-a-new-kind-of-science#sect-1-1--an-outline-of-basic-ideas'>An Outline of Basic Ideas</a>” that appears at the very beginning of the book.

But it’s interesting to see how what I jotted down more than 20 years ago has actually panned out. And in fact I think much of it is surprisingly close to the mark. Plenty of small extensions did indeed get made in the first few years, with larger ones—both in studying abstract systems and in building practical models—coming later. (One notable extension was the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2007/10/the-prize-is-won-the-simplest-universal-turing-machine-is-proved/'>2,3 Turing machine universality proof</a> at year 5, stimulated by our <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/'>2,3 Turing Machine Prize</a>.) </p>\n<p>How about “major new directions”? We’re remarkably “on cue” there. At year 18 was our <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/'>Physics Project</a>, and from that has emerged the whole <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>, which I consider to be the next major direction building on the ideas of the NKS book. I have to say that when I wrote down these expectations 20+ years ago, I didn’t imagine that I would personally be involved in the “major new direction” I mentioned—but, unexpected as it has been, I feel very fortunate that that’s the way it’s worked out. </p>\n<p>What about technology? Already at year 7 <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a> was in many ways a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2009/05/7-years-of-nks-and-its-first-killer-app/'>major &#8220;philosophical spinoff&#8221;</a> of the NKS book. And although one doesn’t know its detailed origins, the proof-of-work concept of bitcoin (which also first appeared at year 7) has fundamental connections to the idea of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a>. Meanwhile, the general methodology of searching the computational universe for useful programs is something that has continued to grow. And although the details are more complicated, the whole notion of deep learning in neural nets <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/#machine-learning-and-the-neural-net-renaissance'>can also be thought of as related</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s very hard to assess just what’s happened in “becoming a part of everyday thought”—though it’s been wonderful over the years to run into so many people who’ve told me how much the NKS book affected their way of thinking about things. But my impression is that—despite quite a few specific applications—the truly widespread absorption of ideas like computational irreducibility and their implications is a bit “behind schedule”, though definitely now building well.

But in the course of working on the book there was definitely quite a bit of more ephemeral material. Some was preserved in my computer filesystem. But some was printed out and discarded, and some was simply handwritten. But all these years I’ve kept archive boxes of that material.</p>\n<p>Some of those boxes have now been sealed for nearly 30 years. But I thought it’d be interesting to see what they contain. So I pulled out a box labeled 6/93–10/93. It’s slightly the worse for wear after all these years, but what’s inside is well preserved.

And I can’t help but wonder what gems there may be in all these “outtakes” from the NKS book.

In modern times there’d be that moment of “making things live” (as there was, for example, for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEkxX-M-VRc\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfram|Alpha in 2009</a>). But back then there’d been a big rush to get books to bookstores, but on the actual “day of publication” there wasn’t much for me to do.</p>\n<p>It had been a long journey getting to this point, though, and for example the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/pxii--preface/'>acknowledgements at the front of the book</a> listed 376 people who’d helped in one way or another over the decade devoted to writing the book, or in the years beforehand. But in terms of the physical production of the book one clue about what had been involved could be found on the very last page—<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/colophon/'>its “Colophon</a>&rdquo;:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img1.png\"><img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='397' height='527' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And, yes, as I’ve explained here, there was quite a story behind the simple paragraph: “The book was printed on 50-pound Finch VHF paper on a sheet-fed press.

The computational universe, of course, will be the same forever. And those pictures of the behavior of simple computational systems that occur throughout the book share the kind of fundamental timelessness that pictures of geometric constructions from antiquity do.</p>\n<p>Of course, I knew that some things in the book would &#8220;date&#8221;, most notably my references to technology—as I warned in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--technology-references/'>one of the &#8220;General Notes&#8221; at the back of the book</a> (though actually, 20 years later, notwithstanding “electronic address books” from <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p643--the-phenomenon-of-universality/'>page 643</a>, and MP3 on <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1080--auditory-perception/'>page 1080</a> being described as a “recent” format, surprisingly little has yet changed): </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img14.png\"><img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img14.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='428' height='196' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img14_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='14_out'>&#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='14_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>What about mistakes? For 20 years we’ve meticulously tracked them. And I think it’s fair to say that all the careful checking we did originally really paid off, because in all the text and pictures in the book remarkably few errors have been found. For example, here’s the list of everything in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-4--systems-based-on-numbers/'>Chapter 4</a>, indicating a few errors that were fixed in early printings—and a couple that remain, and that we are now fixing online:</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img15.png\"><img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img15.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='210' /></a></p>\n<p>People ask me if there’ll be a second edition of the NKS book. I say no. Yes, there are gradually starting to be more things one can say—and in the past couple of years the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a> and the whole <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> has added significantly more. But there’s nothing wrong with what’s in the NKS book. It remains as valid and coherent as it was 20 years ago. And any “second-edition surgery” would run the risk of degrading its crispness and integrity—and detract from its unique perspective of presenting science at the time of its discovery. </p>\n<p>But, OK, so all those NKS books that were printed on all those tons of paper from hemlock trees 20 years ago: what happened to them? Looking on the web today, one can find a few out there in the wild, sitting on bookshelves alongside a remarkable variety of other books:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img16.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img16.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='567' height='466' /></a></p>\n<p>I myself have many NKS books on my shelves (though admittedly a few more as convenient 2.5-inch “filler bookends”). And—at least when I’m in a “science phase”—I find myself using the online NKS book (if not a physical book) all the time, to see an example of some remarkable phenomenon in the computational universe, or to remind myself of some elaborate explanation or result that I put so much effort into finding all those years ago.</p>\n<p>I consider the NKS book one the great achievements of my life—as well as one of the great “stepping-stone” points in my life, that was made possible by what I’d done before, and that in turn has made possible what I’ve done since. Twenty years later it’s interesting to think back—as I’ve done here—on just what it took to produce the NKS book, and how all those individual steps that I worked so hard on for a decade came together to make the whole that is the NKS book. </p>\n<p>To me it’s a satisfying and inspiring story of what can be achieved with clear vision, sustained effort and a willingness to go where discoveries lead. And as I reflect on achievements of the past it makes me all the more enthusiastic about what’s now possible—and why it’s worth putting great effort today into what we can now build for the future. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kind-Science-Twentieth-Anniversary-Collection/dp/1579550568/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GL9BLLSBPEAF&#038;keywords=new+kind+of+science+20th&#038;qid=1652459905&#038;s=books&#038;sprefix=new+kind+of+science+20th%2Cstripbooks%2C80&#038;sr=1-1\" target='blank'><img class=\"\" title=\"A New Kind of Science Twentieth Anniversary Collection\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw-writing-banner-ad.png\" alt=\"A New Kind of Science Twentieth Anniversary Collection\" width=\"620\" height=\"185\" /></a></p>\n",
