    "media:description": "This video is part of a raw unedited lecture series about traditional mechanisms and mechanical systems given by Professor Jonathan Hopkins at UCLA. Specifically, Topic 6 reviews the principles of energy and power in the context of traditional mechanisms. The power equation uses the kinematic coefficients of a mechanism to calculate all external loads imparted onto the mechanism. The equation considers the mechanism’s kinetic energy, gravitation and elastic strain energy, and heat dissipation generated from contact friction and dashpot dampers. The power equation is not capable of calculating internal forces and moments.\n\nAdditional course resources are posted to Professor Hopkins’ website: \nwww.flexible.seas.ucla.edu\n\nDisclaimer: \nResponsibility for the content of this video is my own.
