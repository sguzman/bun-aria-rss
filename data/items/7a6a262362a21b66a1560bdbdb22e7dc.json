  "description": "<p>“And when you are lucky enough as a writer to have your book be found, and then have it be a source of someone's passion, someone who is not normally spoken to by the book publishing industry, who then with generosity and real passion, finds a way to tell other people about it, you cannot get luckier than that.” Hanya Yanagihara’s second novel, <em>A Little Life</em> was already a word-of-mouth must read, a finalist for the Man Booker Prize and the National Book Award and winner of the Kirkus Prize when #Booktok introduced Jude & Co. to a new set of readers and kicked the book’s sales into the stratosphere. Hanya’s following up her massive hit with <em>To Paradise</em>, a story of love and ambition, loneliness and freedom, that cuts across time and reimagined Americas. Hanya joins us on the show to talk about Hawaii and New York, her admiration for the novels of Kazuo Ishiguro, what paradise means for her characters, the helix of history, and more. Featured Books: <em>To Paradise</em> and <em>A Little Life</em> by Hanya Yanagihara, <em>The Remains of the Day</em> and <em>Never Let Me Go</em> by Kazuo Ishiguro, <em>The Hours</em> by Michael Cunningham, and <em>Cloud Atlas</em> by David Mitchell. Poured Over is produced and hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang. Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays (with occasional bonus eps on Saturdays).</p>",
