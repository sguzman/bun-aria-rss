  "description": "The Enfield Poltergeist. August 1977. Enfield, England. Peggy Hodgson contacts the police after furniture in her children's bedroom appears to move on its own. A series of witnesses and investigators over the next year would report seeing a child levitate, toys thrown by an unseen force, an unsettling, raspy voice coming from a young girl, as well as other strange phenomena. Things get creepier at the Enfield house when the voice seems to confirm that it belongs to a man who had died in the home prior to Peggy and her children moving in. Was a poltergeist responsible for the mischief in the house? Images and audio collected during periods of activity seem to support such a possibility. Join us as we attempt to tear the sheet off of the mystery known as the Enfield Poltergeist.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
