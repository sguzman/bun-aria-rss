  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, you are now living through the greatest scandal in American history. The effort by President Obama, his administration, Hillary’s campaign, and the DNC to influence our elections is even more than the Russians. There are now more text messages between Peter Strzok and Susan Page which Rod Rosenstein sought to cover up. The texts showed that Strzok had a personal relationship with the FISA court judge in the Mike Flynn case. These FISA court judges have a lot to answer for and they must explain why they approved their applications. Also, Dr. Peter Pry, EMP Task Force on National and Homeland Security executive director, calls in to discuss the Russians attacking our energy grid, which is an act of war. If the power grid goes down there will be widespread death in this country. Later, our Republican congress is scheming to put in place a massive internet sales tax scheme. They are preparing to fully fund planned parenthood, extend Obama’s executive amnesty and preparing, under Obamacare, to bailout insurance companies. This is why the Republicans will get hurt in November’s election. Finally, Marc Morano calls in to discuss his new book, the politically incorrect guide to climate change.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
