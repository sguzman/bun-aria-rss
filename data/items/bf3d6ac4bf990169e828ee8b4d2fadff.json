  "description": "Will Brinson, Nick Kostos, Pete Prisco and Jason La Canfora recap all you need to know from Week 4 in the NFL. The guys discuss the 0-4 Browns potentially cleaning house again at the end of the season (4:27), if the Patriots should consider trading backup QB Jimmy Garoppolo for defensive help (5:35), and the Panthers impressive victory over New England (10:56). They also break down standout performances from young quarterbacks' Jared Goff, who led the Rams to a road win in Dallas (13:38), and DeShaun Watson, who lit up the statsheet in the Texans dismantling of Tennesse (23:55). Will, Nick, Pete and Jason cover much more, including the still winless Giants and Ben McAdoo's job (33:57) and injuries to Derek Carr, Marcus Mariota and Dalvin Cook (44:42).\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
