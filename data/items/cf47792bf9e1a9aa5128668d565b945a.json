  "description": "<p>Oh boy. Did you know that some people think that Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears, Beyoncé, Eminem, some guy named Donald Marshall, and many other celebrities have been cloned? There are conspiracies revolving around underground cloning centers created and run by illuminati global elites who sometimes kill celebrities who don't follow orders and then clone them to keep making music money mostly. Donny and his clones have been busy writing hit songs since before he was five years old. Most of the music you enjoy was written by clones. We look into so much crazy today. We also look into the actual science of cloning and explain what has been done clone-wise, and what's possible. We break down the difference between therapeutic cloning, reproductive cloning, and more. So much cloning! If you don't enjoy this episode, I hope your clone does. </p>\n<p>We're donating $15,000 this month to The Wildland Firefighter Foundation.
