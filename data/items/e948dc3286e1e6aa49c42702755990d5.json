  "description": "In The Holocaust Averted: An Alternate History of American Jewry, 1938-1967 (Rutgers University Press, 2015), Jeffrey S. Gurock, the Libby M. Klaperman Professor of Jewish History at Yeshiva University, imagines an alternate history of American Jewry had there been no Holocaust.  Contributing to the increasingly popular genre of alternate history, Gurock uses historical sources to create a plausible, but fictional, narrative about mid-century American Jews, their relationship with their coreligionists in Europe and Israel, and their acceptance in American society (or lack thereof).   Each chapter in Gurock’s tale ends a short section that describes what really happened.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
