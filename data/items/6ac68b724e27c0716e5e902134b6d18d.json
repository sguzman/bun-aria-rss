  "description": "<p>My favorite guest returns, Bob Gimlin. This is going to be a laid back show where I just let Bob speak. We will be discussing the time Bob and Roger Patterson found the Ape Canyon Cabin that was attack. A Ape Canyon is a gorge along the edge of the Plains of Abraham, on the southeast shoulder of Mount St. Helens in the state of Washington. The gorge narrows to as close as eight feet (2.5 m) at one point. The name alludes to a reported encounter with several “apemen” in 1924. I will also be asking Bob if he has ever seen anything strange in the woods, outside of Sasquatch. His answer might surprise you. He will also be giving us an update on the drama from the 50th anniversary of the Patterson/Gimlin film.   https://www.bobgimlin.net/</p>",
