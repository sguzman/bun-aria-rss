  "description": "<p>\n    Backtracking step-size strategies (also known as adaptive step-size or approximate line-search) that set the step-size based on a sufficient decrease condition are the standard way to set the step-size on gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. However, these techniques are much less common for <a href=\"/blog/2018/notes-on-the-frank-wolfe-algorithm-part-i/\">Frank-Wolfe-like</a> algorithms. In this blog post I â€¦</p>",
