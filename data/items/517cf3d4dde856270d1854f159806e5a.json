  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">In the United States, nearly 70% of our citizens take prescription drugs. The FDA, or Food & Drug Administration, is responsible for evaluating the safety and efficacy of many products, including prescription drugs. While one might assume that a product approved by the FDA has been carefully and strictly tested, that’s not always the case.</p> <p class=\"p1\">On today’s show, we’re diving into a history and overview of the US Food & Drug Administration, including its origins, roles, funding, and overall efficacy. You’re going to learn about how drugs are tested and approved, what you need to know about adverse effects from pharmaceutical drugs, and the truth about our system of healthcare.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">We’re covering a wide span of information, including how the FDA approval process works, loopholes in safety reviews, and so much more. I hope this episode gives you insight into the approval of food and drugs. More importantly, I hope you are reminded of the importance of taking authority over your own health.
