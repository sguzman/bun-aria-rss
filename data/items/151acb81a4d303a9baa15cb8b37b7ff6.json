  "description": "Two years ago, Mike Gualtieri of Forrester Research coined the term \n“predictive applications” and pitched it as the “next big thing in app \ndevelopment”. Today, some people estimate that more than 50% of the apps on \na typical smartphone have predictive features. Predictive apps were defined \nby Gualtieri as “apps that provide the right functionality and content at \nthe right time, for the right person, by continuously learning about them \nand predicting what they’ll need.” For that, they use Machine Learning (ML) \ntechniques and data. APIs such as the ones provided by Amazon Machine \nLearning, BigML, Google Prediction API and PredicSis all promise to make it \neasy for developers to apply ML to data and thus to add predictive features \nto their apps, but it’s not obvious how these APIs differ from one another \nand how to choose the right one based on your apps’ needs...",
