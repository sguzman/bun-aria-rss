  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys do their best to celebrate Christmas with everyone by checking in on everyone's holiday plans, Wonder Woman flopping in China (it doesn't matter), the creation of the poop sock, which is what Connor will be using instead of toilet paper for the rest of time, Billy Tubes goes to bat for his favorite restaurant (which stinks), and much more. Plus, to send you into the holiday season, the boys put together a Christmas edition of Maraldo's mad libs. It's a fun one. We appreciate you all for listening, Happy Holidays, stay safe out there, and enjoy.</p>\n",
