  "description": "<p>On today’s bonus episode, Pat and the boys record the podcast late into the night immediately after the Packers and Bears kicked off the 100th NFL season. They chat about the game, and how happy they are that football is back. They also cover the ever increasing Antonio Brown drama and why they think he could potentially end up in New England on a one year deal with the Patriots, why Pat thinks the Colts could potentially go undefeated this year, who some of the teams are that everyone is excited to watch play this weekend, and recap the trip to Toronto including the story of running into Canadian legend and retired NHL left winger, Nick “Kyper” Kypreos. Pat and the boys also discuss the launch of the radio show on Westwood One and simulcast on DAZN (starting on Monday September 9th at 10:00 EST), chat about Alec Baldwin’s upcoming roast on Comedy Central whose dais includes Caitlyn Jenner. Pat also answers what his go to candy is on road trips, dives into LeBron’s new glass helmet initiative and if he is becoming less and less relatable, and chats more about his Escalade that he will be giving away to someone who listens to the radio show everyday next week. And finally, after a long hiatus, Friday Bangerz returns to the show to help send you into the weekend. Today’s a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
