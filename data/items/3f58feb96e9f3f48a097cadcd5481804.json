  "description": "<p>Within less than a decade of ratification of the Bill of Rights, President John Adams signed the Sedition Act, which blatantly violated the First Amendment’s protections of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Since that time, the Supreme Court has repeatedly taken a firm stand in defense of the First Amendment against government encroachment. Yet, within the past couple of years, we’ve heard Congressional Democrats and now a Republican President call for restrictions of both the press and speech that is critical of the government. The freedom to criticize government is the last tool available to peaceful people who seek change. A government that prohibits critical speech, leaves its people with no option but to take up arms. Join James Harrigan and Antony Davies as they discuss this and more on this week’s episode of Words and Numbers.</p> <p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/corona-beer-to-ditch-plastic-packaging-by-using-biodegradable-6-pack-rings/\"> Corona brewing replaces plastic six-pack rings</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://mavenroundtable.io/theintellectualist/news/iowa-school-districts-roll-out-mandatory-gun-training-for-middle-schoolers-pGCSz4ObR0KjvV2QzO0hWA/?utm_source=Amplify&utm_medium=Intellectualist&utm_campaign=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR155oGZw_3J27CBA8VdqAN4CJAUdO72DInudchFan3D0sCrINhb40bsRNc\"> Iowa high schools require gun safety courses</a></p> <p><strong>Foolishness of the week</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/tsa-moving-to-all-floppy-ear-airport-dog-force-because-pointy-ear-dogs-scare-children\"> TSA switching to floppy eared dogs</a></p> <p><strong>Topic of the week: The Alien and Sedition Acts</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_divisions_of_United_States_Congresses\"> Congressional party results</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/11/trump-media-criticism-enemy-of-the-people-charge/\"> The enemy of the people</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.history.com/topics/early-us/alien-and-sedition-acts\">Sedition Act 1</a></p> <p><a href= \"http://www.historynet.com/american-history-passage-of-the-alien-and-sedition-acts.htm\"> Sedition Act 2</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/treasures_of_congress/text/page5_text.html\"> Sedition Act 3</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ushistory.org/us/19e.asp\">Sedition Act 4</a></p> <p><strong>Join the conversation</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/antonydavies\">Antony Davies on Twitter</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesRHarrigan\">James R.
