  "description": "<p>Raw vegan runner extraordinaire Tim VanOrden joins the show to discuss his journey with food, how he re-discovered a passion for running that led him to 9 U.S. Masters Trail Championship victories, his holistic approach to life and how he makes it all work on a 100% entirely raw plant-based diet.</p><p>Along the way, we talk specifics about:</p><br><p>* aerobic zone training</p><p>* finding the joy in racing & training</p><p>* the perils of becoming pigeonholed by labels</p><p>* the importance of microbial health</p><p>* what it's like to race up the Empire State Building</p><p>* his thoughts on supplementation, and</p><p>* the ever-present protein question</p><br><p>I thought I knew a lot, but Tim enlightened me on more than a few issues and it was a pleasure interviewing him.</p><p>NOTE: apologies for the poor audio quality of the Skype interview. There is a persistent static hum that I could not eliminate and the levels are — well, let's just say — a wee bit off.&nbsp;I am still new at all this and obviously still have a few things to learn. Production quality is important to me, so I am truly sorry for the issue.
