  "title": "PODCAST 11-08-2018: Orthodox Christianity, explained (?), with Hannah Gais",
  "description": "<p>Freelance writer and Harvard Divinity School grad student Hannah Gais is back, so that makes two repeat guests on the podcast! She's going to try to explain to me how the Orthodox Church works, an effort that goes so well you can hear my dog literally howling by the end of it (I'm pretty sure she saw some kids outside). We talk about the schism between the Russian Orthodox Church and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I over Bartholomew's decision to allow Ukrainian church leaders to form their own autocephalous Orthodox Church separate from Moscow and try to Make Sense Of It All. Enjoy!</p><p>Hannah has also written a piece about the schism, which we discuss during the interview that you can find <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fx.substack.com/p/guest-post-inaccurate-conception\">here</a>.
