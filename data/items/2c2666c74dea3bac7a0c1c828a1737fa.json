Each single app is unique and special in its own right, but they all have one thing in common - their purpose is to help. From helping motorhome enthusiasts find somewhere to camp, small business owners manage their finances or waste pickers make a reliable income - in this latest batch of <strong><a href=\"http://g.co/play/weareplay\" target=\"_blank\">#WeArePlay</a></strong> stories, we celebrate app founders who are helping people across the world in extraordinarily different ways. \n</p>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://g.co/play/weareplay\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1667\" data-original-width=\"1668\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjpQMSvw2DhcUfPKHtk-PdC7ewF9JAK8elFauKlr6ThDoaMZh_CsdhOKFJ3qsbYNnAWV4Ka3uvKbneCcoTPKttS5kCaLWXhe5Q_ZufDLdFHS1sdH9e2RfBcQ4iC2HDCHV2Qv_xNGlTvnMl2xco1NkfRYjCwXGxgG8YbKSdIdENZSro_YDXlTp8q36ky/w400-h400/image8.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>\nFirst we begin with Cristian. Originally from Villa Rica in southern Chile, he made his family very proud by being the first to go to university. During his studies in Santiago, he learned about the local waste pickers – people who make an income by searching through trash cans and finding valuable materials to sell. Despite his mother’s wishes, he was so motivated to help them that he dropped out of university and dedicated all his time to creating an app. <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cl.app.reciclappchile&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\">Reciclapp</a> works by helping waste pickers connect with local businesses, so they can collect resellable materials directly from them. So far, the app has helped waste pickers across the city save time and guarantee a more reliable income. As Cristian has grown his company to a team of 12 and expanded into Mexico, his mother is now very proud of his bravery and success.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://g.co/play/weareplay\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1667\" data-original-width=\"1668\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPvvZfqsC4HWMYkLk46l5Bx0Vqw4zwdxY_mRFQPqiItfRElVXL_GykO6Inff4suoTYDpHKplMDQIaplCaLmOYGPFyQIj0NKEQ-xyvQ_EuRA4njBx8osr0W48vTwYQ6-Zlczg-Ua9fEbcXsS51nsWkMZWX5u0hLNrZkbpmkCIE4Gdi4yqVyMNflve_E/w400-h400/image4.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n  \n<p>\nNext, Kennedy and Duke. When they were children, their father’s business sadly failed because managing his finances and tracking spending was too hard. Years later, after a successful career abroad in tech, Kennedy decided it was time to return to his homeland of Nigeria and build his own company. Inspired by his father’s struggle, he partnered with brother Duke and travelled across the country to interview other business owners about their financial struggles. Using this research, they created <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6658414424173469073&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\">Kippa</a> - the app simplifies bookkeeping to make sending invoices, storing receipts and setting up a bank account easy. It’s now used by over half a million businesses in Nigeria, as Kennedy mentions “without Google Play, we couldn't help as many business owners”.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://g.co/play/weareplay\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1667\" data-original-width=\"1668\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-klaoN1auBSUGfeYLXrRY65eEHyJZZVsP3o9_MLC4IYhFQxmVrt181WZbNHijmu0Ly1wDFt4BJcQ9jKI8zYJOvoGJOtfwLJNN8cygskLA7RVFUuOgQlC0xo_iR_muPL8IlAmjEhrwLOFW1jWfC2S6GCITrTBd0imBEfQZU0mRsNV3TpCWJ8i1Bbaz/w400-h400/image22.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>\nTo round up today, Gijs and Eefje. The couple adore renting campervans and travelling around to explore the natural beauty of Europe, but they always seemed to struggle with one thing - easily finding places to stay. Feeling like nothing out there could help them, they decided to give app development a go and create <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5430376029831492954\" target=\"_blank\">Campy</a>. The app works as a digital camping encyclopaedia: helping like-minded campervan enthusiasts discover the perfect spots to set up camp, plan their trips and meet others who love the outdoors. A few years after Campy launched, Gijs and Eefje now have 2 little girls to bring on their big adventures, and are elated with the feedback they have received - “it never ceases to amaze me what a tiny app can do for so many people”. \n</p>\n<p>\nCheck out all the stories from around the world at <a href=\"g.co/play/weareplay\" target=\"_blank\">g.co/play/weareplay</a> and stay tuned for more coming soon. \n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n How useful did you find this blog post?</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLTlzFd_aV-3rAdBqO1QxwCsuAcDCIM6fJFXyNcyf7zElVXg/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.753333049=1%E2%98%85+%E2%80%93+Not+at+all&amp;entry.2056663615&amp;entry.646747778=changeme-mm/yy\" target=\"_blank\">★</a> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLTlzFd_aV-3rAdBqO1QxwCsuAcDCIM6fJFXyNcyf7zElVXg/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.753333049=2%E2%98%85+%E2%80%93+Not+very&amp;entry.2056663615&amp;entry.646747778=changeme-mm/yy\" target=\"_blank\">★</a> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLTlzFd_aV-3rAdBqO1QxwCsuAcDCIM6fJFXyNcyf7zElVXg/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.753333049=3%E2%98%85+%E2%80%93+Somewhat&amp;entry.2056663615&amp;entry.646747778=changeme-mm/yy\" target=\"_blank\">★</a> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLTlzFd_aV-3rAdBqO1QxwCsuAcDCIM6fJFXyNcyf7zElVXg/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.753333049=4%E2%98%85+%E2%80%93+Very&amp;entry.2056663615&amp;entry.646747778=changeme-mm/yy\" target=\"_blank\">★</a> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLTlzFd_aV-3rAdBqO1QxwCsuAcDCIM6fJFXyNcyf7zElVXg/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.753333049=5%E2%98%85+%E2%80%93+Extremely&amp;entry.2056663615&amp;entry.646747778=changeme-mm/yy\" target=\"_blank\">★</a></p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://g.co/play/weareplay\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"53\" data-original-width=\"260\" height=\"53\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgReOMfklMpKJIQYyNey3Hs_0NxB5nhroOrbXV6TnjYCuz2YZHVZRVSeFzqL8bcf3CS7roGUw1EE04mpyhSwjPaCpbIiWrXVpa93u6NiK8A8RDddwpjp0-eh-5UV7RE4OQPlNSncnb_e2Sv6e3V00dZ810lKO_ZRVV-QFGpeBnI8NMpcxTfP3qNV5Vh/s1600/lockup_ic_Google_Play_H_260x53px_clr.png\" width=\"260\" /></a></div><br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></p>\n  \n\n <p></p>",
