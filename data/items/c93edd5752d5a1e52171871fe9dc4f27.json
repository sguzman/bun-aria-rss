Moving to Minnesota from Florida in her twenties, homesickness and a bitter winter helped inspire her to write <em>Because of Winn-Dixie(</em>https://amzn.to/39I3Vee)<em>, </em>her first published novel, which became a runaway bestseller and earned her a Newbery Honor.&nbsp;Since then, Kate’s written for a wide range of ages, earning a devoted audience and heaps of accolades.</p><p>Her #1 New York Times bestseller <em>The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane</em> was a deeply moving reflection o life, meaning and legacy, through the eyes of a toy china rabbit. <em>The Tale of Despereaux, </em>her Newbery Medal-winning novel, later inspired an animated adventure from Universal Pictures and Kate was named National Ambassador for Young People’s Literature for 2014–2015.</p><p>She’s fiercely honest, always tells the truth, but also always leads you to a place of awakening and hope, especially in circumstances that seem destined for the opposite. And right now, we could all use a bit more of that. The theme of hope and belief amid tough circumstances is a common thread in much of Kate’s writing, in no small part because that was her story, too.</p><br><p>You can find Kate DiCamillo at:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.katedicamillostoriesconnectus.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> : http://www.katedicamillostoriesconnectus.com/</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CandlewickPressBooks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> : https://www.facebook.com/CandlewickPressBooks/</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
