And this doesn’t just happen with meditation. Whether it be adopting healthier eating habits, spending more time in nature, or improving our sleep hygiene, the understanding that these things are good for us is rarely enough to change our behavior. The good news is having trouble changing habits is not about a lack of willpower or discipline.</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman talks with Dan Harris about his own journey into meditation and how just one minute a day may be enough to get you on the path towards all of meditation’s benefits. He also speaks with BJ Fogg about using the science of behavior to create new and lasting habits.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dan Harris is an Emmy Award-winning journalist and the co-anchor of ABC's Nightline and the weekend edition of Good Morning America. He is the author of two New York Times best-sellers, 10% Happier and Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics: A 10% Happier How-to Book.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. BJ Fogg is a behavior scientist with deep experience in innovation and teaching. For the past 20 years at Stanford University, he has directed a research lab and he also teaches his models and methods in graduate seminars. BJ has personally coached over 40,000 people in forming new habits, using his breakthrough method called “Tiny Habits.” His New York Times bestselling book, Tiny Habits: The Small Changes that Change Everything, was published in early 2020 and is contracted to be published in over 25 languages.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Thrive Market.
