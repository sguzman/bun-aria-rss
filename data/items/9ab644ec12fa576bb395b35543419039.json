  "description": "The recent round of primary elections in the US don't seem to show a groundswell of public indignation over the fact that the president of the United States has obstructed justice, is a pathological liar, is profoundly corrupt and is, at the very least, surrounded by people and family members who may well have conspired with the Russians to tip the scales in the last election.  So, that's a bummer.  But if that weren't enough, the president is now playing the North Korea nuclear summit not for its arms control or geopolitical value but as a card in helping to stave off a Democratic victory in November.  That's important to know, observe our experts, because...well, it means all the traditional foreign policy analysis you may hear will be completely irrelevant.  Sam Vinograd, Asha Rangappa, Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and David Sanger join to discuss this, Dennis Rodman, Seb Gorka and why Rudy Giuliani is driving Asha to drink and may offer Trump an inadequate counsel defense in the long run.
