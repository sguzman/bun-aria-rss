  "description": "In Episode #202, I’m joined by Drs Erica and Justin Sonnenburg to learn more about microbes and the gut microbiome.\nThis episode, we recap (or introduce for new listeners) what microbes are and what the microbiome is. Then we dive into a more in-depth conversation about evolution and the microbiome, the impacts of industrialisation on the gut, and what inflammation really means for human health. You’ll learn about probiotics; microbiome diversity; the relationship between microbiota and disease; how low-fibre, animal-based diets effect the gut; and more.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nFasting & Gut Health (2:42)\n\nWhat the Microbiome is (7:06)\n\nStudying the Microbiome (14:47)\n\nHealthy vs Industrialized Microbiome (19:00)\n\nInflammation (28:55)\n\nFood & Restoring Diversity (46:39)\n\nAnimal-based elimination diets (1:04:25)\n\nHealing your own Microbiome (1:15:39)\n\nGluten & Lectins (1:36:04)\n\nLifestyle Changes (1:42:13)\n\nOutro (1:45:42)\n\n\nTo learn more from the Drs Sonnenburg, you can access the Sonnenburg Lab website, read their book, The Good Gut, and connect with Justin on Twitter.
