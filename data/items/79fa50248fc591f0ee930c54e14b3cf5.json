  "description": "<p>Emu isn't the only thing on the menu at Oz.  On this week's Real Housewives of Potomac, Gizelle and Robyn get their fingers all up in Ashley's business (literally). Then it's on to our new favorite show, Invite Only Cabo, where Emily and Agu engage in a \"cuddle\" session, thus consecrating their official couple name, which ironically is \"Emu.\"  Their scandal is trumped only by the revelation that not all topics birthed on an elliptical machine can be considered LIGHT.  Come listen to our recaps!</p>\n<p>00:00:00 - Real Housewives of Potomac<br />\n00:49:27 - Invite Only Cabo<br />\n<br /><hr /><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p></p>\n",
