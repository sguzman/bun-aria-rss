  "description": "Yuko Miki’s book, Frontiers of Citizenship: A Black and Indigenous History of Postcolonial Brazil(Cambridge University Press, 2018), was the recent recipient of LASA’s 19th-century section Honorable Mention for Best Book. Frontiers of Citizenship is a beautifully written book that integrates quite seamlessly the history black and indigenous peoples in 19th century Brazil. The book explores the intersections of race and ethnicity, borderlands studies, as well as the intersecting histories of citizenship, popular politics, national identity, emancipation, and labor. In the book, Dr. Miki explores the quandaries of citizenship in a multiracial society and challenges the idea that citizenship is an equally important and equally valued goal for everyone. The book not only demonstrates otherwise, but really helps the reader challenge these widely held assumptions in a compelling and grounded manner.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
