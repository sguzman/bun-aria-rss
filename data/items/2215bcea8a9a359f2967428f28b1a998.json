  "title": "A Short Chronology Of Deep Learning For Tabular Data",
  "description": "Occasionally, I share research papers proposing new deep learning approaches for tabular data on social media, which is typically an excellent discussion starter. Often, people ask for additional methods or counterexamples. So, with this short post, I aim to briefly summarize the major papers on deep tabular learning I am currently aware of. However, I want to emphasize that no matter how interesting or promising deep tabular methods look, I still recommend using a conventional machine learning method as a baseline. There is a reason why I cover conventional machine learning before deep learning in my books.",
