  "description": "<p>We extend the $SU(3)_c \\times SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$ standard model by a\n$U(1)_{Y'}$ gauge symmetry. Three right-handed neutrinos are introduced to\ncancel the gauge anomaly. One Higgs singlet is responsible for spontaneously\nbreaking the $U(1)_{Y'}$ symmetry while the standard model Higgs doublet does\nnot carry any $U(1)_{Y'}$ charges. The down-type quarks, up-type quarks,\ncharged leptons and neutral neutrinos obtain their Dirac masses through four\ntypes of dimension-5 operators constructed by the fermion doublets and singlets\nwith the Higgs doublet and singlet. This effective theory is realized in three\nrenormalizable contexts with heavy fermion singlets, scalar doublets and\nfermion doublets. The heavy fermion singlets and doublets for generating the\nneutrino masses also accommodate a successful Dirac leptogenesis to explain the\nbaryon asymmetry in the universe.\n</p>",
