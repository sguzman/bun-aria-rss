  "title": "Ep. 845 - They Will Never Tell The Truth About The Waukesha Massacre",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a day after a serial felon and career criminal mowed down dozens of people at a Christmas parade, Democrats are out in public calling for more criminals to be released into our communities. Meanwhile, the killer was a BLM supporter and apparent racist who carried out his attack an hour from Kenosha, two days after the Rittenhouse verdict. Will we ever be told the truth about his motives? And, New York goes nuclear in the war on history, taking down a 200 year old Thomas Jefferson statue, and removing a Theodore Roosevelt statue from a museum. You have to hear the reason they gave for this decision. It’s almost impossible to believe. Plus, Kyle Rittenhouse talks to Tucker Carlson, Condoleeza Rice calls for more female coaches in the NFL, and Joe Biden claims that there's an epidemic of anti-trans hate crimes. Is that true? No, it isn't, but we’ll discuss that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \nSign The Petition To Keep Matt Walsh on Saint Louis University Campus: https://bit.ly/3Dzeu1f\nAndrew Klavan's latest novel When Christmas Comes is now available on Amazon.
