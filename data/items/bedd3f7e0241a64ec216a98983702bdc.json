  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the press has provided almost no coverage of the rulings on the Trump cases, or the multiple hearings that have taken place with dozens of witnesses. They have all but ignored President Trump's speech today where he laid out the facts of the irregularities, the elimination of signature matching, and postal requirements, as well as the extension of ballot deadlines other rule changes for mail-in ballots. The fraud abounds and the yet establishment media and government types say and do nothing. Then, the economist and columnist Walter E. Williams has passed away. Williams was a huge icon for liberty, the constitution, and humanity. Armed with an excellent sense of humor and superior intellect, Williams lived a graceful life and kept the company of fellow conservative intellectuals Milton Friedman and Thomas Sowell. Later, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is out of control. What Pennsylvania has done at the state level affects the Electoral College. A state court cannot change or create election laws, only the PA legislature can. Republicans must stand up to this lawlessness. This cowardice must end because the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is stepping all over the legislature. If the US Supreme Court doesn't fix this rogue state court we will have a federal Constitutional crisis. Afterward, CNN is further exposed in newly released tapes from Project Veritas revealing more of their bias. CEO Jeff Zucker even went as far as saying that Trump was a bigger threat to national security than election fraud. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
