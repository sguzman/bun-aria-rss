  "description": "<p>Today on The Cigar Authority we light up two cigars that have some rarity attached to them. In the first hour we will light up Pappy Van Winkle from Drew Estate. We’ll try not to take a 20 year nap, as we tell you the story of Rip and Julian “Pappy” Van Winkle. It’s also not the first cigar to have ties to the liquor industry and we will discuss how the two industries have worked together in the past.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we will light up a cigar that has the famed Medio Tiempo tobacco leaf. This small tobacco leaf doesn’t grow on every tobacco plant. It is however in every cigar of Vallejuello Medio Tiempo which was part of The Cigar Authority care package for October.</p>\n<p>All that and the usual bag of tricks Debonaire Mr. J, Asylum Barry, Cigar News, Classic 3 Way and even a few mail bags..</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='http://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n",
