  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media is falling all over itself to celebrate Simone Biles for quitting. She is the most inspiring and courageous quitter the world has ever seen, they tell us. But I’m not so sure that I agree with this redefinition of courage. And our Five Headlines including the pathetic, desperate, and grotesque display put on by the Democrats during the January 6th hearing yesterday. Also, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who was not in the Capitol that day, now says that she was afraid that she would be raped. The CDC has reinstated the mask mandate, but the question is whether anyone gives a damn about the CDC’s mandates at this point. And in our Daily Cancellation, after a day filled with men crying on camera, we will discuss whether these sorts of displays should be welcomed in our society. \nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
