  "description": "<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, we have one of the craziest stories I've ever read. An out of touch multi-millionaire boss has one of his employees invest some of his cash into the stock market. When OP grows the investment, his boss demands that OP also hand over his portion of the profits. OP begrudgingly agrees, but he doesn't tell his boss that there's still some leftover cash in the stock market. The boss either forgets about that cash or never realized it was there in the first place, leaving OP to walk away with a cool $2,000,000.</p>\n",
