  "description": "I AM ATHLETE | Season 3: Episode 19\n\nBrandon Marshall and D.J. Williams welcome J.R. Smith and Antoine Walker to the show as they discuss basketball, HBCU’s, what really happened in the 2018 NBA Finals and much more.\n\nThe show opens up with J.R. talking about his time in Denver and what it was like playing with Carmelo Anthony and company. Antoine goes on to talk about the similarities between him and J.R. when it came to how they played the game. Antoine felt judged when playing for the Boston Celtics because of the way he celebrated and showboated around the court. He explains how people looked at him differently because of that and understands the weight J.R. felt from the public eye because he chose to do things differently when he played.\n\nBrandon brings up HBCUs and asks J.R. to explain his thoughts on the topic. J.R. begins by saying how he went to a high school that was predominately white and explains that he never felt as if he was accepted and belonged. He goes on by saying how much he admires Deion Sanders and what he is doing at Jackson State. He explains how there needs to be more Brandon Marshall’s and D.J. Williams’ going to HBCUs to play football in order to see a change in popularity. \n\nThe conversation shifts to the 2018 NBA Finals as Brandon asks what really happened during the infamous moment when J.R. chose to hold the ball with seconds left in their tied game with the Golden State Warriors. He talks about the miscommunication between the team which ultimately led to that mistake. He opens up to talk about the struggles he faced mentally after that game with the world putting all the blame on him for what happened. He says, “That’s not my legacy…not if I have something to do with it.” He explains how the world gives you labels and creates your identity for you, when referring to his nickname of ‘Henny God’. He says, “I don’t even drink Hennessy.” He explains how he feels he’s been misrepresented but has finally come to peace with what happened back in 2018.\n\n\nWATCH MORE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGAaZmvZaF9i_MOW1SzmEqPYpKAC5sAsH\n\nSUBSCRIBE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/IAMATHLETE\n\nFollow I AM ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://iamathletetv.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/iamathlete\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpod\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamathlete/?hl=en\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@iamathlete_podcast\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/i-am-athlete\n\nFollow HOUSE OF ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://houseofathlete.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thehouseofathlete/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/houseofathlete\nApparel Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/houseofathleteapparel/\nHoA Supplements: https://houseofathlete.com/supplements\n\n#IAMATHLETE #BiggerThanAPodcast #BrandonMarshall #D.J.Williams\n#AntonieWalker #J.R.Smith\n\n\nDRAFTKINGS:\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 877-8-HOPENY/text HOPENY (467369) (NY)\n\n1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL/IN/MI/NJ/PA/WV/WY), 1-800-NEXT STEP (AZ), 1-800-522-4700 (CO/NH), 888-789-7777/visit ccpg.org/chat (CT), 1-800-BETS OFF (IA), 1-877-770-STOP (7867) (LA), visit OPGR.org (OR), call/text TN REDLINE 1-800-889-9789 (TN), or 1-888-532-3500 (VA).\n21+ (18+ NH/WY). \n\nPhysically present in AZ/CO/CT/IL/IN/IA/LA/MI/NH/NJ/NY/OR/PA/TN/\nVA/WV/WY only.
