  "title": "Beyond the 5 Stars Round up",
  "content": "Last week, I published a post on the Netflix tech blog. The post, entitled \"<a href=\"http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/04/netflix-recommendations-beyond-5-stars.html\">Netflix Recommendations: Beyond the 5 stars</a>\" describes how recommendations have evolved at Netflix since the Netflix Prize. If you haven't read the post, do so now.<br /><br />The post stirred quite some interesting reactions and many comments. Here is a list of some of the ones I picked up, grouped by \"category\":<br /><ul><li>Our post got picked up by the usual content aggregators:<br /></li><ul><li>Hacker News posted a link to the post, and as always attracted <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3810058\">a great number of comments</a></li><li>Likewise, <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/rxp2e/netflix_recommendations_beyond_the_5_stars_part_1/\">Reddit </a>also attracted some interesting comments.<br /></li></ul><li>Some online media gave a summary of our post:<br /></li><ul><li>Engadget was the first one to have a brief piece with several interesting comments: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/04/08/netflix-explains-its-recommendation-system-cant-find-a-reason/#disqus_thread\">Netflix explains its recommendation system, can't find a reason for Adam Sandler's last movie</a></li><li>The CNN also had a longer article, with a detailed summary of our post: <a href=\"http://whatsnext.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/09/inside-netflixs-popular-recommendation-algorithm/\">Inside Netflix's popular 'recommendation' algorithm </a></li><li>Econsultancy reflects on our post by calling us <a href=\"http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/9554-netflix-the-algorithm-company\">Netflix: the algorithm company</a><br /></li></ul><li>Others focused on the figure we gave on the post related to the percentage of views coming from recommendations.<br /></li><ul><li>The Verge picked up on this for their piece: <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/8/2934375/netflix-recommendation-system-explained\">Netflix offers details on its recommendation engine, says it guides 75 percent of viewership</a></li><li>Also PC Magazine focused on this issue, but gave a more detailed summary of the post: <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2402739,00.asp\">75 Percent of Netflix Viewing Based on Recommendations</a></li><li>Finally, Business Insider, also focused on this issue in their <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/netflixs-recommendation-engine-drives-75-of-viewership-2012-4\">Netflix's Recommendation Engine Drives 75% Of Viewership</a><br /></li></ul><li>The last few reactions I picked up, focused on the reasons why we are not using the winning entry to the Netflix Prize .</li><ul><li>The Next Web, entitled their piece <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/media/2012/04/13/remember-netflixs-1m-algorithm-contest-well-heres-why-it-didnt-use-the-winning-entry/?awesm=tnw.to_1E23j\">Remember Netflix’s $1m algorithm contest? Well, here’s why it didn’t use the winning entry</a></li><li>Techdirt focused only exclusively on this issue in their <a href=\"http://www.techdirt.com/blog/innovation/articles/20120409/03412518422/why-netflix-never-implemented-algorithm-that-won-netflix-1-million-challenge.shtml\">Why Netflix Never Implemented The Algorithm That Won The Netflix $1 Million Challenge</a></li><li>Both the previous articles are ok, but a bit misleading in that they seem to imply that not implementing the final solution to the prize might have been a loss for Netflix. But, the prize to the worst uninformed and ill-intentioned reaction to our post has to go to Forbes' <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanholiday/2012/04/16/what-the-failed-1m-netflix-prize-tells-us-about-business-advice/\">What The Failed 1m Netflix Prize Tells Us About Business Advice</a>. It should be clear to anyone that the Netflix Prize was a huge success in all metrics. And, Netflix had already recovered the $1m long before the competition ended.<br /></li></ul></ul>",
