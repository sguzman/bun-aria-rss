  "description": "<div>Today’s episode continues my look at the life and crimes of Andy Baker, known as ‘The Cornerman’ for taking a cut of any deal. We look at his rise from working the doors in Surrey, through to murder trials, drugs and extreme violence. It is a story straight out of the movies but this week, his luck runs out as he is finally convicted by a Jury.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sponsors<br>\n</strong>With thanks to:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.hellofresh.co.uk\">www.hellofresh.co.uk</a>  promo code, Truecrime<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.stitchfix.co.uk/true\">www.stitchfix.co.uk/true</a>\n</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n<strong>Sources</strong><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>I have drawn heavily on an amazing piece of investigative journalism at The Cable who covered the life of Andy Baker in four articles.
