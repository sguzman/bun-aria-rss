  "description": "<p>On Darren Aronofsky's philosophical 2017 film about humanity's relationship to nature. We discuss the philosophical content of the film (Gnosticism, anyone?) and explore the relation between meaning and the sensuous aspects of an artwork. Can a work be both allegorical and yet have fully fleshed out characters and the other elements that make a film feel real? This was a very polarizing film; how do the circumstances of viewing affect reception? With guest Tim Nicholas.</p> <p>End song: “The Day of Wrath, That Day,” by Sarah McQuaid, as interviewed on <a href= \"http://nakedlyexaminedmusic.com/nem72-sarah-mcquaid/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nakedly Examined Music #72</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com/support\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Please support PEL!</a> Citizens and $5 Patreon supporters will get access to a bonus discussion on identity politics this week.</p>",
