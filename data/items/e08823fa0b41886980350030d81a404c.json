  "description": "<p><span>When the Dobbs decision went down, ER doctor Avir Mitra started to prepare for the worst — botched, at-home abortions that would land pregnant people in the emergency room. To prepare himself and his colleagues for the patients they might see, and to think through how best to treat them, Avir asked Laura MacIsaac, one of New York City’s leading gynecologists and abortion experts, to come talk to his ER department. But what Dr. MacIsaac had to say in her lecture wasn’t what Avir expected: she didn’t talk about how we’re going back in time and the horrors of self-harm as a means to an abortion. Instead, she painted a picture of progress — how in the last 40 years, through private practice and clinical trials all around the world, the process and science of providing and having an abortion has changed dramatically, mostly because of two types of pills: misoprostol and mifepristone. On this episode, Avir and Senior Correspondent Molly Webster visit Dr. MacIsaac to hear more, and also learn about a new study that indicates the process of abortion is on the precipice of even further change. </span></p>\n<p><span><em>Special thanks to </em><em><span>Mariana</span></em><em><span> Prandini Assis and Pam Belluck</span></em><em><span>.</span></em></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Episode Credits:<br></strong>Reported by Avir Mitra and Molly Webster<br>Produced by Sarah Qari<br>Mixing help from Arianne Wack<br>Fact-checking by Diane Kelly<br>Edited by Becca Bressler<br><br></span></p>\n<p><em><span>Our newsletter comes out every Wednesday.
