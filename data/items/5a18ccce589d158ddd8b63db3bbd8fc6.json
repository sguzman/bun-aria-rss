His goal is to help people understand each other, live and work near each other, and even learn from each other despite their moral differences. He’s written several books, including <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VnpXvM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Happiness Hypothesis</em></a><em> (</em>https://amzn.to/2VnpXvM), <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2MfbfTe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Righteous Mind</em></a> (https://amzn.to/2MfbfTe) and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/33f6e4i\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Coddling the American Mind</em></a><em> (</em>https://amzn.to/33f6e4i), and co-founded a variety of organizations and collaborations that apply moral and social psychology to help foster connection among disparate groups.
