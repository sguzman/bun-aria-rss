  "description": "Welcome to the first 'Big Picture' Movie Auction. What’s that? Well, as we anticipate our return to movie theaters, we thought we’d find a way to measure the movies we’re most excited to see in 2021. The return of James Bond? ‘Top Gun: Maverick’? Three MCU movies? This could be a fun year for Hollywood after all. And what better way to express our excitement than to wager cold, hard (imaginary) cash? Chris Ryan joins Sean and Amanda for a good old-fashioned auction, movie-style.\n\nHosts: Sean Fennessey and Amanda Dobbins\nGuests: Chris Ryan and Danny Heifetz\nLearn more about your ad choices.
