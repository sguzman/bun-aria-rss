  "description": "<p>The Ben Lomond Hotel is located in the Historic Downtown of Ogden, Utah. This is one of the last three “Grand Hotels” in Utah that still operates as a hotel. Built in the latter part of the Victorian Era, the hotel has changed over time. The original five stories now rise to eleven. Ogden was a major railroad junction and brought people from all over. And while a hotel is meant to be a place of comfort, the Ben Lomond seems to be a place of death and this has lead to stories of strange happenings. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Ben Lomond Hotel. The Moment in Oddity is suggested by listener Lisa Nielsen and features Holger Danske and This Day in History is by April Rogers-Krick and features Women Fired Over Turkey Trot. Our location was suggested by listeners Jon Mueller and Dean Carrington and our Researcg=h Assistant is Kristin Swintek.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/05/hgb-episode-127-ben-lomond-hotel.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/05/hgb-episode-127-ben-lomond-hotel.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
