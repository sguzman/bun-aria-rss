  "description": "<p>The properties of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) for the\ndouble magic $^{48}$Ca are analyzed in the framework of a microscopic model\nbased on Skyrme-type interactions. A method for simultaneously taking into\naccount the coupling between one-, two-, and three-phonon terms in the wave\nfunctions of $0^{+}$ states has been developed. The inclusion of three-phonon\nconfigurations leads to a substantial redistribution of the ISGMR strength to\nlower energy $0^{+}$ states and also higher energy tail. Our results\ndemonstrate that the developed approach enables to us to describe a gross\nstructure of the ISGMR spreading width.\n</p>",
