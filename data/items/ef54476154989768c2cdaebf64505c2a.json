  "description": "In this episode of The Barron Report, host Paul Barron hears from Dr. Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Barron and Murray explore the data behind mask usage in light of the recent spike in coronavirus cases in Florida and other states.<br />In this episode, Yolofsky explores the ins and outs of estate planning. For entrepreneurs and business owners, having an exit strategy is paramount.<br /><br />According to a 2018 study conducted by Merrill Lynch and Age Wave, while more than half of adults over the age of 55 have some form of estate plan, only eighteen percent have a complete estate plan. Most business owners have self-reported similarly dire legal situations: 87 percent of business owners do not have a retirement plan, and 89 percent do not have a legal professional on retainer—yet business owner respondents universally stated that they would like to sell their business at some future point.",
