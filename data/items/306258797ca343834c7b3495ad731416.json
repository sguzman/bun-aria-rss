If people eat or drink less of their products, they lose. This is the primary reason for why Big Food seeks to hook&nbsp; consumers and keep us coming back for more. The food industry approaches food as “engineering projects,” with the end goal of creating “heavy users”—a disturbing internal term used by food manufacturers that helps them make as much money as possible at the expense of public health. But as more and more consumers demand healthier foods, many companies are working hard to meet that demand. So how can we support this innovation and reward companies who are trying to do the right thing?</p><br><p>Dr. Hyman explores these topics in his past interviews with Michael Moss and Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian.</p><br><p>Michael Moss is a New York Times investigative reporter turned food-focused journalist, Pulitzer Prize winner for Explanatory Reporting, and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller, “Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us”. He also has another book coming out soon called, “Hooked: Food and Free Will,” focused around food and addiction.</p><br><p>Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian is a cardiologist, Dean and Jean Mayer Professor at the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, and Professor of Medicine at Tufts Medical School. As one of the top nutrition institutions in the world, the Friedman School’s mission is to produce trusted science, future leaders, and real-world impact. Dr. Mozaffarian has authored more than 400 scientific publications on dietary priorities for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, and on evidence-based policy approaches to reduce these burdens in the US and globally. He has served in numerous advisory roles including for the US and Canadian governments and, in 2016, Thomson Reuters named him as one of the World’s Most Influential Scientific Minds.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Four Sigmatic.
