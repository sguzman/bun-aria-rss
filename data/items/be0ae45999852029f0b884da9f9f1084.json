  "description": "2021 was a great year for the Old Man & the Three as many of the NBA's brightest stars joined JJ and Tommy to present an intimate look at the players who make the league such an incredible force. But along with the NBA stars, there were also interviews that took a step outside the box to shed light on the different aspects of our society, business, and life in general. Those were encompassed in the OM3 Leadership series where the likes of Bob Iger, Stacey Abrams, Ben Winston and many more paid visits to the show. Now, to open 2022, we step forward with a new look at the league with the \"Coaching Series\", which will focus on specific coaches from around the NBA - and maybe some other sports as well. Who knows who will show up... that's part of the fun. And to kick things off for the first installment, JJ and Tommy welcome in Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse for an incredible interview where he breaks down his coaching journey and how he reached the top, what intangibles make a great coach, motivation in players, the preparation it takes to succeed, and so much more.\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
