  "description": "<p>Happy Friday! The guys start this episode off giving men their flowers for another win with the Johnny Depp v. Amber Heard defamation case. Somehow this leads into a debate about what squirt is made of. The guys talk about their worst dates ever, and then get into the BET Award nominees (and give you a little peek of who they voted for). They debate who is actually Reality Royalty, and should win best Hip Hop Couple. They also speak on B-Dot's \"so far\" list, Cyhi claiming best rapper alive, + more!</p>\n",
