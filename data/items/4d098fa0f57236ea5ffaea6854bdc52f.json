  "description": "It might sound like fun to date a glamorous movie star, but in reality, it would probably get very messy. That's the premise of HBO Max's <em>Starstruck,</em> created by and starring New Zealand comedian Rose Matafeo.

It's a great weekend binge watch, and just returned for a second season. In this encore episode, we discuss the first season. ",
