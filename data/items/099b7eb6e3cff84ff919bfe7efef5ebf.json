  "description": "<p>Our research assistant and listener favorite Freya Porter joins us on this episode to share the history and hauntings of a location near to where she grew up. Her family is very familiar with the Oystermouth Castle and she shares their personal experiences about this old and wonderful castle. Mumbles is a small resort town that is a headland overlooking Swansea Bay. It has a pier there that was the end point for the Mumbles Railway, which was the oldest passenger railway in the world at the end of the 1800s. Mumbles is also home to an old castle known as Oystermouth. It was fought over by the Welsh and the Normans for years and today is under restoration. As is the case with so many other castles, this one has some unexplained and haunting activity taking place within its stone walls. Moment in Oddity features the legend of Kashima Reiko and This Day in History features the first X-ray photo.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http//historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/01/hgb-podcast-ep-96-oystermouth-castle.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/01/hgb-podcast-ep-96-oystermouth-castle.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",
