  "description": "<p>It’s no secret that food-based illnesses have become deeply ingrained in our culture. From the obesity epidemic to an uptick in food addiction, it’s clear that somewhere along the way we’ve lost touch with how to form healthy relationships with food.</p> <p>Unlike many other health problems, finding a solution to these issues isn’t clear. Traditional medical solutions aren’t applicable due to food’s basic function—we need it to survive. Food is something we all have to interact with on a regular basis.</p> <p>Mark Schatzker has extensively studied and written about the link between food and behavior, including how traditional knowledge has overlooked an important piece of the puzzle—flavor. On today’s show, he’s sharing the fascinating science behind the production of flavor, and how modern food is designed to get us hooked. We’ll talk about how to hack the system, and how you can get back to your roots in order to find balance between flavorful foods and nutrition.</p> <h2>In this episode you’ll discover:</h2> <ul> <li>How our food’s nutritional quality has become more diluted over time.</li> <li>Theintuitiveeating habitsof cattle (and how it relates to humans!)</li> <li>How production of crops like corn has changed over the last few decades.</li> <li>The incredible link between flavor and nutrition.</li> <li>What reverse evolution is, and how it works on both humans and plants.</li> <li>The science behind why supermarket tomatoes taste so bland.</li> <li>What brain scans indicate about food addiction.</li> <li>Why sugar and flavor are a dangerous combination.</li> <li>Which two senses contribute to deliciousness.</li> <li>The definition of retronasal olfaction and how it affects our taste.</li> <li>Why your taste seems to change when you have a cold.</li> <li>What we can learn from babies’ intuitive senses.</li> <li>The three rules of flavorthat you need to know.</li> <li>How flavor compounds are connected to pleasure.</li> <li>The two ingredientson a nutrition label that you should avoid.</li> <li>What we can learn from healthier, leaner populations.</li> </ul> <h2>Items mentioned in this episode include:</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/onnit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Onnit.com/Model</a>⇐ Get your optimal health & performance supplements at 10% off!</li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/foursigmatic\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Foursigmatic.com/model</a> ⇐ Get 15% off your daily health elixirs and coffee!</li> <li><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Dorito-Effect-Surprising-Truth-Flavor-ebook/dp/B00LD1RWVK/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Dorito Effect by Mark Schatzker</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NX75CM/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Steak by Mark Schatzker</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/the-history-of-sugar/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The History of Sugar: Sex, Drugs, and Entertainment – Episode 222</a></li> <li>Connect with Mark <a href= \"https://twitter.com/markschatzker?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter</a>/ <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/mark.schatzker\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a>/ <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/markschatzker/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a></li> </ul> <p>* <a href= \"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/themodelhealthshow/Episode+305.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download The Transcript</a></p> <p>Thank you so much for checking out this episode of The Model Health Show.
