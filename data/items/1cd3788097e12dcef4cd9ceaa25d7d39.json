  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, American cities are depopulating as a result of the China virus. Liberals are moving to the suburbs in red states to escape over-taxation and overt criminality of their blue-state enclaves, which have become breeding grounds for illegal immigration. Then, the left in the media are trying to portray the post office as a central part of electing a president — it's not and it never has been. In fact, most Americans receive and return mail that was erroneously delivered. Later, former Vice President Al Gore egregiously says that President Trump is putting his knee on the neck of the voters in this election. Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi keeps lying and saying that Trump is sabotaging the election. Afterward, the Cloward and Piven playbook is still at play as the democrats continue to use the system to try and destroy the system. Whether it's overloading the postal service with more mail-in ballots than it can handle, or flooding the suburbs with multi-unit housing that drastically increases population by abolishing single-family zoning. The country is coming to a boiling point. People won't put up with this for long and eventually, the law of the jungle kicks in, and criminal Marxists, cartels, and uncivil violent forces take over.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
