It’s something most, if not all, of us accept as just a normal part of life. Yet, what if we’ve been approaching ‘aging’ wrong this entire time? What if there was a way to not only slow down our aging process but put an end to aging altogether? On this episode of Health Theory, Tom Bilyeu is joined by anti-aging, regenerative, and age-reversal medical expert Dr. Alex Paziotopoulos to discuss such matters and more as they explore how you can put a halt to your body’s aging process and begin turning back your biological clock for good. They discuss the modern science behind age reversing, the importance of sleep on your brain, the ideal lifestyle you should be aiming for, why a meat-based diet may be aging you, why your world is ‘too sterile,’ the differences between good and bed stress, the supplements you can take to prevent aging, and the practical steps you can take today to begin slowing down how you age.   SHOW NOTES:   Anti-Aging | Dr. Paziotopoulos reveals the science behind today’s age reversing.

So, we want to go beyond your genetic potential.” [13:26]   “…you’re not a human being, you’re a conglomerate of all of these organisms together. So you have, you know, hundreds of millions of different species just living in you. And so when we look at hunter-gatherer populations and what their microbiome looks like versus us, we’re completely sterile compared to them.” [21:24]   “There’s not a system of the body that we’re not looking at and that we’re not trying to optimize because it all works together. You can’t just say, “I’ll optimize your heart.” There’s no way, it’s impossible, right? Everything’s connected. And so, we have to look at all the systems and see where we’re at.” [41:09] FOLLOW DR.
