  "description": "Clay returns from fun family vacation in Michigan.  He says, \"Congratulations, America, we've got 87,000 new IRS agents!\" Dems push through massive tax and spending bill. Ted Cruz: Abolish the IRS, don't double it. Gambling markets: Dems now favored to control Senate. Senate possibilities make Buck and Clay \"nervous\" and they warn not to take anything for granted. Bill Maher triggers libs by ripping, not what used to be fat acceptance, but the current \"fat celebration.\" C&B stress, while not everyone needs to strive for great abs, everyone should strive for health. By watching what he eats and increasing his gym time (to better match his fit fiancee), Buck is down more than 10 pounds of the 20 he put on during the pandemic due in part to sitting and broadcasting five hours of radio a day.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
