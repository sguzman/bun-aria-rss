  "description": "<p>Confused about <strong>expectancy theory</strong>? I’ll clear things up in this episode. It can be a little complicated but I’ll use the familiar example of losing weight to nail this idea down. I’ll also talk about <strong>goal setting</strong>. What’s the psychology behind getting in shape? In this episode of The Psych Files podcast I examine two established theories of human motivation – <strong>goal setting</strong> and <strong>expectancy theory</strong>. If you’ve tried the Atkins diet, the south beach diet some other low carb diet plan or even (yikes!) a lemonade diet, then it’s time to try something different – get into your head just a little bit and see what’s going on in there. Join me for a different perspective on weight loss, exercise and fitness.</p>",
