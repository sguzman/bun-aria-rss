  "title": "Managing Your Mental Health When Living with a Chronic Illness or Disability + How to Turn Any Challenge into an Opportunity (With Adam Bremen, Keto Krisp Founder)",
  "description": "<p>On this podcast, I had the privilege of interviewing Keto Krisp founder and successful businessman Adam Bremen. This was definitely one of my favorite interviews, with the creator of my favorite keto snack bar! We discuss everything from finding the joy in life, how he overcame his disability, how keto changed his life and inspired him to start his company, why having fun in life and in business is so important, how to be a successful entrepreneur, his desire to celebrate and empower others to take charge of their health, how to build mental resilience when times are tough, what to say to someone who is going through a really tough time, and the power of learning to see the good in every situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Adam learnt early on that life is about what you can do, not what you can’t do. Diagnosed at the age of 2 with cerebral palsy, he has learnt to overcome numerous odds, including life in a wheelchair. Thankfully, he grew up with a loving and supportive family who encouraged him to never put limits on himself, and to always find ways to celebrate his life and the lives of the people around him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>**SPECIAL OFFERS FROM THIS WEEK'S SPONSORS** &nbsp;</p>\n<p>-HIYA HEALTH (the best children's multivitamin!): Receive 50% off your first order.
