  "description": "<p>This is the speech Dr. Eric Thomas Weber gave in thanks and acceptance of the Mississippi Humanities Council's 2015 Public Humanities Scholar Award. The address was delivered in the Old Capitol Building in Jackson, MS, on Friday, February 13, 2015. NOTE: This recording was made with my cellphone in my suit jacket. Consequently, there are clothing-noises and odd sounds related to a bit of an awkward way of recording the speech. You can hear most everything well enough. I thought I should explain, however. My future podcasts will likely be made on a great mic that I now have and that I can use when I'm not giving a formal address at a public function of this kind. </p>",
