  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the great composers, who was born into a family of musicians in Bonn. His grandfather was an eminent musician and also called Ludwig van Beethoven. His father, who was not as talented as Beethoven's grandfather, drank heavily and died when Beethoven was still young. It was his move to Vienna that allowed him to flourish, with the support at first of aristocratic patrons, when that city was the hub of European music. He is credited with developing the symphony further than any who preceded him, with elevating instrumental above choral music and with transforming music to the highest form of art. He composed his celebrated works while, from his late twenties onwards, becoming increasingly deaf.\n\n(Before the live broadcast, BBC Radio 3's Breakfast programme played selections from Beethoven, with Essential Classics playing more, immediately after, on the same network.)\n\nWith \n\nLaura Tunbridge\nProfessor of Music and Henfrey Fellow, St Catherine's College, University of Oxford\n\nJohn Deathridge\nEmeritus King Edward Professor of Music at King's College London\n\nAnd\n\nErica Buurman\nSenior Lecturer in Music, Canterbury Christchurch University\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
