  "description": "Drew Brees is being attacked by the outrage mob for recording an \"anti-gay\" video. In reality, the video promotes the Bible and says nothing at all about gays. We'll discuss how \"anti-gay\" and \"Christian\" have been synonymous terms in our culture. Also, more stores are banning open carry. My opinion on the subject may put me at odds with most conservatives. Date: 09-06-2019\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
