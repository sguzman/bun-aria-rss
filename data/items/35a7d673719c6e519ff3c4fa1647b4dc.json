    "media:description": "This is the legend of George Green (1793 - 1841), a mathematician / physicist, \"son of a miller\". First time going outside to film, and I only have my phone, so I'm really sorry that the video quality is not very good.\n\nGreen's theorem, identities, and functions are immensely useful in 19th century physics, and even in the 20th century for quantum electrodynamics, but not a lot of people know who this person is, unless you have been to college or uni. When Albert Einstein, Julian Schwinger, Lord Kelvin, Sturm and Liouville all speak very highly of Green, yet not everyone knows who he is, is a little bit sad... This is really an injustice, so I hope to bring this mathematician to more attention so that people recognise his efforts in mathematical physics. \n\nThis video was made because I remember my lecturer talked about George Green only being a miller while he discovered Green's theorem, so I decided to look more into the story and continued to be amazed. Hopefully you are as well!\n\n(Please don't tell the Cambridge University Library about this, because I don't think posting stuff about the library on the internet is allowed. Shhhhh...)\n\nThis is hopefully a new side of Mathemaniac you haven't seen before, but the next video is going to be a more typical one. There are loads of stuff that I came across in the research, primarily by reading Cannell's biography, that I haven't put into the video, just because I don't feel like this is too relevant to the whole story, but this is just to tell you that there is a lot more history going on behind the scenes, e.g. why did Green use Leibniz notation throughout the paper, while the majority of the UK was still using Newton's notation? If you want to know, refer to the biography!\n\nCorrection: 9:25 The German journal name should be Klassiker der Exacten Wissenschaf*t*en instead.\n\nSOURCES:\n1) Cannell, D.
