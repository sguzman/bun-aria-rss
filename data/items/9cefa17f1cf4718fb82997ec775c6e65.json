  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Radio Host Bill Cunningham fills in. The Democrats have been attacking minorities, especially in urban neighborhoods, for decades. Cities like Chicago, Detroit, and New York city have suffered greatly under the policies and control of leftwing Democrat politicians. The KKK is an outgrowth of the Democrats, yet many African Americans support them anyway. The majority of welfare recipients are white and they too lend the unwavering support to the Democrats so that the checks keep coming in. The Marxist idea of dependence on government is the common thread amongst all of these scenarios. Then, Joe Biden flip-flops on his support for the Hyde Amendment and Mitt Romney hints that he won't support President Trump's re-election despite the support Trump gave to Romney in his Senate run. Later Bill delves into the media's hypocrisy and how great American health care is. It's so great that people are sneaking into the country to benefit from it.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
