  "description": "<p>    Matt kicks things off with a really interesting story about how a girl and a trip to Italy changed him from a D1 lacrosse player at BC to an actor in NYC. How Georgianne Walken caused him to lose one job, but then got him the gig of a lifetime on the Sopranos. He also shares stories about his first day on set and his audition where he got a rare pat on the back from David Chase. </p><p>     Then Chris Caldovino joins the podcast. Chris followed Terry Winter from NY to LA and was the only other client of Terry’s fake agency. When Chris was hired for the Sopranos he got the role of Billy Saragusa…But after one day the writers changed his name to Billy Leaotardo and that’s the way it stayed. Chris may be the only person killed by Steve Buscemi in two different shows! </p><p>    BTW ever since the Milton Berle huge cock episode we've been getting a lot of e-mails and Steve is finally going to set the record straight about who’s packing in Hollywood. The Golden Poddy awards have been released and you’ll be surprised at what Talking Sopranos has been nominated for. It’s all this week plus the episode breakdown of “Where’s Johnny?” on Talking Sopranos Ep #56 S5-E6.
