  "description": "<p>Mayim opens up about her days on Blossom, how she started in the industry, and the huge pressures and expectations she faced. Jaleel discusses the path which led him to fame as a teenager and talks about what it was like to have so much power at a young age. Both experienced a sense of being owned by the industry and the public and share how they were trained to be deferential to adults. While they both experienced unique opportunities, including stories of 90's NBA all star games with Michael Jordan, and stories with Karl Malone and Penny Hardaway, the conversation turns to one about Jaleel’s identity as a young black man in a predominantly white industry and the impact this had on his mental health and his outlook on his career. </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
