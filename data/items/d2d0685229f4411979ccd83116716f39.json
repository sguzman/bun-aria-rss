And improved their calculation accuracy, so that they are in better agreement with the experimental data. By calculating the improved formulas, the neutron lifetime is 877.7495 &#55349;&#56416;, and the gravitational constant is 6.6742986&#215;10&#8722;11 &#55349;&#56410;3/(&#55349;&#56408;&#55349;&#56404;&#183;&#55349;&#56416;2).\n  \n   "
