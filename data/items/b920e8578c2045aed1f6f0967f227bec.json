Gould says the show never would have made it to the air when there were only three networks on TV and praises the fact that nearly \"all programs are niche programs\" in 2017. He also explains why it's important for content creators to be adaptable but not slaves to new modes of viewing TV, and reflects on the seven years he spent writing for \"The Simpsons.\" Plus: Why he still does stand-up comedy and how he sneaks his politics into shows without turning them into lectures.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
