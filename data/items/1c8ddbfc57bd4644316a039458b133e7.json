  "description": "<p>Tricia Donegan took me upstairs to the roof of her yoga studio on the Lower East Side to tell me all about how she got started in yoga. She ran the studio and the classes that I took most during Sober Octobert. Tricia is a really kind-hearted person who always made me feel warm before and after I got hot. It's an interested conversation with a non-comic about the stretchy arts.</p>",
