  "description": "It is ALL SORTS OF HOT, MUGGY, STICKY & HUMID in Seoul, but we cool down with ITZY’s comeback song ICY (3:03). See what we did there? Also, would you ever tell someone you LIKE THEIR FACE? Woosung clearly does a lot with his new song Face (10:03), while singer-songwriter Davii walks through random places by himself in Nothing Without You (15:05). In other fascinating parts of this episode, Eric discusses the discrepancies between English and Korean titles, mayhaps spoils Tablo’s entire new show podcast, and teases a new Catching Up with Peniel of BtoB - who just released a new single Fly23. #itzy #woosung #davii #peniel #btob\n \n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
