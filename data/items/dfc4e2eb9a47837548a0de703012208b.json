  "description": "<p>Former National Football League running back Robert Smith joins Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams to discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including why he walked away from pro sports in what seemed like the prime of his career. Smith also talks about why players are reluctant to disclose outside interests to their coaches, who often times would prefer to have players myopically focused on football. Also talked about is Smith's venture, The Fan Health Network, which is backed by the NFL Players Association's accelerator, the One Team Collective. Smith also discusses his time at Ohio State, his lack of success against rival Michigan, and the odd touchdown record that he doubts will ever be broken. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams </p><p>Producer: Colin Tipton</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
