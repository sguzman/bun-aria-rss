  "description": "The conclusion to this horrific case is finally here. Tonight we talk about Oklahoma's most massive manhunt, we discuss the mounting evidence against Gene Leroy Hart and we discuss some questionable police work that may have cost them their case in the end. Unfortunately, this case technically remains unsolved, despite many attempts to get something from the DNA evidence that was poorly stored for so many years. It's a tragedy that hopefully will one day have some real closure. \n\n<br>\nSources for these episodes:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Camp-Scott-Murders-1977-Scout/dp/150015735X/ref=sr_1_3?crid=FD24WLARPMR0&dchild=1&keywords=someone+cry+for+the+children&qid=1609727505&sprefix=someone+cry+for+the%2Caps%2C148&sr=8-3\" target=\"_blank\">The Camp Scott Murders by C.S.
