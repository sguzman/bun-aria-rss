  "description": "Si is about to bring Willie's ban hammer down on him. The boys talk about Christmas gifts, a girl who's creeped out by her mother-in-law, fishing tips, Godwin's smoked bologna, and the secret to eating leftover fried shrimp. There's one piece of fishing equipment Stone adamantly opposes. Stone's waders fill up with liquid, but it's not water. The boys shout out the only man they know who can cut a steak on his belly. Stone demos the new Phil Robertson Pro Series duck call. And John-David asks everyone for their New Year's resolutions.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
