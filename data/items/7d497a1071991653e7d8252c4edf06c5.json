  "description": "At 43 years old, Byron Katie was unhappily married, suffered from depression and agoraphobia and was addicted to codeine and alcohol.  In fact, she felt so much self-hatred, she slept on the floor believing she did not deserve a bed. Yet in the midst of her crisis, she awoke one morning in a halfway house, with a sense of pure joy.  A switch had been flipped and all her suffering disappeared. It had become evident to her that her thoughts were causing all her emotional pain and she had finally broken free. Katie believes she has been given a gift and now spends her life trying to help end suffering for others.\nPlug Zone\nThe Work of Byron Katie: https://thework.com/\nBooks: https://www.amazon.com/Byron-Katie/e/B001H6S8B4\nTwitter: @ByronKatie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theworkofbyronkatie/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8dvufocK9zM6KnkronGbzA\nThe Work App: https://thework.com/the-work-app/\n***VOICEMAILS***\nHave a question for Dan?
