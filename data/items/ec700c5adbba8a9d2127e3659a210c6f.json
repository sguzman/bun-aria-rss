  "description": "<p>Woody Allen says the new HBO Max documentary about him is a hatchet job, and Kirk's tempted to agree. Broncos Country Tonight host Benjamin Allbright is back in our lives after he threatened to take food out of the mouths of the children of David Sisneros, a Denver area blogger (0:16:00). Kirk, Blind Mike, and Steve revisit August 2019, when Chaps and Kmarko tried to get Steve fired over Allbright, leading Kirk to heroically lay down his job in order to protect his shit head producer. Sisneros and his wife Nikki join the show (0:28:40). Will anyone at KOA answer for Benjamin's transgressions? Labor Secretary Marty Walsh might have moved on from Boston, but Steve's all-important FOIA request still haunts him.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
