  "description": "A special \"versus\" episode is here! Today, we debate several of the hottest topics in the tech world. First up, Epic Games and Fortnite are engaged in legal warfare with heavyweights Apple and Google. Next, we invite studio members Vinh Dang and Brandon Havard onto the podcast to discuss the battle of the newest mirrorless cameras out right now: the Canon EOS R5 and the Sony a7S iii. Finally, we debate the feature we'd most like in a smartphone: an extra large battery or a battery that charges super fast. Strap in. This is a fun one.\n\nLinks:\nhttps://twitter.com/wvfrm \nhttps://twitter.com/mkbhd \nhttps://twitter.com/andymanganelli \nhttps://www.instagram.com/wvfrmpodcast/ \nshop.mkbhd.com \nMusic by KamrenB: https://spoti.fi/2WRJOFh \nCaptain Dissillusion: https://bit.ly/2Yig0Cq \nRene Ritche Epic vs Apple: https://bit.ly/2EnDKOi   \nWild Wild Tech Podcast:  https://bit.ly/WildWildTech  \n\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
