Cinematographer Ian Dodd questioned whether he would ever be ‘man enough’ sexually, but that changed when he and his badass wife Margot opened up their 30 year marriage. Diving deep into polyamory & kink, they planned a Joshua Tree Forgy (c’mon, you know what that is) with lovers. But when Ian’s date cancels, he finds inspiration in a 1970’s TV commercial and conspires to make Margot’s secret fantasy come true. #DoublePenetration #WoundsAndScars #WaxPlay #Flogger #Rope #Submissive #Erotica #BodiceRipper</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>About the storyteller:</strong></p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>Ian Dodd lived in Los Angeles where he worked telling other people’s stories visually, as a cinematographer. He had always wanted to learn to share his own stories, so after attending a number of Bawdy live shows, he signed up for Dixie’s storytelling workshop retreat in the spring of 2019.  Ian won Best of Bawdy 2020 - where listeners vote for their favorite tellers - and told this story onstage in San Francisco at our last pre-Pandemic show.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>He is now retired and lives in Joshua Tree with his wife, Margot.</strong></p> <p class=\"p4\"> </p> <p class=\"p5\"><strong>Song: ‘Margot’ (custom song written by Jefferson Bergey)</strong></p> <p class=\"p5\"><strong>Links for Jefferson Bergey:<br /> Website: http://jeffersonbergey.com/<br /> Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/jeffersonbergey/</strong></p> <p class=\"p5\"><strong>Jefferson Bergey’s ‘Risqué show happens every Monday evening from 7 - 8:30 PM PST on YouTube, Facebook & Instagram, and it features many of the songs he’s written for Bawdy.
