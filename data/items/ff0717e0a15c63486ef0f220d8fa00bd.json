McDormand plays a person on the outskirts of life, struggling to survive and connect with a world she no longer feels a part of.  But does she even want that connection?  Then it’s on to Florida via Nebraska with Barb and Starbara and their trip to Vista Del Mar in ‘Barb and Star Go To Vista Del Mar’.  Funny stuff or cringey non-comedy?  There’s the venerable review of the big releases on Physical Media, with the Streaming and Straight to DVD Picks of the Week.
