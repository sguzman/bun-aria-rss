  "description": "<p>Today’s episode is opened up by our Canadian pal Gumpy as he gets caught on the hot mic talking about his experience fighting against mammoth like back hair. The boys jump right into the latest updates on their show as Connor has been flying through The Supranos, finishing season 1 and letting the boys know what he’s expecting next. We then jump into the Pod FOD which is made up of all things around the internet sent in by the viewers. Today’s FoOd consists of a South side Pittsburgh fake Burger King, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Afflecks latest romances, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis refusing to bath their children, an update on the crazy happening in New York City and much much more.
