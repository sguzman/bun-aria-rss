How do we maintain what we've worked so hard to achieve? Today we talk about how to continually be aimed at minimalism and some of the lifestyle shifts and changes that will help keep us in the minimalist lifestyle we desire!</p><p>Sponsors: </p><ul><li>.

We’ve kept him alive for a full year and I am impressed. I’ve been dreaming about throwing him a first birthday since before he was born because let’s be honest, a 1st birthday isn’t for the kid, it’s for the parents. I bought space decorations because people on Facebook looked at me weird for asking if I could have their decorations. 1st birthdays, I will give anyone these decorations when I’m done with them.1st Birthdays</li></ul><p>Our Other Minimalism Episodes: </p><p>Ep 32 with Joshua Becker author of </p><p><a href='https://www.frugalfriendspodcast.com/episode-32-minimalism-with-joshua-becker/'>Ep 32 with Joshua Becker author of </a></p><p><a href='https://www.frugalfriendspodcast.com/episode-89-letting-go-of-material-possessions-to-save-money-w-desirae-endres/'>Ep 89 with Desirae Endres host of the  Minimalish podcast </a></p><p><a href='https://www.frugalfriendspodcast.com/episode-99-contentment-gratitude-flexible-minimalism-within-frugality/'>Ep 99 on contentment, gratitude and flexible minimalism.</a></p><p><a href='https://www.frugalfriendspodcast.com/episode-32-minimalism-with-joshua-becker/'>Ep 32 with Joshua Becker author of 'The More of Less'</a></p><p><a href='https://www.frugalfriendspodcast.com/episode-89-letting-go-of-material-possessions-to-save-money-w-desirae-endres/'>Ep 89 with Desirae Endres host of the  Minimalish podcast </a></p><p><a href='https://www.frugalfriendspodcast.com/episode-99-contentment-gratitude-flexible-minimalism-within-frugality/'>Ep 99 on contentment, gratitude and flexible minimalism</a></p><p>Notable Notes:</p><p>What the Internet has to say:</p><ul><li>This article from <a href='https://www.becomingminimalist.com/momentum/'>Becoming Minimalist</a> describes ways to keep the minimalism momentum going!</li></ul><p>What Jen+Jill have to say:</p><ul><li>Continue to explore new opportunities + intentional living so as to not fall into old patterns</li><li>Take better care of your things</li><li>Volunteer!</li><li>Start a blog</li><li>Give</li><li>Start a daily habit</li></ul><p>More from the Internet:</p><ul><li>This article from <a h=''></a></li></ul><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
