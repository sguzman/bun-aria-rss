  "title": "143 - America's Homeless Epidemic",
  "description": "<p>Really hope you enjoy this one. One of my favorite episodes so far. Such a big topic that touches so many lives. What is the history of homelessness in America? Why are people homeless now? Who is homeless now? What is being done to help the homeless? What COULD be done to help? I touch on mental health issues, substance abuse, economic conditions, good ol' fashioned laziness, and more. I also share a lot of personal homeless encounters and really try to look at this issues from as many sides as possible, and as fairly as possible, on this little edition of Timesuck that feels almost, dare I say it, important.
