Stu and Pat rank the states on how they handled the pandemic over the past year. President Biden is taking credit for Trump’s vaccine success, and Pat and Stu explain why that’s ludicrous. After she defended Piers Morgan, Sharon Osbourne’s career may be over. Democrats are targeting the filibuster, and Republicans promise retaliation if they succeed. The crisis at the border is only getting worse, and Biden finally addressed it … sort of. AOC’s \"crying\" photos are even more cringeworthy today. After Biden’s first press conference is announced, Pat and Stu discuss whether Americans mind Biden being hidden from the public.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
