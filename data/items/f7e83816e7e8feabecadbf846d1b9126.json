  "description": "When Marcela Sulak was planning classes in the MFA program she directs at Bar Ilan University, it became clear that the traditional prose/poetry binary was not going to work. In both her own and her students’ writing, there was a tendency to complicate the binary, to produce literary writing that hybridized many established forms and genres. And so there was a real, practical need for a text to instruct from that would define literary hybridity, and model new hybrid forms. And there wasn’t one. As a teacher, then, and not just a poet, Dr. Sulak literally wrote the book on hybrid literature, with co-author Jacqueline Kolosov: Family Resemblance: An Anthology and Exploration of 8 Hybrid Literary Genres (Rose Metal Press, 2015).\n\n\n\nWhen people ask, Phillip Witteveen usually says he’s “temping at a tech startup.”Outside of work, he’s trying to write fiction and for screen.
