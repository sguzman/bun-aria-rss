  "description": "Let's be honest - if you're here listening to this podcast, it's probably because you know me from my social media following. I get a lot of questions all the time about how I grew my following, or whether I can share tips or \"secrets\" to reach a million+ followers. I want to speak on that today, but I want to do it in a way where, you're not focusing on what other people think, but instead you treat social media as a tool to help you be your greatest self. Believe me, it's harder than it sounds, but we're going to tackle it, together.\nIt's Rehab Time. Let's get it.\n--\nTo celebrate the launch of my brand-new podcast, I'm offering listeners a special discount on ALL merch in my online store.
