Some of those messages are among <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-there-a-smoking-gun-in-the-january-6th-investigation\">the thousands of documents that Meadows handed over</a> to the House select committee investigating the events of January 6th. They reveal that Meadows was in touch with the organizers of the Stop the Steal Rally—which precipitated the riot—as well as with several Fox News personalities, conservative activists, and Donald Trump, Jr, who told Meadows that his father “has to lead now.” After surrendering the documents, Meadows suddenly announced that he would not testify before the panel. On Tuesday night, the House voted to recommend holding Meadows in criminal contempt of Congress, and referred his case to the Justice Department for prosecution. <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/susan-b-glasser\">Susan B.
