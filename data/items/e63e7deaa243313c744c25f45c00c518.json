  "description": "The study of Palestine and Israel has been largely shaped by the politics of the conflict and thus, many scholars start with political history, often using Israeli state sources. Maha Nassar, in Brothers Apart: Palestinian Citizens of Israel and the Arab World (Stanford University Press, 2017), looks specifically at the larger context of Palestinian citizens of Israel, those Palestinians who stayed behind after the 1948 war simultaneously created the state of Israel and created refugees out of thousands of Palestinians. Brothers Apart looks at their position within Israeli society, their intellectual production, and their relationship to the greater Arab world. Nassar also examines the relationship between different ideologies amongst these Palestinian citizens of Israel, as well as the issue of Palestinian resistance. She thus tells the story of a people who are caught between different intellectual and political commitments, yet who are also dedicated to fighting for their rights within Israeli society and for the greater Palestinian cause.\n\n\n\nNadirah Mansour is a graduate student at Princeton University’s Department of Near Eastern Studies working on the global intellectual history of the Arabic-language press. She tweets @NAMansour26 and produces another Middle-East and North Africa-related podcast: Reintroducing.\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
