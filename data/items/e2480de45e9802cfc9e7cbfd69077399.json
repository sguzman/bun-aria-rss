  "description": "<p>Jai Bhavnani is the Co-Founder of Rari Capital, the DAO behind a quickly growing suite of DeFi protocols. Most popular is Fuse, the open interest rate protocol that allows users to lend and borrow digital assets. As Fuse approaches $1B total value locked, Rari recently announced permissionless Fuse pool creation. This means that anyone with liquidity can create a money market for their digital asset of choice.</p> <p>Rari finds itself at the center of what is being described as DeFi 2.0, a loose collection of newer DeFi protocols which orbit around novel tokenomics, game theory, and memes. Tune in to find out where Rari sits among resident DeFi blue chips, and the future of young people pioneering in the crypto space.</p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎖 CLAIM YOUR BADGE: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/-guide-2-using-the-bankless-badge\"> https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/-guide-2-using-the-bankless-badge</a> <br />  ------<br /> 📣 ZERION | Your Gateway to the Metaverse!<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Zerion\">https://bankless.cc/Zerion</a> <br />  ------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>💰 GEMINI | FIAT & CRYPTO EXCHANGE<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/go-gemini%E2%80%8B\">https://bankless.cc/go-gemini​</a> </p> <p>💧LIDO | DECENTRALIZED STAKING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Lido\">https://bankless.cc/Lido</a> </p> <p>👻 AAVE | LEND & BORROW ASSETS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/aave\">https://bankless.cc/aave</a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants/dharma\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants/dharma</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 10:00 Jai Bhavnani<br /> 16:22 Rari Capital<br /> 20:47 The Long Tail & Risk<br /> 29:02 Assessing Risk & Yield<br /> 33:08 Total Value Locked<br /> 38:46 Roadmap<br /> 44:00 ZoomerFi, DeFi 2.0<br /> 52:47 Build Fast, Break Fast<br /> 58:19 Crossing $1B<br /> 1:00:51 Regulation & Zoomers<br /> 1:04:54 What's Left to Build?<br /> 1:08:12 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Jai on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/jai_bhavnani?s=20\">https://twitter.com/jai_bhavnani?s=20</a> </p> <p>Rari Capital:<br /> <a href=\"https://rari.capital/\">https://rari.capital/</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
