    "media:description": "This video is part of a raw unedited lecture series about traditional mechanisms and mechanical systems given by Professor Jonathan Hopkins at UCLA. Specifically, Topic 7 discusses how free-body diagrams can be used to calculate all internal and external loads acting on a general mechanism. Graphical methods are also introduced.\n\nAdditional course resources are posted to Professor Hopkinsâ€™ website:\nwww.flexible.seas.ucla.edu\n\nDisclaimer: \nResponsibility for the content of this video is my own.
