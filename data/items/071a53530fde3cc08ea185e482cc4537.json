  "description": "In her book Captured Landscape: Architecture and the Enclosed Garden (Routledge, 2018; 2nd edition), Kate Baker discusses the continuing relevance of the typology of the enclosed garden to contemporary architects by exploring influential historical examples and the concepts they generate, alongside some of the best of contemporary designs – brought to life with vivid photography and detailed drawings – taken primarily from Britain, the Mediterranean, Japan and North and South America. She argues that understanding the potential of the enclosed garden requires us to think of it as both a design and an experience.\nKate Baker is an architect and has been a lecturer at the University of Portsmouth, UK, and previously at Cambridge University, UK. Before that, she was partner in an architectural practice. She is an active researcher in both architecture and landscape, and our sensory relationship with space.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
