  "title": "How to Use Sketchbooks to Develop Ideas [ep: 111]",
  "description": "<p>We recorded this episode in response to a listener question about the ways in which we both use sketchbooks. The ensuing discussion demonstrated how different we are in this regard. Louise uses many of her sketchbooks as judgement-free playgrounds, places in which to relax and explore while Alice does this kind of work on loose sheets of paper and keeps her sketchbook for a more thoughtful development of ideas. We both also have a practice of journalling about our art, although again in slightly different ways. During today's chat, we also share how we've worked in the past, debate our favourite sketchbooks, and share the different ways that our sketchbook work feeds into our finished paintings. As always, we agree that sketchbooks are intensely personal - there is no right or wrong - and we hope our ideas help to make sense of your own feelings about your sketchbooks (or lack thereof!)</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Seawhite sketchbooks (regular): <a href=\"//\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/SEAWHITE-Hardback-Artists-Sketchbook-195X195/dp/B0067JPQR0</a></p>\n<p>Seawhite concertina: <a href=\"//\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seawhite-A5-Concertina-Sketchbook-Case/dp/B00BUPIPMO</a></p>\n<p>Moleskine sketchbooks: <a href=\"//\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=moleskin+art+sketchbook&adgrpid=54075308395</a></p>\n<p>Stillman & Birn books: <a href=\"//\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=Stillman+%26+Birn&ref=bl_dp_s_web_3818381031</a></p>\n<p>Hannemuehle sketchbooks: <a href=\"//\">https://www.hahnemuehle.com/en/artist-papers/sketch-drawing/sketch-books.html</a></p>\n<p>Handbook sketchbooks: <a href=\"//\">https://www.jacksonsart.com/brands/hand-book-journal-company</a></p>\n<p>Robert Motherwell Storming the Citadel: <a href=\"//\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9V1ccTOBoQ</a></p>\n<p>Artholes Podcast: <a href=\"//\">https://artholespodcast.com/</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/\"><u>www.alicesheridan.com</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
