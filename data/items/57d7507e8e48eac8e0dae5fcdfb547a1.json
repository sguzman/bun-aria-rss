  "description": "Bill Browder tells the story behind the Magnitsky Act that he successfully lobbied governments around the world to introduce. Sergei Magnitsky was Bill's lawyer and was tortured and murdered by the Russian authorities. Bill explains how he went from running the largest foreign portfolio investment fund in Russia to having the company taken over by criminals, getting deported, being found guilty of tax fraud in his absence and having Interpol arrest warrants issued for him. This is an astonishing, heartbreaking and inspiring conversation with someone who has direct personal experience of how corrupt the Russian state is.
