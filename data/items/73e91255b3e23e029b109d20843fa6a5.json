But our ancient ancestors had an in-depth understanding of how to use food and plants as medicine and this wisdom still holds true today. Our conventional medical system heavily relies on prescription medication to silence, or “manage,” symptoms. I call this the “pill-for-ever-ill” model of medicine. This often turns into a lifelong dependence without ever getting to the root of the problem. If we instead look at where the imbalance is stemming from and use a variety of tools to treat it—like food, stress reduction, herbs, etc.—we can see profound improvements and, many times, a reversal of disease.&nbsp;</p><br><p>I was so happy to connect with Dr. Josh Axe to talk more about how ancient remedies can help us create the vibrant health we deserve and avoid lifelong health struggles.
