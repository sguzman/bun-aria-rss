  "itunes:summary": "Mono-Poly is Liquid Architecture’s monthly offering of sonic, filmic and performance experiments hosted at Collingwood Yards. In March 2021, for the first Mono-Poly event, Mara Schwerdtfeger performed an improvisation that utilised viola and artificial reverb to expand the architecture of the performance space. Placing the speakers behind the audience, a separation of dry, acoustic viola with wet, reverb signal attempted to play with the perspective and feeling of the room. This performance was recorded on the 4th of March, 2021.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/mono-poly-march\n\nMono-Poly-March\nThu, 04.
