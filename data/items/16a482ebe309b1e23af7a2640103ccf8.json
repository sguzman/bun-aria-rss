  "title": "Ep. 786 - Psychologist Prescribes Mass Suicide For White People",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a prominent psychologist suggests that white people should kill themselves while another worries that white people are haunted by the “ghosts of whiteness.” It’s just more radical leftism from mental health professionals. The entire industry is rife with it. We’ll talk about the consequences of that fact today. Also, Dr. Fauci endorses vaccine mandates for children and makes a predictably misleading argument in favor of them. A security guard shoots a man because he wasn’t wearing a mask and says it’s self-defense. Hollywood churns out another woke remake. And speaking of Hollywood, why was James Cordon stopping traffic and thrusting his pelvis in the faces of unsuspecting motorists?\nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
