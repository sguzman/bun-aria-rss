He is a great guest and openly shares everything from how <a href= \"http://www.benchmarkwine.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Benchmark</a> procures wine to how they ensure the wines are authentic (provenance) to the important things to know about collectible wine, should you decide to dip into this world.</p> <p> </p> <p>As a bonus, David tells us about the <a href= \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Kurniawan\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Rudy Kurniawan</a> scandal (he knew Rudy!) and he shares great information about how the market works to keep that kind of fraud out of rare wine. </p> <p> </p> <p>As an important program note: I do need to thank <a href= \"http://www.patreon.com/winefornormalpeople\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">the Patrons</a> for encouraging me to have Dave on as a guest and for providing some great questions for this interview.
