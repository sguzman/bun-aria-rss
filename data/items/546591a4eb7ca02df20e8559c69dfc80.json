  "description": "<p>According to the Bible, we don’t <em>have</em> souls, we <em>are</em> souls. And people will live forever not in a disembodied existence as a soul, but in an embodied existence.  So what do we do with physical/body desires like hunger and sex?</p>\n<p>In part 1 (0-9:00) Tim outlines some other uses of the word \"nephesh\" in the Old Testament including translating the word as “person” or “people” and calling kidnappers and murderers “nephesh thief” and “nephesh slayer.”</p>\n<p>In part 2 (9:00-17:25) the guys discuss the uses of “nephesh” when referring to the human physical desires for food or water (like in Psalm 42) and sex.   In Song of Solomon, the erotic love poetry book in the Old Testament, in the original Hebrew, the writer expresses physical desire for their lover using the word “nephesh.”  Tim and Jon discuss why we’ve spiritualized the physical sexual desires of people.</p>\n<p>In the third part (17:25-end) of the episode, Tim explains that animals and immigrants are described as “nephesh” in the Bible and the “righteous” people are called to respect their “nephesh.”  Tim outlines Psalm 35 and explains that the author uses the word “nephesh” in seven different ways in this Psalm.  Tim says it’s a great example of the diversity and depth of the word.</p>\n<p>You can view our video on the word Nephesh here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_igCcWAMAM&index=5&list=PLH0Szn1yYNeclOdfwWBawnNT5ZkGFHxBf</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!
