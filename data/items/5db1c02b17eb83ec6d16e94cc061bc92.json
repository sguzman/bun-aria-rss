While investigating a home robbery, assault and attempted kidnapping of a family in Dublin, California (40 miles away from Vallejo) , Sergeant Carausu became concerned that the suspect they had in custody for that crime might have committed other home invasions. One seemingly small clue that she noticed — a strand of blonde hair stuck to a pair of blacked out goggles — led her on a dogged search for more victims. Misty&nbsp;talks about searching the offender’s home in South Lake Tahoe and paraphernalia that she found which led her to ask more questions about other potentially linked crimes.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The clip used in this episode can be viewed in its entirety here:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/story/survivors-called-girl-case-reflect-life-changing-experience-77964075\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/story/survivors-called-girl-case-reflect-life-changing-experience-77964075</a></p><p><br></p><p>LINK TO VICTIM F BOOK</p><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3fPBbo2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://amzn.to/3fPBbo2</a></p><p><br></p><p>We are so thankful for our sponsors.
