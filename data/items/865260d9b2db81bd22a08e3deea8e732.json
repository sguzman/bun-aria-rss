  "description": "<p>With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its potential\nintegration with the traditional Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs), we have\nwitnessed the emergence of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which promises to\nseamlessly integrate into smart transportation systems. However, the key\ncharacteristics of IoV, such as high-speed mobility and frequent disconnections\nmake it difficult to manage its security and privacy. The Blockchain, as a\ndistributed tamper-resistant ledge, has been proposed as an innovative solution\nthat guarantees privacy-preserving yet secure schemes. In this paper, we review\nrecent literature on the application of blockchain to IoV, in particular, and\nintelligent transportation systems in general.\n</p>",
