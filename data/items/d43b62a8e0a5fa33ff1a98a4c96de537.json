  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Islamo-nazis that have taken American's hostage for hundreds of days, a regime that slaughtered U.S Marines as they slept in their barracks, has shot a U.S aircraft out of the sky. We cannot let Iran, a terrorist regime, act this way without any repercussions. If we do nothing, Iran will test us even further; enemies like China and Russia are watching and they will test us as well. Disgusting comments have been made by former Vice President Biden, Pat Buchannan, and others in order to politicize this attack. Others are saying that this is a false flag set-up by John Kerry and the Democrats which is completely nonsensical and reduces the quality of any intelligent debate. In the past, aggression like this from Iran was met with force by the U.S, in the form of Operation Praying Mantis where the U.S used military action to destroy Iranian oil ships in response to their aggression. Then, Senator Tom Cotton calls in to discuss Iran shooting down an unmanned American aircraft. Cotton says if we don't respond Iran will think they can get away with shooting down a manned aircraft. We must learn from our history so that we don't repeat the errors of our past. Later, President Trump says that no one in his Administration is pressuring him to go to war with Iran.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
