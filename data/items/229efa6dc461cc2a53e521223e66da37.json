It’s no surprise their tastes are completely different but it’s a great reading list so definitely take some notes. After that they get into some of their most embarrassing moments. Steve shares a few stories from the club and the church, while Michael remembers how he ruined a wedding when he worked at a catering hall. \nThen they get into this week’s episode which is a great one. Steve talks about working with the incredible Bert Young and what he was like on set. They share an incredible story about an actor who had “One Line on the Sopranos” and turned it into a viral video and a part on Boardwalk Empire. Michael and Steve also talk about their superstitions, Bigfoot and why you should never pour wine overhand. \nLots to take in on Talking Sopranos Episode #31 “Another Toothpick” S3 E5. \nRemember to subscribe to the Talking Sopranos podcast wherever you get your podcasts and go to talkingsopranos.com to post questions and buy official merchandise. \n",
