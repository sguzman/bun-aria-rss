  "title": "Bonus 22 - Edgar Allan Poe",
  "description": "<p>Edgar Allan Poe did more than write <em>The Raven</em> and look creepy. He also basically invented the modern detective story. He was America's first \"master of suspense\" according to Stephen King and many other modern authors. He changed the way American authors wrote scary stories. He changed the way authors in general approached their craft, both creatively and business-wise. And yet he died penniless after a lifetime of financial struggle. And he married his thirteen-year-old first-cousin and died a mysterious death at forty. We dig into the life and struggle of America's first master of the scary story and talk about how much easier it is to make a living as an artist today as it was during Poe's time, and so much more, today on Timesuck.</p>\n<p>Listen to the end of the show if you need an introduction to Nimrod, Chikatilo, Lucifina, Bojangles, Triple M and more (or just want a refresher).</p>\n<p><strong>Merch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
