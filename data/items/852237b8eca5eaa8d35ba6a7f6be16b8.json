  "description": " The two books in today's episode explore how we construct meaning from the music we listen to. First, record producer Susan Rogers talks to WBUR's Robin Young about her book, <em>This Is What It Sounds Like, </em>which breaks down the science behind what draws different types of listeners to particular songs. Then, author Francesca Royster traces the relationship between Black identity and country music in her book,  <em>Black Country Music: Listening for Revolutions</em>. She tells NPR's Juana Summers that as a queer Black woman, listening to country can feel a lot like coming out. ",
