We demonstrate the importance of angular tetravalent logic in mathematics and theorical physics. As an example, we give a proof of Fermat&#8217;s last theorem using angular tetravalent logic, as suggested by the Ummites. Then, we will pierce the secrets of the universe always using the tetravalent logic, we will explain the reasoning which proves the existence of a twin universe and we give the mathematical formula for the folding of space-time which separates the two twin universes and finally we explain why the curvature of the universe is necessarily negative.\n  \n   "
