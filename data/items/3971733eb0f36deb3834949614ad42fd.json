  "description": "<p class=\"\">It’s February and it’s winter and it’s grey and dark and we’re all just looking for some books that are quick, dirty and delicious. Or, at least, Sarah & Jen are. If you are, too, this is the week for you!</p><p class=\"\">We love having you with us! — subscribe on your favorite podcasting platform and like/review the podcast if you’re so inclined!</p><p class=\"\">Next week, we’re reading the Queen of Dirty Talk! Sarah and Jen both love Tessa Bailey — so we’ll be talking about our two favorites of her books, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bvLWs4\"><em>Asking for Trouble</em></a> (Sarah’s) and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bt3THH\"><em>Protecting What’s His</em></a> (Jen’s). Find them at: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/37hIluj\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Tessa%20Bailey's%20Line%20of%20Duty%20Series%22?Ns=P_Series_Number&Ntk=P_Series_Title&Ntx=mode%20matchall\">Barnes & Noble</a>, <a href=\"https://books.apple.com/us/book/asking-for-trouble/id717856920?app=itunes&at=1l3vpAR&mt=11\">Apple Books</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?fcsearchfield=Series&query=Line%20of%20Duty&seriesId=d9b9b9b4-5bff-53f4-993c-2729d491d143\">Kobo</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\">- Sarah had boozy brunch with the RITA Writer’s Room—<a href=\"https://www.nisha-sharma.com/\">Nisha Sharma</a>, <a href=\"https://www.laquette.com/\">LaQuette</a>, <a href=\"https://adrianaherreraromance.com/\">Adriana Herrera</a>, <a href=\"https://www.andiejchristopher.com/\">Andie Christopher</a>, <a href=\"https://alexisdaria.com/\">Alexis Daria</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.joannashupe.com/\">Joanna Shupe</a> (<a href=\"https://www.thesierrasimone.com/\">Sierra Simone</a> & <a href=\"http://www.traceylivesay.com/\">Tracey Livesay</a> weren't there). You should maybe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nishawrites/status/1155290032422477824\">check out this awesome video</a> of them in all their slow motion glory.</p><p class=\"\">- Jen didn’t know what <a href=\"https://www.sleep.org/articles/what-is-asmr/\">ASMR</a> is either.</p><p class=\"\">- Valentine’s Day is Go Week for Sarah. Jen wrote about <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/happy-galentines-day-romance-readers/\">Galentine’s Day for Kirkus</a>. But one thing we can all agree on: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/is-anna-karenina-a-love-story\">Anna Karenina isn’t a fucking romance</a>. Getting hit by a train does not qualify!</p><p class=\"\">- The 2 for 1 rule: in a male/female romance, she comes twice for every time he comes.</p><p class=\"\">- If you’re in Chicago, you can see Fated Mates Live at <a href=\"https://chicagospringfling.com/\">Spring Fling</a>, and at <a href=\"https://info.harpercollins.com/kisscon/\">KissCon</a>, it’ll be a podcast ménage special with us, the <a href=\"https://wickedwallflowersclub.com/\">Wicked Wallflowers</a>, and <a href=\"http://heavingbosomspodcast.com/\">Heaving Bosoms</a> podcast.</p><p class=\"\">- What will Craven Day 2021 bring? Stay tuned.</p><p class=\"\">- Sarah’s friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LadyHawkins\">Rachel Hawkins</a> told Sarah to read A Heart of Blood and Ashes by <a href=\"https://millavane.com/\">Milla Vane</a>, which is a pen name for Meljean Brook, author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/32aqa91\">The Iron Duke</a>. Is there <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1228791597778788352\">danger banging</a>? Yes. Is there vengeance banging? Also yes.</p><p class=\"\">- Jen read and loved White Out by <a href=\"https://www.adrianaanders.com/\">Adriana Anders</a>, which is a romantic suspense novel that takes place in Antarctica. It’s cold, but they still manage to danger bang.</p><p class=\"\">- Speaking of Danger Banging, Jen’s favorite is in the first of the Kinky Bank Robbers series by <a href=\"https://annikamartinbooks.com/\">Annika Martin</a>. It's honestly more like heat-stroke banging.</p><p class=\"\">- Jen and Sarah don’t think a quick and dirty read has to be InstaLust, but it does have to get right to the <a href=\"https://narrativefirst.com/articles/plot-points-and-the-inciting-incident/\">inciting incident</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- Sarah recommends London Hale (a pen name for authors Ellis Lee and Brighton Walsh) as a reliable quick and dirty read. Start with <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2V7cKcm\">The DILF</a> (if you're ok with taboo) or <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2wy7m85\">Talk Dirty To Me</a> (if you'd prefer something a bit further left on the Simone Scale).</p><p class=\"\">- <a href=\"https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/top-reasons-adopt-pet\">Adopt don’t shop</a> when it comes to real pet stores.</p><p class=\"\">- <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/baby/breastfeeding-vs-formula-feeding#1\">Breastfeed if you can and if you want to</a>, but if you can’t that’s fine, too. Even if you live in Fucking <a href=\"https://www.movoto.com/guide/berkeley-ca/berkeley-stereotypes/\">Berkeley</a>. Or the Berkeley of <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/ujY4u\">Brooklyn</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- Some other of our favorite quick and dirty reads that are mostly in space: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ucAkJL\">Grace Goodwin’s Interstellar Brides</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2P6d1sk\">Ruby Dixon’s Ice Planet Barbarians</a>. But if you’re reading the Ice Planet Barbarians,please listen to our friend Dani’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iceplanetpod\">Ice Planet Pod</a>. It’s great.</p><p class=\"\">- More space romances: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/329e7sp\">Laurann Donner’s New Species series</a>, or <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2V0P5KJ\">Cavas</a>, the one that appeared recently on the USA Today Bestseller list (not the New York Times, Jen misspoke) is one from the Vorge Series. Cynthia Sax has a whole cyborg series. Jen also really liked The Grabbed series by Lolita Lopez.</p><p class=\"\">- What we're trying to say is that these books are the romance equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/fast-and-furious-movies-ranked-worst-best-hobbs-shaw/\">The Fast and the Furious series</a>--which is the pinnacle of Jen's favorite movie genre, \"Handsome men blow things up.\"</p><p class=\"\"> - Finally, check out <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SWfsid\">Brill Harper’s alphamallow series</a>. But Jen’s favorite was Altogether, which is very, very hot. Yum. This <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Plow\">Mr. Plow</a> is <em>not quite</em> as hot; unless your name is Marge, of course.</p><p class=\"\">- Buy<a href=\"https://www.jenreadsromance.com/shop\"> buttons and stickers from Kelly</a> and <a href=\"https://jordandene.com/collections/romance-sarah-maclean\">t-shirts and totes from Jordandene</a>.</p>",
