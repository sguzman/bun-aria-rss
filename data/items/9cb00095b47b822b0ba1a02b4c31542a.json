  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys discuss Dave Bautista's acting chops, Gumpy gives a review of the ABC critically acclaimed series, Big Sky, and through osmosis, Zito somehow infects Nick's brain. Plus the guys go into the Pod FOD and discuss the best type of pizza, arguably the final nail in movie theaters' coffin, whether or not Zito knows there is a fairly simple treatment for GAHT, why everyone thinks Billy Tubes has a lot of Thibs from Waco in him, and much more. Plus Nick closes the show with a couple more selections for Friday Bangerz to help propel you into the greatest weekend ever.
