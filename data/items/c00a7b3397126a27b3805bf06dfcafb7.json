  "description": "Emily explains how to navigate through all the online dating lies out there! If he seems too good to be true, he just might be. He's probably not as rich, handsome, tall and dapper as his profile suggests. Here's how to tell the online dating lies from the truth.

Should you send a naked photo to someone? Do men care about lingerie? Or do they just want to see you naked? Are hand jobs really that bad? And when is it time to pick up a hobby other than masturbation?
