  "description": "<p>This week, Cathy invites Priya Krishna to the studio for a chat about her latest book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Indian-ish-Recipes-Antics-Modern-American/dp/1328482472\">Indian-ish</a>: Recipes and Antics from A Modern American Family, which she co-wrote with her mother, Ritu Krishna. Priya cuts to the chase about why her mom's cooking is considered American, and why this cookbook should be seen as an American rather than Indian cookbook. She also shares some background stories on the making of many of her mom's classic dishes, like roti pizza, impossibly fluffy pancakes using Bisquick and no eggs, and endive cups with minced tofu inspired by an appetizer at P.F. Chang's.</p>\n<p><em>Eat Your Words</em> is powered by <a href=\"http://simplecast.com\">Simplecast</a>.</p>\n",
