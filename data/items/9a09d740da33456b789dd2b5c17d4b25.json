The nature that exists outside of us also lives within us. Separation is an illusion.</p><p>Indeed, we are all intrinsically connected — to each other and the world that surrounds us. Embracing this fundamental truth lies at the core of ultimate well-being. Because true health doesn't stop at the kale salad — it requires fidelity to our natural rhythms and a comprehensive, holistic devotion to bettering and balancing not just our physical bodies, but our mental, emotional, and spiritual selves as well.</p><p>Returning to the podcast to walk us through this powerful law of nature is Colin Hudon.</p><p>A gifted healer, physician of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Taoist Arts,&nbsp;Colin is also an herbalist, acupuncturist, tea master, and founder of <a href=\"http://www.livingtea.net\" target=\"_blank\">Living Tea,</a> an enterprise that finds Colin traveling across China, Taiwan, and Malaysia multiple times a year&nbsp;to source and import the finest and rarest old-growth teas and teaware in the world, sharing his expertise and wares in group tea ceremonies, with an eye on opening a tea house in Colorado in 2018.</p><br><p>On point and remarkably instructive, this episode is lifted from Colin's open dissertation conducted during our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ourplantpowerworld.com\" target=\"_blank\">Plantpower Ireland</a> retreat this past July.</p><p>Most of us live lost in our heads. A predisposition that leaves us disconnected from ourselves, others, and the world. This is about transcending our&nbsp;addiction&nbsp;to thought and information, and how to leverage mindfulness and awareness to live healthier and more fully actualized.</p><p>Colin also delivers an amazing primer on what we can glean from Traditional Chinese methods of medicine and healing. A perspective that begins with embracing seasonal rhythms to live in better alignment with the laws of nature.</p><p>In addition, it's also about tea. How tea, and the traditional ceremony around its enjoyment can serve as a powerful, moving meditation — an expression of living art&nbsp;that soothes the soul and enhances vitality.</p><p>In anticipation of this episode, Colin was cool enough to create a special offer for listeners to purchase his amazing <a href=\"https://www.livingtea.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Living Tea</a> (the only tea I drink) at reduced prices, including an awesome new subscription service called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.livingtea.net/products/subscription\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Club,</a>&nbsp;which takes the guesswork out of differentiating his exotic teas. When you sign up, Colin will send you the best seasonably appropriate, rare, old-growth teas (3-4 teas per season) quarterly, plus a bundle of extras, including information on the tea’s origin, optimal brewing techniques and Chinese medical philosophy on how to live a healthy, longevity focused life, including food suggestions and more. When you add the promo code RICHROLL at checkout listeners will get 12% off on your first season.
