  "description": "<p>Excited to bring you another Fencing interview today and our first interview with an athlete who is just back from Tokyo as we chat with Canadian foil fencer Alanna Goldie. Alanna gives us a great insight into how coming from a fencing family helped get her into the sport, and why she was so keen to start earlier than she could. We also learn about her experiences competing at the Youth Olympics back in 2010 and how that helped her when it came to competing at the full Olympics 11 years later, as well as how she was able to overcome the disappointment of not making Rio in 2016 to help spur her on towards her eventual Tokyo ticket. Added to this we learn more about her special friend Albert, some new epic ways to improve team fencing and just how she is a global trend setter. It’s an epic interview that you simply can’t miss!</p>",
