  "description": "<p>Money anxiety is something we have all experienced in one way or another. Whether it’s student loans, trying to save up enough for a car, or even having enough money to make it to the end of the month- this stress is a very real thing. Covid-19 and its effects on our economy and our jobs have only exacerbated the issue. According to a recent Qualtrics report, 67% of people say they have higher levels of stress since the beginning of the health crisis. And money anxiety doesn’t just plague low-income earners. More personal stories and accounts have been shared in recent years of “rich” people willing to admit their own money anxieties: individuals making $100k or more are just as susceptible to living paycheck to paycheck. So in this episode we dive into some of the symptoms of money anxiety and then we recommend some practical steps we could all implement into our lives to reduce the amount of stress surrounding our personal finances.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Sour Opal by Firestone Walker- thanks to our friend Josh for donating it to the show!
