  "description": "In this episode of Deep State Radio, a discussion about the state of the rudderless, visionless Middle East (and America's rudderless, visionless foreign policy) leads Rosa Brooks to frame that the core idea behind modern US foreign policy should be \"strategic muddling through.\"  Our panel of Rosa, Kori Schake, MacKenize Eaglen, and host, David Rothkopf, discuss.  While all agree its how most of we who reside in the Deep State manage our personal lives, there is disagreement about the implications.  Good for China?  Good for Russia and Iran?  Bad for our Arab allies?  Maybe all of the above?  Or is it still, as Kori concludes, the best of all times to be an American?
