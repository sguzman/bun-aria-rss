  "description": "There have been innumerable attempts to silence the voices of our ancestors, especially the stories of enslaved Black women. While we hear about the realities they faced of sexual violence and exploitation, there’s a layer not readily discussed. And in that hidden layer are the many ways Black women resisted enslavement while navigating within it. This episode we sit down with Dr. Heather Finch, professor of literature at Belmont University, to learn the resistance of enslaved women and the strategies we can apply today.\nBHY is produced by PushBlack, the nation's largest non-profit Black media company - hit us up at BlackHistoryYear.com and share this with your people!\nPushBlack exists because we saw we had to take this into our own hands.
