  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zach is keeping it short and simple and getting straight to the point. Ego is NOT your enemy. Zach is no stranger to having his back against the wall, and he knows that’s when you need to go all in on yourself. We all have an ego, it’s how we use it that matters.  People will tell you ego is bad, but that’s because they’re letting it get to their head and thinking they’re unstoppable.  When used correctly, our ego is literally designed to protect us. You have to keep it on a tight leash; know when to release it and know when to reel it in.  </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’d like to learn more about how to utilize your ego and build a life that fulfills you, get your tickets to the Alpha Underdog Empowerment event at</span> <a href=\"http://www.underdogempowerment.com/aue\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">www.underdogempowerment.com/aue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How to use your ego to get ahead.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How your ego can get you in trouble.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What to expect at the upcoming Alpha Underdog Empowerment event.</span></li> </ul> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m here to help you unleash that alpha, and do everything they said you’d never be able to do.” - Zach Babcock</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Connect with Zach:</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/realzachbabcock/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/realzachbabcock/?hl=en\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get podcasting help</span> <a href=\"https://podcastpowertrain.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to grow your business</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><br /> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!
