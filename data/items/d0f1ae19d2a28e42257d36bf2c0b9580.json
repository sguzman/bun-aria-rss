  "description": "<p>BROCKHAMPTON's original members formed after posting on a Kanye West fan message board in 2010, and then started making music in The Woodlands, Texas. Since then, they’ve turned the idea of a boy band on its head. With as many as 14 members at times, BROCKHAMPTON's deconstructed the traditional pop star/rap ethos by being unapologetically inclusive of racial and sexual identities. </p><p>Today BROCKHAMPTON's frontman Kevin Abstract talks through the group’s sixth and latest album, <em>Roadrunner: New Light, New Machine</em> with Rick Rubin. We’ll hear Kevin talk about how the project slowly evolved from a pop album to something darker and more rap driven. Kevin also explains how supporting one of the group’s members through losing their dad became the album’s creative thrust, and explains why their next album will probably be their last.</p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord\">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out a playlist of our favorite BROCKHAMPTON and Kevin Abstract tracks <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2fnp49Z9HfXlziOldJrpeA?si=0b34e0aa1c7f437f\"> HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
