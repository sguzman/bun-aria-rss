Bring a prepared mind.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Founders (as they should) typically think more about solving a problem in the world, and less about the market context around what they're doing. Sequoia has always focused on the market ‚Äî which allows them to bring a prepared mind to conversations with founders both pre and post investment. Great partnerships and great investments lie at the intersection of these two perspectives.</li> <li>Focusing on the market takes many forms at Sequoia. It includes building and maintaining market landscapes, constantly looking for white spaces, and convening quarterly \"blue sky\" sessions within the firm.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. The two questions that matter are \"Why now?\" and \"Who cares?\".</strong></p> <ul> <li>Early-stage is different from other forms of investing. As Don would say, it's predicated on investing in markets undergoing significant change: today's solutions are wrong for tomorrow. A good answer to \"why now\" upends the Warren Buffet quote about reputations of businesses with bad economics surviving intact. For example, DoorDash and Instacart had great ‚Äúwhy now's‚Äù (ability to access a whole new class of labor through mobile devices), whereas Webvan (also a Sequoia investment) did not.</li> <li>Similarly, the key to evaluating market size in the context of early-stage venture is to focus on the opportunity size tomorrow, not today. \"Who cares\" is a great lens to predict and distill this: if this new solution were widely known and available <em>who</em> (how many people/customers, what segments, with what buying power) will <em>care</em> (how much will it improve their lives or businesses)?</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. The goal is not buying low and selling high. The goal is compounding capital.</strong></p> <ul> <li>In a compounding environment, gains from the next few years will always dwarf all cumulative gains from years prior. The goal is to invest in companies that are able to become compounders, help them do so, and enjoy the returns as long as possible.</li> <li>Identifying compounding (and whether it will continue) is hard to get right. The question Sequoia asks is whether the future for a given market, company or investment looks brighter than today. When the answer is yes: üíéüôå</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Venture is a humbling business.</strong></p> <ul> <li>You can make money even if you get the investment thesis wrong, lose money even if you get the investment thesis right, and you realize your losses many years before your gains. (Alfred has been at Sequoia for over 10 years and only just had his first two IPOs: Airbnb and DoorDash.)</li> <li>To succeed in venture over the long run you need all three of high IQ, high EQ, and hustle. (We would also add high patience to the list!) What you don't need are specific qualifications: Michael Moritz was a journalist, Roelof Botha was an actuary, Don and Doug were sales guys and Alfred was a COO. Greatness can come from anywhere.</li> <li>There will always be too much capital chasing too few good deals. It's true today, it was true when Alfred started 10 years ago, and it was true when Michael Moritz started 20 years before that. But the winning companies will always generate outsized returns by using that capital to their unfair advantage.
