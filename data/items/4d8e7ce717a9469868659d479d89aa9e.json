  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane is all in on the Kirk Minihane Radio Network -- the hottest media outlet in all of the St. John River Valley. The crew recaps yesterday's segment on Amanda Dobbins, The Ringer features editor who engaged in victim blaming during her review of the Fox News movie, Bombshell (11:00). Predictably, no one cared about the story because the transgression was carried out by a liberal and Minihane was the one screaming about it. Bill Simmons could not be reached for comment... New sound of Steve Robinson from a former career has hypnotized Minihane (21:00). Adam Driver walks out on NPR's Terry Gross because he has a phobia of hearing his own voice or something. Jim Braude, Margery Eagan, and Trenni Kusnierek team up for one of the most idiotic segments in the history of Boston Public Radio (42:50). A new scandal has erupted in the race to see who will become the next President of the Minifans (1:13:00). Bad radio and bad podcasts return (1:30:00). </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
