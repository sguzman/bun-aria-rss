    "media:description": "◆ In this week's video, I discuss Phil Elverum's project, Mount Eerie. Particularly 2017's landmark album, A Crow Looked at Me. Following the death of Phil's wife, Geneviève Castrée, due to cancer at 35, he looked to music as a coping mechanism. The grief Phil endured turned into a record, detailing the complex feelings one encounters after loss. This is a tribute to Phil, Geneviève and their daughter. A Crow Looked at Me is genuinely the saddest album I've ever heard, but it's essential listening. Hope you appreciate the video. Rest in peace, Geneviève. 1981-2016\n\nAlso, I ran into multiple problems in the audio department for this particular video, so please excuse the minor inconsistencies.\n\nSONG USED |\nSovereign by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song...\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...",
