  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin on Labor Day. While the establishment claims that Republican candidates are running on the unconstitutional raid at Mar-a-Lago it simply isn't true. Despite much talk about it, candidates must run on their records and against President Biden's. Lamentably, there is no establishment media for the conservative movement so 'We The People' must fight like we're behind, in order to win seats in Congress this November. Then, the media portrays the midterm elections as a national election but not a single candidate will represent the nation. Instead, they will represent individual congressional districts so one should view much of this data as skewed and be skeptical of it. Then, President Biden gave an address from Independence Hall in Philadelphia where the American Revolution was launched. Biden and the Democrats keep alienating and lying to the American people and the people keep pretending to believe it. Afterward, isn't the open border an attack on democracy? Why is Biden funding the police? Because the Democrats defunded them and now cities across America are suffering. Incidentally, the Democrats blame the Republicans for this. Afterward, Mikhail Gorbachev passed away. Gorbachev was critical of Putin saying he's created a sham democracy.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
