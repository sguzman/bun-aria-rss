  "description": "<p><strong>It’s possible to grow a church that is <em>not</em> healthy.</strong> It’s also possible for healthy churches to get stuck.</p> <p>But we think the win is for there to be both <em>health and growth</em> in a church. When that happens, we get to celebrate as churches continue to fulfill the Great Commission and make more disciples.</p> <p>In this episode, Tony and Amy unpack the first 5 things on a list we brainstormed of 10 things we regularly see unstuck churches doing right—and all of them stand the test of time. </p> <p>For the full episode transcript, links mentioned during the show, and to download the Leader Conversation Guide, visit this episode's <strong>Show Notes</strong> at <a href= \"https://tonymorganlive.com/2019/10/23/things-unstuck-churches-do-right-episode-116-the-unstuck-church-podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><strong>theunstuckgroup.com/episode116</strong></a>.</p> <p><em><strong>Join the Live Conversation on Social Media</strong></em></p> <p>If you're listening on Wednesday, when the episode first releases, join the live conversation The Unstuck Group's team will be having on social media about this week's topic.
