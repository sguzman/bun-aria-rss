In this episode, Emily and Laura encourage us to consider the ways memorizing Scripture brings the life-giving hope we need in the busy seasons of motherhood. By hiding God’s Word in our hearts, we may be surprised at the ways it gives us joy, hope, and guidance the next time we face an unexpected sick day, run late for a meeting, or tackle our chore list.</span></p> <hr /> <p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our generous donors.
