  "description": "<p>Greetings again my friends! While it was great to take some time off and enjoy the holidays with my family, I’m thrilled to kick off this new season of the podcast. While there has been a huge shift over the past few years toward grassfed products, some people find the taste of real foods somewhat shocking. The truth is, products like eggs, dairy, and beef can taste different than what most people are used to? Why is this? In today’s episode, we find out why what an animal eats effects the taste of the final product as well as how it looks. In addition, I discuss the nutrient difference between real food products and the grocery store imitations, as well as why it’s sometimes necessary to adjust our taste buds in order to get the food we really need.</p><p>This episode is proudly sponsored by Genuine Beef Co. (<a href='https://genuinebeefco.com/'>https://genuinebeefco.com/</a>) This dream has been 4 years in the making, but we are finally shipping our Wyoming-raised beef nationwide! It’s grass fed AND grass-finished, dry-aged to perfection, and vacuum-sealed in a USDA facility. We have 90/10 ground beef, roasts, steaks, and a variety of bundles.
