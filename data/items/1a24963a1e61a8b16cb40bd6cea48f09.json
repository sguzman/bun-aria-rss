Evelyn Douek and Quinta Jurecic spoke with Jonathan Zittrain, the George Bemis Professor of International Law at Harvard Law School, about the decision by Twitter, Facebook and a whole host of other platforms to ban the president in the wake of the Capitol riot. Jonathan, Evelyn and Quinta take a step back and situate what’s happening within the broader story of internet governance. They talked about how to understand the bans in the context of the internet’s now not-so-brief history, how platforms make these decisions and, of course, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p> <p>Listeners might also be interested in Zittrain's February 2020 <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBfYsBbDve8&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=TheBerkmanKleinCenterforInternet%26Society\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tanner Lecture</a>, \"Between Suffocation and Abdication: Three Eras of Governing Digital Platforms,\" which touches on some of the same ideas discussed in the podcast.</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
