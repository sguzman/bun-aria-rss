It gives you the ability to close your eyes, imagine something that you want to create, and then open your eyes and actually be able to go out there and do it.<br /><br />However, I‚Äôve also found that people have wildly different opinions on money, how we should relate to it, and how it affects our levels of happiness and fulfillment.<br /><br />But what do people who have really mastered the game of money have to say about it?<br /><br />What constitutes a wealthy life? How should we define success? How do we create and monetize long-term value for those we serve?<br /><br />Todays‚Äô episode of Impact Theory answers those questions, and many more. I‚Äôve assembled some of my favorite moments from past guest interviews, all revolving around our relationships with money and financial success.<br /><br />What was your #1 takeaway from the episode? Let me know in the comments below! üëá<br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br />00:00 | Ken Honda on shifting your focus around wealth<br />09:01 | David Rubenstein on children of wealthy families<br />17:54 | Ramit Sethi on rewriting your invisible scripts around money<br />28:10 | Tilman Fertitta on forging your own path in business<br />37:05 | Yancey Strickler on new ways of measuring value<br /><br /><br />QUOTES:<br />‚ÄúI think wealth is an attitude. If you feel like you're so happy, and so content with what you have, you are already wealthy. But if you have to struggle every day, and you cannot find happiness, either in your business or in your personal life, I think you're not wealthy, even if you have billions in your bank account.‚Äù - Ken Honda [05:38]<br /><br />‚ÄúRaising children is a complicated thing. If you mess up raising your children, nothing else in life really matters. Your ultimate legacy is not a building named after you, or a scholarship named after you - it's your children‚Äù - David Rubenstein [13:50]<br /><br />‚ÄúIt's not impossible to make money - there's actually a lot of people making money. It's not impossible to get ahead, pay off debt, even invest and grow - there's a lot of people doing it. But if you're surrounded by people who constantly complain about how difficult it is, and it's impossible, guess what? You're going to absorb those invisible scripts.‚Äù - Ramit Sethi [19:43]<br /><br />‚ÄúYou've got to know your God given gifts, and everybody has it. Everybody in this room has it right here. So do what you know was your God given gift and find a way to use that as your path.‚Äù - Tilman Fertitta [33:18]<br /><br />‚ÄúMy assumption was always that financial value is simply the first value we've learned to rationally express - that financial value is a proxy for goodness that is mathematical and that is tradable and that is universal - and that that process can be repeated for other values‚Äù - Yancey Strickler [44:48]<br /><br /><br />FOLLOW KEN HONDA:<br />WEBSITE: <a href=\"https://kenhonda.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://kenhonda.com</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/33gYfss\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/33gYfss</a> <br />INSTAGRAM: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3FbTBJw\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3FbTBJw</a> <br />TWITTER: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3tc0IQ4\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3tc0IQ4</a> <br /><br />FOLLOW DAVID RUBENSTEIN:<br />WEBSITE: <a href=\"https://www.davidrubenstein.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.davidrubenstein.com</a> <br />TWITTER: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Gbdnq9\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3Gbdnq9</a> <br /><br />FOLLOW RAMIT SETHI:<br />WEBSITE: <a href=\"https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com</a> <br />FACEBOOK: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Fe2RNk\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3Fe2RNk</a> <br />INSTAGRAM: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Gd7GrJ\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3Gd7GrJ</a> <br />TWITTER: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3zIChux\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3zIChux</a> <br /><br />FOLLOW TILMAN FERTITTA<br />WEBSITE: <a href=\"https://www.tilmanfertitta.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.tilmanfertitta.com</a> <br />FACEBOOK: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3qZ5SvT\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3qZ5SvT</a> <br />INSTAGRAM: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3GbWDyW\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3GbWDyW</a> <br />TWITTER: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3tbzTeA\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3tbzTeA</a> <br /><br />FOLLOW YANCEY STRICKLER:<br />WEBSITE: <a href=\"https://www.ystrickler.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.ystrickler.com</a> <br />INSTAGRAM: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3f6xRnZ\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3f6xRnZ</a> <br />TWITTER: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3td2uQS\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3td2uQS</a>",
