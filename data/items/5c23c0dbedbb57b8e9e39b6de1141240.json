  "title": "Deepgram - Audio Search with Deep Learning",
  "content": "A very <a href=\"https://twimlai.com/from-particle-physics-to-audio-ai-with-scott-stephenson/\">interesting podcast</a> by <a href=\"https://twimlai.com/about/\">Sam Charrington</a> who is interviewing Scott Stephenson from <a href=\"http://deepgram.com/\">DeepGram</a>. DeepGram is using deep learning activations for creating indexes that allows to search text in voice recordings.<br /><br />DeepGram have released <a href=\"https://github.com/deepgram/kur/blob/master/examples/cifar.yml\">Kur</a> which is a high level abstraction of deep learning framework to allow quickly defining network layouts. But still, writing the target persona is researchers with deep learning knowledge.<br /><br />A related Israeli startup is <a href=\"https://www.audioburst.com/\">AudioBurst</a>. &nbsp;They claim to use AI for indexing but it is not clear what they actually do. Another Israeli startup is <a href=\"https://www.verbit.ai/\">Verbit</a>. They seem to transcribe audio with humans going over the preliminary result.<br /><br />In addition, my friend Yishay Carmiel is working on importing parts of <a href=\"http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/\">Kaldi</a> to TensorFLow. A recent <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/08/kaldi-now-offers-tensorflow-integration.html\">Google developer blog post describes this effort</a>. Yishay is leading a spinoff of Spoken called <a href=\"http://intelligentwire.com/\">IntelligentWire</a> who is also searching audio files using deep learning.<br /><br />Overall it seems that search in audio files using deep learning is getting hotter!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />",
