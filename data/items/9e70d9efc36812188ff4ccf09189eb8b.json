  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a special episode. This particular episode with Paul & Jack Haden from C2 Collaborative represents the evolution of the podcast. Not only do we have a wonderful conversation with this Father / Son duo on site. But after the podcast we put microphones on both of them and filmed them talking amongst themselves throughout one of the most cutting-edge mixed-use urban communities in the country. Follow along this voyeuristic editing style as they talk about framing, patterns, concepts behind a park, and an impromptu conversation from a resident gathering ingredients for lunch from one of the community gardens on site</span></p>",
