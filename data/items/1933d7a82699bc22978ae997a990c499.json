  "title": "The Thank You Economy by Gary Vaynerchuck",
  "description": "This is the second of the Gary's New York Times bestseller books. The book explains the tactics that businesses can use to provide real value to consumers in what he terms the ‘Thank You' economy. In the book, Gary explains that social media has given the power of voice back to consumers, making businesses volatile to any public issues. He explains that businesses that understand the use of social media as a gateway to provide value alongside closer contact with customers rather than a way to gain likes will win in the Thank You Economy. I really enjoyed reading this book as it gave me a real insight into what a leader in the current entrepreneurial environment is thinking about when running his business. This book would provide value for businesses owners in any industry as well as those who are thinking about establishing their own enterprise in the digital age.\n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
