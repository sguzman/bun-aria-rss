First they talk through their decisions to move to major cities when starting their gay lives and what drew them away from smaller locales. Next they’re joined by Hugh Ryan to discuss his book When Brooklyn Was Queer and how the urbanization of Brooklyn allowed its queer identity to blossom. Then they interview Samantha Allen about her new book Real Queer America about finding strong queer communities in red states. And they answer some advice about finding your own queer home in a smaller than average place.\nThis podcast was produced by Daniel Schroeder.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
