  "description": "On February 28, Akamai recorded a 1.35 Tbps DDoS attack against one of our customers. The attack was driven by a relatively new vector, memcached reflection. Possibly the largest publicly disclosed DDoS attack to date, the memcached attack was more than twice the size of the largest DDoS attacks that were launched against an Akamai customer by the operators of the Mirai botnet in September of 2016.",
