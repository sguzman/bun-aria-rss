  "description": "<p>For most people car and home insurance policies are expected, necessary costs of owning those things. Because we automatically set up these policies, we tend to forget to continually shop them around- which may mean we’re significantly overpaying! Loyalty with a particular insurer doesn’t save you money over the years so continually shopping your provider is one of the best ways to get your rates down. Listen as we cover several other ways to save big on car and home insurance, plus we answer the question: When should I even use my insurance?!</p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Uroboros Stout by Anthem Brewing which you can find on Untappd. A big thanks to Sy in Oklahoma City for donating these beers to the show!
