  "description": "<p>Casey Anthony back in the news after calling 911 to report that a woman had thrown a drink on her at a Florida bar.  The incident allegedly stemmed from the fact that the woman and Anthony had dated the same man, a police sergeant.  The reported incident involving <a href=\"https://people.com/crime/body-cam-footage-from-bar-brawl-reveals-casey-anthonys-ex-is-a-police-officer/\">Anthony and patron Thelma Moya occurred on May 23 at O’Shea’s Irish Pub</a> in West Palm Beach. Anthony told responding officers that she and Moya got into an argument  and that she wanted to file a report as Moya verbally and physically assaulted her. She alleged that Moya threw a drink at her because Allison was texting her.  <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2021/06/03/casey-anthony-police-body-cam-footage-spat-woman-ex-boyfriend/\">Anthony said in the 911 call</a> that she wanted the altercation documented as she planned to get a restraining order against Moya.
