  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew come out of the gate hot with some Love Boat talk and review some game film on the subject leading to the advice of one Jesus Christ. Adam also marvels at the amount of ex-wife and alimony jokes that were pervasive in comedy writing at the time. They also go on a deep dive on the musical stylings of Mac Davis and explore just how much hasn't changed from when he was observing the world some 50 years ago. As the show wraps up they speak with a caller who is concerned about some behavior developing with her teenage son that Drew says sounds a lot like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder to him. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nHeadspace.com/ADS\nTommyJohn.com/ADS\nJoinFightCamp.com/ADS\nLifelock.com, promo code ADAM",
