Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to yet another white person calling the police on a black person for a unreasonable situation, and his name is \"Coupon Carl\". Moreover, since today is \"National Get Out of the Dog House Day\" we opened up the phone lines to see if any of our listeners are in need of making up to their partner. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
