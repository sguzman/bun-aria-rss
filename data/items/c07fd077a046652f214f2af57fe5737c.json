  "description": "<p>Success is not just about knowing what to do. It is about doing it.</p><p>All the information in the world, the best laid plans, the clearest, most-defined, measurable and attainable goals will not deliver the outcomes, results or resolutions you want.</p><p>There is something missing. In order to succeed at anything worth the effort, you also need to put in place critical changes in environment, culture, mindset and community that enable the consistent action that, over time, delivers astonishing results.</p><p>I call this \"Success Scaffolding.\" And, I've been diving into, experimenting with and refining the key elements for years, across a wide array of domains, from health and fitness to art, innovation, careers and entrepreneurship.</p><p>In today's episode, instead of our usual long-form conversation with a special guest, I am doing something different. I'll be sharing what I call the 7P Success Scaffolding™ framework.</p><p>Every element, every step, nothing held back. Why? Because it is that time of year when millions commit to big, new, deeply-meaningful goals, only to walk away or fail by the time we hit February. Not because we don't want it badly enough. Not because we're not smart enough. But, because we do not have our Success Scaffolding in place.</p><p>This is my New Year's offering. It&nbsp;is about helping you make 2017 different, bridging the gap between hope and reality.</p><p>You may want to grab a pen. Or, if you'd like a PDF mind-map of the entire 7P Success Scaffolding framework, just be sure to <a href=\"http://www.goodlifeproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">sign up for our Weekly Insider Updates</a>.
