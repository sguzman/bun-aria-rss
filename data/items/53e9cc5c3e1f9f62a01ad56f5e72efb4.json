  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys welcome on friend of the show, Ohio State legend, Super Bowl champion, 5th overall pick of the 2006 NFL Draft, and one of the funniest humans on the planet, AJ Hawk, for the entire episode. They discuss everything from AJ and Pat's relationship, them calling NCAA Football games together, AJ's relationship with Aaron Rodgers and how the Lake Tahoe tournament was, his thoughts on the raid on Area 51, whether he thinks aliens are real, and what he enjoys doing in his leisure time. They also cover his thoughts on players not being happy about their ratings in Madden, how he thinks the Packers will fare this NFL season, what it's like being apart of the first celebrity couple, whether he thinks Urban Meyer will coach college football again, and much more. It's a hilarious interview (2:14-1:49:44). Today's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
