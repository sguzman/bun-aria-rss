  "description": "<p>When Kirk asked Brandon Walker whether his performance on Wednesday was the extent of his talent, few could have foreseen his devastating retort via penis-themed photoshop. Walker brings more of his classic wit to the show today as Kirk fields calls on a special Friday mailbag edition of the show.  Big Cat suggests we need to reverse engineer a \"W\" for Walker so he can get back to focusing on college football and gambling. Steve \"Captain Nonsense\" Robinson makes the case for his top three favorite movies and decides he wouldn't mind going to jail for a few years.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
