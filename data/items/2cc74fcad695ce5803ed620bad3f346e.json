  "itunes:summary": "Revisiting the first Ritual Community Music event of 2020, we hear a viscerally emotive live performance from Eartheater that closed a night of subversive beauty with Battle-Ax and V. \n\nEartheater distills foley-filled digital production, a three-octave vocal range, and classical composition into works suspended between obsessively detailed sonic tapestries and almost recklessly romantic and gestural electronica. \n\nThis performance was recorded at Colour Club on the 19th of January 2020. \n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/eartheater-battle-ax-v\nRitual Community Music 19 January 2020 Colour, Carlton Presented by Liquid Architecture\n\nImage: Keelan O'Hehir\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work. You can support Liquid Architecture’s weekly podcast and our online journal Disclaimer, for new thinking and writing on listening and sound through a Patreon subscription, for as little as $5 a month. \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/liquidarchitecture\n\nFor the past 20 years, Liquid Architecture has been Australia’s leading organisation for artists working with sound and listening. LA investigates the sounds themselves, but also the ideas communicated about, and the meaning of, sound and listening.",
