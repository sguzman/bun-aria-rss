  "description": "A Requiem for 2020. What a year… In many ways, 2020 was apocalyptic as it unveiled and revealed much about society, the Nation and the Church. Today we talk a little about Christmas and what it looks like without the bows and garland and we answer a question in response to Gombis’s episode on Capitalism and the Church (Episode 273). Where do we go from here? How do we fix this mess we’re in? Should people still give to the Church? What does transparency look like for the Church? How can it become more trustworthy and renew its reputation? We’re excited to close out this difficult year and look to new things in 2021. A new name for the Podcast! New communities and connections with y’all! \nMay the Lord bless you and keep you;\nMay the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;\nMay the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and in these days, may He give you peace.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram. \n\nRelevant Article on ‘O Holy Night’: https://www.relevantmagazine.com/culture/music/reminder-o-holy-night-started-out-as-an-abolitionist-anthem/?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-relevantmagazine&utm_content=later-12647918&utm_medium=social&utm_source=instagram \n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nVoxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\n\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
