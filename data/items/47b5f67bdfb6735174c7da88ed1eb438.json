  "description": "<p>Our Gospel for this weekend comes from the end of the Sermon on the Plain, which is St. Luke’s version, more or less, of the Sermon on the Mount in St. Matthew’s account.

But unless they’ve surrendered to Christ and found salvation in him themselves, they are absolutely in no position to help you. </p>\n",
