  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>In celebration of Black Music Month, this week I&rsquo;m joined by Danyel Smith, the former editor-in-chief of Vibe Magazine, R&B Editor at Billboard, award-winning journalist, and host of the mega-hit podcast, Black Girl Songbook. Danyel is also the author of the new and highly celebrated book Shine Bright: A Very Personal History of Black Women and Pop. The book is a literary mashup, part biography, part memoir, all while weaving in the history of Black women&rsquo;s contributions to the genre of American pop music. During our conversation we explored the music that has meant the most to Danyel in her lifetime and chatted about how she prioritized her mental health while writing the book.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Visit our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a>&nbsp;for all the books mentioned on the podcast.</p>\n<p>Get updates about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sisterhoodheals.com/\">Sisterhood Heals</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Danyel</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3mtccda\">Grab your copy of Shine Bright</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/20Ifo2kqrmLweDY87KC0dr\">Black Girl Songbook Podcast</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/danamo/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/danamo\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
