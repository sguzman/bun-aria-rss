James Purrington seemed to have plans of killing himself after suffering from what was likely undiagnosed mental illness. When one of his children brought this to the attention of their mother and his wife, he said he had no intention of killing himself at all, just typical worries about his family after a long grueling summer and a bad drought. His wife seemed to be settled for the time being, but soon almost the entire family would be found axed to death in their home, and James Purrington would be discovered lying dead on the kitchen floor. <br>\n<br>\nSources to check out:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004FGMD9G/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1\" target=\"_blank\">A Midwife's Tale by Laura Thatcher Ulrich</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Return-Smuttynose-Island-other-Murders-ebook/dp/B0046A9N9E/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6C6D8V9EUXQD&keywords=smuttynose+island+maine+murders&qid=1642274935&s=digital-text&sprefix=smuttynose+island+maine+murders%2Cdigital-text%2C48&sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\">Return to Smuttynose Island and other Maine Axe Murders by Emeric Spooner<br>\n</a><br>\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:<br>\n<br>\nLiquid IV: Get 25% off when you go to <a href=\"http://LIQUIDIV.COM\" target=\"_blank\">LIQUIDIV.COM</a> and use code MORBID at checkout.<br>\n<br>\nNoom: Start building better habits today.
