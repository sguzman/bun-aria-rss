  "description": "Isolationists fit right into the fusion of George Soros and Charles Koch parroting the pacifistic propaganda of keeping America out of endless wars or radical interventionism. President Reagan's view was that enemies couldn't be contained therefore prudently going on offense was his preferred alternative. However, the leftist and/or the pacifist pigeonhole any activity that doesn't bow down to an opposing regime as an \"escalation\" to weaken the U.S position and prevent America from asserting any dominance against aggressive foreign actors. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott made remarks today the way we hoped our President would have but instead, Biden politicized the deaths of these innocent children in Texas. But then former Congressman Beto O'Rourke rushed the stage to heckle the Governor and blame him for deadly gun laws. Biden never signs an executive order to stop the killings happening in big cities in blue states run by his fellow Democrats. No mention of the same cities with the strongest gun control laws being the same cities with the most shootings and killings, just look at New York City and Chicago where crime is out of control and lunatics are on the loose. Following President Biden’s remarks China announced Taiwan military drills. Notice how more confrontational China is becoming? China and Iran are on the move against us and if Washington politicians keep fooling around, we will end up effectively arming Iran with nuclear weapons. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
