  "description": "On this season of Working, we visit the city of Baltimore, to talk to people about their jobs there. We're hoping to learn about how the city informs their work, and how they are shaping Baltimore itself, by working.\nWhen Harry Mushlin operates on a brain, he feels his patient's selfhood in his hands. Mushlin is a neurosurgery resident with the University of Maryland currently practicing pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Medical Center and operating on victims of violence at UMD's Shock Trauma Center. He spoke with us about working on the human brain, the trying hours of neurosurgery, and seeing Baltimore through the lens of the operating room.\nThen in a Slate Plus Extra, Mushlin tells us about working in the shadow of Baltimore's most famous neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson.
