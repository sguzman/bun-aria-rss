So let’s bravely face the awkwardness, with communication hacks for even the most nerve-wracking of convos.</p><br><p>Clamming up during sex talks? I’ve got a confidence-building solution for that. How about giving tough feedback, like asking for better handjobs, or addressing a funky smell? We get into it! Finally, we tackle tough topics like telling a friend you have feelings for them, whether or not to open a relationship, and if you should stay in a partnership if the sex is just OK. Communication is lubrication, but you know what? It’s also liberating, and by the end of this episode, you’ll be feeling a lot freer.</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/yes-no-maybe-the-list-every-relationship-needs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yes, No, Maybe List</a></p><p>Episode: <a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/hot-sex-with-stis-w-dr-ina-park/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hot Sex with STIs w/ Dr. Ina Park</a></p><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
