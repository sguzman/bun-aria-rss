  "description": "<p>Today on the show we have Branden Steineckert, who is the drummer for legendary punk band Rancid and founding member of The Used. This is a pretty deep and heavy conversation but an absolute must listen as he shares stories of drumming as therapy, building a scene and how suicide affected his life. I really appreciate Branden being as open and honest as he was. Special thanks to a previous guest of the show, Jay Weinberg, for initially bringing this up and my friend Jeff Bradley for helping this along. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
