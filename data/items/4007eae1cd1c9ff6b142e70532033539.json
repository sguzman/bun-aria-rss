  "description": "<p><p>Day 1 of the podcast rollout for Kirk Minihane's old partner did not go swimmingly, and Gerry Callahan is none too pleased with Dave Cullinane. Yet Minihane remains, as ever, Gerry's benevolent teacher and mentor, ready to help if asked. Steve Robinson's reaction to an old Don Imus bit provokes a fight over censorship and whether Minihane should go on shows hosted by the likes of David Duke or Alex Jones. The crew reacts to Barstool Sports CEO Erika Nardini's exclusive interview with the Minifan Show. A WEEI morning show host has survived the reemergence of questionable old standup material, but brand new audio raises hard questions for Entercom and the Boston Globe, two well known paragons of virtue and consistency. Troubling video of an old trip on the Starship Enterprise surfaces. Plus, conservative firebrand and Daily Wire writer Matt Walsh joins the program to make the case that the federal government should ban all online pornography.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
