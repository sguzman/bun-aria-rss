  "description": "<p>It’s the&nbsp;the early 2000’s and the animal rights group PETA accuses KFC of cruelty in their poultry processing and creating “Frankenchickens.” As KFC revenues tumble, Chick-fil-A surges ahead, cultivating fanatic customers with opening day parties and lavish food giveaways. But when President Dan Cathy makes controversial remarks against same-sex marriage, Chick-fil-A becomes a battleground. Meanwhile, Popeyes new CEO reverses the chain’s long downward slide by returning the company to its Louisiana roots. He introduces snappy new advertising and Cajun recipes, including the company’s first fried chicken sandwich. Rising to the challenge, Chick-fil-A attacks their rival with some savvy twitter swordplay over whose sandwich reigns supreme. The ensuing social media frenzy inspires a nationwide rush on both chains, but KFC is left out in the cold. Then the great sandwich wars of 2019 help bring about a shocking upset in the world of southern fried fowl, just as all the players begin to plan for a more sustainable, less meat-heavy future.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pre-order our new book&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://www.harperbusiness.com/book/9780063019522/The-Art-of-Business-Wars-David-Brown/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Art of Business Wars</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;now before it is released on April 13.</strong></p><p>Listen to new episodes 1 week early and to all episodes ad free with Wondery+.
