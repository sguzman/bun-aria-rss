  "title": "The Race To Build A 200mph Production Car",
  "description": "Today on Past Gas, it’s a sprint AND a marathon– inside the decades-long quest to build a production car that could hit two hundred miles per hour. Was it even possible for a land-based vehicle to reach 200mph? And if it was, could it be mass-produced? What companies joined in on the cut-throat race to shatter the 200mph barrier? Who were the madmen that actually made it happen? And did yet another grudge match with Enzo Ferrari lead to another milestone in automotive history? All that and more on a VERY fast episode of the podcast.\nMore about Show:\n\n\n﻿Follow James on IG and Twitter @jamespumphrey.  \n\n\n\nFollow Nolan on IG and Twitter @nolanjsykes.  \n\n\n\nFollow Joe on IG and Twitter @joegweber.\n\n\nFollow Donut @donutmedia, and subscribe to our Youtube and Facebook channels!  \n\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the podcast for free wherever you're listening or using this link: http://bit.ly/PastGas.\n\nIf you like the show, telling a friend about it would be helpful!
