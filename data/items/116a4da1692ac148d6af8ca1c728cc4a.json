  "title": "Marcus Whitney: Entrepreneur, Author, Healthcare Venture Fund Founder",
  "description": "In this episode Marcus shares the story of his highly programmed upbringing in Brooklyn, New York, with significant sporting achievements somewhat hiding his challenges in conventional learning environment because he is and was a “learner by doing”. We hear how he was challenged by freedom of the world of university education: dropped out, dived into the world of hip hop and failed to make a go of this as a business. His onward journey demonstrates hard work, a series of steps forward and back, major moments of change as he moved from the world of blue collar waitering to being a junior developer, and developed self-awareness through years of therapy. We hear insights into why soccer could be the sport of the future, its important role in integration and civic pride, and his reasoning for forming a fund that only invested in health care startups in Nashville. His conclusion that you should explore that entrepreneurial itch if you have it so as not to die with regrets is one that will resonate with many.\nIn his book Create and Orchestrate: The Path to Claiming Your Creative Power from an Unlikely Entrepreneur, as well as sharing the learnings from his entrepreneurial journey he sets out a framework of eight core concepts he argues that every entrepreneur needs when building their business. Four internal: Leadership, Finance, Operations, and Growth and four external, Product, Service, Sales and Marketing. They make sense for both a seasoned entrepreneur and are very useful for someone who hasn’t yet started out on their journey.\nAbout our guest\nMARCUS WHITNEY is CEO and founder of Health: Further, a strategic advisory firm working with leading healthcare organizations, as well as founding partner of Jumpstart Health Investors, the most active venture capital firm in America focused on innovative healthcare companies. Marcus is also a co-founder and minority owner of Nashville Soccer Club, Nashville’s Major League Soccer team.
