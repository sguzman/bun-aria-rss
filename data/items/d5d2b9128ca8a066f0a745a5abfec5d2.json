  "description": "<p>There’s more to plants than meets the eye. They detect sounds, they defend themselves against insect attacks and they can even send each other secret messages through the wind! Our leafy, green friends sense and interact with the world in their own, planty way. We’ll learn all about it in this episode, plus we’ll find out why some plants like to grow in spots where other plants have died. We’ve also got a Mystery Sound and a Moment of Um that answers the question: why do bats sleep upside down?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Khan Academy (<a href=\"http://khan.com/freekidsapp\" title=\"khan.com/freekidsapp\" class=\"default\">khan.com/freekidsapp</a>)</p>\n",
