  "description": "The wokest white boy this side of the Atlantic, Justin Trudeau, has a nasty blackface habit. Will he be held accountable in the same way that a conservative would be? Of course not. On a related note, remember when Megyn Kelly was fired just for talking about blackface? Also, a new study claims that all \"unwanted\" sex is rape. We'll talk about why that definition of rape is wrong and dangerous. Finally, NBC gives us all the chance to confess our climate sins. Date: 09-19-2019\nLearn more about your ad choices.
