  "description": "<p><p>On Monday's episode of Spittin' Chiclets the guys are joined by current Arizona Coyotes forward Derek Stepan. Biz did his dirty work before the Stepan interview and texted everyone person in his phone book to get dirt on Stepan, so the interview was a good one. The guys then break down each of the remaining playoff series and also discuss some NHL news including the Calder Trophy finalist, the Hart Trophy finalists and more. RA wraps up with a gambling corner and Biz wraps up with a good story about his twitter getting “hacked”.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
