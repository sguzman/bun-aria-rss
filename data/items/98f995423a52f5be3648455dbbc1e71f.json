  "description": "The market continues to be volatile. Daniel and I discuss the political theatrics surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling... and whether investors need to worry. [0:40] Two Fed presidents resigned this week over controversial personal stock trades. Daniel goes on a quick rant about why this is a sliver of positive news... and why you shouldn’t feel sorry for them. [6:50] As interest rates continue to move higher, investors are realizing inflation isn’t transitory. For months, I’ve been saying inflation is the biggest risk to the markets. Today, I lay out why tech stocks are hurt the most by higher rates... and why we haven’t seen a bottom in the supply chain woes. [8:35] Meanwhile, rising costs have led a couple of major corporations to issue lower guidance… Be prepared: As winter approaches—and particularly the holiday season—hundreds of companies across sectors will be forced to do the same... [11:40] And, with supply chain pressure expected to continue for months, Daniel and I share several names to pay attention to as capital flows out of growth stocks and into cyclical/value plays.
