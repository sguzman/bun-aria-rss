  "description": "We hear from many quilters that the reason they started quilting in the first place is because they wanted to make a gift for someone else – and many times that gift comes in the form of a baby quilt or even a small blanket for a special pet. In this show, we share some special considerations to have before making a quilt for a little one or an animal. We also share tips for fixing tension problems on your sewing machine, the ombre fabric trend we love, and what to look for when shopping for a longarm quilting machine.\nFor more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here: www.allpeoplequilt.com/magazines-more/quilting-podcast/episode-518-sew-something-special-for-a-child-or-pet\nEmail us at APQPodcast@meredith.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
