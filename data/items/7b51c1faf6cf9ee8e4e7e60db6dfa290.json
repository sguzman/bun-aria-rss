    "media:description": "The world of microcontroller programming is ever changing. Arduino still remains one of the best entry level devices to get into embedded development, but it was never easy to learn a garbage collected language like Go. Go now is supported on a TON of smaller microcontroller devices through the project TinyGo. TinyGo brings the power of Go to your next embedded project.\n\nhttps://go.dev/learn/\nhttps://tinygo.org/\n\nüè´ COURSES üè´\nhttps://www.lowlevel.academy/courses/\n\nüî• SOCIALS üî•\nLow Level Merch!: https://www.linktr.ee/lowlevellearning\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lowlevellearning\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/lowlevellearni1\nFollow me on Twitch: https://twitch.tv/lowlevellearning\nJoin me on Discord!: https://discord.gg/gZhRXDdBYY",
