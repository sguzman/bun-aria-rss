  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 1/14/22",
  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Nancy Pelosi's son Paul Jr. is connected to several companies investigated by the FBI and the media is barely reporting on it. One of the biofuel companies even defrauded investors. Paul Jr is frugal but nowhere near being strapped for cash. A special counsel's criminal investigation into all of the Pelosi's dealings is definitely warranted. Then, the democrat party is devouring Americanism with American Marxism and they're using issues that are irrelevant to the American people to do it. All the Democrats do is offer empty promises, not solutions. Later, President Biden and company don't have answers to our problems because they cause our problems. Their entire reason for being is to advance their ideology, they don't care if you have to suffer for a while. This is how the Marxist works and why they make empty promises like healthcare is a right. Just ask our veterans in the Veterans Administration if healthcare is a right. Afterward, Brent Bozell, founder of MRC and author of \"Stops Along the Way: A Catholic Soul, a Conservative Heart, an Irish Temper, and a Love of Life\" calls in. Bozell explained that billionaire progressive activist George Soros is spending billions on every major issue including bribing colleges to adapt to his gender abolition agenda to change the arc of history.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
