  "description": "<p>We show that transverse coupled K\\\"ahler-Einstein metrics on toric Sasaki\nmanifolds arise as a critical point of a volume functional. As a preparation\nfor the proof, we re-visit the transverse moment polytopes and contact moment\npolytopes under the change of Reeb vector fields. Then we apply it to a coupled\nversion of the volume minimization by Martelli-Sparks-Yau. This is done\nassuming the Calabi-Yau condition of the K\\\"ahler cone, and the non-coupled\ncase leads to a known existence result of a transverse K\\\"ahler-Einstein metric\nand a Sasaki-Einstein metric, but the coupled case requires an assumption\nrelated to Minkowski sum to obtain transverse coupled K\\\"ahler-Einstein\nmetrics.\n</p>",
