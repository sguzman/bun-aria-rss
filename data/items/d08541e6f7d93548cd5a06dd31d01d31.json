Hence, safety and reliability are arguably the most important factors for one working in the travel or transportation industries. Passengers need to know that they and their belongings are safe and that the vehicles or operators they travel with are reliable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the advent of AI technologies, safety levels can reach higher peaks. The ability of AI to analyze large quantities of data will allow travel and transport operators, as well as eventually the public themselves, to schedule public and private transportation services in a significantly improved manner. Researchers believe that AI-enabled vehicles could reduce traffic fatalities by up to 90% by 2050 in some developed countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" id=\"h4Efficiency\">\n\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Efficiency</strong></a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing countries rank lower on the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) than developed countries because of a lack of efficiency due to inadequate infrastructure and poor customs procedures. AI will undoubtedly enhance the energy efficiency of transport systems which is an essential aspect of travel. In particular, AI can be helpful in e-logistics, where Internet-related technologies are applied to the supply and demand chain to match shippers with delivery service providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" id=\"h4Pollution\">\n\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Pollution</strong></a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Emissions from transport vehicles are significant contributors to increasing pollution and global warming. With the world becoming increasingly environmentally focused, a drastic reduction in the emission of the travel and transport industry is required to secure their long-term sustainability. AI can help in deploying new and innovative solutions to deal with increasing pollution by enabling scientists to discover more environmentally friendly methods of running vehicles and machinery for travel. <a href=\"http://mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/distraction-or-disruption-autonomous-trucks-gain-ground-in-us-logistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">McKinsey</a> has predicted that self-driving trucks will reduce operating costs by some 45%.

For example, the short-distance ridesharing platform Uber uses AI techniques in all aspects of its services, from matching riders and drivers to route optimization. AI algorithms are also being applied in road traffic management to analyze the traffic pattern and volume and provide drivers with information on the fastest route. This relieves them of any traffic congestion and decreases their commute time.

However, with recent advancements in AI, the industry will significantly impact how its business is conducted. Managing the increasing air traffic is an important area where progress in automation and computing power can be helpful. The <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/en/programs/ops-infra/air-traffic-management/drones/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">International Air Transport Association (IATA)</a> report points out that developing unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and UAS traffic management using enhanced computing capabilities will create new opportunities for improving existing traffic management systems, separation standards, and airspace planning design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sesarju.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR)</a> joint undertaking has supported several AI research projects and air traffic management (ATM), covering issues including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>predictability of traffic at different flight phases </li><li>passenger flow improvements at airports</li><li>greater automation</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A potential application of machine learning in the aviation industry is the translation of historical and real-time insights into customers&#8217; behaviors into real-time strategies (e.g., adjusting the website content presented to the customer). This also includes social media sentiment analysis, which predicts customers&#8217; needs based on their social media behavior. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.nommon.es/research-projects/bigdata4atm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BigData4ATM</a> project looks at how AI can analyze different passenger-centric geo-located data to identify patterns in passenger behavior, door-to-door travel times, and travel mode choices (<strong>Figure 5</strong>). With smart devices and related services, researchers can access large-scale, detailed longitudinal (dynamic) data to test hypotheses about passenger behavior.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bigdata4atm.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bigdata4atm-1024x660.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34620\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bigdata4atm.png?size=140x90&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 140w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bigdata4atm-300x193.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 300w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bigdata4atm.png?size=420x270&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 420w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bigdata4atm.png?size=560x360&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 560w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bigdata4atm.png?size=700x450&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 700w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bigdata4atm-768x495.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 768w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bigdata4atm-1024x660.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 1024w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bigdata4atm.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 1142w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /></a><figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> BigData4ATM pipeline (source: <a href=\"https://www.nommon.es/research-projects/bigdata4atm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nommon</a>).</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Another area where AI can make a difference is ground handling. This includes high potential use cases like safety checks, aircraft movement operations (pushback and towing), aircraft turnaround operations (fuelling, catering, loading and unloading, de-icing and anti-icing), and ground transportation on the ramp (passengers, baggage, cargo, and mail). It can also facilitate airport security by digesting a large amount of historical and real-time data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, aircraft makers are using AI to solve problems pilots face in the cockpit and predictive maintenance of aircraft. For example, an English start-up, <a href=\"https://aerogility.com/easyjet-deploys-aerogility-fleet-maintenance-solution/#:~:text=easyJet%2C%20Europe's%20leading%20airline%2C%20is,increased%20cost%20efficiency%20for%20maintenance.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Aerogility, is working with EasyJet</a> to automate daily maintenance planning for its fleet, including forecasting heavy maintenance, engine shop visits, and landing gear overhauls. The Airbus manufacturer uses a similar tool, Skywise, to offer predictive maintenance and data analytics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several companies have also started using AI technologies in drones for cargo delivery of all sizes and types. For example, <a href=\"https://www.iadb.in/2022/02/08/nautiluss-next-gen-cargo-drone-aims-to-propel-air-cargo-industry-to-new-heights/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=nautiluss-next-gen-cargo-drone-aims-to-propel-air-cargo-industry-to-new-heights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nautilus</a>, a California-based start-up, is developing a cargo drone with a 90-ton capacity. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" id=\"h4Railway\">\n\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Railway Transport</strong></a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Railways were one of the most innovative sectors of the economy that, for the first time, allowed passengers to travel longer distances. They were also a significant factor in the industrial revolution. AI can help improve the manufacturing, operations, and maintenance of rail operators and infrastructure managers. It will improve management, lower costs, and enhance competitiveness concerning direct competitors or other transport modes. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" id=\"h5Intelligent\">\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Intelligent Train Automation</strong></a></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important contributions of AI in railway transport is the automation of train operation (ATO), which transfers the responsibility of managing train operations from the driver to a train control system with varying degrees of autonomy. This usually involves moving train drivers&#8217; sensory and intellectual capacities to an automated driving module, ready to react to possible hazards. Further, the design module should understand and integrate passengers&#8217; conduct on railway platforms, allowing automatic train door closure without danger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rail-research.europa.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Shift2Rail-MAAP-Part-A_Executive-View_webfinal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shift2Rail</a> (<strong>Figure 6</strong>), an R&D joint undertaking by the EU, is developing and validating a standard ATO for all rail segments (mainline/high speed, urban/ suburban, regional, and freight lines). In addition, they are carrying out activities related to ATO to optimize resource utilization. As the container transport market is growing, many projects are being developed to synchronize container train movements better to improve the information and data exchange in real time. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shift2rail.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shift2rail-1024x647.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34622\" width=\"700\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shift2rail.png?size=126x80&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 126w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shift2rail-300x189.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 300w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shift2rail.png?size=378x239&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 378w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shift2rail.png?size=504x318&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 504w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shift2rail.png?size=630x398&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 630w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shift2rail-768x485.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 768w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shift2rail-1024x647.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 1024w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shift2rail-1536x970.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 1536w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shift2rail.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 1748w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /></a><figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Shift2Rail pipeline (source: <a href=\"https://rail-research.europa.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Shift2Rail-MAAP-Part-A_Executive-View_webfinal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Europe Rail Research</a>).</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" id=\"h5Operational\">\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Operational Intelligence</strong></a></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>In railways, it is valuable to identify and be aware of potential failures before they happen to avoid service interruption.

However, these risks and challenges can have significant socioeconomic effects and must be managed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Loss of Jobs:</strong> According to a report by the Center for Global Policy Solutions, more than 4M people will lose jobs because of the quick transition to autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the United States. These jobs include drivers for deliveries, heavy trucks, buses, and taxis. In addition, AI will likely accelerate the growth toward a service-based economy which will speed up job losses for low-skilled workers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Investment:</strong> A significant constraint on AI growth in the transport market is its high-investment nature in terms of talent, hardware, and software. Demand for AI experts is growing tremendously, and a lack of skilled AI talent will pose the most significant barrier to AI adoption in developed countries. In addition, huge investments and capital stock are required to take advantage of skilled people and business practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Poor and Underdeveloped Infrastructure:</strong> Low-income and developing countries like India face an enormous challenge in adopting AI because of their low-quality infrastructure. This includes roads, ports, maintenance, and repair stations. The lack of reliable power sources and weak telecommunications further make things difficult. Countries with few investments in technology research and complex infrastructure as a percentage of GDP may have a more challenging time harnessing the power of AI. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Regulatory Requirements and Privacy Concerns</strong>: Regulatory requirements for AI are always tricky to predict. Although research has shown that AVs reduce traffic deaths, it is still unclear who is ultimately liable if an accident, harm, or fatality occurs. Similarly, asking users to provide personal data to develop robust machine learning models requires privacy laws. These laws must be balanced against the benefit of having more data in a telecommunications network. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"pitch\" style=\"padding: 40px; width: 100%; background-color: #F4F6FA;\">\n\t<h3>What's next?

These Neural Networks can be trained on a CPU but take a lot of time. Moreover, sometimes these networks do not even fit (run) on a CPU.</p>\n\n\t<p>To overcome this problem, we use <strong>GPUs</strong>.  The problem is these GPUs are <strong>expensive</strong> and become outdated quickly. </p>\n\n\t<p>GPUs are great because they take your Neural Network and train it quickly.  The problem is that GPUs are expensive, so you don’t want to buy one and use it only occasionally.  Cloud GPUs let you use a GPU and <strong>only pay for the time you are running the GPU</strong>.  It’s a brilliant idea that saves you money.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>JarvisLabs</strong> provides the best-in-class GPUs, and <strong>PyImageSearch University students</strong> get between 10-50 hours on a world-class GPU (time depends on the specific GPU you select).</p>\n\n\n\t<p>This gives you a chance to <strong>test-drive a monstrously powerful GPU</strong> on any of our tutorials in a jiffy.
