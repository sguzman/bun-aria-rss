  "description": "From the moment we are born, our cells begin to age. But aging does not have to mean decline. World-renowned surgeon Dr. Steven Gundry has been treating mature patients for most of his career. He knows that everyone thinks they want to live forever, until they hit middle age and witness the suffering of their parents and even their peers. So how do we solve the paradox of wanting to live to a ripe old age—but enjoy the benefits of youth?\nIn this episode I interview renown cardiologist and New York Times bestselling author Dr. Steven Gundry to discuss how we may be living longer but not better, how to reverse the disease of aging and prevent Alzheimers, how some vegetables may actually be harming our health, how lectins could be related to the rise of autoimmune diseases, how to help children develop healthy habits, and so much more! \nFor more info on Dr. Gundry visit: https://drgundry.com\nI also highly recommend his books:\nThe Plant Paradox: https://drgundry.com/books/\nThe Plant Paradox Family Cookbook: https://drgundry.com/books/\nThe Longevity Paradox: http://www.harperwave.com/book/9780062843395/The-Longevity-Paradox-Steven-R.-Gundry-MD/\nAnd follow him on social media:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drstevengundry/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DrStevenGundry/\nTwitter: https://www.facebook.com/DrStevenGundry/\n \nAdditional resources:\nGet my new 21 day brain detox program here: https://theswitch.app\nRegister now for my 2020 Mental Health Summit Dec 3-5 in Dallas, TX!
