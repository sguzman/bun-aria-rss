  "description": "Will Brinson, Nick Kostos, Pete Prisco and Jason La Canfora are all together again to recap Wild-Card Weekend. The guys start by recapping a thrilling finish that probably shouldn't have been so thrilling as the Saints narrowly beat the Panthers at home in an NFC South battle. Then, it's a discussion on bad coaching across the slate this weekend. Will, Nick, Pete and Jason break down the Falcons handling of the Rams, the Jaguars grind-it-out victory over Buffalo in a matchup of long postseason droughts, and then a refereeing disaster and epic collapse in KC vs. Tennessee. The episode wraps up by taking a look at the future of eliminated playoff teams, and a quick glance at the divisional round.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
