Championing its breakout stars, Def Jam became the label&nbsp;by&nbsp;signing the movement's ground-breaking forerunners – acts like the LL Cool J, Public Enemy, and The Beastie Boys.</p><p>But Def Jam was just the first step in Russell's empire building quest. Before selling the label to Universal Music Group in 1999 for $100 million, he formed RUSH Communications and quickly expanded his reach into&nbsp;artist management, apparel, and film & television projects like The Nutty Professor, Krush Groove, Gridlock'd and Def Comedy Jam.</p><p>Russell's current holdings include a vast array of entrepreneurial interests and philanthropic efforts, including All Def Digital, Argyleculture, RushCard, Global Grind, The Foundation For Ethnic Understanding and Tantris, a yoga & lifestyle destination currently in development.</p><p>All of this is fascinating. But what interests me most about Russell is his personal journey. How discovering yoga and meditation led to his embrace of a vegan lifestyle. And the tremendous extent to which his commitment to cultivating an inner life based on the spiritual principles of ahimsa — a Sanskrit term for no harm&nbsp;— has impacted both his private and public life, his approach to business and his commitment to service and advocacy.</p><p>Today we unpack all of it.</p><br><p>This episode is definitely&nbsp;my most unique to date. Generally, I endeavor to architect the basic trajectory of my conversations; I know where I want to start and I know where I want to go. Suffice it to say this did not happen&nbsp;with Russell. Within the first 5 seconds of our conversation one thing was clear — I was not in control. Russell's show, Russell's flow.</p><p>When the dust settled, all I could think was,&nbsp;what just happened?</p><p>That's charisma. This one's different.
