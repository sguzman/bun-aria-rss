  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, don’t fall for the New York Times’ Rod Rosenstein trap. The details of this story make it look like a strategic leak from someone in the Justice Department to the New York Times. Why was this story leaked now? It was leaked now, to prompt President Trump to fire Rosenstein and blow up the entire Brett Kavanaugh hearings, to have Republicans running for the hills, and to create chaos just ahead of the midterm elections. It's possible that this may be from the Andrew McCabe memo’s and may have been leaked by McCabe or the Special Counsel's office, which has the McCabe memo in their possession. Then, the Democrats are ready to impeach Brett Kavanaugh when he hasn't even been voted in yet! The Senate Judiciary committee has imposed a deadline of 10:00 pm Friday night for Christine Ford to appear and testify on Monday otherwise the scheduled vote will take place on Monday as planned. It's concerning that women are presumed to be victims and men are presumed to be perpetrators.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
