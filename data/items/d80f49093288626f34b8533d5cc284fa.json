  "title": "2021 NFL Draft Day 2 Winners & Losers: Raiders, Panthers, Browns emerge as winners, while Steelers, Jaguars and Aaron Rodgers considered losers (Football 5/1)",
  "description": "Day 2 of the 2021 NFL Draft is in the books and while we didn't have the same fireworks as Thursday, there were still plenty of notable moves that could dictate the path several franchises take next year and beyond. Will Brinson is joined by Josh Edwards and Chris Trapasso to break down everything from Rounds 2 & 3 with a focus on winners & losers from Friday. First, the guys pinpoint their favorite selections at the top of the 2nd round (6:30). Next, it's time to anoint winners (12:30). A couple of names like the Raiders and Eagles may be a surprise to see in this category. Also, could we be headed towards a Browns-Bills AFC Championship Game next season? Trapasso thinks so, but we know Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs will have something to say about that. The crew also dishes out losers from Day 2 (48:00) and Brinson torches the Jaguars and Edwards explains why the Steelers' draft has been a miss. Will, Josh and Chris break down the 3 quarterbacks that were selected on Friday (1:10:00), before highlighting a few of the best players available entering Saturday (1:13:00). \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
