  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has pulled the funding from conservative Republican candidates that he doesn't like because if they win, they might not vote for him as leader. McConnell was censured by the Alaska Republican Party after the Democrats endorsed RINO Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski. McConnell despises the conservative base of the Republican Party and supported Gerald Ford over Ronald Reagan and hated former President Trump. Then, the federal reserve was never intended to be the drug dealer to the drug addicts in Washington whose drug of choice is your tax dollars. Later, Jim Shultz, candidate for Attorney General of Minnesota, calls in to discuss how close his race against Keith Ellison is. Shultz highlighted how pro-violent crime the Democrats in Minnesota really are. Afterward, Rep Ted Budd joins the show to discuss his race for the US Senate in North Carolina. Budd says that the race is close and they aren't letting up. Budd says the Republican Party and State Committee have been helping to knock on doors and make phone calls to win this race. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
