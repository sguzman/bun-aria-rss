  "description": "<p>If you’re like most people, you’ve got a powerful computer in your back pocket that allows you to listen to this podcast, check the score of your favorite team, and learn the population of Mickey Mantle’s hometown of Commerce, OK (answer: 2,473). Our smartphones are a blessing, but for many people they can also feel like a curse. You feel compelled to check your device all the time, leaving you feeling disengaged from life. </p><p>What is it about modern technology that makes it feel so addictive? My guest todayexplores that topic in his book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HNJIK70/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B01HNJIK70&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked</em></a>. His name is Adam Alter and today on the show, we discuss what makes today's technology more compelling than the televisions and super Nintendos of old, whether our itch to check our phones can really be classified as an addiction, what soldiers' use of heroin during the Vietnam War can tell us about why our attachment to our phones is hard to shake, and how the reward we're looking for on social media isn't actually the \"likes\" themselves. Adam then shares what he thinks is the most effective tactic for taking back control of our tech, and how consumers may be able to influence the direction of its future. </p>\n",
