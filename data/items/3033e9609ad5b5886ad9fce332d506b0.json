  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Democrats are not serious about mask-wearing. Look at the maskless illegal aliens detained at the border, the situation is horrendous. Yet the rioters and arsonists didn't need to socially distance themselves while burning down various cities across the country. Now, hotels along the border are filled with often-times un-tested, potentially covid infected individuals flying people who are not vetted all over the country and the Biden administration remains silent. The Democrats just sit and watch the Cloward-Piven overload of our system take place. Landlords are being pummeled by the eviction moratorium and Democrats want to extend it even further. If you give the Dems an inch they'll take your whole country. The Marxists within the Democrat Party are adamant about turning Texas blue and if you're not down with the Marxist revolution, they will label you a white supremacist and cancel you. The full strength of the government's iron fist is pounding down on the We The People while the southern border is wide open. Then, China is slaughtering Muslims, targeting Christians, building their military to tame the pro-liberty movement in Tai wan, and businesses led by corporatist moral fraudsters like Lebron James and others across the country are happily waiting in line to do business with them. To paraphrase Thomas Paine, we must call upon all states to have more force (than not enough) when we're looking at the fate and survival of hope and virtue of America. Afterward, Sen. Mike Lee calls in to discuss the infrastructure bill negotiations in Washington, DC. The bill was 2700 pages long and was delivered in the dead of night. Lee says that it's wrong to rush something so massive and it must be rejected. Spending like this will exacerbate inflation in a way that will impact the pensions of any working Americans.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
