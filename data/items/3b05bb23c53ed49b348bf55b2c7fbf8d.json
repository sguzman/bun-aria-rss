  "description": "<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard about the minimalist lifestyle- maybe you&rsquo;re picturing a bearded hipster drinking coffee in his perfectly white dining room or an Instagram worthy, perfectly styled modern kitchen. It turns out that&rsquo;s <em>not</em> what minimalism is all about- it&rsquo;s about priorities. We felt that that summer is a great time to hit reset on a number of things in life, including the vast amount of clutter that many of us surround ourselves with. Here to talk with us today about minimalist living is Joshua Becker. While beginning the process of removing possessions from his life, Joshua started the site Becoming Minimalist and has written several fantastic books over the years including The More of Less<strong>, </strong>The Minimalist Home, as well as the recently published Things That Matter. Not only can a minimalist approach to life allow us to spend less and save or invest more, but it can have a positive impact in lots of areas of our life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed an I Feel It All by Monday Night Brewing!
