  "description": "Get out your air horns...Wednesday means it's time for the Brady Quinn Football Show! BQ joins host Will Brinson to discuss the slow starters of the league and the teams that have gotten off to perfect starts. On this episode, we're ignoring the middle. There are 11 teams that are 0-2. Which ones still stand the best chance to make the playoffs? The Eagles might be the favorite because of their division, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are the best team of the bunch. The Texans schedule has presented no favors and the Falcons, let's be honest, should be 1-1. The guys then flip the script and take a look at 2-0 teams that could miss the playoffs. The Ravens and Chiefs are locks but are there any guarantees after that? Could Brady actually join Pete Prisco on punching the Packers ticket to the Super Bowl already?
