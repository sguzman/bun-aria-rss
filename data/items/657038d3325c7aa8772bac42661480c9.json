  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the Washington Post and the New York Times are reporting that this program's network has pressured Mark to tamp doen election fraud talk – but that never happened. The Washington Post’s article was a complete fabrication and their reporter never contacted this program. These media companies are intent on interfering with this program and it's a disgrace. Then, it's advisable to not attend the Biden inauguration for the sake of avoiding violence which is predicted by the FBI. The electors have been counted, it's over! But there's 2022 and 2024. We must fight to take the house and the senate back in 2022. Corporatists, banks, and other companies are on the attack and Americans must be aware of where they spend their money. Later, did Nancy Pelosi call the Capitol Police, the DC Metro Police, or the National Guard \"stormtroopers\" when they showed up to save her and other members of Congress during the Capitol riot? No. Violence is on the rise in big Democrat cities yet the media was silent and echoed calls to defund the police in 2020. Interestingly, there is no talk of systemic racism in the law enforcement community in Washington, DC. Congress needs them for their own personal safety so they don't call to defund the DC Metro police. Afterward, Brandon Straka of the walkaway Movement calls in as his Facebook account, email service, and fundraising platform have been canceled. Straka says this is an opportunity for conservatives to break their toxic reliance on the political left with the tech industry and build their own platforms and services to become self-sufficient. Regarding the censorship of Parler, big tech does what Communist China does with speech it disagrees with, it quashes it. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
