  "description": "<p>With the playoffs not far away, there was plenty to talk about on this week's episode. The boys kicked things off talking about the NHL's newest supervillain, Calgary Flames rookie Matthew Tkachuk, and Wednesday's eventful tilt between him and his new enemies, the L.A. Kings. They also discuss future HOFer Jarome Iginla still chuckin' knucks in the twilight of his career and why Micheal Haley's one-game suspension for punching Calle Jankrok was so worth it. Barstool's New York Rangers writer 610 ( @610Barstool ) makes his Chiclets debut to get us up to speed on all things Rags before the fellas tackle #AllRightHamilton questions. They also get into the Bruins signing Charlie McAvoy, teams adding college players this time of year, and several other league notes. Tune in, give it a whirl.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
