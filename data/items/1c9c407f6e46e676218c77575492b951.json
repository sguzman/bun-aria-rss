Because we are not nearing the edge of a cliff. We have already flung ourselves off.</p><p>Hitting the brakes isn't enough. We need to jam the engine into reverse.&nbsp;We need an immediate call to action. We need a 'Manhattan Project' scale approach to reckon with the objective truth of our dire predicament.</p><p><strong>Margaret Klein Salamon, PhD</strong>&nbsp;is here to guide us.&nbsp;</p><p>A Harvard graduate and self-dubbed “climate psychologist,” Margaret is the founder and executive director of&nbsp;The Climate Mobilization,&nbsp;a volunteer organization dedicated to initiating a transformation of the economy, politics, and society to respond to the climate emergency. She is also the author of&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Facing the Climate Emergency: How to Transform Yourself with Climate Truth</em>,&nbsp;an emotional guide to processing our impending apocalypse, and the subject of today's exchange.</p><p>Recorded remotely in early June, this is a conversation about our emotional response to climate change, and tools for contributing to the positive change required of us.</p><p>It's about the intersectionality of the climate crisis--it’s ties to the pandemic as well as the protests.</p><p>It’s about the inherent conflict between capitalism and environmentalism--and how we must de-couple corporate self-interest from the public good.&nbsp;</p><p>And it’s about how to deal with weaponized media and the way in which we are being spoon-fed lies by conglomerated industry over-invested in maintaining the status quo.</p><p>But more than anything, this is a discourse about effective altruism--and the actionable steps we can take now to backtrack from the global suicide we are nearing.</p><p>It's normal to feel disheartened. Action seems futile. And 2020 has maxed out our collective bandwidth when it comes to crises and revolutions.&nbsp;But embracing the truth and finding a way to contribute to positive change is not only mandatory -- it’s a path to hope.
