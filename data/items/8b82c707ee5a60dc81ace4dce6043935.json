Good news, chances are it never will. Bad news, chances are it’s not going away and if you’ve been avoiding this conversation, it needs to end today. Cryptocurrency is the fastest growing technology we’ve ever witnessed in human history. 10 years ago people doubted it, laughed at it, and blew it off. Today, countries like Nigeria, Vietnam and the Philippines are starting to adopt crypto. What is often rejected and feared is typically not understood. While billionaires and master investors once turned their backs to Bitcoin and the crypto world, they are slowly coming around and see the potential of what this currency and technology really is. Anthony Pompliano joins Tom to put you on notice and help you better understand exactly why low income and middle class people literally cannot afford to continue dismissing the potential for building wealth with cryptocurrency. Blockchain is happening and there is a major shift in wealth and purchasing power taking place. You owe it to yourself and to your future generations to at least do some more research, investigate and find out how you can better leverage the potential that a new digital world represents for you. The cost of entry is low, it’s decentralized, and for the first time you are not restricted by your income to take advantage.   SHOW NOTES:   0:00 | Introduction Anthony Pompliano 0:50 | Disadvantage of Non-Investors 7:27 | Understanding Personal Finance 13:18 | Cryptocurrency and Fiat Money 20:44 | Bitcoin’s Volatility Advantages 25:36 | Breadcrumbs for Going Digital 30:50 | Increasing Purchasing Power 35:22 | Censored Payment Systems 46:15 | Benefit of Open Payment System 56:23 | Decentralized Tech Structure 1:03:00 | Predicting vs. Observing Market 1:09:45 | Digital Versions of Analog (NFTs) 1:20:05 | Blockchain Is Happening 1:31:13 | The Monetary Revolution 1:38:55 | Bitcoin Global Reserve Currency 1:47:04 | Why Pomp Choices Bitcoin   QUOTES:   “Poor people spend the middle class, save, and then the wealthy invest.” Tom Bilyeu [0:24]   “There’s really one key rule that everyone has to understand, which is, the dollars will be worth less than purchasing power terms over a long period of time.” [3:43]   “It's easy to mock and make fun of these young people. But these young people are interested in understanding how does the market works.” [8:03]   “It is impossible, literally impossible in America to get a financial security position by saving” [10:21]   “I can either suffer at the hands of this system, or I can flip around to the other side table, and I can benefit from the system. Every single rich person understands how to benefit from the system, hold assets, not a currency” [18:46]   “All money, at the end of the day, is a unit of time.” [31:28]   “Bitcoin, specifically, it has a financial component that is unavailable and other assets, it is systematically built to continue to protect your purchasing power” [33:02]   “The more that you can be a market observer, rather than a market predictor, you start to just understand, crazy stuff happens.” [1:07:03]   “The digital version of something is always bigger than the analog version” [1:10:19]   “Everything you think is cool is going to go to zero, and everything that you think is dumb is going to moon.” Tom Bilyeu [1:19:36]   Follow Anthony Pompliano: Website: <a href=\"https://www.anthonypompliano.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.anthonypompliano.com/</a> YouTube:  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCevXpeL8cNyAnww-NqJ4m2w\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCevXpeL8cNyAnww-NqJ4m2w</a> Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/APompliano\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/APompliano</a>",
