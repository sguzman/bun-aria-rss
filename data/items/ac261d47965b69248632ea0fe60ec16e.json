  "description": "<p>Celine Dion. The name alone conjures certain imagery. A lightning bolt shooting out of a finger during a performance of \"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\". A huge ship sinking. A mom crying. On the Fourth Day of the 12 Days of Culture, Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang exalt the one and only Celine and share Vegas memories, lift up the bops we've come to know (\"That's The Way It Is\" really does come out of nowhere sometimes and slay you! HO!), and talk about the underground Celine smashes (\"Imperfections\"? Heard of it?!) while navigating a space where their own Hot Engineer Doug, a straight man, claims to have been unaware of Celine's importance during the time he worked with her on her huge album <em>Let's Talk About Love </em>in the 90's. It's a lot to get through and says a lot about what a long way we still have to go as a human race. All this, how \"goofy\" and \"silly\" are different, Bowen reveals that he does not know who Ava Max is, and the boys resist sharing the ages of their mothers on the podcast.
