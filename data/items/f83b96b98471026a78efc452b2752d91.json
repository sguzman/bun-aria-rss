  "description": "Chinmay Tumbe's book Moving India: A History of Migration (Penguin/Viking, 2018) is a brilliant and path-breaking history of Migration in India. Tumbe analyses the interlinked histories of migrations of different communities in and out of India and the world. His focus is novel and he argues for regarding the Great Indian Migration Wave as a unique phenomenon especially in terms of its voluntary character at time and also its consequences in the flow of labor and capital in most parts of the world. Written in a very lively style and backed with solid research and facts; the book is a treat for academics and lay readers alike.\nSanjay Kumar teaches at the Central European University.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
