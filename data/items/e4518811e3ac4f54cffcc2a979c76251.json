  "description": "<p>This week, we discuss how to handle a slump... those times when you turn up to work, and put in the hours, and yet nothing goes right; somehow the well has run dry, When this happens it's so easy for us to start berating ourselves, but actually we both believe this is a natural part of the process. Alice has always believed in taking breaks, but Louise finds that difficult since painting is the most joyful thing she does. So we brainstorm solutions and offer tips and strategies for anyone experiencing the same thing. Alice's suggestions include steppin<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/buy/thankyou/handlers/display.html?ie=UTF8&asins=B000VDPNCQ&isRefresh=1&orderId=205-5750955-0929918&purchaseId=204-5464365-6085955&ref_=chk_typ_browserRefresh&viewId=ThankYouCart\">g</a> back to assess what has been working and what hasn't. Louise thinks getting outside input might be one solution. &nbsp;Whatever the solution turns out to be, Alice believes this is a breakthrough moment and so we end our discussion with a challenge for Louise - go explore her newest idea and just see where it leads. This is an honest and open look at one artist's process - the good and the bad - and we hope it encourages you if you ever feel down about your work.</p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
