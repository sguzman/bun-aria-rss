  "description": "<p>WRITE YOUR STORY. Everyone has a story. You do. I do. Your life will be recorded. The question is, is your story the one that you want to be told? We often let other people write our pages instead of taking the pen and doing it ourselves. If you want your life to be a masterpiece, you’re going to have to live intentionally. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with John Maxwell where he shared the gift that inspired him to live an intentional life. John C. Maxwell is a #1 New York Times bestselling author, coach, and speaker who has sold more than 25 million books in fifty languages. In 2014 he was identified as the #1 leader in business by the American Management Association and the most influential leadership expert in the world by Business Insider and Inc. magazine. The recipient of the Mother Teresa Prize for Global Peace and Leadership from the Luminary Leadership Network, Dr. Maxwell speaks each year to Fortune 500 companies, presidents of nations, and many of the world's top business leaders. John says that in order to live intentionally, you have to bridge the gap between knowing and doing. You have to take your good intentions and act them out.</p>\n",
