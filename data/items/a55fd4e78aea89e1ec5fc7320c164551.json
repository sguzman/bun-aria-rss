  "description": "<p>Michael worked his way down from the treetops with a chainsaw hanging from his belt to owning a company (<a href=\"https://ponderosamillworks.com/\">Ponderosa Millworks</a>) that repurposes urban trees, making uniquely gorgeous tables, chairs, bars, countertops, etc. But he's so much more than a businessman. Michael is a guy who GETS THINGS DONE. He's got tremendous energy and a tremendously generous spirit. He's a lovely man, teaching us all better ways to interact with each other and the other living things around us.
