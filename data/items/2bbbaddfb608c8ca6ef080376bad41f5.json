    "media:description": "Google doesn't have the best history with its projects. And now, they've released another one. KataOS aims to be a secure operating system kernel for Internet of Things or IOT devices. The idea behind this OS is that it will be mathematically proven to be secure. If it can do this, then the world of IOT security will be solved. Surely, this can't go wrong.\n\nGoogle in the past has not done the best with sticking to its new projects. There's a list of projects online that Google has started but not completely adhered to and seen all the way to the end. \n\nKeyboard ASMR. Check it out.\n\nWhat do you think about this?
