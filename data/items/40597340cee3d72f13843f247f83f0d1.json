  "description": "<p>Visual Teach and Repeat 3 (VT&amp;R3), a generalization of stereo VT&amp;R, achieves\nlong-term autonomous path-following using topometric mapping and localization\nfrom a single rich sensor stream. In this paper, we improve the capabilities of\na LiDAR implementation of VT&amp;R3 to reliably detect and avoid obstacles in\nchanging environments. Our architecture simplifies the obstacle-perception\nproblem to that of place-dependent change detection. We then extend the\nbehaviour of generic sample-based motion planners to better suit the\nteach-and-repeat problem structure by introducing a new edge-cost metric paired\nwith a curvilinear planning space. The resulting planner generates naturally\nsmooth paths that avoid local obstacles while minimizing lateral path deviation\nto best exploit prior terrain knowledge. While we use the method with VT&amp;R, it\ncan be generalized to suit arbitrary path-following applications. Experimental\nresults from online run-time analysis, unit testing, and qualitative\nexperiments on a differential drive robot show the promise of the technique for\nreliable long-term autonomous operation in complex unstructured environments.\n</p>",
