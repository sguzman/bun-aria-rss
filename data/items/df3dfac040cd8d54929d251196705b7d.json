In this episode of Crash Course Kids, Sabrina shows us how matter is affected by different pressures and how that makes water do some weird things. \n\n///Standards Used in This Video///\n5-PS1-3. Make observations and measurements to identify materials based on their properties. [Clarification Statement: Examples of materials to be identified could include baking soda and other powders, metals, minerals, and liquids. Examples of properties could include color, hardness, reflectivity, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, response to magnetic forces, and solubility; density is not intended as an identifiable property.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment does not include density or distinguishing mass and weight.]\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nCrash Course Main Channel: https://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/thecrashcourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com\n\nCredits...\nProducer & Editor: Nicholas Jenkins\nCinematographer & Director: Michael Aranda\nHost: Sabrina Cruz\nScript Supervisor: Mickie Halpern\nWriter: Kay Boatner\nExecutive Producers: John & Hank Green\nConsultant: Shelby Alinsky\nScript Editor: Blake de Pastino\n\nThought Cafe Team:\nStephanie Bailis\nCody Brown\nSuzanna Brusikiewicz\nJonathan Corbiere\nNick Counter\nKelsey Heinrichs\nJack Kenedy\nCorey MacDonald\nTyler Sammy\nNikkie Stinchcombe \nJames Tuer\nAdam Winnik",
