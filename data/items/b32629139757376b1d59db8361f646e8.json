  "description": "<p><p>Kawhi Leonard is a killer (2:27 - 5:53). We recap both Game 7's on Sunday. Joel Embiid cried, CJ McCollum went off and Magic Johnson had a glitch in his system (5:53 - 16:11). Steph and the Warriors ruined the Rockets forever (16:11 - 26:22). Who's back of the week including the clutch gene and James Harden's lack of it + #BigMad for Rockets fans (26:22 - 38:35). 3X NBA Champion Rick Fox joins the show to talk about his crazy path to the NBA, playing for Phil Jackson, Shaq and Kobe and more (38:35 - 71:12). Segments include No one wants to coach the Lakers, Drunk Idea, Monday Reading and the (starts at 88:24) dumbest Game of Thrones recap on the internet. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
