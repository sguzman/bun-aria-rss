Prisco joins host Will Brinson to discuss all elements of the Top 100 including omissions, which Browns fans would say are led by the absence of Baker Mayfield. We cover how Pete determines positional value, how to weigh injuries, the track record of veterans and status of unproven young players. We'll give away just 1 more secret: Patrick Mahomes remains #1 on the list.
