  "description": "This episode comes to you from Day 3 of Nashville Week! Our guest is Nashville-based interior designer and nonprofit art gallery owner Julie Couch. Her work has been featured in Country Living, Southern Home, domino and she was named one of Traditional Home’s Rising Stars. She was also on DIY Network’s Nashville Flipped. This busy lady sits down with us to talk about her many projects, her love of performance fabrics and textiles, staying accessible and how to jazz up the popular all-white look.\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nJulie’s doesn’t have a particular style, but she likes to pull her client’s requests through her own filter. She particularly likes performance fabrics.\n\nJulie likes the motto, “If you feel like you have to impress somebody at your house, then you don’t need to invite them over.” And that design is evident in designing her own home.\n\nHaving kids in the house doesn’t mean you can’t have nice things; Julie didn’t alter her home much when her daughter was born. Life is short—make your home beautiful! Even on a budget.\n\nJulie wants to take the intimidation out of the building and design process, so she is very transparent.\n\nWhat the best plan and biggest challenges are for all-white rooms; and how to make them unique.\n\nAll about the spiral slide one of Julie’s clients wanted in her kids’ playroom.\n\nOne thing Julie is seeing is clients being adventurous with their bathrooms, laundry and mud rooms.\n\nHow to layer in textiles to make the light and white rooms feel more cozy.\n\nWith more people at home, they are decorating and designing their spaces.\n\nJulie believes designing your home should be accessible; she has a blog with free advice and encourages people to think of design as an ongoing process.\n\nWith so many clients finding Julie through social media, she has really embraced it as a tool.\n\nWhy one of Julie’s biggest dislikes are rugs that are too small.\n\nMore about Julie’s nonprofit art gallery, G Grace Gallery, that benefits chronically ill children.\n\nJulie’s tips on how to start and display an art collection.\n\nHow Julie is able to bring back an old-fashioned classic, café panels, and make it feel modern.\n\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\nJulie Couch Interiors\nJulie Couch on Instagram\nJulie Couch on Facebook\nG Grace Gallery\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Lee,\nThis room is adorable! We agree that the wallpaper would be so pretty and we would put it on every surface you can; walls, ceilings, everywhere. We would use a fun print but in a lighter color. For the window, a Roman shade mounted all the way up where it meets the ceiling will define the window but add a softness. Over in the niche, a little desk or vanity table would be really nice with a shaded sconce above it. Wired sconces on the angled ceiling would be great, as well. We love this room and can’t wait to see what you do with it!",
