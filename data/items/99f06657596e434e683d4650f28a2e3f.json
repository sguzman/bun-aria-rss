Orlando Pride teammates with Ali and engaged to Toni, Marta admits to having more of an open mind when it comes to vegan prepared meals since living with Toni and adapting a more healthy lifestyle.  Becoming the cooking duo's toughest critic, Marta helps them prepare a a Mushroom Bolognese, straying from her Brazilian roots where meat, specifically steak, is a core part of every meal.<br /><br />While preparing the meal, Ali takes the opportunity to chat with Marta and focus the conversation on her personal journey, the stories that not many know about the global soccer star. Marta opens up about her tough childhood, close sibling bonds and being the rock of her family as she shares her emotional journey of leaving home at a young age to pursue her dream. Holding back tears, the memories get the best of her as she realizes everything it took for her to achieve success and not only become the best in the world, but pave the way for other young women and athletes originating from her home country of Brazil. <br /><br />Turning the tears into laughter, the three share some funny moments and of course a little kitchen competition to kick off the cooking challenge. Although, It proves hard to have a friendly soccer juggle when you are up against the GOAT, who only knows how to finish in first, even if it's as silly as juggling cherry tomatoes!<br /><br />Girls Gone Veg is a limited eight part series releasing a new episode every Friday at Noon eastern on the I Am Athlete Channel. <br /><br /></p>\n",
