  "description": "<p>      Michael and Steve are joined by guest Max Casella (Benny Fazio). Max is a show business veteran who has appeared in a number of hit movies and TV shows including; The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Inside Llewyn Davis, Blue Jasmine, Doogie Howser and of course the Sopranos. He talks about how he got his start in the business and what it was like to work with Woody Allen, The Coen Brothers and to perform the Lion King on Broadway. He also shares his story of auditioning for David Chase and how he thought it was the worst audition of his life. Imagine how shocked he was when he landed the re-occurring role of Benny Fazio. </p><p>      Then the guys turn their focus to food. Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Pizza, whatever. They trade stories of amazing meals they’ve had and their top restaurants in NY, LA, Sidney and around the world. Plus get the scoop on all the cool little places the Sopranos cast used to go during and after shooting the show. </p><p>     After that Michael and Steve get into this week’s show which sort of a Christmas episode…Sopranos style. Bobby wants nothing to do with Kris Kringle, Sil is having nightmares about Pussy, and the kids tell Santa to go f**k himself. Paulie talks about the real story of Christmas where the elves give good kids toys and the bad ones a beating. Ho F**king Ho, Taking Sopranos is taking on S3 E10 “To Save Us All From Satan’s Power”.
