  "description": "Prison. Assassins. Marionette dance parties. The original story of Pinocchio has it all. Of course, you know of Pinocchio and Geppetto, but did you know that Geppetto, in order to get the wood to make Pinocchio, had to chew on an old man's wig? Or that the original story had a shockingly brutal end, even for an 1800s children's tale? Check it out. This story is wild. The creature this time is a giant grasshopper who wants to have your kids over for dinner. And no, he's not being playfully ambiguous with that wording. He's going to eat your children and there's nothing you can do to stop him because he's a twelve foot tall grasshopper. -- Sponsors: I've been a happy Simplisafe customer for two years. Check them out. Go to http://www.simplisafe.com/legends Yes. We replaced our Casper...with another Casper. It's the best mattress I've ever used.
