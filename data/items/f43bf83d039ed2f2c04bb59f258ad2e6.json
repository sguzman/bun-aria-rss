  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking!   Today I talk about something my subscribers will get very familiar with... Stop-loss orders. This is an investment strategy I will use and strongly recommend for every stock pick in the portfolio. But as you might notice, my recommended stop-loss percentages often vary. Depending on the size of the stock and other technicals, the formula switches.  And this is extremely important for protection purposes. Today I explain why. Moving on... I then talk about a stock that I've been getting tons of emails on - Northern Dynasty (NAK). Just last week the state of Alaska came out with game-changing news surrounding NAK's land-permit. The stock rose 34.1% in one trading day. This is a huge slap in the face for the infamous short-seller Kerrisdale Capital. And I'll explain why. But we cannot forget... Northern Dynasty still has their biggest hurdle ahead. Join me this week as I break-down the recent news, what it means for the company, and how I think investors should react. Other topics talked about: Advice for any entrepreneurs, a perfect example of compounding your investments, and how to get your feet on the ground in the world of finance. Also, once again... And I'll never stop saying it... Thank you to all of my listeners for joining me on my newest venture - Curzio Research Advisory.  It's been a successful launch. And I'm already looking towards next months pick! Special thanks to Brett, Jose, Douglas, and John for all the great questions.  Keep them coming! Just email me at Frank@CurzioResearch.com Good Investing,  Frank Curzio        ",
