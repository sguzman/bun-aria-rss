  "description": "<p>We’re headed off to an owl sanctuary to meet up with Nolan the know-it-owl for a special night owl Tour. We hear the sound of owl wings and check out some super-tubular owl eye facts. Find out how owls can swivel their heads 270 degrees and why their ears are at uneven spots on their heads. We’ll meet a poetry-loving barn owl named Olive, who fills us in on why owls are considered wise. Fun fact: owls are sometimes classified by their sounds -- bigger owls are <em>hooters</em> and smaller owls are <em>tooters</em>!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Special Thanks to the Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for the owl sounds used in this episode:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Jian Diego Fernández / Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (ML420855751)<br>Paul Marvin / Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (ML97928071)<br>Bob McGuire / Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (ML188805)<br>Wil Hershberger / Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (ML100707)<br>Gerrit Vyn / Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (ML140258)<br>Thomas G.
