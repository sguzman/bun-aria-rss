  "title": "CAFE Insider Sample 5/10: “Hellish Dystopian Nightmare”",
  "description": "In this sample from the CAFE Insider podcast, Preet and Joyce break down the latest developments from the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade. Why did Justice Alito focus on policy arguments to rationalize his decision? And how might classifying a “fetus” as a person further restrict reproductive rights?\n\nIn the full episode, Preet and Joyce further discuss issues stemming from the leaked opinion:\n\n– The extent to which overturning Roe would restrict abortion access and jeopardize the right to contraception;\n– The implications for other constitutional rights, including the right to interracial and same-sex marriage, and the right to consensual sexual intimacy; and\n– The Supreme Court Marshal’s ongoing investigation into the source of the leak.\n\nStay informed. For continued coverage of the Supreme Court — and the other pressing legal and political issues of our time — try the membership for one month for $1.00: www.cafe.com/insider. You’ll get access to full episodes of the podcast, and other exclusive benefits.\n\nThis podcast is brought to you by CAFE Studios and Vox Media Podcast Network. \n\nREFERENCES & SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS: \n\nDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, U.S. Supreme Court, Alito draft opinion, 2/10/22\n\nRoe v. Wade, U.S. Supreme Court, opinion, 1973\nLearn more about your ad choices.
