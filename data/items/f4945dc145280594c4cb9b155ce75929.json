    "media:description": "5D Diplomacy With Multiverse Time Travel. That's it. That's the video.\n\nCode on GitHub: https://github.com/Oliveriver/5d-diplomacy-with-multiverse-time-travel\n\nMy original 5D Chess video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7VAnAgmshA\nMy original Diplomacy video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUaLEgzvMQs\nFacebook AI plays Diplomacy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Df_58LJVLs\n\nJoin my Discord: https://discord.gg/AVcU9w5gVW\n\nTo my utter disbelief, I managed to program a multiversal time travelling version of Diplomacy. Well, a very simplified Diplomacy. But hey, I've shown a 5D Diplomacy game can exist. As a maths student, that's enough for me. The rest I leave as an exercise for the viewer.\n\nMUSIC\n\nMonkeys Spinning Monkeys\nKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)",
