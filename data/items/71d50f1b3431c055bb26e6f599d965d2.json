  "description": "<p><p>Tiger Woods is officially Back. We talk about the awesome sports Sunday and Tiger Woods winning his first major in 11 years (2:27 - 15:25). NBA playoffs and we're officially and Orlando Magic podcast now. NHL Playoffs, did the Caps kill the Penguins and the Lightning (15:25 - 21:39). Who's back of the week including gum chewing and Magic Johnson tweets (21:39 - 33:19). Scott Van Pelt joins the show from Augusta to talk about Tiger's 5 green jacket, the scene on Sunday, the comeback, and whether or not it's time for Tiger to \"come home\" (embrace the bald) (33:19 - 61:29). Segments include THIS LEAGUE for Amir Johnson on his phone, it's louisiana who cares, and hot in the streets. </p> Finally we wrap up with a Game of Thrones recap. Big Cat binged the last 7 seasons and gives all the hot takes he wrote down plus Episode 1 talk and who will win the throne. It's without a doubt the dumbest Game of Thrones talk on the internet but perfectly in line with what we do. </p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
