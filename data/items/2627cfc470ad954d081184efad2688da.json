  "description": "Last week, the Fed announced the results of its annual stress test… and all the major U.S. banks passed. Now, banks are raising dividends and buybacks—all good news for the economy. But a few days later, Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, shared an op-ed slamming bank bailouts. Here’s why he’s full of s***. [00:35] Then, Genia Turanova, editor of Curzio’s MoneyFlow Trader and Unlimited Income, shares her thoughts on whether inflation will be transitory... and the risks it creates over the long term. With all the uncertainty in today’s markets, Genia lays out the importance of hedging your portfolio… and how her MoneyFlow Trader strategy can limit your losses. Genia also offers a valuable lesson on why you should be skeptical of high-dividend-paying companies... and what income investors should look for instead. [25:39] Plus, how retail investors are driving “meme” stocks higher… And who will benefit the most from rising capital expenditures.
