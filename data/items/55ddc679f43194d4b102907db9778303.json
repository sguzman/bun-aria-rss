  "description": "Born on a farm in southeast Colorado near the Oklahoma panhandle, Clare's roots run deep in the heart of Dust Bowl country. Working cattle, hauling water, driving combines, tractors and eighteen wheelers from a young age all were a part of everyday life. When your closest neighbor is six miles away, and many hours are spent behind the wheel of a John Deere Tractor on the family farm, a work ethic becomes ingrained in your soul. During the miles burned up hauling water to cattle, Clare dreamed of creating her own music.\n\nFred talks to Clare about life in Colorado and nails down her palate as a cornbread fan.
