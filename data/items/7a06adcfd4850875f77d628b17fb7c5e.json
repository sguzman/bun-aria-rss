  "content": "<p>Did Fear betwixt the winters hide,\n<br />In Autumn, donned his mangy hide,\n<br />“Hail all, all’s well!” he ravenously cried.\n<br />He lied.</p>\n\n<p>And now he darkens darkness skyed,\n<br />And now the hands of cold untied,\n<br />And now his hunger grows. With every stride\n<br />They died.</p>\n\n<p>The mother begs a piece of bread;\n<br />She claims the cold’s gone to his head.\n<br />“Or maybe you could spare a quid instead,”\n<br />She said.</p>\n\n<p>How art thou, banker, in thy lair?\n<br />Dost thou know that it’s unfair?\n<br />Canst thou see (wouldst thou give the merest care)\n<br />Her stare?</p>\n\n<p>When all’s repaid that has been spent\n<br />That day there will be no relent\n<br />Wouldst thou, before then, offer some consent,\n<br />Repent?</p>"
