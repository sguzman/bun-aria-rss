  "description": "<p>The village of Tilty is in the county of Essex in England. The county is known for its Medieval Gothic architecture using various stones, wood and bricks in the construction of buildings that have thus endured for centuries. Some of these structures have not fared well though and one of these is Tilty Abbey. All that really remains of the abbey are some crumbling stone walls in the field and a chapel outside the gates built for worshipers who were not monks. The abbey was built in the 12th century and was a religious and social center. Some may say that a religious location is a source for the supernatural and it would seem that Tilty Abbey remains such a source today with rumors of strange creatures, headless monks wandering around, curses and other strange occurrences. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Tilty Abbey and her village! The Moment in Oddity features Murder Bottles and This Month in History features the birthday of Mildred \"Babe\" Didrikson. Our location was suggested by listener Bob Sherfield.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/06/hgb-ep-209-tilty-abbey.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/06/hgb-ep-209-tilty-abbey.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",
