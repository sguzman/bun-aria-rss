  "title": "PMS 2.0 154 - MLB ConTROVersy Chat w/ Gold Glove Tucker Barnhart. Also, Legends Jeff Garcia & Thomas Morestead Stop By",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat reacts to the shocking news of Luke Kuechly's retirement from the Carolina Panthers after 8 seasons as arguably the best linebacker in the game. Pat reflects on some of the thoughts he had when announcing his retirement and looks back on what will undoubtedly be a Hall of Fame career for Kuechly. Pat and the boys also discuss what comes next for Matt Rhule and the Carolina Panthers as they lose Kuechly and hire LSU passing game coordinator Joe Brady, and what that means for their Quarterback situation and if they are now in a position to trade up to try and draft Joe Burrow. Next, Gold Glove winner and current Catcher of the Cincinnati Reds, Tucker Barnhart stops by to discuss the controversy surrounding the cheating scandal that has rocked the Houston Astros, Boston Red Sox, and the rest of the MLB. Tucker explains why he doesn't necessarily like what is happening with the punishments, gives his take on the whole situation, and explains his opinions on the entire situation, as a guy who is intimately involved with giving signs every game (20:33-31:54). Next, 4x Pro Bowler, Grey Cup Champion, and legend of an NFL Quarterback, Jeff Garcia joins Pat and the boys to discuss the NFL Conference Championships. Jeff gives his thoughts on Green Bay vs. San Francisco, and why he thinks the game will be closer than most people think, and what he sees as the keys to the game are for both the Packers and the 49ers. Jeff also dives into the AFC Championship and explains why it is so hard to stop a guy like Patrick Mahomes, but why a team like the Titans might have the perfect formula for doing so (33:33-44:10). Lastly, Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, All Pro, and current Punter for the New Orleans Saints, Thomas Morestead joins the show live from LA. Thomas and Pat discuss where things are currently at with the NFLPA discussions and if he thinks things are moving in the right direction. He gives his thoughts on the state of the Saints after another crushing defeat in the playoffs and whether or not he thinks Drew Brees will return to New Orleans for another season, and what makes him so special. Thomas also reacts to Luke Kuechly's retirement and discusses whether or not he thinks this will become more of a norm moving forward with elite players retiring during what most would consider the prime of their careers. Pat and Thomas also reflect on the PFF Punter of the decade and Pat shares the story about how Thomas taught him how to punt after he got drafted (46:18-59:43). Today's show is a loaded one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
