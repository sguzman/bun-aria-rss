A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. Identity Politics,\n\nThis week has been filled with an exciting buffet of government actions. From the outright threat from the left to keep an illegal immigration policy in place (DACA), to the complaints that the Temporary Protected Status for 200,000 Nicaraguans is being lifted, to the events in Las Vegas, NV when the Federal Judge dimissd the case against Clliven Bundy and some of his suppporters. Hardliners on both sides have had something to say with little to contribute.\n\nJoin me tomorrow at 1030am Pacific, when I open up the lines, and discuss how all of these changes are good for us, and even the people that they effect.\n\nTrigger Warning; I'm not intending to be Politically Correct.\n\nPodcast: Galtspeaks.com Contact: Radio@galtspeaks.com Follow us on twitter.com/radiomarkowitz & Facebook.com/radiomarkowitz Also available on Podomatic.com at http://wrm.podomatic.com, and Spreaker-www.spreaker.com/show/the-warren-markowitz-show",
