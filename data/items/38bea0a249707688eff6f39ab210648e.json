  "content:encoded": "<h1>Our friend the hippocampus!</h1>\n<h3>Neuronerds &#8211; this one is for you. What exactly is happening in our brains when we feel defensive? We go beyond the basics of the amygdala and the pre-frontal cortex and deep dive into the hippocampus to help us understand more deeply what is happening under the surface of our problematic behaviors.</h3>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>The hippocampus deep dive is part 2 of a 5-part series and you can pick it up anywhere.  However, if you prefer to start at the beginning, click here to go to<strong> <a href=\"http://therapistuncensored.com/183\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Session 1.</span>  </a></strong></em></h4>\n<p>In the last episode, we explored what Sue and Ann call the 3-R spiral of change, <strong>Recognize, Reflect and Rewire.</strong>  We also identified various common defenses. In this episode, Ann & Sue break down the different areas of our brain, and discuss the roles each can play in our defense responses. Understanding the critical interplay between the amygdala and hippocampus gives us more insight into our own behavior and sheds light on how our history can intrude today. They explain the concept of &#8220;coherent narrative&#8221; and discuss applying the 3 R Spiral to our relationships and personal healing. By blending neuroscience and these strategies, we can begin to sort through our unconscious defenses and rewire the ways in which we navigate our interpersonal world.</p>\n<blockquote><p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-13710 alignright\" src=\"https://therapistuncensored.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-engin-akyurt-3356489-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"234\" height=\"156\" /></p>\n<h2>&#8220;If you&#8217;re someone that needs to be right or needs to be giving advice &#8211; you might not recognize that&#8217;s your own defense.
