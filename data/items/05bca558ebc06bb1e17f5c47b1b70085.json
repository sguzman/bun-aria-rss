  "description": "<p>Kate Logan, an Evangelical missionary, was in The Dominican Republic on a break from her second year of film school when she stumbled uponÂ  Escuela Caribe, an American-operated, faith-based reform school that aims to \"cure\" teens of homosexuality and purge \"ungodly\" influences though \"Christian milieu therapy.\" She set out to document the 'good work' the school was doing, but quickly realized that the kids she was documenting were in serious danger at the hands of their 'house fathers.' Kate then embarks on a year long journey of helping one of the students, David, escape.</p>\n",
