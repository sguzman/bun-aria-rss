Even if you’re not a home flipper, it’s hard to not get sucked into the glitz and glamor of watching <strong>Tarek El Moussa</strong> and his team rip out old fixtures from the 1950s and replace them with brand new, beautifully designed upgrades. <strong>Tarek is one of the most recognized home flippers in the world </strong>and has inspired thousands of others to start <a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/4-reasons-to-invest-in-real-estate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>building wealth through real estate</strong></a>. He’s an inspiration to all of us, but how did he get to such a peak point?</p><p>Tarek wasn’t a great flipper right out the gate.<strong> He electrocuted and burned himself</strong> <strong>on his first deal</strong>, but that wasn’t enough to deter him. Before the great recession, Tarek was living large,<strong> making forty-thousand dollars a month</strong> in his early twenties. But when the crash came, <strong>he had to sell everything and start from scratch</strong>. After attending a real estate seminar he caught the flipping bug and realized he needed to invest in real estate full-time.</p><p>After a successful first flip, he <strong>pitched the idea of <em>Flip or Flop</em></strong> to different television networks, with HGTV finally giving him a chance.
