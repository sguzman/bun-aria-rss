  "description": "<p>“Change will not come if we wait for some other person, or if we wait for some other time. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.” – Barack Obama<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Our society is experiencing deep disconnection, turmoil, and uncertainty. As we face two devastating crises, we also have an incredible opportunity. We get to decide if we will remain in fear, struggle, and disconnection—or instead create a brighter future focused on solutions, equality, and connection.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>I couldn’t think of anyone better suited to address this topic than Dr. Michael Bernard Beckwith. Michael is a thought leader, spiritual teacher, and the founder of the Agape International Spiritual Center. His message has proved to be of abundant inspiration and empowerment to me personally, and I hope you will receive the same gift from this interview.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>This episode is about finding empowerment in times of despair and turmoil, opening your mind and heart to new paradigms, and how to step into a more elevated way of being.
