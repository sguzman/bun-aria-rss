  "description": "This week, the gals squeeze into their corsets to chat about some disarming damsels over a pitcher of sweet tea. Topics include the dangers of hoopskirts, a gunslingin' Outlaw Queen, and a daring Civil War spy. Replace that sweet tea with City Winery's Gone with the Vin, mind your crinoline, and tune in for Southern Belles (Live from Atlanta)!",
