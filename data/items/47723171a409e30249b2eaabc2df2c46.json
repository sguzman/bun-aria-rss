  "description": "People’s Tribunals, Human Rights and the Law (Routledge, 2020) gives a vital introduction to an essential but overlooked topic; the rise of People’s Tribunals, their role in truth and justice, and the contribution they make to redress the rights of survivors and victims. People’s Tribunals are independent, grassroots movements, growing from civil society which address past atrocities in spaces where governments or political agendas can’t or won’t. They provide a voice and recognition for survivors, and have the potential to spark dialogue and action beyond the scope provided by the normative domestic or international legal framework.\nRegina Menachery Paulose’s edited collection gives a thorough account of various People’s Tribunals, which address many situations – from genocide to environmental degradation. The work explores the limits and challenges of People’s Tribunals, while leaving the reader hopeful that the work of People’s Tribunals can fill gaps of injustice left by the conventional legal framework. People’s Tribunals can be part of broader social movements which attempt to bring reconciliation and some sought of healing for past atrocities.\nThe book will be of interest to anyone interested in human rights, international criminal law, environmental justice, transnational justice and international relations.\nJane Richards is a doctoral candidate in Human Rights Law at the University of Hong Kong. Her research interests include disability, equality and criminal law. You can find her on twitter @JaneRichardsHK where she avidly follows the Hong Kong protests.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
