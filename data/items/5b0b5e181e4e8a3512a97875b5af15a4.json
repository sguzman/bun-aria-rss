  "description": "In her new book, Autodidacticism, Artistry, Media Practice (Autodidaktik, Artistik, Medienpraktik [Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, 2016]), Julia Kerscher, postdoc at the University of Tubingen examines the historical development of appearances of dilettantism by analyzing works of Karl Philipp Moritz, Carl Einstein and Thomas Bernhard. She uncovers how the discussion about dilettantism is linked with the question of what is considered to be art and what should be excluded. Moreover, she shows how in the 20th-century dilettantism has turned from a negative into a positive concept and how the arrival of the electronic media in our age can be debated against the backdrop of the dilettantism discourse. Altogether, the book deals with historically changing designs of anthropology, aesthetics and writing styles.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
