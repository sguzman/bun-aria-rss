  "itunes:summary": "Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?\n\nRare performances from CS + Kreme, Maria Moles and efp will reignite our Ritual Community Music series for 2022. Circling bodies, hallucinatory sounds and luxury systems will take place at the Meat Market Pavilion on the 11th of February. \n\nMaria Moles uses drums, percussion, electronics and everyday objects to weave hypnotic, layered webs of sound that pulse freely while slowly transforming with subtle textures and movements. One of the finest and most imaginative musicians in the Melbourne experimental scene, Moles has performed everywhere and with everyone, but it is her solo performances that are, arguably, the most powerful expression of her work. Ahead of her performance for Liquid Architecture Maria talks through the influence of Kulintang music on her album For Leolanda, how she blends live drums with electronics, and what to expect from her live performance. \n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/cs-kreme-maria-moles-efp\n\nRitual Community Music \n11 February 2022\nMeat Market, North Melbourne\nPresented by Liquid Architecture\n\nImage: Nick McKinlay\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
