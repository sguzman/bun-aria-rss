  "description": "<p>Today’s show is loaded with a couple of great guests. First, 10x Pro Bowler, 9x All-Pro and arguably the greatest offensive lineman in the history of the NFL, former Cleveland Brown tackle, Joe Thomas, joins the show. He and Pat chat about the Myles Garrett situation and Joe gives his take as he’s known Myles for a long time, they cover his transition from the league into media, his thoughts on Dwayne Haskins’ offensive lineman blowing him off on the sidelines on video, and Joe admits that he was wrong about whether or not Lamar Jackson was going to be successful in the NFL (2:34-23:41). Next, former Pro Bowler and Super Bowl Champion with the Seattle Seahawks, Cliff Avril joins the show. He chats about being in London with Sky Sports and what he’s trying to do in the next phase of his career, what defensive lineman can do in order to try to stop a guy like Lamar Jackson and why it is proving to be so difficult, and he gives his thoughts on the potential of the new CBA and if he thinks a 17 game season would benefit everyone (25:36-32:26). Later, former National Champion for the Ohio State Buckeyes and current starting Quarterback for the DC Defenders, Cardale “12 Gauge” Jones, joins the show. He and Pat talk about the differences between the NFL and XFL and why some of these changes will help the game be more explosive, he looks ahead to this weekend’s Ohio State/Penn State clash and explains what it’s like playing in the Horseshoe on Saturday’s, and gives some clarity to his now infamous tweet about being in school to play football and not to study (32:28-44:24). Also included is Pat’s take on why moving the Chargers to Mexico City could make sense, but why it will be tough to ever execute, and the guys wonder why NBA ratings are down so much this season and what may be causing it. It’s a good one today. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
