  "title": "Ep. 857 - Now SLU Wants To Expel A Student For Associating With Me",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Saint Louis University is still seething about the event I held there a few weeks ago, and now they’ve decided to take their frustrations out on an innocent student. One kid at the school faces possible explosion for hanging flyers for my event off campus. Also, the media is breathlessly reporting the fact that various Fox News hosts texted Trump Administration officials on January 6th begging Trump to speak out against the riot. But these text messages actually undermine their narrative about January 6th, I’ll explain why. And an MSNBC contributor says that the Texas abortion law will lead to vigilantes “hunting down foreigners.” In our Daily Cancellation, we will deal with the Methodist minister who appeared in drag on an HBO reality show. He’s the victim, he says, because he was forced to step down from his role after the episode aired. \nSign the petition to stop Biden’s vaccine mandate.
