  "description": "<p>Key West, Florida is the southernmost part of the United States. The city features man-made beaches, resorts, shopping, eateries and lots of history. One of the historical bars here is Capt. Tony's Saloon. The building has a long and diverse history that includes brothels, speakeasies, morgues and much more. One of the former bars here was a favorite watering hole of Ernest Hemingway. The current saloon, Capt. Tony's is a favorite gathering place for locals. It also seems to be a gathering place for customers from beyond the veil. Could it be because a former hanging tree once stood here? Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Capt. Tony's Saloon! The Moment in Oddity features a deadly magnetic strip on the Autobahn and This Day in History features the discovery of polar explorer Robert Falcon Scott's body. We also have the fifth installment in the third series of Tim Prasil's Spectral Edition in this one. This location was suggested by listener Maryann Barcomb.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/11/hgb-ep-163-capt-tonys-saloon.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/11/hgb-ep-163-capt-tonys-saloon.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
