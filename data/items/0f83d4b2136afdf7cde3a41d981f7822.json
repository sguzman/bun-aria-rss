  "title": "Ep. 910 - Leftist Media Accuses Me Of 'Harassing' Groomers",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the organizers of a sex camp for children are now allegedly in hiding because of “right wing harassment” from the likes of Ben Shapiro and yours truly. According to the media, just because you hold masturbation workshops for kids doesn’t mean you can’t be a victim. Also, Jussie Smollett is released from jail, proving that few people are more privileged in this culture than someone who is gay, black, rich, and famous. Also, a children’s hospital gives advice on “tucking.” If you don’t know what that is, you’ll find out today. And probably hate me for telling you. And a popular new song worships Ukrainian president Zelensky as a Christ figure who has come to save the world. What’s the problem with this kind of over the top adulation of a political figure during war time (or any time)? We’ll talk about all of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.
