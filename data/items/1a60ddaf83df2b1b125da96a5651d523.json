Nobody gets to opt out of the human condition.</p><br><p>What if leading and living a good life wasn't about learning and practicing our way out of the realities of day-to-day existence, but rather owning the fact that, no matter what may come our way, the essential ingredients for a meaningful existence are here, in front of us, in each moment?
