  "description": "Our audiobook this week is SAVING MASON by Kaci Rose\n\nI had one night with him. One incredible night.\n\nThis wasn’t a situation where I didn’t know him. I knew his name, Mason. He was deployed the next day, and we had mutual friends, so… I knew him. But I didn’t know him at all.\n\nThen the letters started. He agreed. I agreed. It was a done deal–Pen pals and in the old school way.\n\nI wasn’t prepared.\n\nThe texture of the paper. His words. The ink. He touched what I was holding. The magic. It was a window into his soul.\n\nUntil he’s hurt. Until he comes back. Until everything changes. Mason needs to decide if he’ll let me in or push me away because I already knew.\n\nI’d fallen in love with my pen pal, but will he love me back?\n\nGET THE eBOOK NOW:  https://bit.ly/39wy5W6\nKaci Rose: https://amzn.to/38OpgH0\nGiveaway – https://bit.ly/39wy5W6\nFREE - Saving Noah: https://amzn.to/3NRHSFo\nOakside Military Heroes: https://amzn.to/3tzPBzK\nStalking His Obsession: https://amzn.to/3NV415B\nJoin Kaci&#039;s VIP mailing list and get 2 FREE Novellas at http://www.kacirose.com/free-books\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nOther Mentions\nComedy – Pete Davis with Friends – on Netflix\nUnbound by Tarana Burke\nNEW AR – Secrets & the Bride: https://bit.ly/3MT3csG\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nLatest Alexa Riley Releases: https://bit.ly/3qrQpVS\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\nAlexa Riley TikTok: https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdUryXr9/\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
