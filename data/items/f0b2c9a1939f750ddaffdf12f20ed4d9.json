    "media:description": "This is a remake of my video from 2008, rendered in HD, with narration and  minor changes.\n\nThis video demonstrates the effects of Einstein's special relativity on objects that move at high velocities due to the Lorentz transformation.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation was already known a few years before relativity, but mostly in attempts to justify the classical conception of Ether and absolute space.\n\nThe theory of relativity was created based on two principle:\n* The principle of relativity: there's no absolute space, and physics works equally correct for different observers.\n* Light speed is a fundamental property of physics.\nFrom these two the Lorentz transformation follows as the only possible transformation.\n\nThe video shows a 3-dimensional view containing 2 dimensions of space and one dimension of time.",
