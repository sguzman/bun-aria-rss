Culley was most recently the passing game coordinator for the Baltimore Ravens, who just so happen to have the worst passing game in the NFL. If you think this is going to help keep Deshaun Watson in Houston, you’ve got another thing coming. Speaking of quarterbacks, Matthew Stafford appears to be the 2nd best signal-caller that could be available this offseason.
