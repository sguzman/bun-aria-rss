  "description": "<p>In this episode on attitude, John encourages us to overcome five common challenges of maintaining a positive attitude. These challenges are discouragement, problems, change, fear, and failure. John addresses each potential threat to a positive attitude and offers sage advice on how to overcome it.</p> <p>Mark Cole, Richard Chancy, and Jason Brooks talk through their personal challenges with maintaining a winning attitude, and they offer various ways to reframe our perspective in a positive way. They talk about the fact that the “Success Cycle” John is fond of teaching includes failure, and they discuss the role failure can have in success. They encourage us to lean into the tension we feel around failure and see it as a part of the growth process rather than allow it to dampen our attitude.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Attitude Worksheet. You can access the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Attitude and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”       </p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/The-Difference-Maker-Hardcover_p_2782.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Difference Maker</em> by John C.
