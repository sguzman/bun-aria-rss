  "description": "<p>It’s the summer of 1999 in New York City, and everyone's looking towards the future, towards millennium parties and potential Y2K catastrophes. But if they turned their eyes to the streets around and skies above, they might have seen something else on the horizon, something much more real and alarming than a Y2K glitch: the arrival of West Nile virus. In this episode, we take a close look at the virus whose recent emergence in the Western Hemisphere serves as a crucial reminder of how pathogens know no political boundaries and how working across disciplines is the only way to effectively control and prevent disease outbreaks. We are also so excited to be joined by Dr. Sarah Wheeler, Biologist at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fightthebite.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control District</a>, who talks us through the ecology of this mosquito-borne disease and shares the birds-eye view of the situation in North America. Last but certainly not least, we round out this episode with a delightful and informative song about West Nile virus:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL6V4eB-mbI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">West Nile Story by MC Bugg-Z</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/health/fairfax-county-health-department\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fairfax County Health Department</a>.
