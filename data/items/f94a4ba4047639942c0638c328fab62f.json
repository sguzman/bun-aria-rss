  "itunes:summary": "The Presidency of Donald Trump may very well be remembered for his administrationâ€™s contentious relationship with â€˜the truthâ€™. Indeed, when many speak of the current political age as the Post-Truth era of democracy, the catalyst is often seen as resting within the controversial Republicanâ€™s approach to politics.\n\nFrom the rise of â€˜alternative factsâ€™ as a means to undermine scientific consensus, to the Presidentâ€™s constant laments over media scrutiny and the framing of his critics as â€˜fake newsâ€™, the legacy of the 45th President of the United States will likely remain always chained to the ways in which truth and fact came under fire in his tenure.\n\nAnd perhaps no greater example of this exists than the end of that tenure. Mr. Trumpâ€™s recent electoral loss to the now President-elect Joe Biden has sparked a stream of conspiracy and accusation from the Republican leader, with allegations of fraud and electoral tampering being posted by the President almost hourly on Twitter in the weeks since election night.\n\nWhile Mr. Bidenâ€™s victory has been confirmed at the state level, by the Supreme Court and by the Electoral College, it hasnâ€™t stopped President Trump from attempting to undermine that victory â€“ even if no credible data exists to support his claims.\n\nWhat place does truth have in an era of post-truth politics? How does democracy survive in an age when truth is so easily reduced and reconstituted by leaders and citizens alike? And can we ever return to a politics of truth as the core of democratic practice?\n\nOn this weekâ€™s episode of the Carleton University Political Science Podcast, we interrogate these questions and more, and turn to the canon of political theory and philosophy for answers.
