  "description": "The first day of competition is complete for the 2018 PyeongChang games and what a day we have had! If you're Australian it's been filled with endless coverage and replays of the moguls, if you're Canadian you're actually getting to see the games! There has also been some excitement for New Zealand with it soon set to be a national holiday in recognition of the great Carlos Garcia Knight. There has also been some late nights for Jarrod & Ben with the epic ski jumping being exciting when it really shouldn't be. We also get excited over pink guns with ponies on it, that great TV show 'Games of Throne' as well as trying to work out why the Koreans aren't going to the events, decoding why Channel 7 really sucks at covering the Olympics and working out if the Moguls are more important than 'My Kitchen Rules'. It's all in another days work for us here on Off The Podium!",
