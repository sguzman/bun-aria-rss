  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the world's wealthiest man, Elon Musk, made a $43 Billion offer to buy Twitter to preserve free speech on the platform. But Wall Street investment group Vanguard Group has purchased more shares to become the largest shareholder at Twitter and block Musk. It's also been reported that the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have launched a joint investigation into Musk's companies. Countries should celebrate inventive citizens like Musk, not investigate them. Then, Charlie Gasparino from the Fox Business Channel calls in to explain how the Vanguard purchase will block Musk but wasn't necessarily done to interfere with Musk, per see. Gasparino added that some past federal regulators are sympathizers of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's kneecapping of capitalism. Later, Russia continues to commit atrocities in various battles in their attempt to take Ukraine. New reports show signs of sexual assault by Russian soldiers. Afterward, the Black Lives Matter organization was a fundraising scam. New York City Mayor Eric Adams questioned where the Black Lives Matters protesters were as he asked the community why young Black men victims are getting shot in Black neighborhoods. Finally, US Senate Candidate, TW Shannon, joins the show to discuss his campaign in Oklahoma. Shannon, a Black, conservative Christian says that America is not racist because if it was, we wouldn't have Black and Hispanic people from all over coming through our borders. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
