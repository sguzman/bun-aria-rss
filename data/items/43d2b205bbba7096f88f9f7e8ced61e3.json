  "description": "<p>Examine your zipper and hop right in! It's as casual as it gets this week with just the 4 of us and some good old fashion conversation. What's in the box? We're not sure. But Heath's hoping it's the thousands of dollars he got stolen from him. It's a fun facts and games type of week! While we're brushing up on trivia, Zane is brushing up with tire residue. YIKES. Enjoy!</p>\n",
