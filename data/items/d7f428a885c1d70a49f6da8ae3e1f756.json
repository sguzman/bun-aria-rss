Anna, Melissa and Sim a wide variety of topics including Melissa’s first kiss, disdain for the term “preggers” and the brilliance that is THE NEVERENDING STORY. We also introduce a new segment called “Thank You For Bringing Something Weird…What Is It?” You will not believe the value of one of the items! Needless to say, Melissa left the house a VERY surprised and VERY happy woman. Plus a female caller’s roommate is dating her ex-boyfriend’s identical twin brother – and she can’t move on because she sees her ex’s clone every day at the apartment! This call leads to Anna and Sim's first on-air argument about...of all things, “twin fantasies.”<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
