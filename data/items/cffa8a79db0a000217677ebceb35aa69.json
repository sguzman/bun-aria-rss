  "description": "Jason La Canfora joins Will Brinson to break down whether or not Aaron Rodgers is frustrated with how things are playing out in Green Bay and if it will affect contract talks between the Packers and the QB. They also dive into how the Seahawks have drafted poorly in recent years and how it could set up a market for Russell Wilson to leave if he needs too much money ($33 million??) or the Seahawks want to reboot everything. Could Dez Bryant go to the Giants? MAYBE. And then the guys break down JLC's preview of the draft's top 10, including a wild possibility of a three-team trade as well as the Patriots trading up for Josh Rosen.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
