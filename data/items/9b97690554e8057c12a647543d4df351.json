  "description": "<p>Real Housewives of Potomac was chock full of drama this week. First, Michael 'fesses up to \"taking the bait\" and going back a hotel with a random girl. But don't worry guys — he passed out immediately and when he came to, he was half naked and lying next to a woman. NOTHING HAPPENED. Then it's off to a barn for some wine tasting where all hell breaks loose between Monique and Candiace. It's the fight we've been preparing for all season, and now it's finally here! Sort of? We'll have to wait for next week for all the juicy details.Team Monique or Team Candiace?</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p>\n",
