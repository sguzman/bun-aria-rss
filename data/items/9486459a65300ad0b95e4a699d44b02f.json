    "media:description": "This very large word search puzzle poster is for the nerdiest Shakespeare nerds.\n\nThe word search has a grid of 85,808 letters containing the 26,786 words in William Shakespeare's vocabulary. Our source was The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, originally published in 1623, available from Project Gutenberg (http://gutenberg.org).\n\nShakespeare wrote using a vocabulary of, depending on who did the counting, 15,000 to 31,500 words. We found, after removing punctuation and deleting duplicates, 26,786 unique words.\n\nWe wrote a computer program that arranged the words in a word search grid of 248 by 346 characters. The words are arranged horizontally, vertically, and diagonally going forward and backward. The puzzle is 95.6% dense, meaning that about 96% of the letters are part of a word, and only about 4% of the letters are random fillers.\n\nFor more info, visit https://ptolemypress.com/shakespeare/",
