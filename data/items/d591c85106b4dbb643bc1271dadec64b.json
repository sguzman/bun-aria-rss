  "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to a very special double episode of Drunken Philosophy! This week Connor and Dan are taking a little break from their intense philosophical studies to discuss a terrible movie they both watched— the 1994 video game masterpiece Double Dragon. And boy is there a lot to talk about here. It's not what you would call a smart movie but it sure is intellectually challenging, specifically because it makes absolutely no sense most of the time. If you want to watch it before listening, it's available on YouTube. But you don't have to! The podcast is still fun. Connor and Dan will be back next week with more regular philosophy and regular drinks. Enjoy!</strong></p>",
