  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, the Democrat Party has embraced evil more than it has embraced Americanism. They've chosen hateful emotion over facts and logic. The latest being the controversy over the statue of President Lincoln in Boston which some Black Lives Matter activists want removed. This particular statue is the first statue of Lincoln ever erected and it was paid for by freed black slaves. Then, a new Gallup poll shows that the public is less trusting of the media than before regarding the coronavirus and the confidence is split among party lines. Sadly, the Democrat Party is at war with American institutions, the founding, the military, the police and a vote for a Democrat or a vote for Joe Biden is a vote against America. Later, Donald Trump, Jr. calls in to discuss how the left distorts the truth in word and in deed.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
