  "description": "After 300 rejection letters from local newspapers around the country, Warren Leight decided it was time to ditch his journalistic pursuits, and we're lucky he did. Warren has always had his thumb on America's political pulse merging the most topical issues into his work.  While he never found an audience for his feel good hostage musical comedy, he found critical acclaim writing/producing Law & Order SVU.  His new \"ripped from the headlines\" show Law & Order: Hate Crimes is poised to take deeper look into the issue. And most importantly we talked about Ice-T, Emily's rap name, twitter trolls and why people need to stop blaming him for Chris Meloni leaving SVU.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
