  "description": "Yochi, Jenn, and Zack look at President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a move that breaks with decades of US foreign policy -- and that tells us a lot about how Trump makes decisions and how often his actions don't match his tough-guy rhetoric. When it came to the Jerusalem decision, Trump used the least-inflammatory language possible, paid lip service to restarting peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, and made clear that the US embassy wouldn't be moving to the disputed city anytime soon. On Elsewhere, they look at the International Olympics Committee's decision to ban Russia from next year's Winter Games because of a massive doping scandal that involved Russian spies, high-ranking members of the Russian government, and dozens of Russian athletes. Jenn confesses to collecting USSR propaganda posters, Zack reaches deep into his thesaurus, and Yochi explains why vermouth is the drink of choice for female athletes looking to dope themselves to Olympic glory. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
