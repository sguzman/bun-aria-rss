  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marc works with Lori, 57, who has been dieting for nearly 40 years. Sheâ€™s exhausted from thinking about food and weight constantly, but still feels attached to losing weight. She believes sheâ€™d feel more accomplished once she loses the weight, and that how she feels on the inside would finally match the outside.Â </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lori has lost weight in the past, and initially feels more confident. But somehow that starts to go away, and she gradually falls back into eating her favorite high-fat foods. And that inevitably brings the weight back. At these times, Lori asks herself what triggers her old behaviors so that she can avoid slipping back into the diet cycle yet again, but comes up short on answers.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Marc explains, people carry weight for many different reasons, including medical, metabolic, nutritional, food-related, and emotional. But regardless of the root cause, those of us who have focused on weight loss our entire lives have often never experienced their essential self, free from any weight loss goal. As they explore, taking the time to discover what fulfills us and who we are beyond our bodyâ€™s shape and size is essential to finding the happiness weâ€™re looking for. And itâ€™s also important in our efforts to lose weight, as a negative mindset creates a physiological stress response that can cause us to become weight loss resistant.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">---------------</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about us at The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:</span> <a href= \"https://psychologyofeating.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://psychologyofeating.com/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Â </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ðŸ‘‰ Weâ€™re now enrolling for The Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training!
