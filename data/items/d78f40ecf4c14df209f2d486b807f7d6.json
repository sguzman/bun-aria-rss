  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including Major League Baseball and the Chicago Cubs moving to distance themselves from racist emails sent and received by billionaire Joe Ricketts, whose family owns the team and Wrigley Field. Many of the emails had to do with a fear of Muslims, including conspiracy theories about former President Barack Obama. Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade, has apologized for the emails. One of his sons, Tom, chairman of the Cubs, released a statement that condemned the emails and distanced his father from the franchise. Also discussed are Super Bowl viewership and commercials, and the possibility that the Raiders may play at Oracle Park next season. The 49ers may not waive their territorial rights to San Francisco, meaning the Raiders search for a temporary home would continue. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick and Michael Barr Producer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
