  "description": "Bruegel’s Alicia García-Herrero and Robin Niblett of Chatham House discuss a new joint report on EU-China relations. How easy was it to find common ground with Chinese partners? And what should be the priorities for economic cooperation between Europe and China?\n\nIn this episode of The Sound of Economics, we host a conversation between Alicia García-Herrero and Robin Niblett. Our guests talk about a new joint report, EU–China Economic Relations to 2025, produced by four leading institutes in Europe and China.\n\nThey discuss the process of finding common ground between the authors, and draw out some of the most interesting findings. It turns out that the most obvious sphere for EU-China economic cooperation, trade and investment, might be the most difficult. So what could be the next step for Europe and China?\n\nSPEAKERS\nAlicia García-Herrero, Senior Scholar, Bruegel\nRobin Niblett, Director, Chatham House\nCREDITS\nPresented and produced by Bryn Watkins\n\n\n#EU #China #Cooperation #economics",
