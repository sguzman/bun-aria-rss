  "description": "In today's podcast, we talk about the breaking news concerning Russia's hack of the DNC, with insights from STEALTHbits Technologies' Adam Laub. We discuss the state of the investigation into what, if any, role online inspiration played in the Orlando gunman's massacre. North Korea appears to have engaged in a long-running campaign of cyber espionage against the South. The Molerats' failure to clear document information may have unmasked them. The Vawtrak banking Trojan gets more evasive. Shadow apps place enterprises at risk, and application collusion disturbs mobile users. The Angler exploit kit has practically vanished, replaced for the most part by Neutrino. Symantec's acquisition of Blue Coat fuels M&A speculation. And the price of that Windows LPE zero day keeps dropping. Ben Yelin reviews a judge's ruling that restricts the FBI's use of hacking.",
