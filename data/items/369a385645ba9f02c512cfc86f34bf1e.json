  "description": "<p>John Maxwell’s Law of Modeling says that it’s hard to improve when you have no one but yourself to follow. In this series, which we’re calling People Do What People See, John Maxwell shares five qualities that make a good role model. In part one, John shares the first three qualities and explains why teaching is much easier than modeling. Modeling requires practicing what you preach. It gives you integrity as a leader and establishes you as a credible role model and authority.</p> <p>In the discussion portion of this episode, we’re excited to introduce Traci Morrow to you! Traci is a shining example of what it means to be a product of John Maxwell’s teaching and leadership. She’s a great addition to this discussion, as she shares what she’s gleaned from her experience a leader, entrepreneur, and coach.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the People Do What People See Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/RoleModel and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/15-Invaluable-Laws-of-Growth--Hardcover_p_2871.html\"> <em>The 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth</em> by John C.
