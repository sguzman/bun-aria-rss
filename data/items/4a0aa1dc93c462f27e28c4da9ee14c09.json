  "description": "<p>When beamforming is applied at the transmitter, only part of reconfigurable\nintelligent surfaces (RISs) will be active, and it becomes indispensable to\nstudy the impact of RIS geometry. This letter aims at evaluating RIS geometry,\nranging from linear (1D), and planar (2D), to cylindrical (3D) structures. We\nfirst derive the effective illuminated surface of different RIS topologies and\ndetermine the resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and outage probability.\nThen, we investigate the optimal RIS location to trade off active area versus\nreceived power considering near-field propagation. Numerical results quantify\nthe benefit of RIS geometric compactness and provide their applicable ranges.\n</p>",
