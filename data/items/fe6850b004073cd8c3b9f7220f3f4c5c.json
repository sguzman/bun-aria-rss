  "description": "I'm joined by Michael Youhana to discuss his recent piece for the Fellow Travelers Blog, \"Ending the War on Weapon States.\" We talk about what constitutes a Weapon State, how the War on Weapon States has impacted post-Cold War US foreign policy, and how to think about WMD and \"rogue states\" without falling into the usual Blob b******t. Apologies for a couple of spots where the audio is rough, one of us was fighting a lousy internet connection and the Skype quality suffered for it.<p>You can find Michael's Fellow Traveler's piece <a href=\"https://fellowtravelersblog.com/2018/08/09/ending-the-war-on-weapon-states/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>Follow Michael on Twitter: @Michael_Youhana</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
