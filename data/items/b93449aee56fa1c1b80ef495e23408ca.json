  "title": "Best and Worst Early Draft Values (05/23 Fantasy Football Podcast)",
  "description": "Sure, we have a few months before most of our drafts begin, but we still need to monitor the early trends. After some trivia to kick off the show, Dave tells you his favorite draft value (5:45) and Jamey tells you his least favorite early draft value (12:30) based on current ADP ... News and notes (14:45) on the Panthers and Seahawks quarterback situations, the Dolphins running backs, potential problems with the Patriots offense and more. Then we're back to the good draft values (26:00) including Mike Evans. Should he be a Round 2 pick? ... We like Courtland Sutton, Dalton Schultz and a couple of others if you can get them after pick 65 (35:00). A couple of rookie WRs could be steals in Round 10 (37:15) and Dameon Pierce in Round 11 (40:00) could pay off. And we finish with bad values (46:00) like Javonte Williams, Jaylen Waddle, DeAndre Hopkins and Dawson Knox. When is the right time to draft the players? ... Your Apple Podcast questions.
