  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, NBC News had an explosive story saying that federal investigators wiretapped Michael Cohen phones and the country went nuts but every word was wrong. 4 hours later they had to make a correction and explain that he wasn’t wiretapped. They were keeping a log of phone calls known as a pen register, so they weren’t listening in. The journalist profession has become a joke – NBC News rushed to report anti-Trump stories leaked by anonymous sources and got the facts wrong. Also, Sarah Huckabee Sanders is one of the best White House press secretaries a president has had. She is very professional and doing a spectacular job. She shouldn’t let these dogs get her down. As a parent would you be a prouder if your daughter was Huckabee Sanders or Stormy Daniels? These democrats are hanging their hat on a porn star. Finally Rep Ron DeSantis call in to discuss his run for Governor of Florida. There’s been ad after ad for his opponent Adam Putnam saying that he’s the conservative in the race. Where is Putnam getting all this money for these ads? From special interests, mainly from agriculture and U.S sugar.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
