  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, a jihadi anti-Semetic terrorist got into our country through a travel visa despite being under surveillance and took hostages at a Texas synagogue. The radical Islamist demanded the release of \"Lady Al Quaeda\" Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani prisoner being held in a nearby federal prison. Interestingly, the FBI's initial response claimed that the attack was not an anti-semitic in nature, although they amended that narrative soon after. The reckless immigration policies of the Biden Administration put Americans in danger. Then, CAIR (Council on American Islamic Relations) attacks the talk radio industry but defended and advocated for the release of Aafia Siddiqui. CAIR has enormous influence with members of Congress, the FBI, and the DOJ. Later, Direct TV, a subsidiary of AT&T like CNN, is removing One America News from their service. We should be encouraged to choose how to spend our money and speak out against this type of censorship, not support it. Afterward, Democrats aim to destroy the voting system and they're doing it in the name of Martin Luther King Jr. Democrats are destroying the supply chain and creating shortages. Now they're destroying the criminal justice system with their American Marxist views. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
