  "description": "We bet you think that there was plenty of crazy to go around this summer and that you were as unsettled by each day's news as you could be. Nonsense. We live in Trump times where yesterday's inconceivable outrage is wrapping today's fish and we're on to something we didn't even have a word for yesterday. That's not just true in the US either. Britain is reeling from its worst democratic crisis in centuries. The Taliban were coming to visit Camp David until they were not. The CIA pulled an asset from Russia because they didn't trust...the US President. Congress is ramping up impeachment investigations. And for some reason Ivanka dressed like a lily pad when repping the US with the President of Colombia. And Labor Day is just past. We help you prepare with this great back-to-school edition of your favorite pod featuring Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, IISS's Kori Schake and the Financial Times Ed Luce. Join us!\nThis episode is brought to you by the Election Ride Home Podcast.  The Election Ride Home is a podcast dedicated to figuring out who that someone... or maybe even multiple someones... will end up being. Every day at 5pm eastern, veteran journalist and This American Life contributor Chris Higgins catches you up on what happened on the campaign trail. Who's up, who's down, what issues are getting traction, what do the polls say. It's a 15-20 minute show that keeps track of all the latest and summarizes it so you don't have to be nervously refreshing your web browser 12 times a day. It's like TLDR as a service. So, if you want to catch up on what you missed on your way home, search your podcast app and subscribe to the Election Ride Home podcast.
