To do this, I pulled average player draft positions across thousands of fantasy leagues collected in <a href=\"http://www03.myfantasyleague.com/2016/adp?COUNT=500&POS=*&ROOKIES=0&INJURED=0&CUTOFF=5&FRANCHISES=12&IS_PPR=1&IS_KEEPER=0&IS_MOCK=0&TIME=\">myfantasyleague.com</a>, and used these as input parameters to simulate leagues of 11 human drafters to compete with 1 VBD drafter. I measured performance by evaluating the actual fantasy points collected by the best set of starters on each team and then finding the rank of the VBD drafter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<p>In general, VBD gives a slight edge, but it could be an occasional slam-dunk when players drafted early by humans turn out to be lemons.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>I simulated drafts from three seasons (2014-2016), with the VBD drafter placed in any of the 12 positions. Across all leagues, VBD rosters had a mean rank of 4.68 when evaluating fantasy points observed at the end of the season. This is significantly higher than a rank of 6 that we would expect if VBD drafters were indistinguishable from typical human drafters (Chi. Sq. p.val=2.2e-16). Unfortunately, that is also substantially worse than how well we would have expected to VBD rosters to rank based on preseason projections, for which the mean rank is 2.05.  So VBD does tip the scales slightly, but it isn’t exactly a silver bullet.</p>\n<p>Interestingly there was a fair amount of variability between how VBD performed in the three years. Both expected ranks and observed ranks were noticeably higher in 2015 than 2014 and 2016.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1930\"

forecasts though, the Pearson correlation and the mean absolute error (MAE) were not dramatically different in 2015 than in other years.  So maybe forecast quality should be evaluated differently, or there might be a better explanation.</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"><b>Position</b></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><b>Season</b></td>\n<td

turns in the middle of the rotation.  What stood out in 2015 is the first two draft positions resulted in some of the worst outcomes and late picks didn&#8217;t hurt performance like they did in other years.  But, that doesn&#8217;t exactly point to what differentiated that year, since early picks also performed poorly in 2014.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1931\"

round that ended up bombing.  To get a sense if this is the case, we can look at the correlation between expected &#8211; observed points and draft position for each year.  A correlation of 0 would indicate that across draft positions there wasn&#8217;t a trend with underperformance.  A negative correlation might indicate that players drafted early underperformed to a greater extent than players drafted later.</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:'Helvetica

Neue';font-size:small;\">-0.258</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Turns out that this was indeed the case.  Players drafted early in real fantasy football leagues underperformed more in 2015 than other years.  The biggest offender that year was Le&#8217;Veon Bell, who <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000569888/article/leveon-bell-suffers-knee-injury-in-steelers-loss\">injured his knee in November</a>.  But in all, 8 of the first 24 players drafted (first 2 rounds) underperformed by more than 100 points, compared to 2 and 4 players in the other two years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#800080;\">Ok, so I wouldn&#8217;t exactly say the case is closed here, but at this point, I&#8217;d like to submit this as a first argument in favor of model-based drafting being superior.</span></strong></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>And here are the deets, in case anyone wants to know more</h3>\n<p><strong>League overview.</strong>  I simulated a standard snake draft in a league with 12 teams.  One team drafts players with a VBD-like policy, the remaining 11 have a simulated baseline policy.  In all, I simulated 100 drafts for each year and each possible VBD draft position.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation.</strong> After the drafts, I identified the best set of starters on each team using actually observed fantasy points for each player and then compared how the VBD rosters rank in each league.  In other words, assuming the teams are fixed after the draft, and the one best roster is selected by some oracle, how well does a VBD roster perform relative to baseline rosters?  Another artifact is that I&#8217;m not considering defense, special teams, and kickers because people <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/ffl/story?page=nfldk2k9dstpreview\">don&#8217;t generally draft them meaningfully early</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/articles/defcc.htm\">their performance doesn&#8217;t correlate well year to year</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Simulated human drafter.</strong>  On each baseline draft turn, for every undrafted player, I sample from a Poisson distribution with lambda set to that player&#8217;s mean draft position, and then take the lowest sampled value, resolving ties by choosing the player with the lower mean draft position.  This is done without picking backup players until all starters are selected.</p>\n<table width=\"529\" cellspacing=\"0\"
