  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Ben Ferguson fills in for Mark. Anthony Fauci's family net worth has increased by more than 70% according to a new report from the Open The Books Foundation. Fauci is still the highest-paid federal employee at $480,00 annually. Fauci's net worth was estimated at $5.8 million in 2016 and is now estimated to be above $13 million after the pandemic. Then, Sen. Ted Cruz joins the show to discuss how to take back America. Cruz said Nancy Pelosi is delusional if she thinks Democrats will maintain their current majority after the November midterm elections. Cruz added that South Texas will be turning red thanks to several Latina candidates winning Congressional seats held by Democrats for more than 100 years. Afterward, James Simpson calls in to discuss his new book, \"Who Was Karl Marx?: The Men, the Motives and the Menace Behind Today's Rampaging American Left.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
