  "description": "<p>Experiencing positive transformation after trauma is known as post-traumatic growth. People who experience post-traumatic growth may develop a new appreciation of life, newfound personal strength, see an improvement in their relationships, see new possibilities in life and undergo spiritual changes. Why do some people experience such profound positive changes after enduring something terrible and others don’t? Our guest for this episode is Richard Tedeschi, PhD, who developed the academic theory of post-traumatic growth with Lawrence Calhoun, PhD. Dr. Tedeschi is the distinguished chair at the Boulder Crest Institute for Posttraumatic Growth, a nonprofit organization focused on military members, veterans and their families.</p> <p><a href=\"https://convention.apa.org\">Join us online August 6-8 for APA 2020 Virtual</a>.</p>",
