  "description": "<p>GO FROM THINKING TO DOING TO BEING. Your emotions create your reality. You can either be held back by the feelings of your past, or you can create the feelings of your future. Every thought you have affects every atom. So how can we free ourselves from those familiar emotions that are keeping us from our ideal reality? It takes work. You’ll probably feel uncomfortable.

In his easy-to-understand, encouraging, and compassionate style, he has educated thousands of people, detailing how they can rewire their brains and recondition their bodies to make lasting changes.
