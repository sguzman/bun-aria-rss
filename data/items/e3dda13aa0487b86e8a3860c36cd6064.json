  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery is joined by Justin to discuss the Meuse-Argonne Offensive of World War 1, which was the bloodiest engagement in American military history. Over the course of six weeks, the American Expeditionary Force lost over 26,277 soldiers killed in action, and over 95,786 wounded. The casualties for the French, Siamese & German forces engaged in the battle were equally as high. Justin gives his perspectives on the battle and recollects his personal experiences of visiting the World War I battlefields during the Centennial Events last year in 2018, all of which Avery reacts to with a mixture of amazement and jealousy. The guys missed Tony & Codie this week, but will catch them next time! Still an amazing episode so enjoy!</p>",
