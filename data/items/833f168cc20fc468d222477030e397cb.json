  "description": "Today I interview Richard Schwartz. His friends know him as Dick. And while this is my first time speaking with him, I can’t help but feel friendly toward him. Dick is the creator of Internal Family Systems or IFS, an extraordinary and paradigm-shifting therapeutic model that changes not only the way we envision healing, but also the person being healed. Full disclosure: I am currently working with a therapist who uses IFS in their approach, and it’s been healing and revelatory, which is why I’m very excited to share this conversation with you, where we explore personal and cultural healing, the innate goodness of our humanity, and our connection with one another and the world around us. Dick is the author of several books. He’s taught around the world. He’s the founder of the IFS Institute, which offers resources and training for professionals and the general public. And he’s just written the new book No Bad Parts: Healing Trauma and Restoring Wholeness with the Internal Family Systems Model (Sounds True, 2021). Enjoy my conversation with Dick Schwartz.\n﻿Eric LeMay is on the creative writing faculty at Ohio University. He is the author of five books, most recently Remember Me.
