  "description": "Today’s episode features one of the largest spirits companies you might not know much about. You’ve heard of brands like Ezra Brooks, Rebel Yell, and Blood Oath, but there is a lot to discover about Luxco. We sit down with Philip Lux, Global Brand Ambassador at Lux Row Distillers and son of CEO Don Lux, as he guides us through the family history of the Lux’s along with their acquisitions of bourbon brands. Then we also get the inside scoop on what’s happening at Lux Row Distillers. After sourcing whiskey for many years, it became apparent they needed to build a distillery and they did it right in Bardstown, KY. We discuss the future of the brands and how they plan to grow and evolve. Don’t sleep on this location during your bourbon trail visit because the facility is incredible.\nShow Notes:\n\nBlack Market Liquor Sales:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/fredminnick/2020/03/19/wholesalers-warn-of-black-market-liquor-if-liquor-stores-close-amidst-coronavirus/#3b5445042e88\n\n\nSupporting Spirits United: https://p2a.co/JRoHtT8\n\n\nBourbon Pursuit USBG Fundraiser: bourbonpursuit.com/usbg\n\n\nBourbon Crypto:  https://www.coindesk.com/wave-financial-to-tokenize-20m-worth-of-bourbon-for-new-whiskey-fund\n\n\nPat Heist on TedX: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSLWEnz-1mc\n\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about supporting craft distilleries.\n\nWhat was your introduction to bourbon?\n\nHow did you get into the business?\n\nWhat stands out about bourbon when you are traveling?\n\nTalk about the difference between Luxco and Lux Row.\n\nDid your dad ever tell you about how he had the foresight to acquire all these brands?\n\nTell us the story of David Nicholson.\n\nTalk about Blood Oath.\n\nWas Rebel Yell acquired the same time as David Nicholson?\n\nTell us about your bourbon portfolio.\n\nWhen did you break ground on the facility?\n\nWhy did you decide to build in Bardstown and not St. Louis?\n\nWhat is the difference between regular David Nicholson and the reserve?\n\nTell us about your still and capacity.\n\nAny worries about your bourbon being ready in 4 years?\n\nAre you trying to replicate the existing flavor profiles?\n\nWhat is your storage capacity?\n\nWhat is something that people might not know about your brands?\n\nWhen is the Lux Bourbon coming?\n\nAny plans to use this facility to support Luxco?\n\nWhat issues have you had starting a distillery?",
