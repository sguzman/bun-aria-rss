  "description": "Journalists intentionally leave themselves out of the stories they cover. In Clyde H. Farnsworth‘s book Tangled Bylines: A Father and Son Cover the Twentieth Century (University of Missouri Press, 2017) he gets the chance to tell not only his own stories, but also those of his journalist father. Farnsworth spent most of his career as a foreign correspondent and both he and his father worked at the same time at the New York Times.\n\nIn the book he shares what it was like to cover historical events and grow up in the shadow of his father’s career. The book features stories about unique encounters with notable people, such as Amelia Earhart and Winston Churchill as well as personal vignettes of a real-life family in the twentieth century. Tangled Bylines provides unique perspectives on the transformations and consistencies in journalism from the 1920s through to the digital age. It provides a foundation for understanding a specific, sometimes singular facet of the history of American journalism.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
