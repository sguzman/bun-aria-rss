  "description": "Today I will be reviewing 'The Art of War' by Sun Tzu. War is not as common in comparison to our recent history, but that does not mean we can't use the strategies of war in today's world. The Art of War uses adages formed in poetic nature to explain the essential points of tactics in war. The book explains the role of general, the anticipation of enemy tactics and the provision of one's army to lead to victory, as well as many other points. What I found interesting was the emphasis on the role of the leader as the focal point in the army no matter the size. This emphasis can have application in all areas of life and can serve as tactics to lead if you read in between the lines. It is a short book, so it is accessible to all and will teach you both strategic and leadership qualities to look out for no matter what you do. The universality of this book makes it a must-read.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
