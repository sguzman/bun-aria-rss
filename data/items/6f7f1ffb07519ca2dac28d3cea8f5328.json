  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about all the BS floating around in the NFL right now and react to the breaking news that the 49ers acquired the 3rd overall pick from the Dolphins, and then the Dolphins used that pick to trade back into the top 10 with the Eagles. Joining the program is friend of the show, former NFL Head Coach, analyst with the NFL Network, Steve Mariucci to chat about Zach Wilson's pro day and if it has been blown out of proportion by the media, and Mooch reacts live to all the different draft picks being moved around (34:52-1:05:46). Next, former NFL GM and friend of the program, Michael Lombardi joins the show to tell us what exactly all this swapping of draft picks means, and why mostly everything is fake (1:08:04-1:19:31). Later, 2x Super Bowl Champion, member of the Patriots 2010's All-Decade Team, now back in New England playing LB, Kyle Van Noy joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about what happened in Miami, why he was just as shocked as anyone, why he's excited to be back home in New England, if he still has the Bentley, and what he thinks the locker room is going to be like without Tom Brady (1:21:17-1:50:18).
