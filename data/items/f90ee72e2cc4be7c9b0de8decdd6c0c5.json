  "description": "<p>Adding fiducial markers to a scene is a well-known strategy for making visual\nlocalization algorithms more robust. Traditionally, these marker locations are\nselected by humans who are familiar with visual localization techniques. This\npaper explores the problem of automatic marker placement within a scene.\nSpecifically, given a predetermined set of markers and a scene model, we\ncompute optimized marker positions within the scene that can improve accuracy\nin visual localization. Our main contribution is a novel framework for modeling\ncamera localizability that incorporates both natural scene features and\nartificial fiducial markers added to the scene. We present optimized marker\nplacement (OMP), a greedy algorithm that is based on the camera localizability\nframework. We have also designed a simulation framework for testing marker\nplacement algorithms on 3D models and images generated from synthetic scenes.\nWe have evaluated OMP within this testbed and demonstrate an improvement in the\nlocalization rate by up to 20 percent on three different scenes.\n</p>",
