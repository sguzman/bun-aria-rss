  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, President Trump always has a way of coming out on top, so we don’t understimate him, but there needed to be some kind of retaliation against Iran. The facts right now are that Iran struck us and we didn’t strike back. What we are doing with Iran is a little bit troubling and confusing. We need to deter Iran from doing this again and if that means some of the Iranian military are killed, so be it. Also, Curtis Flowers executed four people 23 years ago and the Supreme Court just overturned his guilty verdict because of racial politics. Justice Clarence Thomas was irate over the 7-2 reversal. Later, text messages that were sealed between Sean Hannity and Paul Manafort were relased by a court today. In these texts Hannity says exactly what he has said on TV and radio, there was nothing horid. These texts had nohting to do with the Mueller investigation, so why did they collect them? Is Hannity not covered by the 1st amendment? Finally, top Robert Mueller prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, has a new book deal. The DOJ should look into the ethics of this.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
