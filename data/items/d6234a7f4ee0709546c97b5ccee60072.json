They're confronting the brutal power struggle already breaking out among three men: Brutus, the deadly friend; Marc Antony, Caesar's gifted military commander; and Octavian, Caesar's teenaged heir. First, Brutus and Octavian will square off with a clash of festivals designed to sway popular opinion to their side... while the wily Antony bides his time. Today, the final day of the Ludi Apollinares, the games that Brutus arranges to sway the people of Rome. Will mounting the wildest spectacle be the key to grabbing the reins of the entire empire? And how does a bolt of lightning reshape Rome's destiny?</p><br><p>Special thanks to Dr. Geoffrey Sumi of Mount Holyoke College, author of <em>Ceremony and Power: Performing Politics in Rome Between Republic and Empire</em>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
