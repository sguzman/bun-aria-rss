  "title": "43: Honest Abe, the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, & John Brown’s Raid on Harpers Ferry",
  "description": "“Any man who took Lincoln for a simple-minded man would wind up with his back in a ditch.”\nThis is the story of America on the eve of the Civil War. Kentucky-born farmboy Abraham Lincoln has an interesting early life. Between losing his mom as a child, suffering from chronic depression, and receiving little formal education, you might not think he’d become one of the youngest state legislators in Illinois, a successful lawyer, and a US Congressman. But that’s Lincoln. He’s a man who beats the odds, and he’s hoping to continue that streak as he challenges Stephen Douglas for his US Senate seat. Can he take down the “Little Giant?”\nIt’s a political throw down that produces one of the most famous debates in US history as the two go head-to-head in over 20 hours of back-and-forth over the future of slavery. Speaking of slavery--John Brown’s looking to start a slave rebellion across the state of Virginia and not afraid to take over a US armory to do it! It’s a full-on battle and the body count’s adding up fast … especially if we include the executions.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
