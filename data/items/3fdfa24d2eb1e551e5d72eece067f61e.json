  "description": "<p>As a general rule we humans are not big fans of change. We tend to buy into one way of doing something, for example a workout philosophy, and keep doing it hell or high water. However, adaptation (what you are going for when you are working out) tends to favor variety. You may not be seeing the gains you want because your body is already adapted to what you are doing. Sal, Adam & Justin discuss the value of \"changing things up\" in and out of the gym.
