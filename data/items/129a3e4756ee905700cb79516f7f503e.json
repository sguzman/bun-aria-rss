Peskin’s book, reminiscent of the work of Oliver Sacks, conveys its scientific information through narrative.</p><p>“I wanted to capture how this actually unfolds in real time,” she says on this week’s podcast. “For a lot of us, we go to doctors and you get a diagnosis and it’s as if that diagnosis has always existed. But in fact, the diagnosis was invented by someone who discovered something. And the history behind these diseases is often lost.”</p><p>J. Kenji López-Alt visits the podcast to discuss his latest book, <a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393541212\">“The Wok: Recipes and Techniques.”</a> López-Alt comes from a family of scientists, and is known for his science-based approach to home cooking.</p><p>“I was cooking for a number of years in restaurants, and all through that time I had a lot of questions,” he says. “For me, it’s natural to ask why we do something, why is this working the way it does? And in restaurants, just by the nature of how a restaurant works and the goal of a restaurant, which is more speed and consistency, you don’t have a lot of time to really focus on thinking about those types of questions or experimenting with them. So I had this backlog of questions built up in my head that eventually I started to get to explore.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Alexandra Jacobs and Jennifer Szalai talk about books they’ve recently reviewed.
