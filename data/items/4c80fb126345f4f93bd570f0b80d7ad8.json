  "description": "Oh hello! Mel's brother's wedding was the weekend before she moved her whole house and family and life. In other words, things are nuts over here! So you get an encore of A Shade of Vampire by Bella Forrest! Or, as we’re calling it, 50 Shades of Twilight: A Tale of Teenage Stockholm Syndrome. Full disclosure, we didn’t necessarily *like* this book, but we cannot wait to give you a hilarious after-school special about why we didn’t. We present a *very special episode* about what the kids are reading these days.&nbsp;\nSelf Love Recommendations:&nbsp;\n- Watch Big Little Lies on HBO or something else where talented people are slaying the game.&nbsp;\n- Listen to the last 15 minutes of The Ringer's Binge Mode. In the final episode there's a beautiful oration about not being ashamed for your interests and escapism. Plus, best friends gush about each other, which you know we LOVE!&nbsp;\nEpisode Notes:&nbsp;\nIf you like excellent vampire tales, be sure to check out American Vampire wherever you get your comics! Scott Snyder is the main writer and they've had arcs with Stephen King and more.&nbsp;\nAnd quick *CORRECTION* from this episode, \"women in refrigerators\" or \"getting refrigerated\" began in the 90's with Green LANTERN, not Green Arrow. Either way, I think we can all agree that ladies should be fully formed characters instead of merely plot devices, right? Thank goodness even mainstream comics have seen the light since then!&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMake sure to check out Mel's new podcast&nbsp;https://bonkers-romance.captivate.fm/listen (Bonkers Romance)!&nbsp;\nSubscribe!
