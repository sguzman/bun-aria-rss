  "description": "Two-thirds of the Fullcast is on vacation, but addition by subtraction is real so we invited Holly Anderson to come on and discuss lawncare disasters with us. Highlights include:\n--The Greatest Tale Ever Told, or How Holly's Dad Cut Their Cable Line With A Power Washer\n--Why lawnmowers are basically Satan's cigarette lighter he uses to burn down the earth\n--Zero football content, like maybe there's a second or two in there but it's purely accidental\n--No really, most of this is just us laughing at you, the listener, and that one time you set an entire orphanage on fire using a weed whacker the wrong way\n--Why's it posting on a Friday? BECAUSE WE WERE BUSY Y'ALL (Probably putting out a fire started by a lawnmower)\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
