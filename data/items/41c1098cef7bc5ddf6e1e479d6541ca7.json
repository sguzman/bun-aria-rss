  "description": "<p>Most people stumble into <a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/short-term-rental-market-watch\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>short-term rental investing</strong></a>. At some point, they realize a long-term rental, mother-in-law suite, or family cabin could become a <strong>revenue-generating, </strong><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/passive-income-from-real-estate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>passive income</strong></a><strong> machine</strong>. So what do they do? They go online to all the big travel sites, upload their listing, and start hosting. After a few months or years, they buy another short-term rental, and now, they’ve got multiple properties across a few different sites.<strong> The reviews are flowing, and the revenue with it. But one day, it stops</strong>.</p><p><strong>This happened to Rob</strong> when<strong> his listing got locked</strong>—halting his revenue. Without much of a way to repair this, Rob started thinking of how he could<strong> host with autonomy </strong>and <strong>reduce the risk </strong>as his portfolio grew. Sooner or later, Rob and today’s guest, <strong>Mark Simpson</strong>, started talking. Mark, an<strong> expert in hospitality</strong>, knew that something like this would happen.
