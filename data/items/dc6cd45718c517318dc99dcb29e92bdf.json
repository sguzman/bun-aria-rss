  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, WMAL radio host Larry O'Connor fills in for Mark. All three men charged with the murder of Ahmaud Aubery have been found guilty by a jury of their peers. This case shows that our justice system works, it’s not systemically racist. The white men that shot and killed a young black man were held accountable for their crimes. Despite the media's warped and perverted view of justice and obsession with the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict, the system worked. Then, President Biden is single-handedly damaging the economy and all the Democrats care about is retaining power. If it means lying about everything, they will do it. The media is just as complicit in covering things up and toeing the line for the Democrats in Washington. Later, if you have children in the public school system you have seen the impact of Biden and the impact of your school board. Our whole system is built on the premise of divesting power from the federal government, especially in your neighborhood. Afterward, the recent wins in Virginia are a good sign for the upcoming presidential election. However, there is much work to be done to win locally to ensure that America moves forward.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
