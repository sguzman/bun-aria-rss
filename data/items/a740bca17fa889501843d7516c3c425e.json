  "description": "American rapper and activist Killer Mike (Michael Render) joins The Fred Minnick Show this week, checking in to do a tasting and chat with Fred about a variety of topics. Mike has appeared in several films and frequently speaks on issues such as social inequality and police brutality. As a musician, he has released five albums since 2003 and also founded Grind Time Official Records. On the episode, he and Fred talk everything from Adult Swim's \"Frisky Dingo\" to moonshine to the history of Uncle Nearest to bringing people together in a difficult time for American society.\n\nWhiskeys tasted:\nUncle Nearest 1820 Barrel Pick (8:13)\nJohnnie Walker Blue Label (31:25)\nMoonshine (45:05)\n\nEPISODE SUMMARY\n\nHere a few highlights from this week's episode of The Fred Minnick Show:\nFred commends Mike on his social leadership, in particular becoming a social leader after becoming a rapper\nMike's fourth grade teacher urged him to not become a rapper because he was such a good student and leader. Although, he considers himself a \"reluctant leader.\"\nMike had a role on Adult Swim's \"Frisky Dingo,\" and relished being an \"arch villain\" on the show.\nIn talking leadership, he emphasizes recognizing we are all human beings - even our leaders. \"Most leaders aren't Superman, they're more like Bruce Wayne ... They can get hurt.\"\nMike also states he hopes Americans will be led by morals and principles and not led by men, a notion that would mean everyone does their part so that no one has to do too much.\nHe also points out that slavery is so recent that it's only \"two Mitch McConnells ago.\" He still believes racism is \"curable.\"\nFred chimes in that he still wonders why American society doesn't function as a unit as was the case when he was in the military. \"We are one America. We're all Americans.\"\nKiller Mike calls Johnny Walker Blue Label his \"Tom Brady of whiskey.\" Nevertheless, he remains a Falcons and Packers fan, thanks in part to a guy named Brett Favre.\nMike also talks about which rock bands and songs he would like to sample and/or collaborate with in the future, and also points out that rappers and country artists have a lot more in common that most realize, calling both \"blue collar music.\"\nFred and Mike talk about the possibility of a Killer Mike whiskey happening someday. Fred tells Mike, \"We can make that happen. I know a guy.\"\n\nQUOTABLES\n\n\"It brings further possibility of inclusion on all levels from all of us. ... If more people in this country were less concerned with protecting their whatever it is and more with connecting with one another, I think that much like sipping a good whiskey together and talking some shit that you know great understanding and empathy comes from those things. ... This whiskey like any good whiskey is going to bring people together, should be bringing people together, and creating an atmosphere of talks that will progress us in a way that I don't think politicians and arguments will.\" -Killer Mike, talking about how the recognition of Nearest Green's whiskey legacy can apply to current events.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nFOLLOW KILLER MIKE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1wmIvzCvixVcJ1fooNM2xA\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/killermikegto/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/KillerMike\n\nFOLLOW FRED\n\nhtps://www.instagram.com/fredminnick/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FredMinnick\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyE_GJtYr3yowks2iv1o4jg\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fred.minnick/\n\nSPONSORS\n\nMichter's: https://michters.com/ \n\nB-Line (Northern Kentucky Bourbon Trail): https://findyoursippingpoint.com/\n\nDistillery 291: https://distillery291.com/\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
