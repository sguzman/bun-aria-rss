  "description": "<p>Pull those jeans high and tight! Tom Segura and Christina P discuss how Sober October is going, best practices for hugging and kissing in public, and goth rockers ability to still rock like Peter Murphy and Dave Navarro. We get a follow up on the hiccup guy, Tom shares a story about a line cutter, and Christina realizes she can do what she likes to do and accepting how her brain works. We take a look at celebrities with hundreds of millions of followers, debate which celebs have retained (and not retained) their looks over the years, and look at a cool lady having a wellness check done on her. We check in on progressive Hungary and take a look at an overly emotional Lady Gaga over a cancelled show.
