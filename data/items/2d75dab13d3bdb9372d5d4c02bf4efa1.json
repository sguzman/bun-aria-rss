  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the trademark application for ``Tom Terrific'' made by New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. The application was made by Brady's TEB Capital. Former New York Mets pitcher Tom Seaver was known as ``Tom Terrific,'' but never moved to trademark the phrase. Also discussed is Andy Ruiz's upset of Anthony Joshua to become boxing's heavyweight champion, and the possibilities for him as an endorser. Also talked about is the convergence of TV sports and e-commerce as NBC during its telecast of the French Open invited viewers to point their phones at the screen to buy the outfits worn by Novak Djokovic. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams </p><p>Producer: Colin Tipton</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
