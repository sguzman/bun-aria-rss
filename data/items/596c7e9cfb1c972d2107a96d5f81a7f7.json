  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, the White House proposed a viable plan for peace in the middle east that was met with immediate rejection by Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority. Today's historic deal was downplayed by House bigots Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib who said it was a deal between an impeached President and an indicted Prime Minister. Meanwhile the real terrorist is Abbas. Then, Mitch McConnell says the Republicans don’t have the votes to block witnesses as possibly 7 Republicans are supporting the democrats on witnesses. This follows the controversy over the leaked manuscript of former National Security Advisor John Bolton. Now Gen. John Kelly has joined the chorus of former Administration officials supporting a push for new witnesses, namely John Bolton. If Bolton had evidence of an actual quid pro quo or impeachable offense, why didn’t he immediately report it to Congress, criminal authorities or ethics officials; or why not go public immediately with a press conference? Later, Michael Pack joins the show, he's the Director of the new documentary \"Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words\" which will be playing in theaters nationwide starting this Friday, January 31.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
