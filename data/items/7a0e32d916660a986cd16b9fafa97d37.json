  "description": "<p>Mark Frauenfelder likes to celebrate and encourage creativity in every form. He's the founder of BoingBoing, a directory of wonderful things that's encouraged \"happy mutants\" for over 15 years (and was a zine created with his wife, Carla Sinclair, before that), and the editor of Make Magazine, one of the inspirations of and driving forces behind the maker movement. Mark's book <a href=\"http://isbn.nu/9781591844433\">Made by Hand</a> documents how he turned to raising chickens, growing food, and pulling espresso as a counterpart to his increasingly digitally focused life. We talk about the revival of people's interest in making things and collaborating with others in communities, as well as his book and Make magazine.</p>\n\n\n\n",
