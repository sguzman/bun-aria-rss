  "description": "Today we look ahead to the next six seasons of Fantasy Football and pick our Top 3 players at each position. Obviously Michael Thomas will be on that list, so let's start today's show talking about his 2020 draft value (2:24). Should he really be a Top 5 pick in any format? Or should he be behind those Top 5 RBs? ... News and notes (13:10) on Todd Gurley, Tom Brady and more ... The best of the next six seasons! Starting with QB (18:00), why was Lamar Jackson left off some ballots? Is Kyler Murray a safer bet? At RB (27:45), the first two players were easy but finding a third was tough. Can Ezekiel Elliott be elite in the years to come? Did LSU's Ja'Marr Chase make our WR list (32:00)? Was there a reason to leave Tyreek Hill off? And at TE (36:50), who the heck is #3 on that list? ...
