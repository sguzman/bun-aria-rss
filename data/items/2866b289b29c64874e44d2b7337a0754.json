  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the big divide that people keep talking about exists and it's between liberty and tyranny; between law and order and we are on the right side of history. Just like the Democrat party hates the Constitution and the founding of the country they hate liberty and embrace chaos to promote their 'progressive' agenda. With 'progressivism' being the bastard child of Marxism, it promotes the notion that the economy exists for the benefit of the government which exists to support the ruling class. Then, don't be fooled when President Biden and the Democrats blame the Republicans and big oil for the massive price increases due to energy shortages that are coming at the end of November because of Biden's policies that slowed domestic energy expansion. Later, US Sen. Mike Lee calls in to discuss how Democrats are pushing a pseudo-independent to fool never-Trump Republicans and others into thinking they won't be as radical as the Democrats. Lee added that Democrats are pushing for total domination in Washington to push their liberal agenda. Afterward, US Senate candidate Herschel Walker joins the show with an update from his campaign. Walker called out Sen. Raphael Warnock for being a Marxist and evicting people unfairly from properties owned by his church. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
