  "description": "<p>This is a massive episode of the Beginner Photography Podcast. I have gone back and looked at all of my interviews in 2017 to compile a list of my biggest takeaways from our great guest photographers. From learning great shooting techniques to business advice to life lessons this, The Beginner Photography Podcast has taught me so much, I want to share it with you! 1: There is Room For All of Us! New photographers tend to think their market is always so saturated and that it is impossible to make any ground unless you have been shooting forever. Go back to Ana Brandts Interview and hear how she had a career before getting into photography, and now she is one of the worlds best!  2: Photography is Not About The Money Photography is not traditionally a lucrative career. What it can afford you is free time. If you really want to make it as a photographer, take the advice Ben Hartley Shared. Money should be the result of your efforts, not the goal of your photography. If you chase the money first you are going to get burnt out quick. 3: The Power of Visualization If you want to grow your skills as a photographer you need to hone your craft. Take Marc Silbers Advice, Visualize the photo in your head before you snap the shutter. Don't just react to whats in front of your camera. There is very little growth there. Work hard to get your photo.  4: Think Outside The Box Just go back to my interview with Taylor Jackson. He took his skills as a photographer to offer hotels around the world, his work in exchange for a room for a few nights. He is now able to travel just about anywhere in the world for free because he thought to do something different.  5: Prints are Not Dead One of the biggest questions I get from new photographers is how to sell prints when clients only want the digital files. When I interviewed Bryan Caporicci he tackled this subject directly. He shared several great ways to increase your clients desire for printed images.  6: It Takes More Than A Great Photo to be Successful!  Photography is more than just being able to snap a good photo. It takes customer service, it takes planning, it takes thinking outside the box. There are plenty of photographers out there who are INCREDIBLE but they are dead broke. Proving the quality of your photo is not directly related to your success. Go back and listen to Sports Photographer Vinny Pugliese or Luxury Destination Wedding Photographer Biran Leahy's interview for proof!  7: You Don't Need To Go Full Time This year I interviewed Canadian Landscape Photographer James Wheeler, a man who has a full-time job that he loves and still makes money passively through his photography. He has found a way to make photography work for his life. As his job, he has benefits, insurance, a retirement plan, and a steady paycheck. For his family, that is incredibly important. Although he is a talented photographer he does not feel the need to go full time, and neither should you if it's not the right decision for you and your lifestyle.  8: Every Client is not an Ideal Client Back when I interviewed Wedding Business Coach Heidi Thompson, she shared something most new photographers don't understand. The Ideal Client. When you're new to photography its easy to photograph anyone who is willing to pay you money. But this path will suck all the joy out of shooting and leave you with no sense of pourpose. She shared how to define your ideal client and how to find them!  9: Location is Not Everything This goes against everything you have ever heard. Husband and Wife Wedding Photographers Phillip and Eileen Blume share how they get their prominent clients to travel more than an hour out of their way to come to their location for a photo session. It is all about differentiating yourself! 10: Why Trust is SO I</p><p>Grab your Free CloudSpot Account at <a href=\"http://deliverphotos.com/\">DeliverPhotos.com</a></p> <p>Grab your Free CloudSpot Account at <a href=\"http://deliverphotos.com/\">DeliverPhotos.com</a></p>",
