Conceived by singer Kyle Morton as a vehicle for grandiose uplift, Typhoon hammers his points home with ambitious swells of brass and strings. At the 2011 Newport Folk Festival in Newport, R.I., the group finally commanded a stage big enough for what it throws down on its marvelous new EP, A New Kind of House.",
