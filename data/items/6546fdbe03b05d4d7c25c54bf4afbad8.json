  "description": "The media is on the side of tyranny and this program is on the side of liberty. Nobody cares what the cable news leftists and Liz Cheney think about the FBI raid on Trump's home. As you were told on this program Merrick Garland had to know about this raid and today, he confirmed that he did. The US Attorney in DC has nothing on Trump, so he is using a criminal statute and looking for evidence to fit the crime of his choosing. That's why they skipped the subpoena process and went straight for a search warrant when they knew Trump wasn't there, and they prevented his lawyers from observing while they went through the house including Melania Trump's closet. Double digit inflation all across every food category. Bread thirteen point seven percent up fruits and vegetables up nine point three percent. Beef and veal up three point four percent. And Biden's out there saying zero percent inflation. The zero percent inflation. It's outrageous. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
