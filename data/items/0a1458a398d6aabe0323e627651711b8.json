  "description": "Kenneth Lonergan doesn’t think there’s a real difference between comedy and drama, at least not in the way he writes and directs. The playwright-screenwriter-director talks with Marc about the lie of sentimentality, how ideas collapse when he’s writing and new ideas emerge, and why he hopes to get to 95% satisfaction with his work (he’s gotten to about 90% so far). That work includes Manchester By The Sea, Margaret, You Can Count On Me, and plays like The Waverly Gallery, which is now on Broadway. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://loopjewelry.com/pages/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Loop Jewelry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/screen-dive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Screen Dive from 20th Century Fox</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube Music</a>, and <a href=\"http://stamps.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stamps.com</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
