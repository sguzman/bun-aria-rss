  "description": "<p>#QOTD: What is your favorite candy?</p>\n<p>First of all, if you want to increase engagement with your content, you need to make sure you're putting out quality product. Once you know that you're hitting the right notes with the material you'e putting out, you need to put your efforts into business development. </p>\n<p>When an opportunity presents itself, pounce on it. Hustle. Be mindful of the environments and conversations you want to get involved in and be sure that you're offering them value in exchange for what you want from them -- exposure. </p>\n<p>When I didn't have the base that I have now, I was out on the streets hustling for Wine Library, formerly named Shopper's Discount Liquors. I was walking into any business that might be relevant to my community and passing out flyers and coupons one-by-one to gain more exposure. Nobody gave a crap or knew who we were but I knocked on doors and made sure we got the exposure we needed. </p>\n<p>So, can you biz dev? Are you willing to hustle to make it happen? Are you willing to work 15+ hours a day to make it happen? In today's world, there's so much room and opportunity to bring value to somebody, but it's never going to happen if all you care about is yourself . </p>\n<p> </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/578213.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
