  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down Back From Vacation and we reached out to some of our favorite The Office cast and crew for the inside scoop on this episode. First, Kentapedia (Kent Zbornak) and Phil Shea help us answer fan questions about Michael and Jan's vacation photo, and Kim Ferry sends in her memories of creating Michaels beaded vacation hair. Then Angela does some amazing detective work to discover just what was written on that Post-it note on Angela Martin's partition, and we head to the warehouse inventory-luau and discuss what Spam is made of. Finally, we get an audio clip from the hilarious Kate Flannery about doing her own stunt work, and Jenna shares her memories of that really sweet scene between Pam and Dwight. We hope this episode has left you feeling hot-hot-hot! </p>\n",
