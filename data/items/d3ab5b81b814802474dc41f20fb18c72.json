How are you?” to binary code, it looks like this: 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001 00100000 01001000 01101111 01110111 00100000 01100001 01110010 01100101 00100000 01111001 01101111 01110101 00111111 </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode takes a look at how computers can do so much with such tiny parts. But computers weren't always small -- so we take a look at where computers came from. We visit Ada Lovelace, whose love of math and weaving paved the way for modern-day computers. And we hear about the material that let computers shrink from the size of a room to something that fits in our pockets. There’s also a visit from a yak and a ram, but you’re just going to have to listen to find out why.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All that plus a new Mystery Sound and Moment of Um that answers the question: what is the flavor of root beer?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by </p>\n<p>Mathnasium (<a href=\"http://mathnasium.com/\" class=\"default\">Mathnasium.com</a>) and Sun Basket (<a href=\"http://sunbasket.com/brains\" class=\"default\">sunbasket.com</a> promo code: brains on)</p>\n",
