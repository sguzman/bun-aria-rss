  "description": "<p>The exponential modalities of linear logic have been used by various authors\nto model infinite-dimensional quantum systems. This paper explains how these\nmodalities can also give rise to the complementarity principle of quantum\nmechanics.\n</p>\n<p>The paper uses a formulation of quantum systems based on dagger-linear logic,\nwhose categorical semantics lies in mixed unitary categories, and a formulation\nof measurement therein. The main result exhibits a complementary system as the\nresult of measurements on free exponential modalities. Recalling that, in\nlinear logic, exponential modalities have two distinct but dual components, !\nand ?, this shows how these components under measurement become \"compacted\"\ninto the usual notion of complementary Frobenius algebras from categorical\nquantum mechanics.\n</p>",
