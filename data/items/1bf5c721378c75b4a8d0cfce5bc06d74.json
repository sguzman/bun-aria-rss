  "description": "<div>Shan Boodram delves into the taboo and hot topic that is cheating: are there ways to predict if your partner will cheat? Are there early warning signs?<br>\n<br>\nRecently two huge celebrity cheating scandals broke out- Adam Levine’s alleged affair and Nia Long’s fiancee, Ime Udoka’s affair. Often when we think of someone being cheated on, we cast an archetype - But in this case the people who’ve been cheated on don’t fit the script at all!<br>\n<br>\nOn this episode, Shan talks to Estefania Pessoa better know as Tefi on Tiktok, who provided an unexpected take on cheating. Tefi breaks down how  your code shapes your decisions, character, morals and therefore if you're likely going to be a cheater. <br>\n<br>\nBut there was another take on how to spot a cheater, that I found very fascinating. Estefania Pessoa better known as Tefi on TikTok spoke about code. Tefi explained how code is your character, your morals, and how this code will impact the decisions you make. Decisions that will not only affect you, but those that you love. <br>\n<br>\nShan also sits down with  Dr. Barry Goldstein, a clinical psychologist who enlightens us on what to look out for to get a leg up on those who can’t keep their legs closed. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Promo Codes: </strong><br>\n<br>\nBetter Help: Visit <a href=\"http://www.betterhelp.com/Lovers\">www.betterhelp.com/Lovers</a> today to get 10% off your first month.<br>\n<br>\nApostrophe: Visit <a href=\"http://Apostrophe.com/Lovers\">Apostrophe.com/Lovers</a> for your first visit for only 5$<br>\n<br>\nThank you Better Help and Apostrophe for sponsoring this episode. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Follow Shan: </strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://instagram.com/shanboody\">http://instagram.com/shanboody</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSE2Lr9RfYXiFtiX1jk5qng\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSE2Lr9RfYXiFtiX1jk5qng</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Call in to the show to leave a voice note</strong><br>\n‪(323) 375-4797<br>\nloversfriendspodcast@gmail.com<br>\n<br>\nFollow the guests on this episode: <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Tefi </strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@hellotefi\">https://www.tiktok.com/@hellotefi</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hellotefi\">https://www.instagram.com/hellotefi</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Dr. Barry Goldstein </strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://realityshrink.net/\">http://realityshrink.net/</a><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
