Billions of pounds have been applied globally since the 70s. In the US, though we’re only 4% of the world’s population, we use 20% of the world’s supply annually. Then, we wonder why our rates of chronic disease are so much higher than other countries. The evidence against the use of glyphosate keeps mounting, yet it’s still legally drenching our food supply. I try to be as good as I can about eating organic, high-quality food, and my glyphosate test revealed I was still in the 50th percentile. Studies have linked glyphosate to cancer, endocrine disruption, infertility, immune dysfunction, liver and kidney damage, and disruption of the microbiome. And not only is glyphosate harming human health and the health of our future generations, it’s also destroying our ecosystems.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Today on The Doctor’s Farmacy I dive into all-things glyphosate with Stephanie Seneff. Stephanie Seneff is a Senior Research Scientist at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She has a bachelor's degree from MIT in Biology with a minor in Food and Nutrition Science, and a master’s degree, an engineer’s degree, and a PhD degree, all from MIT, in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Her recent interests have focused on the role of toxic chemicals and micronutrient deficiencies in health and disease, with a special emphasis on the pervasive herbicide, glyphosate, and the mineral, sulfur. Since 2008, she has authored over three dozen peer-reviewed journal papers on these topics.&nbsp; She is the author of a new book on glyphosate titled Toxic Legacy: How the Weedkiller Glyphosate is Destroying Our Health and the Environment (July 2021).</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health, BiOptimizers, and TrueDark.</p><br><p>Rupa Health is a place for Functional Medicine practitioners to access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, Great Plains, and more.
