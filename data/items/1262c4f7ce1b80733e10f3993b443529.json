  "description": "<p>A listener asked how making  Brains On is different during the pandemic. So with this episode we're giving you a peek into how we're making the show while staying safe. Spoiler alert: we're doing it all from our homes! </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What's the best way to record crystal clear sound at home? (Hint: Lots of soft surfaces!) How do we make sound effects? How do we get all the animals, humans and machines in our homes to keep it down while we tape? Plus: We asked our co-hosts to share what it was like for them to record and episode from home. All that, plus a brand new mystery sound and a Moment of Um that answers the question: how do rocks form?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Purple.com (<a href=\"https://purple.com/brainson10\" class=\"default\">https://purple.com/brainson10</a> Promo code: brainson10)</p>\n<p>Daily Harvest (<a href=\"https://dailyharvest.com\" class=\"default\">https://dailyharvest.com</a> Promo code: brainson)</p>\n<p>PayPal - you can download the PayPal app at <a href=\"https://paypal.com\" class=\"default\">https://paypal.com</a></p>\n",
