  "description": "In Episode 96 I sit back down for a catch up with Vegan PRO Bodybuilder Nimai Delgado. Having recently been in Los Angeles for almost 3 weeks it was great to catch up with Nimai and hear how things have been with him since our last episodes. We also managed to sneak in quite a few gym sessions at Gold's Venice which I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nThis one's quite a casual conversation with no real direction as I have already covered his story back in 2018 in Episode 3. But if you know of Nimai, you'll be well aware his humble and gracious personality is a breath of fresh air. I certainly love catching up with him and am grateful to have him as a good friend.\n\nSome of the things we cover in this relatively shorter episode are:\n\n\nBits and pieces on the Game Changers\n\nHis current training program\n\nPaying the rent with cardio\n\nHis business interests\n\nHis daily rituals\n\nTraining Lewis Hamilton\n\nand other bits and pieces\n\n\nHope you enjoy it friends. As always be sure to let Nimai and myself know how this episode landed for you.
