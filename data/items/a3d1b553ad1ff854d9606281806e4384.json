  "description": "IN THIS EPISODE:\nOrganizing The Disorganized: Understanding The Elusive Attachment Category\nShow Notes\nDisorganized attachment states of mind happen to us all. We temporarily get lost in a jumble and it’s difficult to track what is happening… but for some this is a more serious concern that can reflect much of how we feel much of the time. By popular request, we begin to unravel the last attachment category and update current thinking that includes those who have unresolved trauma, loss or have had caregivers who were frightening.\nDisorganized Attachment\nIn this episode, Sue Marriott, Patty Olwell and Dr. Ann Kelley discuss this oft-overlooked fourth category; disorganized attachment and how it affects our adult lives. We go over it’s development and move to our current thinking on what it includes. We’ll talk about how attachment is formed as a survival skill and how loss, trauma and frightening caregivers transport individuals to disorganized spaces. Towards the end you’ll learn how relationships can provide safety and security in neurobiological terms, and how you can affect change for yourself or a loved one.\nTimeline\n0:00 -1:53 Intro\n\n1:53 – 3:49 Quick review of attachment & underlying organized dynamics (Secure & Insecure) Insecure attachment (Insecure Preoccupied & Insecure Avoidant)\n\n3:49 – 4:18 Data on attachment and historical figures (John Bowlby, Mary Ainsworth, Mary Main)\n\n4:18 – Attachment as biological imperative & cross cultural – everyone has an attachment system\n\n4:59 Three distinct categories – The addition of the fourth distinct disorganized attachment category (The Strange Situation)\n\n6:54 – The problem of disorganization in adults rather than children (update) – Applying data to real life individual people – Disorganization/attachment as a spectrum\n\n7:59 – How can we begin to move towards the middle (secure) including the disorganized?\n\n9:32 – Buckets instead of a category\n\n10:19 – What does disorganized attachment look like in an adult?
