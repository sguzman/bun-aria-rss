  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys chat about 412 Day and how they're proud to be from Pittsburgh, and also discuss the news that Dan Snyder has allegedly been withholding money from the other owners of the NFL, and if this is going to ultimately be the straw that breaks the camels back and will force the NFL to make sure that Dan Snyder sells the team. Joining the progrum to chat about tonight's NBA Playoffs play-in games and what the playoffs are probably going to look like is friend of the show, Insider for The Athletic and Stadium, Shams Charania (21:09-40:49). Later, 12 year NFL veteran at QB, ESPN NFL analyst, and friend of the progrum, Dan Orlovsky joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about this year's NFL Draft, which of the Quarterback's are the most ready to compete at the next level immediately, what he thinks is going to happen with the first two picks in the draft, some of the stuff he's noticed about the QB's through extensive film study, and much more (1:00:39-1:29:29). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show and listen on Sirius XM Channel 82, Mad Dog Radio.
