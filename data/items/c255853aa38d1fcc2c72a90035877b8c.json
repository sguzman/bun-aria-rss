  "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Do you ever feel like your vanilla therapist really doesn’t understand your need for sadomasochistic shenanigans? Yes, graphic artist Elizabeth Barlow’s desire for rough sex and BDSM might be ‘deflecting,’ but who would know better than the hot new relationship therapist she’s hooking up with off of a dating site? Bonus story: Have you ever been invited to join in on group sex with your crush, when all you really wanted was an innocent first date? Burning Man aficionado Soren Berg hopes to summon up the courage to ask out his theme camp neighbor Textbook just as he’s beckoned to her anonymous love-in. A newbie to this, he find her tied up and blindfolded, and he only has 90 minutes to learn the rules. With just minutes left, there’s still one wish left on the white board. Can he make her final fantasy come true? This story has an explosively happy ending - and the story is still evolving, as you’ll find out on this week’s Dixie Ramble.</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>This week: Come meet Dixie in person in these cities:</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Portland Meetup</strong></span><strong>: Wed October 12th 6-9 PM PST</strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>At Bar Bar, 3943 N Mississippi Portland OR</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Seattle Meet n Greet</strong></span><strong>: Friday Oct 14th 6-9 PM PST</strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>At Doghouse Leathers, 715 E Pike St Seattle WA<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>(please support our new Bang-O Sponsor, Doghouse Leathers!)</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>About the Storytellers:</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>Elizabeth Barlow is a bisexual storyteller and artist who draws comics about queer life.
