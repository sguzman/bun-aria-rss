  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, what senior Biden White House officials said was a game-changer for Donald Trump's Big Tech lawsuit. The best witness for his lawsuit is Jen Psaki who admitted today that the federal government is telling Facebook and other social media platforms which posts to censor on social media. The Big Tech companies can no longer say that they are independent when they are doing the work of the government. The first amendment does not speak of misinformation, it speaks of free speech. This assault on free speech by individuals wrapped in pseudo-righteousness will kill the competition of ideas including those of scientists. Then, \"Patriotic Commerce\" is the way to address the woke radicalization of corporations. For that, we look to a thought from Ayn Rand, which is expanded upon in \"American Marxism.\" Indeed President Biden has hired numerous corporatists from social media oligopolies to further blur the lines and increase the virtue-signaling as they enrich themselves and China. Later, social movement theory, collective identity, and other collectivist ideas diminish the individual, and the Marxist needs censorship in order to promote this ideology. Teaching students to be combat-ready activists is done by teaching oppositional protest theory. All of which is rooted in disdain for America and its founding.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
