Maes<br/>\n     <b>category:</b>  Quantum Gravity and String Theory<br/>\n     <b>type:</b>      submission<br/>\n     <b>date:</b>      2022-11-01 00:59:45 <br/>\n     <b>abstract:</b>  \nThis short paper shows that General Relativity (GR) combined with Quantum Physics implies spacetime and quantum gravity with 2D degrees of freedom at very small scales.The result is obtained independently of any other assumption on the underlying theory of quantum gravity other than the existence of quantum fluctuations, the formation of black holes if masses or energy sources are very high, and the properties of interactions with and among Black holes.Implications include universality of particles as microscopic black holes, asymptotic safety of quantum gravity for consistent theories and physical justifications, and hints of a physical justification for chirality of spacetime, and massive fermions/particles; something that will be exploited to explain the early universe, and the absence of GUTs in upcoming publications.\n  \n   "
