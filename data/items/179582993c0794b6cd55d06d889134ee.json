  "description": "<p>Ok we know we have a tendency to say this, but THIS is a very special episode of Questlove Supreme. Bowlegged Lou also known as Quest's \"personal hero\" changed what we knew about Hip Hop and R&B. Lou and his collective of brothers also known as Full Force reinvented and redefined these genres bringing a surplus of music to our ears that would launch and expand the careers of so many of our favorite artists. But that's not it! Can we talk about, their personal style doing the same for masculinity and the joy and hilarity brought by Lou's screen presence? Yes! We can also talk about wild stage shows ,being the only hip hop producers to work with James Brown, beefs with Larry Blackman, hits for New Kids on the Block and the Backstreet Boys, playing our favorite school bullies (as we celebrate the 31st year of House Party) and so much more! So, yes to answer your question, this is part TWO of our episode with the legendary, Bowlegged Lou.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
