  "description": "<p>Get yourself locked and loaded for another medal winning day as we go over everything that happened on one action packed day 8 of Beijing 2022! Why are some of us cross at the snowboard cross but some of us not cross at the snowboard cross? Does it count to lose in a group stage match in ice hockey at the Olympics? How are we feeling on Narracott night? Why is Canada so depressed about the curling? What on earth do Harley Quinn and the Joker have to do with Ice Dancing? And why does Colin love skeleton athletes from the Ivory Coast? It's another episode worthy of a gold medal so get ready to put one around your neck and have another great time! </p>",
