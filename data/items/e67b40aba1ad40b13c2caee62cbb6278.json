  "description": "<p>Conan O’Brien really needs a friend. But does he need a podcast? Turns out he does. If only to find that friend. Conan's bringing his favorite celebrity guests by the studio for some friendly conversations. In the meantime, he is joined by his dependable assistant Sona Movsesian, in an attempt to figure out why a venerable TV legend like himself might want to start a podcast in the first place. Is it really for the friendship, or just the fortune and glory? Or is it maybe to show everyone else just how wrong they’ve been doing it up to now? Weekly episodes start this fall. Subscribe now so you don't miss the biggest podcast event of the year!</p>\n",
