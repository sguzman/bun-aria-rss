  "description": "<p>One of the hardest things to do in any relationship is give feedback. It’s always dicey. You don’t want to be too aggressive. You don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. But you also don’t want to be too indirect.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>That’s where radical candor comes in. This term comes from Kim Scott, who is the bestselling author of <a href=\"https://www.radicalcandor.com/the-book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Radical Candor</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.justworktogether.com/the-book\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Just Work</em></a>. She has coached executives at Dropbox and Twitter, and has led teams at Google. In this conversation she’ll not only talk about how to speak with radical candor, but also how to avoid its evil cousins: ruinous empathy, manipulative insincerity, and obnoxious aggression. She’ll also talk about how to push for more equitable workplaces at all levels of an organization, how to speak up about diversity issues without ruining your career, and what to do if you’re the person who has created harm. Kim will also talk about the difficult wake-up call that led her from her first book to her second.</p><p><br></p><p>This episode is part of the Work Life series we are running here on the show.
