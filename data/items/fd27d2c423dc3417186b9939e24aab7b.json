  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this 86th episode of Philosophy Bakes Bread, called “French Toast Episode,” Eric Thomas Weber and Anthony Cashio return to some tasty bread morsels from past episodes, voicemails, and recordings, moistening them with some egg, sugar, and cinnamon for a tasty treat. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first segment, we revisit a number of voicemails that we hadn’t had a chance to respond to in past episodes. Then, in segments two and three, we return to some material we recorded on the Upper West Branch of the Penobscott River in Maine, on a Philosophy Bakes Bread trip we took with Apeiron Expeditions. Our friends in the conversations were Seth Walton, Ben Vockley, and Alex Strong. Alex was our main guide and is the owner of Apeiron Expeditions.
