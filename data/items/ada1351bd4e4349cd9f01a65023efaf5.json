  "description": "Today is my all International Talk Show, taped in Salt Lake City Utah during the trade show, such fun!\n\nI got to know Katarina Roccella when she showed her first fabric line and had her first trip to the United States. She is Serbian and I was really interested to find out what type of quilting goes on in her country (not much!). Her beautiful fabrics are with Art Gallery and I can't WAIT for Pandalicious  to be in stores!\n http://likeflowersandbutterflies.blogspot.com/\n==========\nGail Pan has a new stitchery book and it's ALL about Christmas!!  As an Australian Fabric designer and Author she always has uniquely 'Gail' touch to her work. I got a few really useful tips on embroidery, you will love this show!\nhttp://gailpandesigns.typepad.com/\n==============\nWhen I was teaching at Paducah I meet Susan-Clare Mayfield and she told me about her 'Block of the Day' called Town and Country Quilt. Isn't it incredible! Lucky for me I was able to get a few minutes of her time. Susan-Clare took a month an toured the US, she is from New Zealand. We have a super fun chat!\n\nhttp://www.gourmetquilter.com/   \n===============\nThe dynamic duo of Frances Newcombe and Jane Davidson are now designing for Moda fabric called Manderley. This line blends American Frances' love of sea with Australian Jane's love of color and design, it's an amazing fabric line and they have created incredible patterns! The two tell me about their partnership and how they design by skype! \nhttp://bellybuttonsboutique.blogspot.com/\n\nhttp://quiltjane.com/\n===========\nvisit American Patchwork & Quilting at http://allpeoplequilt.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/apqmagazine\nVisit host Pat Sloan at http://www.patsloan.com\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
