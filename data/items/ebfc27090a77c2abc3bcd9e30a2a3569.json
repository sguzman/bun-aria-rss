  "title": "#64: The Data Are Going to be Phenomenal! (Bret Weinstein & Heather Heying DarkHorse Livestream)",
  "description": "<p>In this 64th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. In this episode, we begin by discussing some of the Biden administration’s early policy decisions: shutting down DAPL, rejoining the Paris Agreement on Climate, and affirming the rights of trans people (and in so doing putting the rights of women at risk). Rolling Stone (the magazine) jumps the shark (but is it a literal or a metaphorical shark?). We discuss how to survive a year of lockdowns if you’re a small business, calling on two anecdotes from Portland. We discuss what is happening at Powell’s, Portland’s massive, independent bookstore, and ask what it says about “mostly peaceful” protests. Tech censorship is continuing apace, with the removal of Game-B architects from Facebook. And a doctor advises us to “trust the science,” saying that “the data is phenomenal!” <br/><br/>DarkHorse merchandise now available at: store.darkhorsepodcast.org <br/><br/>Find more from us on Bret’s website (https://bretweinstein.net) or Heather’s website (http://heatherheying.com). <br/><br/>Become a member of the DarkHorse LiveStreams, and get access to an additional Q&A livestream every month.
