  "description": "<div>Hi Friends!<br>\nHope your day is off to a good start. Today I wanted to talk about Armin Meiwes and what the hell was going on over there, I mean he was trying to cook sausage and eat it, I mean, yep he did that. <br>\nDid he REALLY deserve the sentencing he got if someone WILLINGLY participated? Weird case right? Least he’s vegan now, that’s good. <br>\nHope you have a wonderful day today, make good choices and let me know who you want me to talk about next week!<br>\nLove and appreciate you guys so much!! Please be safe out there. <br>\nx o<br>\nBailey Sarian</div>\n",
