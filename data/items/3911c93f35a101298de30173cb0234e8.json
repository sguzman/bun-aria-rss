  "description": "“Race isn’t about black people, necessarily,” says Eddie Glaude Jr. “It’s about the way whiteness works to disfigure and distort our democracy, and the ideals that animate our democracy.”\nGlaude is the chair of Princeton University’s department of African American studies, the president of the American Academy of Religion, and the author of the powerful book Democracy in Black. And this is a conversation about some of the hardest issues in American life: the way racism is intertwined with America’s political system, the worldviews we force ourselves to adopt to justify racial inequality, and the way white fear sets boundaries on black politics.\nThese aren’t easy topics to discuss, but they’re necessary ones. As Glaude says, “We have to have a politics that can interrogate it honestly, and do it in such a way that is mature, that opens up space for us to imagine ourselves otherwise.”\nBook recommendations:\nThe Quest for Certainty: A Study of the Relation of Knowledge and Action by John Dewey \nJames Baldwin: Collected Essays by James Baldwin\nNo name in the street by James Baldwin\nMore Beautiful and More Terrible by Imani Perry\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
