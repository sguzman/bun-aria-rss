  "description": "<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Happy Friday, Smarties! Workers at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, New York, elected to unionize today. That&#8217;s a historic win, and we&#8217;ll talk more about what the road to a contract could look like during Economics on Tap. There&#8217;s also plenty to discuss about the new jobs report, but one area to focus on is construction. Plus, a look at the impact the Biden administration&#8217;s immigration plans could have on the  midterm elections and the worker shortage. And we&#8217;ve got a round of our old favorite, Half Full/Half Empty!
