  "description": "<p>Hard Knocks has completely fallen off with few redeeming moments outside of the sick drone shot (00:02:44 - 00:13:25). We get serious for a moment to talk about the passing of Jimmy Hayes (00:13:25 - 00:15:55). Crate videos have reached breaking bones portion. Hot Seat/Cool Throne (00:15:55 - 00:45:05). Washington Football Team's QB Ryan Fitzpatrick joins the show to talk about his career, FitzMagic, FitzTragic, revenge games and Harvard (00:45:05 - 01:22:56). We finish the show with Mt Rushmore of Villains and guys on chicks.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
