  "description": "<p class=\"\">Don’t miss a single moment of our 2020 episodes — subscribe on your favorite podcasting platform and like/review the podcast if you’re so inclined!</p><p class=\"\">In two weeks, we’ve got another of Jen’s pics, Kristen Callihan’s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3005Aa7\"><em>Managed</em></a>, which you may recognize as “SCOTTIE,” which is how Jen refers to it because she loves him so much. We think you’ll love it, too, and if you have time, read the next in the series, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36JcEe9\"><em>Fall</em></a>, which is one of Sarah’s top 10 romances ever. Read <em>Managed </em>at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3005Aa7\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/managed-kristen-callihan/1124037490?ean=2940158465680\">Barnes & Noble</a>, <a href=\"https://books.apple.com/us/book/managed/id1129493045?app=itunes&at=1l3vpAR&mt=11\">Apple Books</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/managed\">Kobo</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Show Notes</p><p class=\"\">Who knows what the RWA situation is when you read this, but as of this podcast, the absolute best source is <a href=\"https://www.claireryanauthor.com/blog/2019/12/27/the-implosion-of-the-rwa\">Claire Ryan's blog</a> post outlining the timeline of events. There was lots of national news coverage, but the \"<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/04/793572217/racism-scandal-in-the-romance-writing-industry\">come on girls</a>\" comment was on NPR.</p><p class=\"\">The 2019 RITA ceremony <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/how-romance-awards-are-changing-and-why-its-about-/\">was amazing</a>, and one that celebrated <a href=\"https://youtu.be/shL1kNwr0nA\">the history of romance</a>. In between when we recorded this episode and when it was released, <a href=\"https://ew.com/books/2020/01/06/romance-writers-of-america-cancels-rita-awards-contest-racism-controversy/\">RWA cancelled the 2020 RITA awards</a>. When Sarah said \"it was a check the organization couldn't cash\" she's alluding to a less well-known section of <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/did-mlk-improvise-in-the-dream-speech/\">Martin Luther King's</a> <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/files/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf\">\"I Have a Dream\" speech</a>.</p><p class=\"\">\"La Nora\" is how many people refer to Nora Roberts. Sarah mentions some of her earliest category romances, including <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36yqz6l\">Gabriel's Angel</a>, an early Nora from <a href=\"https://www.fictiondb.com/series/silhouette-intimate-moments~14147.htm\">the Silhouette Intimate Moments line</a>. She's also read <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2tIDm7J\">Naked In Death</a> (Jen hasn't), but Jen loved <a href=\"https://amzn.to/35sVIa8\">The Brides quartet</a>, which was probably the last Nora Roberts series she read.</p><p class=\"\">Sarah said she feels like readers should at least have read ten percent of an author's backlist for full romance competency. Should the \"Ten Percent Rule\" be a plank of the official Fated Mates Romance Reader platform? Discuss.</p><p class=\"\">When we talk about Nora Roberts, we used a lot of superhero language: her <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/22/real-romance-2\">origin story</a>; her <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/queen-hearts-gives-her-throne-172376\">vanquishing of a villanous and duplicitous plaigiaris</a>t--<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/books/nora-roberts-plagiarism.html\">twice</a>!; <a href=\"https://www.town.boonsboro.md.us/\">owning her own town</a>; her <a href=\"https://noraroberts.com/did-you-know/\">complete dominance</a> of the <a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrpsuycrbo3rlJ4M\">bestseller lists</a>. None of it is hyperbole. It's possible she actually is a superhero.</p><p class=\"\">Lots of authors made statements about the RWA situaton. Here is <a href=\"https://fallintothestory.com/my-pov-on-rwa/\">Nora's</a>, and then <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JRWardBooks/posts/some-of-you-may-be-aware-of-the-rwa-situation-im-not-going-to-go-into-all-the-pa/10157041782658231/\">JR Ward's</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://smartbitchestrashybooks.com/2011/12/virginity-cliches-in-romance/\">Virginity</a> in romance has come a long way. PS. <a href=\"https://www.hercampus.com/school/western/why-virginity-social-construct\">Virginity is a construct.</a></p><p class=\"\">Somewhere in the 43 minute mark, Jen says \"<a href=\"https://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/May-2018/Ope-The-All-Purpose-Expression-of-Midwestern-Politeness/\">ope</a>,\" which is the most Midwestern of sayings. If <a href=\"https://twitter.com/midwestern_ope\">the twitter account Midwest vs. Everybody</a> doesn't make you laugh so hard you wheeze, you're probably part of the everybody.</p><p class=\"\">Jen isn't the only one who thinks <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/the-burning-issue-only-villains-smoke-in-hollywood-5347107.html\">smoking is a short cut for villainy</a>. She thinks <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_Smoking_Man\">The X-Files</a> is to blame. Also, PSA: <a href=\"https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/emotional-health/vaping-4-risks-for-kids\">vaping is really bad</a> for you, too.</p><p class=\"\">Birth control in romance has changed so much, listen to our episode on <a href=\"https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/emotional-health/vaping-4-risks-for-kids\">bodily autonomy</a> for more discussion of this topic.</p><p class=\"\">What does it mean to do something in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue_state\">fugue state</a>?</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/technology-is-transforming-our-love-lives--and-our-romance-novels/2019/12/13/bc893c2e-1de1-11ea-b4c1-fd0d91b60d9e_story.html\">Sarah wrote a column for the Washington Post in December 2019 about how technology is changing romance</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahmaclean/status/1211303904144695297\">Sarah's big thread</a> about why authors shouldn't be afraid of the problematic content in their old romances.</p><p class=\"\">If you're interested in a big interesting book about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/world/europe/northern-ireland-troubles.html\">The Troubles</a>, Jen recommends <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZXsFKM\">Say Nothing by Patrick Radden Keefe</a>.</p><p class=\"\">What's a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorland\">moor</a> anyways?</p><p class=\"\">So you wanted to know what it was like to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/concorde-flying-what-was-it-like/index.html\">fly the Concorde</a>?</p><p class=\"\">Buying a car?
