  "description": "<p>EPISODE 93 - SKIP LIEVSAY - Sound Designer/Editor/Mixer</p> <p>Team Deakins has the chance to catch up with the guru of sound, Skip Lievsay (GRAVITY, ROMA, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN). We use the opportunity to learn the different roles and responsibilities in the sound department, from onset mixer to re-recording mixer, sound editor, and sound designer. He shares with us some experiences on the films, True Grit, Inside Llewyn Davis, No Country for Old Men, and O Brother, Where Art Thou. We learn how the sound was conceived and executed for the movie Gravity. He also talks about working with Robert Altman and his love of sound. He even gets into the different sound formats and why one format might suit a movie better than another as well as choices of mics on the shoot. A great look into the world of movie sound!</p>",
