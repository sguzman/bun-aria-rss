  "description": "<p>Welcome the first guest to Probably a Podcast: Jalen Noble. You might recognize him from Love Island, Tik Tok, or quite possibly just his abs in general. What the girls thought was going to be a sex filled podcast instead turned into a straight up EMOTIONAL knowledge atomic bomb. Jalen takes Shannon and AG to church on topics such as: Toxic masculinity, why therapy is cool, and how to validate your beginning, middle, and end of a breakup. Are we absolutely perplexed that someone as attractive as Jalen could also be this in touch with his emotions? Yes. Are we the problem because of that? Also yes. Tune into episode 9: THERAPY IS SEXY to learn more. </p>",
