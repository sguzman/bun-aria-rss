  "description": "As you go through the coaching ranks, you see all different types of personalities. On one end of the spectrum you have the coaches who have mastered the art of \"coach speak\", where they are able to get by with few words, even fewer emotions, and with what many would call a vanilla approach. Then, all the way on the other side of the spectrum you have... well, you have Dawn Staley. Never one to mince words, emotions, or temper her fiery personality, Staley has brought success and pride wherever she has gone - both on the court and controlling the sidelines. Coming from a person who didn't see herself as a coach, it's hard to imagine the game without her presence on the bench. From turning around a Temple program - while still starring in the WNBA as an all star point guard - to taking South Carolina to the pinnacle of the NCAA universe with the 2017 Championship, Staley has done it all. Don't miss a chance to listen to her incredible journey as she joins the show for this second installment of the \"Coaching Series\" on the Old Man & the Three.  \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
