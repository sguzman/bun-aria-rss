  "description": "If Willie listens to this, things could get awkward fast. Si issues an apology to fans, but his remorse is short-lived. The boys try to solve the mystery of who sent Si 72 cans of Mr & Mrs T. They also share stories about the time Godwin dyed his beard and the weirdness that happens when Si uses an iPhone. John-David slams into his friend's truck, and that reminds Martin of the time Godwin backed into his truck while they were on the phone. Si closes it out with golf tips, the secret to his famous tea, and a Bible verse (complete with sound effects) for people who mess with old folks.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
