  "description": "<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, our hosts Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks continue their series on George MacDonald’s <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/3oMBNhp\">Phantastes</a></em>, covering chapters 10-14. Angelina and Thomas open the book chat talking about disorientation and how MacDonald is using the mirror images to help us enter into Anados’ feelings. Some of the topics covered in these chapters are disenchantment and demystifying the world, the child of mysterious origin, seeing and not seeing, romanticism and the dark imagination.</p> <p>Don’t forget to check out the Advent and Christmas resources our hosts have ready for your holiday season.
