Essentially, money shifting is when you shift to a lower gear than what you were anticipating. This can cause the engine RPM to raise above redline, cause the driven wheels to lockup, and can cause clutch slip - all of which can result in big damage. \n\nIn this video, we'll discuss what is money shifting, what happens internally when a car money shifts, and what the consequences of a money shift are. While driving a 2023 Nissan Z on track, I experienced my first money shift. After over 15 years of driving manual transmissions, I've unfortunately dirtied my clean driving record. But we can learn from my mistake! So enjoy the video, and don't do what I did. \n\nRelated Videos:\nIs It Okay To Skip Gears?
