Seek those who fan your flames.”</p><p>Rumi</p><br><p>I like to think this show sparks that fire by seeking out and sharing the stories of those who fan my flames. A mixed bag of inspiration and education. A diversity of in-depth conversations: life experiences, incredible personal stories, tales of transformation and a wealth of information to light your personal path towards maximum life satisfaction. A grab-bag toolbox to help you escape the status quo doldrums of life, raise your personal vibration&nbsp;and simply live better.</p><p>At the end of the day, it's all about story. Others sharing theirs so you can begin to reframe, tell and live a better story of yourself.</p><p>It’s easy to keep doing what you’re doing, propelled by a story you tell yourself about yourself, in whatever shape or form that may take. Life has a momentum like that. A particular gestalt. The relentless pressures and priorities of daily life take over and before we even consciously realize it, we fall victim to a rut we justify under the rubric of routine.</p><p>The rut is easy. It's the default imprimatur of social acceptance. Do what you're told. Don't ask questions. Shut up and keep shopping. Play that video game. Escape. And numb out your latent voice; your inner potential; and the world at large.</p><p>To escape this prison we must first change the story. This begins with the inside work. Investigate what makes you the only you there is. Develop a sense of self that renders your intuition not just reliable, but the only true compass directing your path. Walk through the fear that constrains the emergence of the true self. Unleash the courage to blaze your own path. And execute. Because talk is cheap. And action is everything.</p><p>Doing this is hard. Maybe the hardest thing you will ever do, it's like a salmon swimming upstream. Or setting sail in stormy seas in a canoe without a paddle.</p><p>But let's flip our perspective and view this path through a new pair of glasses. Not from a perspective of struggle and hardship but instead as more of a letting go. Rather than fight, surrender. Rather than climb a mountain, let's fall into&nbsp;who you really are. A natural process as effortless as a snake shedding an old skin.</p><p>This is what faith is all about. It's about understanding that that shed skin will soon be replaced with a new one that fits more perfectly. It's about being comfortable that that perilous, oar-less canoe will somehow self-orient to flow in the current of your true life purpose. And the idea that when the sea settles, you will find yourself no longer in that rut, but effortlessly gliding in a special, secret current with your name on it. The eddy of your personal life purpose if you will.</p><p>I realize of course that this all sounds counter-intuitive, if not downright weird.&nbsp;Letting go to ascend? Surrendering for the win? Hippy-dippy new-age crap!&nbsp;I get it. I used to feel the same.&nbsp;It took me years to really understand that it is&nbsp;the firm grip — attachment to ideas and behaviors — that keeps us stuck. And that freedom comes when we let go and release that grip and our attachment to behaviors and patterns and beliefs we mistakenly presume comprise our identity. These are truths. Spiritual laws if you will.&nbsp;Incredibly powerful&nbsp;tools I have used to get and stay sober; change my life path; and become more fully myself. Keys I continue to rely on daily to constantly challenge myself to grow and expand my horizons.</p><p>This is all a long way of saying&nbsp;that we all have the power to just start telling a new story about ourselves.</p><p>This is what&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.robinarzon.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Robin Arzón</a>&nbsp;is all about.</p><p>A self-proclaimed Ambassador Of Sweat, Robin is so many things: the inspirational voice behind her blog&nbsp;</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
