  "description": "<p>In this 81st in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. In this episode, we discuss how it is that claims of knowledge are made, and how social norms overlay our ability to think: the sociology of epistemology. We discuss lab leak hypothesis, why intellectual credit matters, and why the press needs to do better. Then: get physically active for a better outcome if you get Covid. And: trans ideology comes to kickboxing, and also to taxonomy, with an ant named they. Then: a poem found in NW Portland. And finally: a pro bono ad for epoxy putty.<br/><br/>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is now available for pre-sale at amazon.
