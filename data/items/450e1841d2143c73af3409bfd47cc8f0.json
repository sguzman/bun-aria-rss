  "description": "<p>Levi Boone Helm. The Kentucky Cannibal. Born in 1828 in Kentucky, and hanged in Montana Territory in 1864, this guy was mayhem on legs. He spent nearly his entire adult life fighting, robbing, killing, and running from the law. He killed at least 18 men in various shootouts and other violent encounters. He ended up stuck way out in the woods on numerous occasions with no option for food other than to eat another grown man, which he did if he got hungry enough. He spent his final days riding with The Innocents, an outlaw gang active in Bannack and Virginia City, Montana, before a massive vigilante mob brought them down. Lotta yip, yip, yaw in this one.
