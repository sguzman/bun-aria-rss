They also realize that  stand-up comedy was WILD in the 80's and hear from a listener that had an unfortunate catfishing incident. <br>\n<br>\nHear the full episode AND watch the boys literally blow up the Yaris (video out now!) for $5/month on Patreon. You also get instant access to 140 eps in the Patreon back catalog + the stiff socks discord and more. <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/stiffsockspod\">https://www.patreon.com/stiffsockspod</a>\n</div>\n",
