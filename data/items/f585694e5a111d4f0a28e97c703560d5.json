  "description": "<p>So… Phil and a Croatian Protestant theologian walk into a bar….  Oh, you’ve heard that one?  Author/theologian/Yale professor Miroslav Volf sits down with Phil to talk about Christians in culture and his new book Public Faith in Action: How to Engage with Commitment, Conviction, and Courage.  What follows is a fascinating conversation about Volf’s arguments for religion in a globalized world, plus what discourages and encourages him about the North American church today.  And how his fountain pen explains his view of God and Creation.  He’s a bright guy and it’s a lot of fun!  This week on the podcast!</p>",
