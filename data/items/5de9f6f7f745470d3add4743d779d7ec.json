  "description": "<div>The archaic-sounding notion of 'filial piety' has little direct translation into English, but is a deep-rooted part of Chinese culture and ethics. On this episode, I find out about what motivates the subscription to such an unequal view of family life; how modernity changes expectations (and in particular, the impact of the one child policy); and what happens to those deemed by society to be disrespectful of their parents.<br>\n<br>\nWith Professor Charlotte Ikels, an anthropologist at Case Western Reserve University.</div>\n",
