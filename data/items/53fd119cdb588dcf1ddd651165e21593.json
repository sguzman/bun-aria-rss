  "description": "How do we talk to kids about race? Most parents are unsure when to start talking about it with their kids, what language to use, and how to unpack nuanced topics with candor. In this episode, Dr. Becky talks with anti-bias, anti-racist facilitator Britt Hawthorne about how, when, and why to start important conversations in your home. Together, they explore the difference between talking about race and talking about racism, what language and tools you can use with even the youngest children, and what to do when you encounter your own racist, prejudiced, and ableist thoughts. Britt also shares her own journey as a bi-racial woman and parent that brought her to this work. This is a not-to-be-missed episode that will leave you feeling equipped with so many new tools. <p/>\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A  <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
