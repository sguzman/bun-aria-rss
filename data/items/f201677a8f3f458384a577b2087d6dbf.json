  "description": "<p>Byzantine-robustness has been gaining a lot of attention due to the growth of\nthe interest in collaborative and federated learning. However, many fruitful\ndirections, such as the usage of variance reduction for achieving robustness\nand communication compression for reducing communication costs, remain weakly\nexplored in the field. This work addresses this gap and proposes Byz-VR-MARINA\n- a new Byzantine-tolerant method with variance reduction and compression. A\nkey message of our paper is that variance reduction is key to fighting\nByzantine workers more effectively. At the same time, communication compression\nis a bonus that makes the process more communication efficient. We derive\ntheoretical convergence guarantees for Byz-VR-MARINA outperforming previous\nstate-of-the-art for general non-convex and Polyak-Lojasiewicz loss functions.\nUnlike the concurrent Byzantine-robust methods with variance reduction and/or\ncompression, our complexity results are tight and do not rely on restrictive\nassumptions such as boundedness of the gradients or limited compression.\nMoreover, we provide the first analysis of a Byzantine-tolerant method\nsupporting non-uniform sampling of stochastic gradients. Numerical experiments\ncorroborate our theoretical findings.\n</p>",
