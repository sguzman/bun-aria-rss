  "title": "253 - Hammer Happy Serial Killer Peter Kürten, the \"Vampire of Dusseldorf\"",
  "description": "<p>This guy. Killing mainly in 1929 when he was 46, the final year of his freedom, Peter Kürten would be charged with nine brutal murders and seven attempted murders in 1930, and then executed 1931. Over the course of his depraved life, he'd be sent to prison over and over, for theft, breaking and entering, fraud, army desertion, arson, rape, and then eventually, murder. Dubbed the \"Vampire of Dusseldorf\" the year before he was caught, this German monster was a sexual sadist who raped and killed women and children, ejaculating at the sight of their blood. He also sometimes killed the occasional man, becoming sexually aroused at the sight of their blood as well. After killing his victims, he was aroused by the press the crimes received, by revisiting the crime scene and talking to investigators, and also be visiting their gravesites later. All of that turned him on. His own execution turned him on. Dogs and farm animals turned him on. It's another strange and dark journey on another twisted true crime edition of Timesuck.</p>\n<p>Thank you Space Lizards for helping us give $14,400  to <a href=\"https://supportsurfside.org/\"><strong>https://supportsurfside.org/</strong></a><strong> -</strong> a hardship fund just established by the Miami Heat basketball team to help those impacted by the devastating building collapse in Surfside, Florida.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/D2lnAp7s6bw\">https://youtu.be/D2lnAp7s6bw</a><br /><br /></strong><strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Sxi48qqMbo\"></a></strong><strong>M</strong><strong>erch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a>  <br /><br />Discord! </strong><strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\">https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
