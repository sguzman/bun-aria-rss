  "description": "<p>In this episode, we’re digging deep into the world of Produce. Chances are, you don’t spend so much time thinking about your greens, your berries, your stone fruits, your avocados… (well, you probably <em>do</em> think about avocados quite a bit). The thing is, we spend <em>loads</em> of time thinking about all of it, so all you have to think about is what looks good when you walk into your neighborhood Trader Joe’s. We find out what it takes to ensure every one of our 488 stores gets the best produce we can find, from all around the world; we talk packaging, and steps we’re taking to reduce our produce packaging; and we’ll answer the burning question… what’s more popular, fruit or veggies?</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/pdfs/transcript-pdfs/InsideTJs-Episode16-Transcript.pdf\"> Episode 16 Transcript (PDF)</a></p>",
