  "description": "We’ve received a question from one of our listeners asking, “We want to know how to decorate a rental.” and we realize a lot of you might be in that same situation and want to know how you can make your rental feel beautiful and homey. We talk about how you can hang art in your rental and the best way to go about that using art hangers, and the brand we recommend is OOK. Being in a rental is also a great time to invest in some rugs because you can take them with you when you move, and then draperies can really soften the feel of your rooms, lending a sense of comfort to your living space. <br /><br />Art 3:03<br />Rugs 7:22<br />Drapery 7:55<br />Replacing hardware or paint 10:47<br />Furniture 12:38<br />Lighting 15:06<br />Plants 18:13<br /><br />“I think drapery rods, you’re gonna use them wherever you go. Your ceiling heights may change, you might have to get new draperies, but it will add such a layer that it’ll make it feel like home.
