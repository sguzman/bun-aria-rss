  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about March Madness beginning and chat more about the bracket challenge they're doing that will see the winner get $100,000, plus a general update of everything happening as we are now a few days into NFL free agency. Joining Pat in studio for an incredible conversation is Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, All-Pro, and new starting Quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts, Carson Wentz. Pat and Carson chat about his new start in Indianapolis, what went wrong in Philadelphia, if he hears all the stuff from the media, if he was ever broken, why he's excited to be back with Frank Reich, and much more (22:53-58:26). Later, 6x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, 13 year NFL veteran at WR, and now cohost of the I Am Athlete podcast, and panelist on First Things First, Brandon Marshall joins the show to discuss his career in the league, his battle with mental illness, how much he loves doing the podcast, the best and worst thing about the NFL, and how much he loved Aaron Rodgers Tuesday's (1:00:44-1:27:05). Later, Pat and AJ chat about the goings on of the NFL, and much more (1:28:31-1:57:44).
