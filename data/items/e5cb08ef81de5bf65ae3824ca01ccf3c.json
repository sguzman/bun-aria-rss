  "description": "<p>Jessica Michelle Singleton came over to talk about what it's like to drive for a ride-share company. She's ridden for Uber and Lyft so she's got first hand knowledge on the subject. And we even drove around a little and picked up a passenger during the podcast. Fun times. The conversation naturally went from driving to rape so expect some really stupid discussion on the subject from the both of us.</p>",
