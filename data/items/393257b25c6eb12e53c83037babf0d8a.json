  "title": "PMS 2.0 334 - OVERREACTION MONDAY, NFL Divisional Playoffs Recap, Allen Lazard, Ian Rapoport, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys overreact to everything that happened during the Divisional Round of the playoffs including Patrick Mahomes potentially being injured for their showdown against the Bills, the Packers taking care of the Rams and looking very good in the process, Tom Brady and the Bucs eliminating the Saints and potentially ending Drew Brees' career as they look ahead at the NFC and AFC Championships. Joining the show after catching 4 passes for 96 yards and a touchdown, is WR for the Green Bay Packers, Allen Lazard. Pat and Allen chat about this Packers team that seems to be peaking at the right time, how good Davante Adams is, what it's like catching passes from Aaron Rodgers, his juice preferences, being nick named the Lizard King, and much more (21:50-38:11). Next, NFL Network Insider and friend of the program Ian Rapoport joins the show to chat about the different coaching hires, who could still potentially end up where, if the DeShaun Watson news is accurate, and everything else we need to know heading into Conference Championship weekend (41:27-1:03:04). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk chat about Urban Meyer's first hire in Jacksonville, the games this weekend and give an early indication of who they like in the Conference Championships, chat about Jack Easterby's meteoric rise throughout the NFL and the expose written about him in SI, and have a lengthy discussion about team chaplains, pastors, and priests (1:24:58-2:06:13). Make sure you subscribe to youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow and listen every day on Mad Dog Radio, Sirius XM Channel 82. We appreciate you all for listening, come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
