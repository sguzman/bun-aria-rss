  "description": "<p>💬 What is an ‘essentialist’? &nbsp;&nbsp;An essentialist is someone who can decipher the difference between what is truly important and what is not. Often in life we focus on the things that are not important, substituting them for the things that are. 🤔 &nbsp;&nbsp;This is usually not because we choose to. But rather than we have not been trained to think as essentialists. Becoming an essentialists, whether at home, school or work, is an active choice we make daily. It is making the decision to only do the things that give YOU the most value. 😊 &nbsp;&nbsp;My personal journey to becoming more of an essentialist started when I read this book a couple of years ago. Since then I have been actively making choices to choose the things that give me the most value. I still fail from time to time, but the self-awareness of actively asking yourself these questions transforms your life. 💯 &nbsp;&nbsp;This is the value of re-reading books. The ideas remain true but provide more value as you spend more time acting out the principles in your life. 👍📚 &nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you to @greg for sending me his book and I can’t wait to discuss it more next week on @book podcast. &nbsp;Thank you for watching this video.
