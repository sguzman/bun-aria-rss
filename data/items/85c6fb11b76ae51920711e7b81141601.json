  "description": "For the last few days, I’ve been at an investment summit in Orlando. It seems every time I’m away, the market tanks… But it’s a great time to start buying stocks. I explain why you need to start picking away at your watchlist. The biggest news is the Fed’s 0.75% interest rate hike—and I do something a little unusual: give credit to the Fed. But it still has a lot of work left to do… I also break down how rising rates will impact homebuyers. The crypto market is the riskiest it’s ever been… but its long-term reward profile is incredible. I highlight innovation in the crypto space—including our metaverse land deal with TCG World… and how accredited investors can join us. In this episode:  Why I’m aggressively buying stocks [1:00] Credit to the Fed where it’s due [6:15]  Should you buy a home as mortgage rates rise? [10:14]  What’s behind the massive crypto crash? [18:00] The metaverse is not a fad [27:00] An inside look at the Orlando conference [37:20]  Enjoyed this episode?
