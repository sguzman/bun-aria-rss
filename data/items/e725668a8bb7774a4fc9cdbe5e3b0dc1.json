We know that learning is not one size fits all - it is personal. To help amplify educators’ impact, we’ve created a new <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/gfe_back_to_school_guide_21.pdf\">Back to School Guide</a> to help educators meet each learner where they are – geographically, developmentally and academically.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"9o6p1\">Use new Classroom tools to support your students</h3><p data-block-key=\"ctmcm\">Many educators are searching for new ways to help them create and deliver instruction efficiently, while supporting students effectively. With <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_us/workspace-for-education/editions/overview/\">Google Workspace for Education</a> and <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/teacher-center/products/classroom/?modal_active=none\">Google Classroom</a>, you can set up classes to do everything from creating coursework to distributing assignments and grading. To get started, check out this <a href=\"https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/path/479480-google-classroom-course\">Classroom training course</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"9o6p1\">We’ve added many <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/theanywhereschool-overview/\">new features</a> to Classroom that we announced during our event, The Anywhere School 2022. For instance, <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/classroom-add-ons\">integrated add-ons</a> let you use your favorite education tools like Kahoot! and IXL right in <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/theanywhereschool-classroom/\">Classroom</a>. And, in partnership with Clever, admins can <a href=\"https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/11546369?visit_id=637902148948227741-1381640758&amp;p=sis_elevate&amp;rd=1\">sync class rosters</a> from most major student information systems (SISs) to Classroom. Schools with Education Plus can sign up for our <a href=\"https://goo.gle/elevatedatasync-beta\">beta pilot</a> of Elevate Data Sync as we expand into 15 more countries.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-video\"><div class=\"h-c-page h-c-page--mobile-full-bleed\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><div class=\"h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col-l--10 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-1\"><div class=\"article-module uni-article-video uni-article-video--body\" data-component=\"uni-article-yt-player\" data-page-title=\"\" data-video-id=\"TlQhI-73rLA\"><div class=\"uni-article-video__embed-container hidden\"><div id=\"uni-article-yt-player-TlQhI-73rLA\"></div></div><figure><a class=\"h-c-video h-c-video--marquee uni-article-video__custom-wrapper\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"uni-article-video__aspect-image\"><img alt=\"YouTube video describing Classroom add ons\" data-loading='{\n                        \"mobile\": \"//img.youtube.com/vi/TlQhI-73rLA/sddefault.jpg\",\n                        \"desktop\": \"//img.youtube.com/vi/TlQhI-73rLA/maxresdefault.jpg\"\n                      }' loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//img.youtube.com/vi/TlQhI-73rLA/default.jpg\"/><div class=\"uni-article-video__dimmer\"></div><svg class=\"uni-article-video__play-button--active\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#yt_video_play_button_no_hole\"></use></svg><svg class=\"uni-article-video__play-button\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#yt_video_play_button\"></use></svg><div class=\"uni-article-video__duration loading\"><svg class=\"uni-article-video__duration-icon\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#yt_video_duration\"></use></svg><span class=\"uni-article-video__duration-time\">10:25</span></div></div></a></figure></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"9o6p1\">Inspire creativity through video</h3><p data-block-key=\"j7ma\">Distance learning taught us the value of being creative while teaching and learning, from using <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google_meet-use_cases_onepager.pdf\">Google Meet to stay connected</a> to <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/project/learn\">taking students on virtual field trips to explore arts and culture</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"9o6p1\">A great way to inspire creativity is through video. Our new <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/theanywhereschool-chromebook/\">Screencast app</a>, built into ChromeOS, helps students and teachers share their ideas in class by creating their own screencasts, with built-in transcription. Educators can also record, trim, transcribe and share recordings for their students to review anytime.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"9o6p1\">Another way to connect is by using the livestream feature in YouTube to share school events with your whole community, in addition to livestreams with Meet.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"9o6p1\">Those same tools present <a href=\"https://www.edtechdigest.com/2022/07/07/lessons-learned-in-re-engaging-students-in-the-classroom/\">new ways to reengage students</a> as schools return to in-person environments. Keep exploring <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_us/for-educators/product-guides/?modal_active=none\">ways to use tools</a> like Jamboard, Forms, Sites, Docs, Slides and Sheets to better communicate with students and understand their needs.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"9o6p1\">Make lessons more personal with adaptive learning technology</h3><p data-block-key=\"f0gbv\"><a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/adaptive-learning-technology/\">Adaptive learning</a> provides students with customized resources and activities to address their unique learning needs. For example, if a student struggles with adding fractions, a teacher might offer additional practice problems. By applying artificial intelligence to adaptive learning, we can explore new possibilities to make the learning experience more personal for each student.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"9o6p1\">A new Classroom feature called practice sets, globally available in beta, offers students a more <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/introducing-practice-sets/\">personal path to learning</a>. Now, educators can easily transform their own teaching content into interactive assignments and use the autograding tool to cut down on manual grading time. When working on assignments, students receive instant feedback on their answers, and real-time support if they get stuck along the way. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekEXqmuwbO_VD-OCaNXZ3CDJyAWhAn2tqGEMtHSkJEwXB8pw/viewform\">Take this new tool for a spin</a> and explore the possibilities.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-video\"><div class=\"h-c-page h-c-page--mobile-full-bleed\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><div class=\"h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col-l--10 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-1\"><div class=\"article-module uni-article-video uni-article-video--body\" data-component=\"uni-article-yt-player\" data-page-title=\"\" data-video-id=\"X-UgPQ6OvAk\"><div class=\"uni-article-video__embed-container hidden\"><div id=\"uni-article-yt-player-X-UgPQ6OvAk\"></div></div><figure><a class=\"h-c-video h-c-video--marquee uni-article-video__custom-wrapper\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"uni-article-video__aspect-image\"><img alt=\"YouTube video describing practice sets in Google Classroom\" data-loading='{\n                        \"mobile\": \"//img.youtube.com/vi/X-UgPQ6OvAk/sddefault.jpg\",\n                        \"desktop\": \"//img.youtube.com/vi/X-UgPQ6OvAk/maxresdefault.jpg\"\n                      }' loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//img.youtube.com/vi/X-UgPQ6OvAk/default.jpg\"/><div class=\"uni-article-video__dimmer\"></div><svg class=\"uni-article-video__play-button--active\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#yt_video_play_button_no_hole\"></use></svg><svg class=\"uni-article-video__play-button\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#yt_video_play_button\"></use></svg><div class=\"uni-article-video__duration loading\"><svg class=\"uni-article-video__duration-icon\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#yt_video_duration\"></use></svg><span class=\"uni-article-video__duration-time\">10:25</span></div></div></a></figure></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"9o6p1\">Help every student succeed with accessibility features</h3><p data-block-key=\"f7uof\">Many of the people behind Google for Education are <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/tools-reach-all-types-learners/\">former educators who bring their passion for inclusive learning</a> to their work every day. So we know learners benefit greatly from tools that meet their unique needs.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"9o6p1\"><a href=\"https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_us/why-google/accessibility/\">Accessibility features</a> built into Google Workspace for Education and Chromebooks help students learn in the ways that work for them. Students can utilize visual aids, spoken feedback and Acapela text-to-speech voices on Chromebooks, or use voice typing, captioning, Braille displays, screen readers and magnifiers in Google Workspace for Education. ​​</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"9o6p1\">Not yet familiar with our accessibility features? Take the <a href=\"https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/path/61214-tools-for-diverse-learners-training?locale=en\">Tools for Diverse Learners Training</a> to help everyone participate and develop a love of learning.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"9o6p1\">Keep families involved and in the loop</h3><p data-block-key=\"9spvr\">One of the greatest predictors of student success is <a href=\"https://www.waterford.org/education/how-parent-involvment-leads-to-student-success\">family engagement</a>. Easily communicate with families using <a href=\"https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/6386354?hl=en\">guardian email summaries</a> in Classroom, schedule meetings with <a href=\"https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/190998?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\">Calendar appointment slots</a> and set up virtual conferences with Meet.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"9o6p1\">It’s also important to work alongside families to help students use technology responsibly and be critical consumers of digital content.
