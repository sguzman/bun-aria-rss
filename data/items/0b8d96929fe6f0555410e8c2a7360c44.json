  "description": "You should eat more protein, and yes, that means red meat. This statement might surprise some audiences, but it is based on the fundamentally sound science that high muscle strength is independently associated with lower all cause mortality. Dr. Gabrielle Lyon has been on the forefront of “muscle-centric medicine” for years, and here’s what really is surprising. She became obsessed with the concept because of her work with palliative care, dementia and geriatrics. On this episode of Health Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Gabrielle Lyon explains why muscle should be viewed as a vital organ which protects against everything from Alzheimer’s to COVID-19. She discusses the optimal high-protein diet, strongly advocates that everyone engage in resistance training, and explains why people should focus on gaining muscle instead of focusing on losing fat.
