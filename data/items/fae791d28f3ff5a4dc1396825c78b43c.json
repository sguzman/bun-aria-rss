  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden is not only stupid by birth, but he is dangerous as well. He is the reason for increased gas, propane, crude oil prices, and an economy in crisis. Now Biden is draining America's strategic reserve by releasing a million barrels a day for the next several months to try and fix the mess he made. Yet the real answer here is to drill and produce more energy to create a surplus. Once there is more supply there will be less demand. Lamentably, Biden won't allow the current leases to gain the permits to develop the infrastructure to drill on approved lease sites. Then, today the Biden Administration recognized Transgender Day of Visibility. The U.S doesn't need to be in the business of promoting genitalia. Later, the Biden family is bought and paid for and there must be a special counsel to investigate the malfeasance of the Biden Family and Merrick Garland is too mired in his own controversy for the task. When it was Trump's family the lawyers worked overtime to accuse them of crimes. The Washington Post covered up Hunter's laptop, saying the story was Russian disinformation only to admit it was real 500 days after Biden took office. Afterward, Sen. Ron Johnson, Chairman of the U.S Senate Homeland Security Committee, joins the show to explain how Joe Biden was implicated on Hunter Biden's laptop and how this is the beginning of many questions. Sadly, the U.S doesn't have all the answers, but the intelligence agencies of China and 12 other countries likely know more than we do.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
