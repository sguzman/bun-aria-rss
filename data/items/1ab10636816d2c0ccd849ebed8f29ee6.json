Joining the program for the first time is WWE Icon, former UFC Heavyweight Champion, NCAA National Champion, one of the scariest human beings on the planet, Brock Lesnar. Pat, Brock, and AJ chat about his career in both the WWE and UFC, what he does in his free time, his work with the Bearded Butchers and the new blend seasoning that he created with them, what's next for his career, his upbringing, and much more in an absolutely incredible conversation (1:26:10-2:15:15).
