  "description": "<p>#QOTD: Let me know what the next 3-5 years look like for your business. What do you have planned? What are you looking to accomplish?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Micro-Content is the idea of making content specific to the context of a platform. It's the idea of utilizing videos and pictures, quotes, and written words that work specifically for the multitude of platforms that exist (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Vine, Pinterest, Snapchat, etc) -- which if I might add, was the context behind my latest book, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook ;)</p>\n<p>So, how do you make good micro-content? First of all, content is subjective. It depends on the viewer and why they're in particular place at a particular point in time. I understand that a 40 year old woman will have a different mindset when she's on Pinterest vs. Facebook. Does she have intent to shop (Pinterest) or is she just catching up with her world (Facebook)? That's how you need to focus on your story-telling strategy. You need to be mindful of the psychology behind the user's intent and the nuances of the platform. </p>\n<p>When creating micro-content, or content in general, you also need to respect the user and their tendencies. Of course you want to sell your products, but you need to portray them in way that's more compelling to the viewer. You need to shape it their interests and lifestyle. There are plenty of targeting strategies out there, and there's no one way to execute. The only things you can hone in on while forming your strategy are: </p>\n<p>1. Respecting the audience  </p>\n<p>2. Respecting the platform  </p>\n<p>3. Making your agenda fall third to #1 & #2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/578203.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
