  "description": "<p>It's another week of 2 Bears 1 Cave with Tom Segura and Bert Kreischer out of the new Austin set and we get into hypotheticals about hooking up with relatives! We get an update on the weight loss challenge with Nadav, talk about Ben Askren and the Jake Paul fight, and Bert tries to figure out his price for getting knocked out by a professional fighter. How much should Bert get to be in a boxing ring with Israel \"Stylebender\" Adesanya? The bears discuss the recent passing of Louis Anderson, Bob Saget, and Norm McDonald. Tom shares a story about him and Ryan Sickler smoking out Norm and seeing him go on stage right after. Bert then shares a story of a Paralympian swimmer Chloe Toscano who recently removed her arm and the bears gauge the room on some playful choking in the bedroom.</p>\n",
