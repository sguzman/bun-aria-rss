  "description": "<p>Johann Hari is a journalist and has studied addiction. Joe has had him on before and it’s always a fact filled podcast. Johann is very knowledgeable about his subject and speaks very fast so PAY ATTENTION! LOL. There are a lot of really interesting points made during their conversation that taught me a lot about drug addiction. Really liked it.  </p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
