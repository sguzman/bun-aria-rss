  "title": "Jacob Smith, “Eco-Sonic Media” (University of California Press, 2015)",
  "description": "Can we have sound media that is ecologically sound? Can we fine tune our media production and consumption habits to a greener key? How can an environmental perspective on sound media contribute to our understanding of how media culture is involved in the ecological crisis? These are just some of the questions Jacob Smith is trying to answer in his latest book, Eco-Sonic Media (University of California Press, 2015). The book brings an ecological critique to the history of sound media technologies and contributes with an environmental perspective to the field of sound studies. It is more than a methodological and theoretical exploration. It is a reckoning with our media consumption practices in an age where speed and volume are taken for granted, and alternatives to the digital are disregarded with huge costs.\n\nHartz Canary Training Record is the jingle used in the episode and was kindly provided by Jacob Smith. It was cut and edited for the purpose of this podcast.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
