  "title": "How I Keep My Projects Organized",
  "description": "Since I started my undergraduate studies in 2008, I have been obsessed with productivity tips, notetaking solutions, and todo-list management. Over the years, I tried many, many workflows and hundreds of (mostly digital) tools to keep my life, projects, and notes organized. Occasionally, I exchange ideas with friends and colleagues, and upon request, I talked about my workflow a couple of times on Twitter. After today's 2021-edition of this discussion, I thought that writing a quick and informal blogpost makes sense, making it easier to read and having a quick reference if someone asks about it again :).",
