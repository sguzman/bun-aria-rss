  "description": "<p>With only two months until Christmas, this seems the perfect time to revisit a topic we first discussed in <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e8trfa\">episode 43</a> - how to encourage people to consider giving your art as a holiday gift (or requesting it as one for themselves!) This time, we cover the importance of good copywriting; the benefit of a flexible returns policy; and the value of offering gift certificates. We also suggest ways to create and market less expensive items such as prints, coffee table art books, mugs, and calendars, and we discuss how \"drop shipping\" firms can reduce costs and workload. In other news, Louise has had a breakthrough on some large paintings that she feels have really pushed her into new territory and this sparks a discussion about what that means. What does it feel like to be working in a new way? How do we recognise what works and re-create those conditions over and over again?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Contrado<strong> </strong><a href=\"//\"><strong>https://www.contrado.co.uk/</strong></a></p>\n<p>Red Bubble<strong> </strong><a href=\"//\"><strong>https://www.redbubble.com/</strong></a></p>\n<p>The Rabbit Hole<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/rabbit-hole\"> </a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alicesheridanstudio.mykajabi.com/connected-interest\">https://www.nytimes.com/column/rabbit-hole</a></p>\n<p>Kate Green <a href=\"//\">http://kategreenart.com/</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Join us</strong></p>\n<p>Alice's Connected Artist Wait List <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/elh636/metadata/edit\">https://alicesheridanstudio.mykajabi.com/connected-interest</a></p>\n<p>Louise's Art Tribe sign-up page <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/elh636/metadata/edit\">https://thispaintinglife.mykajabi.com/art-tribe</a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
