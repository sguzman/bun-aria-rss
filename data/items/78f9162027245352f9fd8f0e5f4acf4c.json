We profile the women and men responsible for sport in this country - many at national governing bodies - who manage teams, staff, budgets, grass-root participation and overseeing those medal moments at Olympic, Paralympic and elite level.</p><br><p>This week, we're in Hendon and the Leon Paul Centre with British Fencing Chief Executive Georgina Usher. Britain last won an Olympic medal in Fencing 50 years ago at Tokyo 1964 Olympics and despite funding cuts since 2016, Georgina's in buoyant mood ahead of Tokyo 2020. The sport is growing and in Richard Kruse and Marcus Mepstead, GB has two World championship medalists since the Rio Games. John admits racing through the rain in Rio to see Kruse nearly win GB's first medal was one of the highlights of his experience in South America! But it's not all about medals, and Georgina, the 2014 Commonwealth champion, explains how Fencing can help youngsters just like her 11 year old self! We also talk women in sport and how businesses need to wise up to the talent of a former Olympian!</p><br><p>And if there's someone who you think is a Great British Boss - and would make a good podcast - please free to get in touch on twitter @AnythingbutF and using the hashtag #GBBosses or contact us through our website www.anythingbutfooty.com</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
