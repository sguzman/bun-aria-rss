In an interview with <em>Jarry</em> magazine, Libby and her business partner Bill Clark described MeMe’s as a “very, very gay restaurant,” and with that one quote, MeMe’s Diner became not just a foodie hot spot, but part of the queer culinary moment that’s sweeping the industry, one that’s being shaped by the likes of JaynesBeard, Queer Soup Night, Chefs Ora Wise, Preeti Mistry, Angela Dimayuga, and others. The attention from <em>Eater, Bon Appetit</em>, and <em>The New Yorker</em> is getting people in the door, but they’re staying for Libby’s unique spin on comfort food, Bill’s baked goods, and the duo’s modern, thoughtful hospitality. Libby talks to host Kerry Diamond (@kerrybombe) about being part of a phenomenon, her kitchen bona fides, and how MeMe’s came to be.</p>\n<p>Our second guest is Lauren Goldstein (lauren_goldstein), Northwestern University grad and creator of the Sugar and Spice Summit, the only conference dedicated to connecting college women and young female professionals with influential women working in the food industry. Lauren joins us to talk about the summit, which will take place this year on April 28th in Chicago.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Emmi, the maker of beautiful, delicious cheeses from Switzerland, and to Le Cordon Bleu, the legendary culinary school, for supporting this episode of Radio Cherry Bombe.</p>\n",
