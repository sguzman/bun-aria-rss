  "description": "<p>LIVE from the Toscano Cigar Sound Stage… This week The Cigar Authority welcomes the podcast coach, Jim Collison as he picks apart our podcast that we have been doing since 2010. What are we doing wrong? Are we doing anything right? Who is the weakest link? How can we improve? What should we change? We will address all of this as we smoke the All Saints Dedicacion Berkey from the care package.</p>\n<p>In the second hour will someone be voted off the show? Jim Collison tells us if we have too many members and if we should downsize and if we have too many commercials. We will address this as we smoke the Byron Mesolongis.</p>\n<p>We will have this and all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, E-Mail of the Week, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH. <a href='https://www.2guyscigars.com/'>https://www.2GuysCigars.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
