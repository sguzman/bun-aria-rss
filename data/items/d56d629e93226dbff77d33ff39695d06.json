  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, once again the American Marxist movement creates turmoil and shreds the constitution. This time it's the Supreme Court. Democrats have threatened the independence of the Court with court-packing and Sen. Chuck Schumer even threatened two justices. This draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked to the media for political purposes to distract from Biden's other failures. The legal reasoning for the case has always been on shaky ground and now five justices agree to correct it. If this decision goes through it would not stop abortions or stop funding for abortions. Overturning Roe v. Wade would only empower states to decide what happens regarding abortions and would have no effect on 100 million women because 100 million women don't support abortion. Then, science tells us that children in the womb feel pain and emotion. It's a child, not a choice. It's time to stop appeasing the radicals in America. If Democrats can't control an institution, they will seek to destroy the institution. Democrats despise the Constitution because it limits their ability to control the country. Afterward, US Senate candidate Herschel Walker joins the show to discuss his campaign to unseat Sen. Raphael Warnock. Walker added that the United States is the greatest country in the world but sadly our elected politicians seem to have forgotten that, citing the crime and drugs that are coming through the border.\n\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
