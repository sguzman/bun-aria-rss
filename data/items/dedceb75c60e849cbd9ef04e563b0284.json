    "media:description": "Erratum; this set is actually NOT fully compatible with the AEK, which uses rotated switches and extended key posts for the F keys. Thanks to poip032 for reminding me!\nGet them here: https://shop.tai-hao.com/categories/alps-keycaps\nMan, this turned out to be WAY more work than I thought it would be xD . \nToday we look at one of Tai-Hao's new Alps-mount keycap sets! Choices for Alps keycaps are quite limited, so these new (and expanded) sets are a very interesting new arrival!
