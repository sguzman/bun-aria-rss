  "description": "<p>This week we finish breaking down Fun Run. We start off with Jenna giving us the inside scoop on why we got so many big one hour episodes to start off Season 4, we get a Jenna and Angela BFF story for the books, and an amazing Fun Run wardrobe breakdown from wardrobe designer Carey Bennet. Then, we chat rabies quilts, answer everything you wanted to know about nipple chafing, and we get a 'fan soapbox' with an interesting take on who's responsible for the death of Sprinkles. Finally, Angela does a deep dive into how to properly carbo-load before a race and no, it’s not downing fettuccine Alfredo seconds before a race. On your marks, get set, go! Or hop into a cab.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Check out some amazing quilted art from Bisa Butler on instagram  @bisabutler </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you have questions for upcoming Office Ladies episodes, go to <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__officeladies.com_&d=DwMFaQ&c=aLv4kG3eFBuAUFgZFQ07JQ&r=tLr8qzvUqzBDOt-3tLBXNg&m=Ha2wbfCfP0fc_PfY4-zAjl_uoHzBHcj01eEFf4uc4Y8&s=uwX6ATuCQjbTPAquDov_OCgc4jMSLE1fHvkE6DLcTqE&e=\">officeladies.com</a> and file your questions there, or email <a href=\"mailto:officeladies@earwolf.com\">officeladies@earwolf.com</a> with the episode title in the subject line.</p>\n",
