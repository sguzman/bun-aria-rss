  "title": "FVA for general instruments",
  "description": "Computing the funding valuation adjustment (FVA) is hard, as it requires the numerical solution of generally non-linear partial differential equations. In this paper, Alexander Antonov, Marco Bianchetti and Ion Mihai develop a universal and efficient approach to numerical FVA calculation for portfolios of general instruments with multiple stochastic assets and funding sources",
