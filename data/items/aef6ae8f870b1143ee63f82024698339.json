  "description": "<p>Covington, Georgia is nicknamed Hollywood South due to the number of movies and television shows that have been filmed there. One location that not only hosts weddings and other events, but has also served as a set for films and TV shows is the Gaither Plantation. The house dates back to 1850 and there are two cemeteries on the property along with other historic buildings, one of which is an old church that was moved to the property. Several of the buildings, especially the main house, have paranormal activity. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Gaither Plantation! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Mike Rogers and features a coffin found in a golf course pond complete with skeleton and axe and This Month in History features Cherry Valley Massacre.</p> <p>Our sponsor for this episode is HelloFresh.
