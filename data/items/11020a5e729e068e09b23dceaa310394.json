  "title": "Big Week At Supreme Court On Immigration, First Amendment",
  "description": "It's a big week at the Supreme Court. On Monday, the justices declined to hear the Trump administration's appeal of a federal court ruling that blocked the president from ending DACA, at least for now. On Tuesday, they ruled that legal immigrants who are arrested for minor crimes do not have the right to bond hearings — meaning they can legally be detained long-term. The Court also heard arguments in one First Amendment case — about public sector unions — and is set to hear arguments in another, about restrictions on what voters can wear to the polls. This episode: host/congressional reporter Scott Detrow, political editor Domenico Montanaro and national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Email the show at nprpolitics@npr.org.
