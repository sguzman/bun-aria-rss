This meditation guides us in relaxing with the breath, including the breath in a body scan, and then allowing the breath to serve as an anchor when the mind gets lost in thoughts. As we settle with the breath as a home base, we find we can then open to the changing waves of experience with increasing balance, clarity and ease.</p> <p>Join Tara's email community at <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=vr6RcUWppXe40kS0wc62R_8qMz98MTU1OTcwMzIzNEAxNTU5NjE2ODM0&q=http%3A%2F%2Feepurl.com%2F6YfI&v=Q2OuTLK8kKE&event=video_description\"> http://eepurl.com/6YfI</a>, to receive exclusive updates, events, and meditations.<br /> - Get a free download of Tara’s new 10 min meditation: “Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease,\"<br /> - Plus a bonus gift: \"8 Essential Tips to Nourish Your Meditation Practice.\"</p>",
