Numbers of Newly Diagnosed COVID-19 Cases (Pink Data Points, Left Axis) and bike sharing rides (Blue Bars, Right Axis), New York City, March 1–April 3, 2020.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>New York City’s multitentacled bike sharing system was a major disseminator — if not the principal transmission vehicle — of coronavirus infection during the initial takeoff of the massive epidemic that became evident throughout the city during March 2020</strong>. The near shutoff of bike ridership in NYC — down by over 80 percent at the end of March — correlates strongly with the substantial increase in the doubling time of new cases in this the city.</p><p>Figure 1 simultaneously tracks the daily movements of two variables from March 1 though April 3, 2020. The pink-filled circles show the <strong>numbers of new coronavirus infections</strong> reported each day by <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page\">the New York City Department of Health</a>. For this variable, the vertical axis on the left is rendered on a logarithmic scale. That way, a straight-line trend would represent the exponential growth typically seen during the initial upsurge of an epidemic where everyone in the population is naïve to the infectious agent.</p><p>For the same variable of newly reported cases, the horizontal axis at the bottom ticks off the date that the coronavirus test was performed.</p><p>The second variable tracked in Figure 1 above represents the total <strong>numbers of bike sharing rides</strong> every day throughout New York City’s bike sharing stations. These counts are <a href=\"https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data\">reported each week by CitBike</a>. This variable is represented as sky-colored vertical bars, along the vertical axis on the right side of Figure 1. For this variable, the horizontal axis measures the dates on which riders used the bikes.</p><p>Figure 1 shows only the volume of rides from March 1 onward. Still, the counts shown during the first full week of the month — from Sunday March 1 through Saturday March 6 — are quite typical of the pattern for prior weeks. As decline in bike use accelerates markedly beginning on Monday March 16, the day that New York City Mayor de Blasio issued an order limiting gatherings and closing numerous places of congregation. By the third week overall, bikes usage is down 68 percent from the first week in March, and by the fourth week, it’s down 86 percent.</p><p>Simple comparison of the two trends in Figure 1 cannot by itself answer questions of causation. Still, <strong>the parallel between the continued high ridership on bikes and the rapid, exponential surge in infections during the first two weeks of March supports the hypothesis that the bikes played a role</strong>. While the subsequent plummeting of ridership appears likewise to parallel the flattening of the reported incidence curve, the steep fall in the heights of the blue bars may just as well represent the public’s response to widespread publicity about the ferocity of the outbreak that had been gathering storm for two weeks. As economists say, the precipitous drop in bike ridership may well have been <em>endogenous</em>. Even so, the temporal pattern in Figure 1 is compatible with the conclusion that <strong>the bike sharing system was the vehicle by which the public’s response was translated into reduced transmission of the virus</strong>.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=fd9760623111\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">"
