  "description": "Our guest today is interior designer Lilse McKenna. Before starting her own firm, she worked with designers Markham Roberts and Lindsey Coral Harper and drew inspiration from their styles. She has since had her work featured in House Beautiful, The Wallstreet Journal, Real Simple, and more. Her signature style is rooted in tradition yet layered with colors, textures, and patterns. We talk about how she uses layers, where she searches for killer fabrics, her best budget buys, and more!\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nWhy Lilse wants your interior to make you “think”.\n\nHow did Lilse get started?\n\nWhat does Lilse love about fabrics?\n\nTips for the pattern people and non-pattern people.\n\nWhat are Lilse’s rules for sconces, wall art… and mattress heights?\n\nWhat are Lilse’s thoughts on the “Grandmillennial” style?\n\nAre vertical line patterns in wallpaper a new trend?\n\nWhere does Lilse like to save vs. splurge on items?\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma\nHi Melissa,\nI like the Pinterest example you showed with the custom shower curtain that was especially long, hung close to the ceiling, and almost to the floor. You may have to custom make it, but I would get an ivory linen with a narrow contrast banding on all 4 sides that pulls from the colors of the wallpaper. This will make sort of a fabric wall and make it look less “bathroomy”. You could even have the shower curtain made with pinch pleats or grommets to make it look more like a curtain.\nGood luck! We are very invested in your shower curtain so show us after photos!\nMentioned in This Episode:\nLilse McKenna\nLilse McKenna on Instagram\nEtsy",
