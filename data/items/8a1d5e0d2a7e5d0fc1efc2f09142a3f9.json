  "description": "<p>This week we welcome lead singer of \"Lamb of God\" our friend Randy Blythe! We talk about everything from Indiana Jones movies to real-life encounters with Keanu Reeves, like when Vanessa recently talked to him for twenty minutes about his star turn in the Paula Abdul \"Rush Rush Video\" (uh oh are they best friends now?) plus Randy and Jonah try to teach Vanessa the difference between punk and metal, concert etiquette and much more. We also dive into the classic Old El Paso taco kit and how the seasoning still holds up today. And we get into the allure of Boboli and Digiorno pizza, which made you feel you were really making the real stuff/delivery! We also discuss classic family recipes like chicken tetrazzini, noodle kugel, and Jonah's ultimate favorite: orange juice (according to our Grandma). And we play another exciting game of \"Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan\" that covers texting at dinner, holding the door at post offices, and radio stations playing Christmas music around Thanksgiving. If you miss this episode you might get a visit from Krampus, and if you don't know who that is, you will learn from this episode- obvi it's a must-listen!</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
