Because, well: someone has to take care of the kids. In this episode, we dig into the economics of childcare, which are bad. Women either get pushed out of the workforce altogether, or have to take lower paying jobs to meet childcare needs. There are places, like Singapore, where childcare is cheap and plentiful, allowing women to stay in the workforce. It’s great for working women, but what about the women taking care of the kids?
