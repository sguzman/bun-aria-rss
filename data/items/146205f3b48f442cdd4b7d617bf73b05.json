  "description": "<p>Maybe you have kiddos that nap for hours on end, giving you time to balance numerous responsibilities. Or maybe, you go to battle everyday just to get 30 minutes of peace and quiet. Whatever your circumstances, Jesus understands what it's like to be needed, and he also understands laying it all down for the sake of those he loves. On today's episode, Emily and Laura discuss the common challenges of naptime and how to make the most of the situation. Because ultimately, all of our time belongs to the Lord, and no amount of peace and quiet will provide the lasting peace we crave. </p> <p>Like what you hear?

You'll also find more encouragement and truth on how to be an intentional mother that cares for and loves her children with eternity in mind.
