  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, do we as a country love our children? This is the most selfish generation and we are destroying their futures. This COVID ‘relief’ bill will lead to massive tax increases and other unintended consequences. This money they are giving away isn't free, it has consequences, this insane reckless spending isn’t necessary. Then, the General Accounting Office (GAO) has examined Trump's Operation Warp Speed and has determined that it was a remarkable success. The report confirms that Trump's administration ordered 800 million doses of the vaccine from various pharmaceutical companies. Going a step further the Trump administration secured partnerships with pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens to fast-track the distribution of the vaccine. The Biden Administration has done little-to-nothing of value regarding the vaccine. The truth is that the Trump Team saved millions of American lives. Later, Congressman Thomas Massie joins the show to discuss the left's latest assault on the Second Amendment. Massie also noted that the model used for Operation Warp Speed was successful and that it should be used for other products to combat the virus. Massie said that the amount of money spent in this bill should have afforded $85,000 per family and instead these families will be $85,000 in debt. Afterward, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy calls in and warns that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Biden and Congressional Democrats are putting up fences around the Capitol while trying to tear down the border wall. They are opening the border and shutting down schools.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
