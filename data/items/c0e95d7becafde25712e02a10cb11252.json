  "description": "<p>Big Jay Oakerson was my surprise opener for my shows in Toronto. This was the most amount of people I had ever played for in a night when I was headlining and Toronto has always been cool to me so I wanted to make it special. So I got a headliner to come open as a surprise treat to the city. We did a podcast about air travel on the way to the airport, in the plane, and at YYZ airport on the way home. Fun episode, funner weekend. And it's kind of like you were there with us. </p> <p> </p> <p>Don't forget to watch Big Jay's set on the Degenerates on Netflix. He's the first comic so just cue it up and press play and you'll see it.</p>",
