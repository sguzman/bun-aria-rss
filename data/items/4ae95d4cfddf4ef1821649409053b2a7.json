  "description": "<p>Andy writes “Beasts of the World is a seven-part series, which seeks to investigate the histories, evidence, and common theories surrounding the numerous cryptid creatures that have been reported around the globe.</p> <p>In Volume 1. – Hairy Humanoids, we examine the diverse collection of hairy, bipedal, man-like monsters that are believed to inhabit the world’s remote and lonely regions and ask the question – do they represent a single species, or, could there be other lesser-known varieties of Wildmen, yet to be revealed?</p> <p>This book seeks to classify some of these distinct kinds and proposes a separation (even when two or more ‘types’ or ‘species’, appear to be sharing a similar geographic area) based upon key physiological and behavioural differences. And so, we find that the Man-Ape – Bigfoot of the Pacific Northwest, is something quite different to the Wildman – Almasti, of the Caucuses Mountains; and that the Relict Ape – known as the Yeti, is more akin to the Florida Skunk Ape, than the Chinese Yeren…</p> <p>Are these mysterious monsters surviving Gigantopithecus, extant Neanderthals, undiscovered apes, hidden tribes, or simply folklore and fable, repackaged for the modern world?</p> <p>Join me, as I go in search of these Hairy Humanoids and the many yet to be discovered Beasts of the World.”</p> <p> </p> <p><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Beasts-World-Andy-McGrath/dp/1955471363\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out the book here</a></p>",
