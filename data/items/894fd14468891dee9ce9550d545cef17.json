  "description": "Today we speak to Carolyn Conley, Professor Emerita from the University of Alabama – Birmingham, about her new book Debauched, Desperate, Deranged: Women Who Killed, London 1674-1913 (Oxford UP, 2020). This book examines the over 1400 trials of women accused of homicide in London from 1674-1913, using trial records as well as newspaper, pamphlets and other media to analyse the changing image of the female killer. Conley is the author of The Unwritten Law: Criminal Justice in Victorian Kent (Oxford UP, 1991); Melancholy Accidents: The Meaning of Violence in Post-Famine Ireland (Lexington Books, 1999); and Certain Other Countries: Homicide and National Identity in England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, 1867- 92 (Ohio State University Press, 2007). This work, a sort of capstone for her career, traces the development of the criminal prosecution and punishment of women from the early modern era to the early twentieth century.\nJana Byars is the Academic Director of Netherlands: International Perspectives on Sexuality and Gender.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
