Only the arts and sciences can do that; and of these, only literature gives us the whole sweep and range of human imagination as it sees itself. It seems to be very difficult for many people to understand the reality and intensity of literary experience.</p> <cite>Northrop Frye</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Education is always an individual endeavor. In terms of a future renewal, much of it will depend on a commitment to individualism, something that has been much maligned in recent years. We hear so much trendy, tedious talk about how bad individualism is and how we need to think in terms of “the group.” The problem is that the group usually offers conformity, not genuine community.</p> <cite>Morris Berman</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>And yet, we are still being taught that fairy tales and myths are to be discarded as soon as we are old enough to understand “reality.” I received a disturbed and angry letter from a young mother who told me that a friend of hers with young children gave them only instructive books. She wasn’t going to allow their minds to be polluted with fairy tales. They were going to be taught the “real world.” This attitude is a victory for the powers of this world. A friend of mine, a fine storyteller, remarked to me, “Jesus was not a theologian. He was a God Who told stories.” Yes, God Who told stories.</p> <cite>Madeleine L’Engle</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>The general fate of sects is to obtain a high reputation for sanctity while they are oppressed, and to lose it as soon as they become powerful.</p> <cite>Thomas Macaulay</cite></blockquote> <h3>To Italy</h3> <p><em>by Percy Shelley</em></p> <pre class=\"wp-block-verse\"> As the sunrise to the night, As the north wind to the clouds, As the earthquake's fiery flight, Ruining mountain solitudes, Everlasting Italy, Be those hopes and fears on thee.</pre> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3uiLFTs\">The Enchanted April</a></em> by Elizabeth von Arnim</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3vxsAyR\">The Educated Imagination</a></em> by Northrop Frye</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3vXBkgt\">The Twilight of American Culture</a></em> by Morris Berman</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3F4x6b0\">Jayber Crow</a></em> by Wendell Berry</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ksyZVJ\">Walking on Water</a></em> by Madeleine L’Engle</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3LAFPV0\">A Wrinkle in Time</a></em> by Madeleine L’Engle</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3F4tFBb\">The History of England</a></em> by Thomas Macaulay</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3MLIviz\">Tea with the Dames</a> documentary</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KsrecQ\">Brideshead Revisited</a></em> by Evelyn Waugh</p> <h3>Support The Literary Life:</h3> <p>Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/theliterarylife/overview\">Patreon,</a> and get some amazing bonus content!
