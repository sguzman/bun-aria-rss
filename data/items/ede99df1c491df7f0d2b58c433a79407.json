  "description": "<p>What does it take to scale U.S. regional cannabis brands and do so profitably? Rena Sherbill talks to two regional cannabis brands, Aviv Hadar from Oregrown and Eric Ross and Ed Weidenfeld of District Cannabis and Phyto Management. One from the Pacific Northwest, in Oregon and one from the East Coast in Washington DC/Maryland. Their issues with MSOs, why one believes in vertical integration and the other doesn't. We also discuss why balance sheets are just as important as income statements, the mistaken emphasis on rapid growth over revenue or profit, the impact of 280E, and 'The Canada Scam'.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
