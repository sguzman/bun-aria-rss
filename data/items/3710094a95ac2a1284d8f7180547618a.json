  "title": "Episode 91: John Collins",
  "description": "For many NBA players, the ‘hoops' road to the NBA is often bracketed in a similar framework. Meaning, eyes were on them from a relatively early age, they were highly touted high school standouts from a strong program, and then expanded on that path in college and transitioned to the pros. But as we saw last week with Georges Niang, that’s not always the case. And that can certainly be said about John Collins, the guest on today’s OM3. Raised in a military family, Collins moved plenty growing up and although a basketball was always in his hands, he flew a bit under the radar. That is, until he got to Wake Forest and his game exploded. John breaks down his journey to the league in this honest and down to earth interview, and also touches on several other topics, including his recent posterizing dunk on Niang, what it actually feels like to be that high in the air, the present Covid situation in the NBA, and much more. \nEditor's note: There will be no OM3 pod next week for the holiday break. JJ, Tommy and everyone at ThreeFourTwo productions and Cadence13 wish all of you a joyous and healthy holiday season and a safe and happy new year.
