  "description": "<p>Wade will be my guest tonight. Wade writes \"The childhood experiences with my 5 sisters and 1 brother all older have being horrifying to all of us when we lived in Rainier Oregon. Dad was a pipe fitter and worked on a new nuke plant there. Mom was a stepford wife so to speak. Not long after we moved there odd things happened..no one could explain..starting with the 3 other houses that no one came out at night.</p> <p>Animals disappeared and or twisted and put in trees. Lots of foot prints. The lumberjacks dad hired kept leaving. The well drillers pulled off twice. And then it got way worse. Bangs on the house, broken windows. We think there were 5 for sure....they all looked different and had NO fear of us. This was over a 3 year span. It had a life long no BS effect on the family. I talked to my older family about Rainer and it was way worse than could 10 year old to grasp. I went back there 2 years ago. It continues to this that day. It's hard to piece together so so many things over the years. There were a hell of a lot of stuff people knew back then. And we were warned by the very old couple dad bought the land from.\"</p>",
