  "description": "<p>On the evening of January 12, 2018, 15-year-old Michael Dillard disappeared from his home in Calvin, West Virginia.&nbsp;He was helping his mom carry in bags of wood pellets from the car when he ran behind the house. His mom didn’t think much of it at first but when she finished carrying the rest of the bags in and couldn’t find Michael, she became concerned.&nbsp;She called family for help and then alerted the authorities. The weather quickly turned that evening as a storm rolled into the area, first bringing rain and then snow. That storm made searching for Michael very difficult that night. Many searches were conducted in the weeks and months that followed Michael’s disappearance but the only item that was ever found was a jacket.&nbsp;Since Michael went missing during the harsh winter months, they were hopeful that the spring thaw would yield some clues but Michael’s disappearance is still just as a much of a mystery as it was that stormy January night.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Michael Dillard, you can call 1-800-THE-LOST. You can also contact the West Virginia State Police at 304-872-0800.&nbsp;To contact the private investigator, John Bonazzo, please 304-415-8920. He is offering a $3,000 dollar reward.
