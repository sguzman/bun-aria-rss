Traumas and toxic beliefs are scary to unpack but when you do, you give yourself the freedom and opportunity for dynamic growth. In this episode, Dr. Hyman is joined by Dr. Joe Dispenza, Dr. Daniel Amen, Byron Katie, Dr. Rangan Chatterjee, and Lauren Zander. They explore how focusing on your emotional health as much as your physical health will have big payoffs for your wellness and happiness throughout life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since 2010, Dr. Joe Dispenza has partnered with scientists and universities to perform extensive research on the effects that meditation has on the brain and body. During his advanced retreats around the world, his team has gathered more than 8,000 brain scans and 4,000 heart-rate variability measurements in an attempt to correlate the effects that sustained elevated emotions and self-regulation have on heart and brain function, immune response, and overall mind-body health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Washington Post</em> called Dr. Daniel Amen the most popular psychiatrist in America and <em>Discover Magazine</em> listed his brain imaging research as the top neuroscience story for 2015. He is a double board-certified psychiatrist and ten-time <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Byron Katie's simple yet powerful process of self-inquiry, which she calls The Work, consists of four questions and the turnaround, which is a way of experiencing the opposite of what you believe.
