  "description": "Another TV season is over. You might not have noticed its end, thanks to the way TV never goes away any more, but technically, the TV season wraps at the end of May.\n\nSo it seemed like a good time to get some of the best TV showrunners together and ask them how they create great standout TV, when there's way too much of it. Salim Akil of Black Lightning (CW), Aline Brosh McKenna of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend' (CW) and Tanya Saracho of Vida (Starz) join Todd for a lively discussion about this era in TV.\n\nTopics include producing good TV on a budget, telling stories about communities traditionally underrepresented in fiction, and finding a way to stand out amid all that clutter. If you're a TV fan, or just curious about what it means to work in television when there are nearly 500 scripted series, you'll love this discussion.\n      \n      \n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
