We talk essential oils, whiskey and on occassion cars. Nic's family has a storied background in racing and he shares the story of how that turned into a coffee company.  As usual we cover Porsches and Jony shares his experience in the 991.2 GT3 along with his undyring love for Mercedes G-Wagons. Despite none of us having even sat in the new Ford GT we all speculate on Ford's new halo car. In addition we drop a little rumor on the new twin turbo Lexus V8.</p>\n",
