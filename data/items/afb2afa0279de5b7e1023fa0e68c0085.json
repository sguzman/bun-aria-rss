Instead of using my platform to blast my own opinions, I decided to use my little Creative Pep Talk megaphone to amplify someone else’s voice.\n\nIn this episode, I chat with co-loop artist Adé Hogue about how he’s feeling as a black artist in these trying times, and we also talk shop about his creative practice as well.\n\nThis was a deeply moving conversation and I’m super grateful to Adé for making the time last minute, but creatively, it was super inspiring as well. Adé has so many insights and perspectives that inspire me and I know all around, you’re going to get a ton from this guy’s thoughts and heart!",
