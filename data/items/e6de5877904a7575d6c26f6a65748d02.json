OP's friend sends over this long, unusual contract that spells out all the things he has to do in order to qualify for being a godfather. For example, he has to work as a free, unpaid babysitter for the child for 18 years. He also has to give the baby $25,000 for education, and even more money over the following 18 years. Why would you give someone money to become an unpaid babysitter-slave for life?</p>\n",
