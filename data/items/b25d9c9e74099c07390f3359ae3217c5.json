  "description": "<p><p>A Wild Wild Card Weekend. We start with the fastest 2 minutes (2:27 - 6:20). The Bills Texans game was absolutely insane and Josh Allen was equal parts electric and crazy (6:20 - 21:19). The Patriots lose and people are asking if this is the end (21:19 - 43:17). Saints lose a shocker and Kirk Cousins gets his signature win (43:17 - 53:46). Jadaveon Clowney cheap shots Carson Wentz and Russ Wilson keeps the Seahawks season alive (53:46 -61:02). Who's back of the week including documentaries and a review of \"Dont Fuck With Cats\" coming Wednesday (61:02 - 70:57). We call Kyle Long who retired on Sunday night to find out what a freshly retired Football Player thinks . Jason Garrett is finally fired, we think. And Hank does Soggy Sorrows for the Patriots loss (83:40).Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
