Burns joins to talk about his very interesting life, his career, some crazy stories and more. The boys also hear from Kevin Connolly, from the hit series Entourage. Kevin is a die-hard Islanders fan so the boys get his take on the upcoming John Tavares return game. The fellas also go around the league and touch on some league news while also finding a way to mix in the question “how much would it cost for you to eat feces”.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
