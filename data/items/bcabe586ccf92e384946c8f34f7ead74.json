  "description": "The Greek translations of the Hebrew Bible, compiled over several centuries in circumstances that are largely unknown, are collectively identified as the Septuagint. In recent years, the study of what is sometimes known as “Old Testament Greek” has developed some very important new lexical and other interpretive tools. But many Bible readers, who recognise that New Testament documents refer to and quote from Septuagint texts, have struggled to access them. With apparatus prepared by Gregory R. Lanier and William Ross, who teach Old and New testament at the Reformed Theological Seminary campuses in Orlando, FL, and Charlotte, NC, Septuaginta: A Reader's Edition (Hendrickson Publishers, 2018) unlocks that complex text, and opens up its transmission, to enable readers with a basic grasp of Hellenistic Greek to tackle one of the most important sets of documents in that language.\nCrawford Gribben is a professor of history at Queen’s University Belfast. His research interests focus on the history of puritanism and evangelicalism, and he is the author most recently of John Owen and English Puritanism (Oxford University Press, 2016).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
