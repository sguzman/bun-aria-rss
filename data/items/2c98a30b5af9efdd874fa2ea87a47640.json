  "description": "<div>Sam Leith's guest in this week’s Book Club podcast is Frances Wilson, whose new book <em>Burning Man: The Ascent of D H Lawrence</em> sets out to take a fresh look at a now unfashionable figure. Frances tells him why we’re looking in the wrong places for Lawrence’s greatness, explains why the supposed prophet of sexual liberation wasn’t really interested in sex at all - and reveals that after his death Lawrence may have been eaten by his admirers.</div>\n",
