  "description": "<p>In the 1960s, Gerald Foos bought a motel in Colorado, furnished the rooms with louvered vents that allowed him to spy on his guests, and kept a journal of their sexual encounters and more (including maybe a murder?). Over the course of 30 years, celebrated writer Gay Talese coxes Geraldâ€™s story out of him and finally convinces Gerald to let him publish it. But when the story gets out, questions are raised and nothing is as it seems. </p>\n",
