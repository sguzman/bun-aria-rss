  "description": "\"Karen\" is not just a name. It's also a persona, an attitude, a label for a certain type of white woman determined to get what she wants—especially at the expense of Black people. Karens are part of a long lineage going back at least a couple centuries. This week we share an episode from <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510312/codeswitch\">Code Switch</a> about the origins of \"Karen\" as an archetype, who her ancestors were, and why such a label even exists.",
