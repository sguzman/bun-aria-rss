  "description": "In 1986, a 31 year old Texan woman was brutally murdered in her bed while home alone with her 3 year old son. Police immediately began to suspect her husband who had written her an angry note before leaving for work that morning. After weeks of questioning him and interrogating their loved ones, he was arrested for her murder. But years later, his attorney motioned to get the DNA tested since technology was better because he truly believed in his wife’s innocence. Once tested, the results were mixed. So, did this man kill his wife? Or was an innocent man put away for life? This is the murder of Christine Morton and the story of Michael Morton.\n\n_________\n\nAudible is the leading provider of audiobooks and audio entertainment so you can listen to audiobooks, memoirs, the news, podcasts, theatrical performances, and plenty of other awesome content from your smartphone or tablet.
