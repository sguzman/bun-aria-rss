  "description": "In Streetwalking: LGBTQ Lives and Protest in the Dominican Republic (Rutgers University Press, 2020), Dr. Ana-Maurine Lara examines the dominant modes of power that seek to suppress LGBTQ lives and identities as well as the ways in which these communities and individuals push back. Lara details how Catholicism and Christianity attempt to delegitimize LGBTQ lives through an insistence on gender binaries and heteronormativity through power it yields in political and domestic life. LGBTQ people and groups enact Streetwalking , which Lara theorizes as the actions of LGBTQ people, such as walking in the street or hanging out in public, as a means to disrupt the Christian colonial gender and sexual order. Streetwalking includes different practices of resistance such as confratación, flipping the script, and cuentos, which people deploy to transform silence into power. Lara walks us through the strategies and tactics LGBTQ people employ to both assert their power and insist on their right to exist.\nAna-Maurine Lara is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies at the University of Oregon.\nReighan Gillam is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Southern California.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
