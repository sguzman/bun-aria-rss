Joining the show today, and every Tuesday for the rest of the NFL season is Super Bowl Champion, Super Bowl MVP, 2x MVP, 8x Pro Bowler, Pat's best friend, Quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat and Aaron chat about how things have been going in Green Bay so far in training camp, why his arm feels more fresh that it has in 16 years, who's impressed him so far in camp, how different he thinks of the level of play will be this weekend, playing with no fans, and how excited he is for this season (10:01-31:07). Later is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ are joined by 3x Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, and member of the Denver Broncos 50th anniversary team, Mark \"Stink\" Schlereth to discuss Von Miller having a devastating ankle injury and how much that alters the Broncos this year, his thoughts on Seattle and Atlanta, whose game he will be calling this Sunday, and how he spent a good portion of quarantine watching tape (32:48-46:38).
