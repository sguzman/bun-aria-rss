    "media:description": "The Ford Raptor R has a new supercharged V8 engine with 700 horsepower.\nRAM TRX vs Ford Raptor - https://youtu.be/mUUHoQWpxVc\nSubscribe to Engineering Explained for more videos! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7\nRecommended Books & Car Products - http://amzn.to/2BrekJm\nEE Shirts! - http://bit.ly/2BHsiuo\n\nThe Ford Raptor R features a 5.2L supercharged V8 producing 700 horsepower and 640 lb-ft of torque. The engine is derived from the Shelby GT500's 5.2L engine, which is based on the same overall architecture as the GT350's 5.2L engine, though the similarities are quite subtle. \n\nThis video serves as a deep dive on the new 5.2L engine; from the intake, to the supercharger, to the cylinders and block, to the exhaust, and the strategies used throughout. Does the Raptor R have what it takes to reclaim top dog against the Ram TRX?
