  "description": "<p>You should consider investing in real estate! If your personal finances are in a solid position and you’ve already taken advantage of the tax advantaged accounts that are available to you, we believe that it could make a ton of sense for you to become a real estate investor. There are many great benefits from owning long term rentals like experiencing a higher return on your investment, monthly cashflow, tax benefits, and others that we’ll get to during this episode. But just because we’ve found investing in real estate to be a boon in our lives doesn’t mean that you should automatically go out and purchase your first rental. There are a number of different factors that you need to consider, before you start making offers! We tackle some of the common excuses that some folks give for why they don’t want to invest in real estate, in order to help you decide if real estate investing is right for you.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed Corn Grisette by Cruz Blanca Brewery- thanks to Dennis and our friends at the brewery for donating this one to the podcast!
