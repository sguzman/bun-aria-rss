  "description": "With America's foreign policy savant, our president leaving the country this week it's easy to understand the fireworks and celebrations last week.  Now we get to share him with the rest of the world--including our NATO allies, the keepers of our special relationship with England, the patrons of a Trump resort in Scotland (ancestral home of his immigrant mother) and then with the main man in his life, Vladimir Putin.  Like US and UK politics at the moment, we can expect it all to be in the language of our own Ed Luce, shambolic, but who knows?  It may even be worse than that!  Ed, Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and host David Rothkopf discuss all that...while educating Ed about Moose and Squirrel.
