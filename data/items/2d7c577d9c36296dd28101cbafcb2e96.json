  "description": "<p>It's always amazing when four sisters can get together, each in their own little box on a screen, and just go deep. And that's what Las Culturistas Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang do with StraightioLab's George Civeris and Sam Taggart. The boys talk how much they love dick, and update each other on what's going on with their buttholes. Also, James Gandolfini as a sexual entity, insane sweeps episodes of Grey's Anatomy and Desperate Housewives, having crushes on friends, and how Charlie Puth made the boys a little horny there for a second! Paws Up For Puth! Slather on some ball toner and enjoy this episode of a podcast that was made for the love of podcasting.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
