    "media:description": "A look at what phonemes are, and how to count them in a language, with a specific look at Standard Chinese. A sequel to my video \"Chinese Doesn't Have Many Syllables\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMI6Mbx8lbw\n\nSORRY! The stress in French goes on the second syllable. I literally speak French (ish) I don't know how I would mess that up.\n\nThis video gets very technical somewhere around the halfway mark, so don't worry if you don't get all of it.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: there are many, MANY more ways to analyse Standard Chinese phonemes. I'm not saying that these are the only three analyses, nor that they are the three most common, nor that they are the three best. Many of the features presented can be swapped around and pieced together to make new analyses (eg. getting rid of the zero-onset phoneme but not fusing the palatal/retroflex series). This is only meant to be an exercise and some thoughts about phonemic analysis.\n\nSources:\n\nChao, Yuen Ren. 1968. A Grammar of Spoken Chinese.
