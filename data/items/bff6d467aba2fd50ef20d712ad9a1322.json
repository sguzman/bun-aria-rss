  "description": "<p>Maybe you just moved to a new city for a job opportunity you’ve been waiting years for... but find that struggling in the whole <em>making friends</em> department. Creating like-minded community with a busy schedule, as a grown up, and in a new place or new season is HARD. Or maybe you’re a small business owner or work from home and tend to feel a little isolated, like you’re on an island and your friends don’t quite understand “what you do.” Networking with others in your industry and connecting with people who GET YOU can be equally as hard.    So, in this episode, Jordan unpacks several lessons she’s learned when it comes effectively cultivating friendships and a few key steps you can implement right away to start building new relationships effortlessly (instead of awkwardly).    Grab a copy of <em>Own Your Everyday</em> <a href=\"Jordanleedooley.com/book\">here</a>!   Thank you to our sponsors:    <a href=\"Grove.co/SHE\">Grove Collaborative</a>   <a href=\"modsy.com\">Modsy</a>: Use code \"SHE\" for 20% off</p>\n",
