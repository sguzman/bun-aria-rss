  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Rep. John Ratcliffe was great in Congress and in the DOJ and is a great pick for director of national intelligence. But Democrats, RINO's and the media are out to destroy him because he defends President Trump. This smear campaign must be stopped. Also, the truth is that the racist narrative against Trump is to slow down the gains he  has made with African Americans.  The truth is that the Democrats cannot win if they don't monopolize votes from African American voters. But, now all bets are off and Chairman Elijah Cummings has now subpoenaed Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump for their financial records during their time on staff at the White House. This charade is not for the sake of governing but for the sake of getting soundbites while they try to destroy Trump's presidency. Then, the Media Research Center reports that executives from NBC News' parent company (Comcast) donated to Kamala Harris' campaign prior to the last debate which was hosted by none other than NBC News. The media is pushing the agenda, public opinion, and these polls. We are no longer dealing with fact-based news or straight reporting, that has been replaced by social activism \"journalism.\" This same media knows very well that Trump attacked one white man after another in his own debates while running for president. Trump, however,  pushes back, he's not a country club Republican, he owns the country club. Yet, the left has devoured, our schools, Hollywood, and the press as well and Trump is their main obstacle stopping them from radically changing our Constitutional system.  They will do anything to define who he is in the media, putting words in his mouth to either impeach or indict this President.  \nLearn more about your ad choices.
