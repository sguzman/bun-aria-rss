  "description": "With the new year comes a new attitude: Glenn argues it’s time to fight like the Left did four years ago, but with a much different playbook. Stu goes over the polls ahead of Georgia’s Senate runoffs. “Wonder Woman 1984” was terrible, a Harvard professor claims aliens exist, and we can teleport quantum data now. Glenn is all for the Left’s secession — they’re the ones who abandoned the Constitution. Glenn spoke to President Trump over the holidays, and he’s not conceding. Rep. Chris Stewart joins to discuss challenging the Electoral College results and why an audit of the presidential election is crucial. Election fraud in Georgia is far from disproven. Can we trust the Georgia Senate results? Glenn hears from Georgia voters.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
