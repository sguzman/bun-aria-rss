In this episode, I sit down with intuitive Natalie Miles to discuss how the unresolved trauma from our ancestral lineage shows up in our lives, how to become aware of it and bring about healing. We dive into what to do if you have shame around your ancestors, don’t know them or are angry about what happened to them.
