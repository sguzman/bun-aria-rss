  "description": "Crypto billionaire Brock Pierce says that Bitcoin will either fail spectacularly or become massively successful.\n\n“[Bitcoin] could go to zero. It’s a binary outcome. It’s either going to go to $1 million a Bitcoin or zero. It’s going to be one or the other, which is why you shouldn’t put everything there.”\n\n“This reminds me a lot of 1999, right? We are in that phase. And what came out of that? eBay and Amazon and all sorts of interesting businesses came out of the Dot-Com sort of 1.0 era. And a bunch of it went to zero. And I think that will probably be true of what we see here.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the innovation isn’t real and it’s not going to play an important role in our collective future.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
