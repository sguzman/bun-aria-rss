  "description": "This episode is going to be a little different than usual – no interviews, no chats with our staff about tips and tricks. Today, we want to focus solely on the coronavirus and what we can all do to help each other and keep ourselves safe. It’s crazy times right now – there are constant updates on the news, new precautions to take, new closures around the city, and many of us are having to change our whole lives and routines to deal with the changes. There's so much fear and uncertainty around the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation. And we’re all trying to deal with it in different ways. On today’s show, we’ll be sharing how to help your local quilt shop and small business owners during this time, how to de-stress and gain back control using sewing, and if you’re one of the lucky parents or grandparents who are watching kids during this extended spring break, we have tips for squeezing in more time to sew when your whole family is under quarantine.\n\nFor more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here.\nTake our podcast survey here.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
