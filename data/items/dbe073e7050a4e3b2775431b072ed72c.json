  "title": "China’s Congress: an inflection point?",
  "description": "The 20th Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which kicked off on Sunday, promises to be one of the most significant events for China in modern history, not only because President Xi Jinping is widely expected to secure an unprecedented third term, but also because it comes amid the country’s slowest pace of growth in decades. So, whether the Congress marks an inflection point for economic policy is Top of Mind. In the latest episode of Exchanges at Goldman Sachs, Susan Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at UC San Diego, David Li, professor at Tsinghua University, and Hui Shan, Goldman Sachs Research’ chief China economist, discuss what to watch for that could presage a policy inflection, what that inflection may look like, and what it could mean for growth. This episode is based on GIR’s Allison Nathan’s latest Top of Mind report.",
