He did his first commercial at the age of 4 and has gone on to appear on some popular TV shows that have filmed in his hometown of Vancouver in Canada. He first appeared in a Hallmark Christmas movie at the age of 9 and went on to film Lost Ollie later that year working with puppets, actors, vocal artists and the director of one of his favorite shows, Into the Spiderverse.
