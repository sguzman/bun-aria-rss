  "description": "Every feel like you're living inside a washing machine in the middle of the spin cycle?  We hope it's not because you have a Tide pod in your mouth.

But for now, the best we can do is help you manage it by talking about the very latest news including the Twitter-firing of Rex Tillerson and everything it triggered with a great group of experts including Ambassador Nicholas Burns of Harvard, Kori Schake of the IISS, Evelyn Farkas of the Atlantic Council and Ed Luce of the Financial Times.
