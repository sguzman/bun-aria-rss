    "media:description": "This video is sponsored by SEGA (who also provided code for the DLC), although their PR had zero input on the contents of the video, nor any influence on the opinions contained within. They just wanted me to check out the Kaito Files DLC and make a standard video about it, with me retaining 100% creative control over the end product. \n\n---\n\nThe original Judgment was my game of the year in 2019, but with its standalone nature largely solving the internal struggle of its protagonist Yagami, I felt like last year's Lost Judgment was left searching for that human anchor to ground the wild events of its plot. Well, after playing through the recently released Kaito Files DLC and becoming utterly engrossed with it, it's clear that the answer was staring us in the face all alongâ€”the titular Masaharu Kaito. In this analysis, let's talk about the hidden depths of this burly ex-yakuza's character, and why he may have been the series' biggest strength all along. \n\n---\n\nSupport the show on Patreon - http://patreon.com/writingongames\n\nPodcast - http://anchor.fm/writingongamescast\n\nSecond Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1xxfS_HILi09yaELQdmV1A\n\n---\n\n#sponsored #lostjudgment #kaitofiles #yakuza #sega",
