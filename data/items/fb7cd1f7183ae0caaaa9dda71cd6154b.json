  "description": "<p>I have been posting John’s videos to the website every chance I get.</p> <p>John writes “As a wildlife biologist, I have been studying the sasquatch (or bigfoot) for just over 50 years. For the past 25 years, the main subject of my wildlife research has been the scrutiny of evidence which appears to affirm the sasquatch as an existing mammal. During this period, I found this evidence to be not only compelling, but eventually conclusive in supporting the sasquatch as an existing North American mammal.”</p> <p>Be sure to subscribe to his YouTube channel. <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdUsSJgC8-0I1dIliI4yAJA\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to check it out.</a></p> <p>John A. Bindernagel is a wildlife biologist who has sought evidence for Bigfoot since 1963. He published a book in 1998 entitled <a href=\"http://sasquatchbiologist.org/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">North America’s Great Ape: the Sasquatch.</a></p> <p>Dr. Bindernagel grew up in Ontario, attended the University of Guelph,and received a PhD in Biology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He moved to British Columbia in 1975 largely because the region was a hot spot for Bigfoot sightings. Over the years, he has collected casts of tracks that he believes belongs to Bigfoot. He also claims to have heard the creature near Comox Lake in 1992, comparing its whooping sound to that of a chimpanzee. Dr. Bindernagel believes that the Bigfoot phenomena should receive more attention from serious scientists, but has remarked, “The evidence doesn’t get scrutinized objectively. We can’t bring the evidence to our colleagues because it’s perceived as tabloid.”</p> <p>Check out John’s website: <a href= \"http://sasquatchbiologist.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">http://sasquatchbiologist.org/</a></p>",
