  "description": "<p>Devin Finzer, founder & CEO of OpenSea, returns to Bankless to discuss the NFT boom and the role of OpenSea at the center of it all. From Devin's perspective, the energy surrounding NFTs right now is crypto native. This means that this boom starts at the center of crypto culture and extends outwards from there.</p> <p>We also discuss scaling and gas fees, the spectrum of centralization, the metaverse, and the OpenSea's recent front-running scandal. Building with an open mind and conviction is a key reason why OpenSea finds itself at the center of the NFT markets today, and it looks like we may just be getting started.</p> <p>✨EXCLUSIVE EPISODE DEBRIEF✨<br /> <a href= \"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/exclusive-debrief-opensea-and-the\">https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/exclusive-debrief-opensea-and-the</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 📣 ZERION | Your Gateway to the Metaverse!<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Zerion\">https://bankless.cc/Zerion</a> <br />  ------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>💰 GEMINI | FIAT & CRYPTO EXCHANGE<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/go-gemini%E2%80%8B\">https://bankless.cc/go-gemini​</a> </p> <p>💧LIDO | DECENTRALIZED STAKING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Matcha\">https://bankless.cc/Matcha</a> </p> <p>👻 AAVE | LEND & BORROW ASSETS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/aave\">https://bankless.cc/aave</a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 4:00 Devin Finzer<br /> 6:05 The Crypto Native NFT Boom<br /> 9:15 Building With an Open Mind<br /> 11:36 OpenSea at the Center<br /> 18:06 Scaling Under Pressure<br /> 22:24 Gas Fees<br /> 25:01 Social Media & Users<br /> 32:00 Before OpenSea & The Bear<br /> 39:50 When NFTs Heated Up<br /> 41:45 The Front Running Scandal<br /> 48:21 The Centralization Spectrum<br /> 55:31 What’s the Metaverse?<br /> 58:24 Rapid Fire Questions<br /> 1:01:43 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Devin on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/dfinzer?s=20\">https://twitter.com/dfinzer?s=20</a> <br />  OpenSea:<br /> <a href=\"https://opensea.io/\">https://opensea.io/</a> <br /> NFT Bull Market Episode:<br /> <a href= \"https://youtu.be/cmLJHlNlH1s\">https://youtu.be/cmLJHlNlH1s</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
