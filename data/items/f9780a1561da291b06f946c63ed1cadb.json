  "description": "Greg Jenner is joined by the brilliant comedian Tim Minchin and Palaeolithic archaeologist Dr Becky Wragg Sykes as they take us way back in time to visit the mysterious world of Neanderthals. Just who were the Neanderthals? Were they the squat caveman archetypes we’ve come to know in pop culture? Did they really shout “Ug” at the moon? Or have we misunderstood them entirely? Join the team as we discover there is so much more to those handsome, hench beings that walked the Earth before us.",
