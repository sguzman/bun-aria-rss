  "description": "<p>April 21, 1998. Onondaga County, New York. Recently separated but still living in the same home, Jeff and Jill Cahill got into an argument. Jill attempted to walk away, but her husband wasn't going to let her do that. Using a baseball bat he struck his wife multiple times in the head. He then called his mother. While his family spoke with him at the house, Jill was bleeding and near death. It wasn't until after a doctor, a friend of Jeff's family, showed up and demanded that they call for help that an ambulance was requested. Jill was rushed to a hospital and would survive, but she was looking at a long rehabilitation due to her injuries. Jeff was treated elsewhere for minor injuries and then arrested. But he was far from done. What he did next was both appalling and shocking.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
