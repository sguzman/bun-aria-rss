  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including what halo effect may be created by Tiger Woods's win at the Masters. His return to championship form generated a bevy of media buzz around not only Woods but his sponsors and the sport of golf, which must find a way to capitalize on the 15-time major winner's resurgence. Also discussed is Zion Williamson's unsurprising decision to leave Duke after his freshman season and enter the NBA Draft.  Williamson is among the most heralded freshmen to ever enter the draft, and the possibility exists that he'll wind up with the Knicks in the No. 1 media market. Also discussed is Russell Wilson's new contract with the Seattle Seahawks. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams</p><p>Producer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
