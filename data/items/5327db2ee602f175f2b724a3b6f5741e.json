I'm teaching my process to build Ironclad Discipline in a new workshop - you can register at discipline.impacttheory.com!<br /><br />On today's Episode: <br /><br />When you are unhappy, you may find yourself constantly seeking approval from others, scared to take risks, and hyper focused on the things you don’t have or lack in life.

A Lot of us don’t know what life we’re wanting to live. A lot of us are living unintentional lives where we’re essentially asleep.” [4:30]<br /><br />“Us not acting in alignment with who we really are is a huge stress on the body.” [9:04]<br /><br />“Your dreams won’t make you happy, [...] unless you’re intentional about them.” [11:43]<br /><br />“You can be happier than you currently are, [...] I think you can have success and happiness. I don’t think you have to choose between the two.” [24:02]<br /><br />“Even if you’re consuming killer, uplifting, inspirational content all the time, even that’s problematic. You have to be able to sit with your own thoughts.” [32:23]<br /><br />‘We’re so disconnected from our bodies and our innermost thoughts, we’re so up here in our head, moving forward, learning new things, consuming more and more and more that actually, we’re not listening to the signals that our body is sending us.” [36:58]<br /><br />“We see the world through the state of our nervous system.” [39:49]<br /><br />“Every single behavior in our life serves a role, it’s there for a reason, and often we try to change the behavior without understanding what role it plays in our life.” [58:17]<br /><br />“Happiness, mental well being, the way you think about the world, [...] is more important than your lifestyle because many of our lifestyle behaviors or lifestyle choices are downstream consequences from the way that we see the world.” [1:04:20]<br /><br />Follow Rangan Chatterjee: <br />Website: <a href=\"https://drchatterjee.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://drchatterjee.com/</a> <br />YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDnwlb3IQDPJtFysPUJbDFQ/videos\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDnwlb3IQDPJtFysPUJbDFQ/videos</a> <br />Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drchatterjeeuk\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/drchatterjeeuk</a> <br />Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drchatterjee/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/drchatterjee/</a>  <br />Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DrChatterjee/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/DrChatterjee/</a> <br />Podcast: <a href=\"https://drchatterjee.com/blog/category/podcast/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://drchatterjee.com/blog/category/podcast/</a>",
