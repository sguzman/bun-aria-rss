  "description": "This week on The Fred Minnick Show, veteran spirits professional Jackie Summers, owner of Sorel liqueur, brings his talents to the show. He and I go back a decade or so, and I've watched him grow into an industry leader. But I do not think he's ever gotten enough credit for his palate. Today, he shows off his affection for rye and lasers in on a mutual favorite--hint.
