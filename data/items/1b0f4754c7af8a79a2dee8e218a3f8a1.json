  "description": "<p>We are joined by Remi Bader to talk about her and Dave's friendship, her rise during lockdown, her evolution into fashion, the incident at the horse ranch, meeting Lizzo, and finish with a game of \"Who Wore It Better\".\n\nWe then get into headlines of Noah Beck not showing up to Dixie D'Amelio's 21st birthday, Jennette McCurdy's book \"I'm Glad My Mom Died\" where she talks about former Nickelodeon execs, Monty Lopez (still) going at it with Yung Gravy, a new documentary series about Armie Hammer, Cardi B exposing Bella Poarch, and Drake dissing his dad's tattoo of him.\n\nWe finish up with BFFs corner to find out whether or not Josh is really going to make a Still Softish 2 with Bryce and Landon and watch something that made everyone more uncomfortable than anything we have ever watched on the pod before. \n\n\nSupport our sponsors!\n\nBeis: Go to https://barstool.link/BeisBFF for 15% off your first purchase\n\nBetterhelp: Go to BetterHelp.com/BFF for 10% off your first month\n\nWhatnot: Download the Whatnot App today.
