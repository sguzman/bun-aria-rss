  "description": "<p>A listener writes, “I was hiking up this trail with a couple of friends. I had a hiking pack on my back and my friends had gotten ahead of me on the trail so I decided to take a break, drink some water and then catch up with my friends.</p> <p>I heard some movement in the bushes below me and I did not really think much of it. I unsnapped my hiking pack from around my waist. I heard it rush towards me and as I started to turn to look at what I assumed was a bear…the next thing I know, I’m in the air and hitting a tree….I am now on my belly. I was confused and when I lifted my head up, all I saw was hairy legs and huge feet. This thing was standing over me and than it screamed/roared at me. I thought I was going to die. I tried to look up at it and it screamed/roared at me again.I noticed the creature was breathing heavy and rocking from side to side. I heard the bushes below me rustle and the creature was focused on the noise….that’s when I looked up and saw it’s face….I….I am not sure what these things are but it was strange... I never thought Sasquatch was real, I always put it in the same category as leprechauns and unicorns. A lot changed that day….”</p>",
