  "description": "<p>This has to be my favorite manifestation episode to date because we really explored the topics, it’s nuances and misconceptions with one of my best friends + Manifesting Through Meditation author Cassandra Bodzak. In this, she breaks down her four steps towards manifesting and gives us clarity on the many hidden blocks people have that are keeping them from manifesting their highest reality. We talk about time being an illusion, the importance of action and clearing limiting beliefs.
