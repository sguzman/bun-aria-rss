  "title": "288 - Doctor Death: Jack Kevorkian and the Right to Die Debate",
  "description": "<p>Death! How comfortable are you thinking about it? Talking about? What rights should be afforded to you when it's your time to <i>\"meet your maker?\"</i>  Jack Kevorkian thought you,  under certain conditions, should be able to have a physician help you peacefully release yourself from a life of unbearable, incurable pain. Do you agree? Or do you think everyone needs to soldier on, no matter what they're suffering from, until the bitter end? There are a lot of people on each side of the right to die debate. We explore both sides, and also look into the history of how we humans have faced death, in addition to the history of Dr. Death - Jack Kevorkian. No one did more in the 20th century to get America thinking and talking about death. Should living in the land of the free include having the freedom to terminate your time on Earth in a way of your choosing that could include having your doctor give you one last, very final injection?  I learned a lot this week. Hope you do to! <br /><br />The Bad Magic Charity of the month is New Orleans Community Fridges  will be this months recipient of the Bad Magic Donation! We donated $13,900 to them and $1,500 to our new scholarship fund. Such a cool charity, providing free food and drink to those who are food insecure.
