  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the guys are back from vacation and they break down everything surrounding the US Women's dominant run during the World Cup, and try to figure out what the deal is with the pay disparity between the women's team and the men's team, and in the end, come up with a solution that could change the face of soccer in the United States. Also joining the show is 3x NBA All-Star, 2x Gold Medalist, 3rd overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft, and 14 year NBA veteran, Deron Williams. Deron and Pat discuss all the craziness with NBA free agency and his take on guys like Kawhi Leonard and Paul George deciding to play for the Clippers instead of teaming up with LeBron. They also rehash their respective rounds during the Baha Mar NFL/NBA Showdown, chat about what D Will does in his free time, what he thinks of the current landscape of the NBA, the MMA gym that he owns in Dallas and whether or not he's ever considered getting into the octagon, and much more in an incredible conversation (27:45-1:14:27). Today's show is a fun one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
