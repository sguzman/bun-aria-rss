  "description": "Sean Lennon admits that he was naïve about his family legacy when he began a career in music. He also admits that when he received bad reviews for his first solo record, deep down he agreed with them. Sean talks with Marc about how he grew into himself as an artist and musician, how “John and Yoko” as the world sees them are different from his dad and mom as he knows them, and how the trauma of losing his father at a young age left him with memories that will never go away. They also talk about his work with Les Claypool, scoring films, and producing for other artists, including his mom. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://fi.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Fi</a>, <a href=\"http://benjerry.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ben & Jerry's</a>, and <a href=\"http://audible.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stan Lee's Alliances: A Trick of Light, an Audible Original</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
