  "description": "<p>There are no sports besides talking about the Falcons having a ton of first round draft picks and Tom Brady officially signing in Tampa (2:37 - 14:14). We've been watching old games and bargaining with ourselves. Who's back of the week including caveman Ben Roethlisberger (14:14 - 26:17) . Billy Football joins the show in his triumphant return to talk about what Generation Z can do to stop Coronavirus plus he has historical facts and some science he's been working on to become the greatest generation (26:17 - 58:36). Mr Portnoy joins the show from Florida to check in with a complaint and a plea for him to stay indoors (58:36 - 85:13). Segments include Mt Flushmore season, the opposite of Mt rushmore where we pick the 4 worst things of a topic, embrace debate and PR 101 for Jamal Murray.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
