  "description": "The Republican Party not only produced the corrupt, failed presidency of Donald Trump, but it has supported Trump at every turn. What is to be done with a party that embraces a president who is a traitor, a con man, a racist, a serial abuser of women? We sat down with two notable former Republicans, Washington Post columnist Max Boot and political scientist and commentator Tom Nichols to discuss what comes next for the GOP. Their answers suggest that a defeat of Donald Trump will not be enough to fix what is broken within the party. Indeed, one suggests it essential to vote against Republicans on every level on every ballot whereas the other warns it might require decades of defeats of this dysfunctional, dangerous incarnation of what was once the party of Lincoln. Join us for this thought-provoking conversation.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
