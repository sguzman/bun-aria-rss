  "description": "<p>The beef has never been wetter. This week, the boys are confronting director, writer and producer, creator of The Bear, Chris Storer. Chris was kind enough to host us in his NYC office for an ambush on Zoom vs. IRL writer’s rooms, the lingering bone we have to pick with him (no pun intended), when you know you have a legitimate hit on your hands, The Bear’s fits and the spread of white tee misinformation, Emmy buzz and potential red carpet fits, embarrassing style phases before he went full Drake’s, working with friend of the show Matty Matheson, whether or not he’s actually nice in the kitchen, television going viral on TikTok, drip ranking his buddies Bo Burnham, Ramy Youssef and Jeremy Allen White, Bella Hadid’s acting chops, Ted Lasso actually being good, his Mount Rushmore of shows, Hollywood red tape, advice for anyone trying to break into TV, what date night with Gillian Jacobs looks like and much more on this prestige and powerful episode of The Only Podcast That Matters™.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more Throwing Fits, check us out on Patreon: www.patreon.com/throwingfits.</p>\n",
