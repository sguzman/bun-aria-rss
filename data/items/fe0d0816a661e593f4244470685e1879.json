  "description": "<p>Spoke to the eyewitness and he said “I live near Washougal, Washington. I was teaching someone how to cold camp, no fire no lights. One night we ran into a group of them. They surrounded us but they were not aggressive. I had no idea what was going on that night or what these things were. They seem to watch from the treeline. We passed one going to our camp. It was dark and I remember thinking, I don’t remember a tree being next to that trail. I realized it wasn’t a tree. Long story short we left. I went back the next day to get all of my gear and there were tracks everywhere. I decided to follow some fresh tracks and that is when I ran into one.”</p>",
