  "description": "<p>An accurate and detailed field map is important for cyclotron beam dynamics\nstudies. During the long history of cyclotron studies, many techniques have\nbeen developed by cyclotron pioneers for the treatment of median plane field\nmap. In this paper, we take the TRIUMF 500 MeV cyclotron as an example to study\nthe asymmetric field resulting from the imperfect median plane symmetry. The\n``Gordon approach'' and a highly accurate compact finite differentiation method\nare used to investigate the historical field survey data. The redundancy in the\nsurvey data is revealed by the expansion method, which also makes it possible\nto correct the error in the measurement. Finally, both the azimuthal field\n$B_\\theta$ and the axial gradient of the axial field $dB_z/dz$ in the median\nplane are corrected using the radial field map $B_r$. The influence of the\ncorrection is examined by recalculating the equilibrium orbit properties of the\nTRIUMF cyclotron. The result shows significantly increased vertical centering\nerrors of the closed orbits. Further simulation study suggests that these\ncentering errors can be reduced to below 1.5 cm by adjusting the trim coils'\n$B_r$ field within the output limits of our trim coils' power supplies. The\nerror in the measurement field data may explain why the calculated trim coils'\nsettings during the cyclotron commissioning in 1974 encountered difficulty.\n</p>",
