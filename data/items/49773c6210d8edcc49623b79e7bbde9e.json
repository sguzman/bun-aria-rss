  "description": "As the U.S. Supreme Court hears two cases involving affirmative action in relation to college admissions, the Washington Post found that the lawyers arguing cases in front of the Justices are mostly white and male. WAPO's Tobi Raji joins us. Then, a new Greenpeace report shows that only 5% to 6% of plastics in the U.S. are recycled. The report also concludes that plastics are \"fundamentally not recyclable\" and calls for the petrochemical industry to end the narrative that places blame on individual consumers instead of the corporations producing so much plastic. Lisa Ramsden, senior plastics campaigner at Greenpeace, joins us. And, the right song can lift us up and make us feel alive. How have some anthems — like \"ABC\" by the Jackson 5 or \"God Only Knows\" by the Beach Boys — transcended decades, remaining popular the whole time? Music journalist Steve Baltin spoke to some of the hitmakers for his new book \"Anthems We Love: 29 Iconic Artists on the Hit Songs that Shaped our Lives,\" and joins us. ",
