  "description": "<div>This year marks the centenary of the birth of Jack Kerouac. As Penguin publishes a lavish new edition of <em>On The Road </em>to mark the occasion, I'm joined by two Kerouac scholars. Holly George-Warren is working on the definitive biography of Kerouac (her previous work includes Lives of Gene Autry and Janis Joplin), and <a href=\"https://simonwarner.substack.com/\">Simon Warner</a> co-edited <em>Kerouac on Record: A Literary Soundtrack</em> and runs <em>Rock and the Beat Generation</em>. They tell me how <em>On The Road </em>came to be written, how it stands up now, and what made 'the Beats' beat.</div>\n",
