  "description": "<p>What if all of our problems came down to the core feeling that we weren’t enough? This is what we explore in this episode. Our ego is here to keep us safe and protected from the world around us. But when we speak to it in a loving way, it knows we are safe without it’s walls.</p> <p>In this episode, I sit down with author and meditation teacher Panache to dive deep into topics such as samadhi, ego vs true self and inner peace. We also discuss the topic of cultural appropriation and his views as a Brahmin (you’ll be surprised by his answer!) This is a loving, soothing episode that will fill your heart with joy.
