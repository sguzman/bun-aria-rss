  "description": "<p>In October, Google announced in a paper in the journal Nature that it built a chip called \"Sycamore\" that achieved what is known as \"quantum supremacy.\" It's being hailed as a massive step forward in the world of quantum computing. Quantum computing's principles lie in the fascinating world of quantum mechanics, and while it is extremely complicated to understand, the theoretical applications of a quantum computer could have a massive real-world impact. We'll talk with Scott Aaronson, the David J. Bruton Centennial Professor of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin, and director of its Quantum Information Center, about Google's discovery. Aaronson reviewed Google's paper before it was published and has worked for years on these complex problems.</p><p><br></p><p>Support us by supporting our sponsors!</p><p>Worried about finding the perfect gift this holiday season?
