  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Joe Biden has gone on the record to deny the sexual assault charges against him. Taking to MSNBC to unequivocally deny any complaints against him by former Senate staffer Tara Reade. Biden alleged that any such complaint against him would be in the National Archives not at the University of Delaware and refusing to have any records searched for Tara Reade's name. This seems to be a distinction without a difference because all records are under the auspices of the federal government. According to Business Insider, eight other women have criticized Biden for acting inappropriately. Later, protests in blue states are proof of why so many people leave these states, to begin with. The common theme is that the blue state governors use tax dollars to destroy private businesses and control public land to benefit their fascistic schemes. Afterward, it’s the big-government progressives that promote densely populated urban planning with high rise buildings and public transportation. Notice how they never recommend living out in the country so citizens have more space. People in rural America are now the freest people in America. Finally, Mark Meckler, President of Convention of States, calls in to explain that the coronavirus protests resemble the tea party and we need to open the states.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
