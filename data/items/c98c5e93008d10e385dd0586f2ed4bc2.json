Are you crushing it everyday? Has your routine and morning habits fizzled lately? Maybe you’re one of the many struggling to find the right routine. If you’re looking for the secret formula that will lead you to the entrepreneurial land of optimization and productivity, you may have clicked the wrong video. In this episode, I’m going to lay out what I do, how I do it and the reasons I have for doing these things that have helped me tremendously, but it means these are guides and flag posts for you to create your own perfect daily routine and habits. Once you understand the key components and trust that sleep is critical to optimizing any morning routine effectively, you’ll think clearer and move even faster in your business. Experimentation is the only way to find out what will serve you best. In the meantime, be open to “trying on” different routines, especially anything mentioned here and go from there. The only wrong action in building your routine is not taking action at all.<br /> <br />SHOW NOTES:<br /> <br />0:00 | Introduction<br />0:53 | The Best Routine For You<br />2:38 | Most Important Things First<br />6:17 | Prioritize Your Sleep<br />11:41 | Meditation or Exercise First?<br />14:17 | How to Program New Routine<br />18:31 | Escape the Late Nights<br />21:06 | Getting To Work Tasks<br />23:32 | Tips To Get Back to Sleep<br /> <br />QUOTES:<br /> <br />“The way that you start your day is one of the most important things for guaranteeing that you're going to be successful.
