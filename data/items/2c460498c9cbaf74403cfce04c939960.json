Katie walked us through sooo many wonderful things. We started with what personality is and then went into an overview of the Enneagram itself. Katie then offered us a brief description of each of the 9 types. It’s so good y’all. Katie is a WEALTHHHH of knowledge and this was an episode where light bulbs were going off in Kat’s head the entire time. P.S. Katie is the creator of The Practice, a new monthly subscription program launching in January that combines practical ways to use the Enneagram and Mindfulness as self-care.
