  "description": "On today's show, Pat sits down with the guys for a couple of conversations covering everything going on in the world. Digs and Zito join the show to discuss Zito's weekend in Chicago and his blogging efforts, and Digs gives his takeaways from week 10 of the NFL, including a couple of awards he'd like to give out, and he and Pat discuss their rough weekends gambling. Todd and Connor pop in later for an incredible conversation covering whether or not Duke is going to get beat this year, what happened in the Patriots/Titans game, and the guys do a deep dive into Tony Robbins after Pat spent the weekend watching a documentary detailing one of his seminars. Also calling into the show is injured Center for the Arizona Cardinals and former Penn State standout, AQ Shipley. They chat about Quenton Nelson's block, AQ's time at Penn State, Zach Smith and Tom Herman's beef, and the feeling inside Arizona's locker room (32:23-52:50). It's a good one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
