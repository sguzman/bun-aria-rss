  "description": "<p>In evidence synthesis, effect measure modifiers are typically described as\nvariables that induce treatment effect heterogeneity at the individual level,\nthrough treatment-covariate interactions in an outcome model parametrized at\nsuch level. As such, effect modification is defined with respect to a\nconditional measure. However, marginal effect estimates are required for\npopulation-level decisions in health technology assessment. For non-collapsible\neffect measures, purely prognostic variables that do not predict response to\ntreatment at the individual level may modify marginal treatment effects at the\npopulation level. This has important implications for recommended practices for\nevidence synthesis. Firstly, unadjusted indirect comparisons of marginal\neffects may be biased in the absence of individual-level treatment effect\nheterogeneity. Secondly, covariate adjustment may be necessary to account for\ncross-study imbalances in purely prognostic variables. Popular summary measures\nin meta-analysis such as odds ratios and hazard ratios are non-collapsible.\nCollapsible measures would facilitate the transportability of marginal effects\nbetween studies by: (1) removing dependence on model-based covariate adjustment\nwhen there is treatment effect homogeneity at the individual level; and (2)\nfacilitating the selection of baseline characteristics for covariate adjustment\nwhen there is heterogeneity.\n</p>",
