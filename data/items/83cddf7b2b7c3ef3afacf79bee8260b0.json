  "description": "Disappearance Of Emma Fillipoff. November 28, 2012. Victoria, British Columbia. 26 year-old Emma Fillipoff had moved away from her family home in Perth, Ontario in the fall of 2011. She found work and messages to family seemed to indicate that all was well. But over time, Emma's physical, emotional, and mental state seemed to be in decline. After a series of calls to her mother in November of 2012, in which a tearful Emma first asked to come home and then changed her mind several times over, it was clear that something was very wrong. Shelley, her mother, decided to fly to Victoria to bring her daughter home. But after her arrival, she learned that no one had seen Emma for several hours at that point. The last confirmed sighting of Emma was when two police officers did a welfare check on her, but decided she was well enough to leave her be on a cold night without shoes. As the clock ticked on and Shelley learned more about Emma's recent behaviors, the disappearance became more confusing and even more concerning. Where had Emma gone? Was she running from someone or something? As more information turned up, a suspect list formed. Can this mystery ever be solved? As difficult as this case has been, we do believe it can be.
