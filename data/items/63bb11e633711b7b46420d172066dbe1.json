A Rhodes Scholar, St. John went on to serve on the White House National Economic Council and has written seven books, including one with her husband called \"Micro-Resilience,\" which outlines five frameworks for small \"life hacks\" to help boost focus and energy.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
