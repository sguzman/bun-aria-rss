  "description": "It's almost Halloween, which means that we're in peak spooky season. So for today's episode, we bring you two books with two <em>very</em> different kinds of frights: a haunted house and...office politics. That's right: In <em>The Other Black Girl</em>, writer Zakiya Dalila Harris captures the all-too-real horror of being the only Black woman in her office. When another Black woman is hired, the tension gets dialed up even higher. And in <em>There's A Ghost In This House</em>, the author-illustrator Oliver Jeffers uses old photographs to create creepy illustrations that will give both children and adults goosebumps. ",
