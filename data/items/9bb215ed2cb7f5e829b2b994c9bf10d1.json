  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the crackpot website Mediaite is falsely reporting that this program is promoting conspiracy theories. However, it was Terry McAuliffe that claimed the 2000 and 2016 election were stolen. It was Terry McAuliffe's campaign that just hired attorney Mark Elias who has known ties to a web of dark money donor groups aimed at changing elections through litigation instead of by legislation (which the Constitution calls for). If Elias specializes in election challenges and McAuliffe expects to win, why would he even hire Elias if he wasn't actually planning on using litigation to win the election? It was Democrats led by Hillary Clinton that called the election of Donald Trump in 2016 illegitimate and stolen. Yet, Mediaite re-prints the propaganda produced by Media Matters and other outlets that exist solely to propagandize and slander conservative opposition. Later, why is President Biden even considering a nuclear treaty review? Such a surrender would be a gift to all global enemies of the United States. Afterward, the Biden administration is attempting to compel the Israelis to accept a Palestinian Embassy in Jerusalem. This goes against their sovereignty and the very spirit of the Abraham Accords. Finally, Arizona AG Mark Brnovich calls in to discuss the news that the Supreme Court accepted Arizona’s petition to defend the Public Charge Rule, which is a Trump administration rule that restricted green cards for immigrants deemed likely to be reliant on welfare.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
