  "title": "Gerry Callahan Finally Apologizes to Kirk Minihane",
  "description": "<p><p>Blind Mike's predecessor Gerry Callahan returns to Kirk Minihane's side for a brawling, contentious, and uproarious guest appearance on the Kirk Minihane Show. Callahan, who was unceremoniously defenestrated at WEEI after 25 years as a staple of Boston morning radio, dishes on his exit from Entercom, his former colleagues, and his plans for the future. The EBT card in his wallet hasn't changed Callahan a bit. The two former titans of New England sports radio discuss John \"Dino\" Dennis, the news media, politics, Trump, movies, who should apologize to whom, Rich Kelleher, whose parents' deaths were more tragic, and more. This episode is worth skipping your yoga class. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
