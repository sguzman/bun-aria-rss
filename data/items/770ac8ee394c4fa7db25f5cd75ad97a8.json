  "description": "Jeff Macke, former hedge fund manager and market expert, does not hold back in this special 25-minute interview.  He talks about how malls will never be extinct, why brick and mortar's have a big advantage over Amazon, and why retailers should stop wasting money repurchasing their shares.     Jeff also breaks down the Federal Reserve and how this institution has zero transparency.  This makes it incredibly difficult to trade stocks since the opinions coming from the 17 board members are almost always inconsistent.    Finally, Jeff talks about his future plans after being host of Yahoo! Finance.  This includes reinventing the hedge fund industry.  Jeff says he may look to open up his own fund with a much better fee structure and much better returns.  But he's not promising anything-(although it does sound like Jeff is planning to open up a new fund in the near-term).  Jeff is one of the few analysts in the media who speaks his mind.  He doesn't care who he offends and always has conviction in every stock or sector he recommends.    So whether you agree with Jeff or not... you will know exactly where he stands on many issues after listening to this special interview.",
