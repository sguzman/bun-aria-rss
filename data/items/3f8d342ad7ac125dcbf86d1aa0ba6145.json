  "description": "<p>The novelist Brandon Taylor, who has generated his own buzz with his debut novel, “Real Life,” and a collection of stories, “Filthy Animals,” visits the podcast to discuss the much-discussed work of Sally Rooney. Taylor recently reviewed her third novel, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/07/books/review/beautiful-world-where-are-you-sally-rooney.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Beautiful World, Where Are You.”</a> On the podcast, he describes Rooney’s writing as an “intense, melancholic tractor beam.”</p><p>“She has this really great, tactile metaphorical sense, but it’s never overworked,” he says. “Her style is so clean. That is the word I come to most often in describing her style. It is so clean, so pristine.” Like her two previous books, this one is fueled by the vexations of intimate relationships. “Ultimately, if you’re a Sally Rooney fan, I think you’ll love this novel,” Taylor says. “And if you’re a Sally Rooney skeptic, I think she will acknowledge your concerns but maybe not answer them in full.”</p><p>Another Rooney, David Rooney, visits the podcast to discuss his new book, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/books/review/a-brief-history-of-motion-tom-standage-about-time-david-rooney.html\" target=\"_blank\">“About Time: A History of Civilization in Twelve Clocks.”</a></p><p>“There’s something about clocks and watches,” he says.” They have more meaning to many people than other artifacts. I wasn’t quite sure why. I was trying to get behind the faces of clocks and watches, to understand not so much how they work — although that’s fascinating — but what they mean, and what they’ve always meant, through history, across cultures.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Tina Jordan looks back at Book Review history as it celebrates its 125th anniversary; Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Jennifer Szalai and John Williams talk about books that have been recently reviewed. Pamela Paul is the host.</p><p>Here are the books discussed by the Times’s critics this week:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/30/books/review-failed-promise-reconstruction-frederick-douglass-andrew-johnson-robert-levine.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The Failed Promise”</a> by Robert S.
