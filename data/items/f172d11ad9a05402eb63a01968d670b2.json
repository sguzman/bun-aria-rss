  "description": "<p>We study the interaction-induced migration of bubbles in shear flow and\nobserve that bubbles suspended in elastoviscoplastic emulsions organise into\nchains aligned in the flow direction, similarly to particles in viscoelastic\nfluids. To investigate the driving mechanism, we perform experiments and\nsimulations on bubble pairs, using suspending fluids with different rheological\nproperties. First, we notice that, for all fluids, the interaction type depends\non the relative position of the bubbles. If they are aligned in the vorticity\ndirection, they repel, if not, they attract each other. The simulations show a\nsimilar behavior in Newtonian fluids as in viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic\nfluids, as long as the capillary number is sufficiently large. This shows that\nthe interaction-related migration of the bubbles is strongly affected by the\nbubble deformation. We suggest that the cause of migration is the interaction\nbetween the heterogeneous pressure fields around the deformed bubbles, due to\ncapillary pressure.\n</p>",
