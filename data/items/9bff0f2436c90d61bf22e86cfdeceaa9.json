  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir podcast, we take a look at ourselves and more specifically, we take a look at our lifestyle and how the work we’re doing everyday is leading us towards a life we want to live. As we started thinking about this topic I wrote down a bunch of questions to ask myself and eventually turned it into a worksheet that I printed out for both Colin and I to fill out and answer on our own.\nAfter we answered them, we got together and reviewed our answers and In this podcast, we go over our answers and talk about what we learned by doing this exercise.\nWe’ve actually turned the worksheet into a PDF that you all can download, just go to Colinandsamir.com or check out our twitter @colinandsamir and we’ll have a link to download the worksheet if you are interested in doing it after you listen to the episode.",
