  "description": "<p><p>On Episode 52, the boys open with the Matt Duchene trade before welcoming Barstool Chief to discuss his major scoop about the 2019 Winter Classic. Next they chat about the horrendous hit on Dan Paille in Europe before bringing on two-time Stanley Cup champion Nick Bonino of the Nashville Predators. Nicky Bones talks about deciding to continue to play Game Two of the 2017 Cup on a broken leg, why he ended up picking Nashville in free agency, him and his wife's hilarious Halloween costumes, his road to the NHL, whether he's a Sox/Yanks or Pats/Giants fan, and much more. The guys then finish up with #AllRightHamilton questions from listeners.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
