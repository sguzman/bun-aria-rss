  "description": "I’m taking more of your questions and comments about the market (and one about the NBA). A listener comments on our major deal with TCG World to buy land in the metaverse. I explain why this will be a game-changer for our business—and how accredited investors can get a stake alongside us. Next, I take a question on whether EV maker Rivian Automotive’s stock is worth looking at… and the same listener wants to know who I like for the NBA playoffs.  Finally, I explain why I’m bullish on markets despite China’s COVID lockdowns… and why it’s different from the lockdowns of March 2020. In this episode:  Be careful as earnings season comes to an end [1:00] We’ve officially launched our metaverse deal [5:30] Is Rivian a buy? [24:15] Who I think will win the NBA playoffs [28:45] Why I’m bullish on markets despite China lockdowns [31:50]   Enjoyed this episode?
