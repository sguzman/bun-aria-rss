  "description": "The guys are back this week and they kick off today’s episode with a weekend recap. Baby Avery turned one, the guys in Lansing did more demolition on the ETA compound, and Josh’s son Hudson won the state championship in golf.\n CJ starts off the conversation by asking the guys a question that he was asked by a listener. What do you do while you’re waiting to blow up ? You’re applying the principles you’re learning, you’re studying your craft, but things just aren’t moving as fast as you want them to. So what do you do ? ET explains that at one point in time he actually stopped speaking and found other ways to serve and add to his craft. When he stepped away is when he, CJ, & Karl started working together at MSU. Karl discovers that even back then the squad was doing the same thing that they are doing now.\n The key principle in this episode is to stay in go mode and master your craft. Even while waiting to blow up you should be working on your craft. ET says that for many aspiring speakers, they only speak when they speak. This statement can be used for more than speakers. No matter what level you’re on in your journey make sure that you are always working on your craft.\n  Time Stamped Show Notes:\n  [09:30] - Avery turns 1 years old\n [13:00] - Father’s Day Weekend\n [21:00] - ET stepped away from speaking\n [33:00] - Karl steps into unfamiliar territory\n [41:55] - CJ finds the gaps\n [52:40] - Fair or Foul\n [1:07:15] - Ask ET\n [1:30:12] - The Nugget of the Day\n   Thank you so much for listening to this episode of the Secret 2 Success podcast.
