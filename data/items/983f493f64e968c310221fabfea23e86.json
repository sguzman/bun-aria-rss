  "title": "Episode 293: Where is Brandon Swanson? Part 1",
  "description": "Brandon Swanson was 19 years old when he went missing in the state of Minnesota. He had been out earlier that night and gone to a couple of parties before making his way home to Marshall, Minnesota. Unfortunately, on the way home, he ran into a bit of car trouble when his car veered a bit off the side of a gravel road and got stuck in a ditch. He called his parents for help and explained exactly where he was but when they got there Brandon was nowhere to be seen and neither was his car. This case is truly one of the most bizarre we’ve covered to date and sadly, there is a lack of any closure involved.<br>\n<br>\nIf you or someone you know has any information about Brandon Swanson's location or disappearance, please contact:<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\nThe Lincoln County Sheriff's Office 1-507-694-1664<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\nFBI ViCap 1-800-634-4097 or <a href=\"mailto:Vicap@leo.gov\" target=\"_blank\">Vicap@leo.gov<br>\n</a><br>\n\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:<br>\n<br>\nFirstLeaf: Head to  TRY <a href=\"http://Firstleaf.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">Firstleaf.com/MORBID</a> for 6 bottles of wine for $29.95 with free shipping.<br>\n<br>\nModern Fertility: Right now, Modern Fertility is offering our listeners $20 off the test when you go to <a href=\"http://ModernFertility.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">ModernFertility.com/MORBID</a><br>\n<br>\nHoney: Get Honey for FREE at Join <a href=\"http://Honey.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">Honey.com/MORBID</a><br>\n<br>\nGoodRX: For simple, smart savings on your prescriptions, go to <a href=\"http://GoodRX.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">GoodRX.com/morbid</a>\n\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
