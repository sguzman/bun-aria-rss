  "description": "<div>On July 10, 2015, a 28 year-old black woman named Sandra Bland was pulled over in a small Texas town for failing to use a turn signal when she changed lanes. She was ultimately arrested and taken to the county jail. Three days later, she was found dead in her cell. The official coroner's report ruled the death a suicide, but many people believe that Sandra Bland was murdered. Sandy, as she was known to her family and friends, became a national figure in the Black Lives Matter Movement and \"Say Her Name\" attempts to uncover the truth behind her arrest and death.<br>\n<br>\nWhere to go from here: <br>\n<br>\nTCO Episodes:<br>\n<br>\nEpisode 24: The Death and Life of Marsha P.
