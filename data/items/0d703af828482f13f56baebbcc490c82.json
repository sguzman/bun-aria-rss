    "media:description": "Alternating and Direct Current | Electricity | Physics | FuseSchool\n\nIn this video we are going to describe what is meant by an alternating and direct current, look at the difference between them and how they can be used.\n\nRemember, an electrical current is the flow of electrons. Watch our video about current here: https://youtu.be/enuNdK426Wo\n\nWith direct current or DC, we have a cell or a battery in a circuit. The current in a cell only flows in one direction. So the electrons only flow in one direction around the circuit.\n\nBut if instead of a cell or battery we have a mains power supply, it is an alternating current or AC, which means the current constantly changes direction.\n\n\n\nCREDITS\nAnimation & Design: Bing Rijper\nNarration: Dale Bennett\nScript: Bethan Parry\n\nSUPPORT US ON PATREON\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fuseschool\n\nSUBSCRIBE to the FuseSchool YouTube channel for many more educational videos. Our teachers and animators come together to make fun & easy-to-understand videos in Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Maths & ICT.\n\nVISIT us at www.fuseschool.org, where all of our videos are carefully organised into topics and specific orders, and to see what else we have on offer. Comment, like and share with other learners. You can both ask and answer questions, and teachers will get back to you.\n\nThese videos can be used in a flipped classroom model or as a revision aid. \n\nFind all of our Chemistry videos here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0gavSzhMlReKGMVfUt6YuNQsO0bqSMV\n\nFind all of our Biology videos here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0gavSzhMlQYSpKryVcEr3ERup5SxHl0\n\nFind all of our Physics videos here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0gavSzhMlTWm6Sr5uN2Uv5TXHiZUq8b\n\nFind all of our Maths videos here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0gavSzhMlTKBNbHH5u1SNnsrOaacKLu\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fuseschool/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/fuseschool/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/fuseSchool\n\nAccess a deeper Learning Experience in the FuseSchool platform and app: www.fuseschool.org\nFollow us: http://www.youtube.com/fuseschool\nBefriend us: http://www.facebook.com/fuseschool\n\nThis is an Open Educational Resource.
