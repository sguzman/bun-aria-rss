  "title": "Reducing approximation errors in LPI swaps",
  "description": "Brody, Crosby & Li (2008) introduced a quasi-analytical method to price limited price index (LPI) swaps with the Jarrow & Yildirim (2003) model. Their method works well for short-term contracts, but the approximation error for long maturities may be far from being negligible. In this article, Joshua Xingzhi Zhang and Fabio Mercurio modify the Brody, Crosby & Li method to reduce approximation error in the worst case to lower than 2 basis points",
