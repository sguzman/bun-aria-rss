This trailer, by Matt Orfalea, is here, and he also produced the full video.\n\nFrom her days as a professional liar for the Bush/Cheney White House and 2004 campaign, now as a beloved-by-liberals MSNBC host, Nicolle Wallace has for two decades been the Typhoid Mary of Disinformation. Nobody spreads official campaigns of deceit and lies more casually, frequently, aggressively or destructively than she.",
