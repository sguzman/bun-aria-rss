  "description": "In this episode we're celebrating two major milestones with the one year anniversary of the podcast launch and 12 years in this business. We started Alice Lane because we saw a spot in the market locally that wasn't being represented.  We talk about what we have learned over the years from our successes and mistakes.  It started as a store front and has grown to a full service design firm that has been around long enough that we are seeing repeat customers.  One of the most valuable things we have learned is that you don't need to feel insecure about your ideas or your own unique design, but get comfortable with getting creative and letting your imagination flow.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a><br /><br />Opening a store 3:31<br />Greatness comes from mutual desire for greatness 19:51<br />When you buy something truly great 27:51<br />Let people do what they’re best at 33:42<br /><br />“We’ve worked with people, often when we’re starting to work with a client and we’re building a new home, we ask them, ‘Do you have anything from your previous home you want us to catalogue and make sure we include?’ And the majority of the time they say, ‘No, we want to start all over.’ And in my heart I kind of sink a little bit because I’m like, ‘Dang it.’ They’ve obviously invested in pieces, but none of it is important enough.
