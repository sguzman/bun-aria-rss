  "title": "Adding Akamai Shared Domains to the Public Suffix List",
  "description": "Akamai plans to submit a number of our shared domains to the ?PRIVATE? section of the Public Suffix List (PSL) at some point on or after March 31, 2022. The PSL contains multi-party domain suffixes and is used by a wide range of client software (for example, web browsers) to implement policy decisions, such as to prevent cookies from being set on public or multi-party domains.",
