  "description": "When Christians encounter tragedy and hardship, how they respond should point people to Christ. That's the reason for suffering in this world. In the wake of Bubba's amazing cancer recovery, we ask how Christians should react, in good times and bad. In politics, Vice President Kamala Harris continues to push \"equity\" as the answer, while in reality, it's impossible and just poorly-veiled Communism. In sports, Aaron Judge breaks the American League home run record. And the movie \"Bros\" was complete flop and we can't imagine why?!?!\nSponsor: True Classic wants to make every man look good and feel good. Tighter fit in the chest and sleeves to make your arms pop, and room in the torso to keep things cozy. All of their styles are super soft and at a great price for what you’re getting.
