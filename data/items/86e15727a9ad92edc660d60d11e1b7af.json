  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/inflation-increase-2021\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Inflation</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;and cash flow</strong>&nbsp;have been fighting against each other for decades. As soon as you increase the rent on an income property, inflation comes right in to eat some of that gain. So in today’s borderline&nbsp;<strong>hyperinflationary environment</strong>, is cash flow still coming out on top? A better question to ask may be,&nbsp;<strong>what happens in five, ten, or twenty years?</strong>&nbsp;Will inflation completely erode your&nbsp;<strong>financial freedom</strong>&nbsp;dreams? Or will cash flow match (or beat) this destructive force.</p><p>This isn’t just a question that<strong>&nbsp;impacts real estate investors</strong>—it affects almost every individual working within today’s economy. In today’s episode of<strong>&nbsp;Seeing Greene</strong>, David goes deep into this question (and others) so you, the investors, can have a better understanding of our economy as a whole. You’ll also hear topics like<strong>&nbsp;whether or not you can transfer title&nbsp;</strong>on an&nbsp;<strong>FHA loan</strong>, what to do when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/win-bidding-war\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>bidding wars</strong></a>&nbsp;push prices well above market comparables,&nbsp;<strong>when to cosign</strong>&nbsp;and when to ask for a cosigner, and&nbsp;<strong>what every investor in their twenties should start doing today</strong>.</p><p>Heard a topic that you wanted more explanation on?
