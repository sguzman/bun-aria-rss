  "description": "<p>Tonight I speak with Randy Harrington, and he had one of the best close-up encounters you’ll ever hear. After setting up a fake camp site to attract Bigfoot, Harrington hid in his truck. When the creatures stepped out of the woods and approached the site, it decided to check out the vehicle where Harrington was hiding with his video camera and a handgun. He said he heard and saw the creatures rummaging through stuff in the back of the truck.</p> <p>Randy has been studying the behavior of these creatures for many years and has put together a picture of what they do and why. I have to say a lot of what Randy theorizes about their behavior makes a lot of sense. Randy will also be giving us an update on the Falcon Project.</p>",
