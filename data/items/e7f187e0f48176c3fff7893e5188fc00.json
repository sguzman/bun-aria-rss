  "description": " <p>With AMD&rsquo;s first-wave of Zen 4 CPUs now in the books with the Ryzen 7000 series, the consumer arm of AMD is now shifting its attention over to its graphics business. In a presentation that ended moments ago dubbed &ldquo;together we advance_gaming&rdquo;, Dr. Lisa Su and other AMD leaders laid out the future of AMD&rsquo;s graphics products. And that future is the RDNA 3 architecture, which will be the basis of the new Radeon RX 7900 XTX and Radeon RX 7900 XT video cards.</p>\n\n<p>The two cards, set to be released on December 13<sup>th</sup>, will be the first products released using the RDNA 3 architecture. According to AMD, the new flagship 7900 XTX will deliver up to 70% more performance at 4K than their previous flagship, the 6950 XT. This performance boost comes curtesy of several architectural improvements in RDNA that cumulatively offer 54% higher performance per watt than RDNA 2, as well as higher clockspeeds courtesy of TSMC&rsquo;s 5nm (and 6nm) processes, and higher overall power consumption.</p>\n\n<p>The full-fledged RX 7900 XTX will be hitting the streets at $999. Meanwhile the second-tier RX 7900 XT will run for $899.</p>\n",
