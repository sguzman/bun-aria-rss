  "description": "<p>On the night of October 1, 2017, Stephen Paddock opened fire on a crowd attending the final night of the Route 91 Harvest Country Music Festival on Las Vegas’s famous StripLas Vegas, killing 58 people and injuring more than 800, before turning a gun on himself. And then two more would die later of their injuries raising the final body count to 61. Although the shooting only lasted 10 minutes, the death and injury tolls made this massacre the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. Today we look into who Stephen was, why he may have done what he did, and we examine conspiracies that surrounded the shooting, promoted by conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones.
