  "description": "<p>As the cannabis community has grown into an industry it's imperative we don't lose track of who and what got us here so today we launch a new Legacy series of the podcast where I talk to people coming from the legacy side of cannabis, way back before the Green Rush started. \nIn Jimmy's own words: \"Sometimes when prayers are answered they don’t get answered exactly as you expected.  I think the law in California that legalized cannabis could have been written better but overall is a good thing for society and a step in the right direction.  This is what people have been dreaming about and fighting for, for decades.  I'm not sure if everyone fighting wanted so many laws that came with legalization but I guess that’s the nature of the beast.\nOne of the things I love most in life is smoking cannabis that I grew.  I highly encourage others to do so as it is one of the most satisfying, and rewarding ways to connect with the plant.  The connection to the plant and the love for it, is the biggest thing the legacy has to offer.  I hope anyone who joins the industry finds that connection.\" </p>\n\n<p>Learn more about your ad choices.
