  "title": "Ep. 149: Cullman & Kravis designers Ellie Cullman and Sarah Ramsey",
  "description": "This week, we welcome Ellie Cullman and Sarah Ramsey of Cullman & Kravis Associates, one of the top design firms in the country known for providing the highest quality of design and personal service. They discuss how the firm was founded and rose to be one of the leaders in design, along with the inspiration behind their new book, From Classic To Contemporary. We talk with them about ways to infuse traditional interiors with a modern and liveable perspective, what to do when you don’t want to be formal in a larger space, and how to create an art collection that best showcases your emotions and unique style.\nWhat You’ll Hear On This Episode:\n\nEllie shares her great story of getting into design through a screenplay that didn’t go to well in a pitch meeting.\n\nThe four ways to make a huge impact when creating a space that feels refreshed and flows seamlessly.\n\nAll your art does not have to come from one specific time period or collection. You can have art reflect your individual taste and lead with emotions rather than what you think should be in the rooms.\n\nWhy attending an art fair (once we can go to them again) is a great idea to find affordable yet meaningful pieces or even just an idea of what’s out there.\n\nJust like finding love, don’t commit to a certain design idea until you’ve looked around and “dated” a bunch of other ideas. If you are constantly seeing the same design ideas reflected back through your searches or Instagram algorithm pages, you can break out and try to embrace something new!\n\nEllie and Sarah work with designers of all ages at Cullman & Kravis, and they find this to be a source of inspiration and fresh ideas.\n\nWays we can create “lamp harmony” by adding uplighting, chandeliers, or even just changing an outdated light bulb or shade.\n\nThe Hudson River home that exemplified how to arrange furniture in a large room that doesn’t need to be so formal.\n\nMore about the Palm Beach project that portrayed beautiful accent walls and big colorful gestures.\n\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\nCullman & Kravis\nFrom Classic to Contemporary\n@cullmankravis\nAmerican Folk Art Museum\nKramer vs. Kramer\nSotheby’s\n\nDecorating Dilemma:\nFirst, as a pet owner, we understand the comfort of wanting to have an indoor and outdoor rug. The technology is amazing these days, and you can get ones that look nice, like the Ballard Anders Indoor/Outdoor rug, that hopefully, your cat won’t destroy. You could paint the top of the table and get a pop of color that way, which allows you to get a 48” table and save some space. Your house is light and open, we love it! Good choice of neutral yet beautiful paint colors as well.",
