Today on the show, Spencer shares the factors that can put us in the safetytrap, and ways to escape it. We discuss how an avoidance mindset and a reliance on false authority can put us in greater danger, how the run-hide-fight rubric for responding to an active shooter has been misapplied, and how being too polite can get you killed. From there we turn to ways you can take responsibility for your own safety, including knowing the warning signs that someone may take violent action and staying physically fit. We also discuss what to do if people are sending you potentially threatening messages online.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/manly-know-how/what-to-do-in-an-active-shooter-situation/\" target=\"_blank\">AoM Article: What to Do in an Active Shooter Situation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/manly-know-how/podcast-513-be-your-own-bodyguard/\" target=\"_blank\">AoM Podcast #513: Be Your Own Bodyguard</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/manly-know-how/podcast-688-protection-for-and-from-humanity/\" target=\"_blank\">Podcast #688: Protection for and from Humanity</a></li><li><a href=\"https://radiolab.org/episodes/no-special-duty\" target=\"_blank\">Radio Lab: No Special Duty</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Spencer Coursen</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thesafetytrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The SafetyTrap Website</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencercoursen?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Spencer on LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/spencercoursen?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Spencer on Twitter</a></li></ul><img src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/07/71FD1kdcYjS.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />\n",
