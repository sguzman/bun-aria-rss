  "title": "Case Update: Carolyn Riggins Part 1",
  "description": "<p>Last fall, we brought you the story of 69-year-old Carolyn Riggins. In July of 2020, after a successful night at her favorite bingo hall just a few miles from her Fort Worth, Texas home, Carolyn had disappeared. Just weeks before we originally aired her story, Carolyn’s remains were found inside the backseat of her car in a deeply wooded, remote part of far north Texas. This area was a place so rural, that it is almost completely inaccessible without detailed knowledge of the area. The discovery of Carolyn’s vehicle and body under such mysterious and unexplained circumstances troubled Carolyn’s family, especially with some of the rumors that swirled around the community from the time she disappeared and even after she was found. This week, we will explore some of the stranger aspects that have developed since we first aired Carolyn’s story nearly a year ago.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://vionicshoes.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vionic Shoes</a>- Visit <a href=\"http://vionicshoes.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VionicShoes.com</a>&nbsp;and use promo code VANISHED for free shipping.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.
