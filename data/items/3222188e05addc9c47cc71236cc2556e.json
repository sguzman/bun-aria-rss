More and more companies are adopting it. So, the need for Developers or DevOps engineers, who know how to build complete CI/CD pipelines on GitLab is increasing.\n \nWhile many GitLab courses teach you only the basics, we will dive into more advanced demos, like implementing dynamic versioning, using cache to speed up the pipeline execution or deploying to a K8s cluster. So, you'll have built several CI/CD pipelines with real life examples & best practices!\nâ€‹\nAs usual you can expect complex topics explained in a simple way, animations to help you understand the concepts better and lots of hands-on demos! \n\nâ–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬  ðŸš€ By the end of this course, you'll be able to... ðŸš€  â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬ \nâœ…  Confidently use GitLab CI/CD at your work\nâœ…  Set up self-managed GitLab Runners\nâœ…  Build and deploy containers with Docker Compose\nâœ…  Build a Multi-Stage Pipeline\nâœ…  Configure a CI/CD Pipeline for a Monorepo Microservices\nâœ…  Configure a CI/CD Pipeline for a Polyrepo Microservices\nâœ…  Deploy to a managed Kubernetes cluster\nâœ…  Setup a CI/CD pipeline with best practices\n\nâ–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬  ðŸ“š What you'll learn ðŸ“š â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬ \nâœ…  Pipelines, Jobs, Stages\nâœ…  Regular & Secret Variables\nâœ…  Workflow Rules\nâœ…  Speed up Pipeline using Cache\nâœ…  Configure Job Artifacts (test report, passing files and env vars)\nâœ…  Conditionals\nâœ…  GitLab Runners & Executors\nâœ…  GitLab's built-in Docker registry\nâœ…  GitLab Environments\nâœ…  GitLab's Job Templates\nâœ…  Reuse pipeline configuration by writing own job ci-templates library\nâœ…  needs, dependencies, extends etc.\n\n\nâ–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬   ðŸ’Ž  COURSE CURRICULUM  ðŸ’Ž  â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬ \nCheck out detailed curriculum here: https://techworld-with-nana.teachable.com/p/gitlab-cicd-course-curriculum\n\nðŸ’Ž Chapter 01: Course Overview\nðŸ’Ž Chapter 02: Introduction to CI/CD and GitLab CI/CD\nðŸ’Ž Chapter 03: Core Concepts of GitLab CI/CD\nðŸ’Ž Chapter 04: GitLab Architecture\nðŸ’Ž Chapter 05: Real Life Pipeline\nðŸ’Ž Chapter 06: Advanced Pipeline\nðŸ’Ž Chapter 07: Deploy Microservices App (Mono & Polyrepo)\nðŸ’Ž Chapter 08: Deploy to Kubernetes Cluster\nðŸ’Ž Chapter 09: Congrats\n\n\nâ–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬ Connect with me ðŸ‘‹   â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬ \nINSTAGRAM             â–º  https://bit.ly/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                   â–º  https://bit.ly/3i54PUB\nLINKEDIN                  â–º  https://bit.ly/3hWOLVT\nFacebook group      â–º  https://bit.ly/32UVSZP\nDEV                            â–º  https://bit.ly/3h2fqiO",
