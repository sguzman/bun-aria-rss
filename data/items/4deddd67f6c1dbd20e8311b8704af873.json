  "description": "It’s scary hours out here. Joe, Rory, and Mal give their thoughts on Drake’s latest release & determine if Drake really wants smoke with Joe or not (8:37). Also, Star is back in mainstream media alongside DJ Akademiks and the guys discuss the future of EDS now that they found a permanent co-host (39:35). “You don’t got the answers Sway!” *Kanye voice*. Well, apparently Mo’Nique thought Sway did have the answers because she revealed her grievances with Netflix in her interview with Sway and the crew weighs in on if she has a legit reason to be upset (1:07:03). And another talented rapper gone too soon, Joe, Rory and Mal send their condolences to Fredo Santana (1:00:40). Salute. The “Oh What a Night” event turned out to be great and incase you’re wondering, Mal actually debuted his spoken word talents. Make sure you look out for tickets to go on sale soon for the February 21st event! Sleeper picks of the week: Joe: SiR “Summer in November” | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gswTvfkjoYk&feature=share Mal: Dave East (featuring Matt Patterson) “Never Been” | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BxpohuTGcY&feature=share Rory: Mone Corleone \"The Watchers\" | https://soundcloud.com/callmemone/the-watchers",
