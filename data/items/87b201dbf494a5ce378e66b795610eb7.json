  "description": "<p>12/27 - Today on the show we flashed back to when Lil Yachty came on the show and spoke about his music but when it came to politics or pass drama he had with ex girlfriends, he curved right through those questions. We also flashed back to when we had back to back black ink crew drama. The first one to visit the show was Ceaser, who explained his side of the break up and the drama. Next we flash back to when Ceaser ex girlfriend Dutches came on the show, and was not scared to reach for her receipts to back up her story. Moreover, we also flashed back to when Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to Draya for not wanting to sign off on her child's homework and we flashed back to some classic Ask Yee's as well. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
