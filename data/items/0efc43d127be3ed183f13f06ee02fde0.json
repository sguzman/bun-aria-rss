  "description": "In The Mizrahi Era of Rebellion: Israel’s Forgotten Civil Rights Struggle, 1948-1966 (Syracuse University Press, 2015), Bryan K. Roby, fellow at the Centre for Judaic Studies at the University of Michigan, traces the early history of Mizrahi struggle for equality and civil rights in Israel. Roby reexamines and destabilises our understandings of this period of Israeli history. This book is a highly original and compelling contribution that tells an unknown story of Mizrahi politicisation and rebellion that has ongoing consequences for contemporary political struggles in Israel/Palestine.\n\n\n\nMax Kaiser is a PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne.
