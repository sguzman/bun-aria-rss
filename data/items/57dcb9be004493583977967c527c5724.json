  "description": "<p>Welcome to today’s episode of The Literary Life Podcast! Today our hosts Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks explore Robert Louis Stevenson’s <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jalxWK\">The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a></em>. After their commonplace quote discussion, each cohost shares some personal thoughts on Robert Louis Stevenson. Be aware that this episode will contain some spoilers, though we will not spoil the full ending. Thomas shares some biographical information about R. L. Stevenson. Angelina points out the mythic quality of this story and the enduring cultural references inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. She and Thomas also discuss some of the differences between early and late Victorian writers. They also begin digging into the first section of the book.</p> <p>Join us again next week for the second part of this discussion. The fall schedule for the podcast will be posted soon on our <a href=\"https://www.theliterary.life/upcoming-events/\">Upcoming Events</a> page for those who want to know what we will be reading and talking about on the podcast next!</p> <p>Don’t forget to check out our sister podcast, <a href= \"https://www.theliterary.life/the-well-read-poem/\">The Well Read Poem</a>, as well as Cindy’s new podcast, <a href= \"https://thenewmasonjar.com\">The New Mason Jar</a>!</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>I would rather (said he) have the rod to be the general terrour to all, to make them learn, than tell a child, if you do thus, or thus, you will be more esteemed than your brothers or sisters. The rod produces an effect which terminates in itself. A child is afraid of being whipped, and gets his task, and there’s an end on’t; whereas, by exciting emulation and comparisons of superiority, you lay the foundation of lasting mischief; you make brothers and sisters hate each other.</p> <cite>Samuel Johnson, as quoted by James Boswell</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Do not talk about Shakespeare’s mistakes: they are probably your own</p> <cite>G. M. Young</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>The most influential books, and the truest in their influence, are works of fiction.
