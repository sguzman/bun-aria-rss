    "media:description": "I livestream code and explain everything you could want to know about Convolutional Neural Networks using TensorFlow. \n\nConvolutional Neural Networks can be used to train computers to recognize objects in images. This allows us to recognize objects or people in images or video. It is helps automate the process of finding cancerous tumors. It is also used to implement driverless car technology and more.\n\nCode is Here : https://github.com/derekbanas/tensorflow/blob/main/tf_cnn_tut.ipynb\n\nIn this video I'll cover all of the following Live : \n\n✳️ Uploading Data to Google Colab\n✳️ Gathering / Preparing Images\n✳️ Normalizing\n✳️ Convolution\n✳️ Activation\n✳️ Pooling\n✳️ Optimizing Performance\n✳️ Minimizing Overfitting\n✳️ Augmenting Images\n✳️ Saving & Loading Models\n\nMY UDEMY COURSES ARE 87.5% OFF TIL June 28th ($9.99)\nhttps://www.udemy.com/\n\n➡️ Python Data Science Series for $9.99 : Highest Rated & Largest Python Udemy Course + 56 Hrs + 200 Videos + Data Science https://bit.ly/Master_Python_34\n\n➡️ New C++ Programming Bootcamp Series for $9.99 : Over 23 Hrs + 53 Videos + Quizzes + Graded Assignments + New Videos Every Month https://bit.ly/C_Course_34",
