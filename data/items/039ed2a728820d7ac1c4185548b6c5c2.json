    "media:description": "An overview of the 2022 Montana flooding and what's next for Yellowstone National Park.\nðŸ“… Sign up for 80,000 Hours for help finding an impactful and rewarding career today: https://www.80000hours.org/practicalengineering\n\nErrata: At 8:53, the bridge shown in the photo is the Gardner River Bridge, not the Yellowstone River Bridge slated for replacement.\n\nIn June of 2022, many tourists and residents of the Yellowstone National Park area found themselves at ground zero of a natural disaster. Torrential rainfall in Wyoming and Montana brought widespread flooding to the streams and rivers that flow through this treasured landscape and beyond. How will the National Park Service Rebuild? Hasty engineering of large infrastructure can be extremely damaging to natural systems like those in Yellowstone, and you donâ€™t want to invest millions of dollars into repairs that might be subject to similar flooding in the future. After all, we build parks (and roads to parks) to get closer to the natural environment and all its wildness, and thereâ€™s almost nothing more natural or wild than a flood.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
