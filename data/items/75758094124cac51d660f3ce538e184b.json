J.C. is pure technician - caring not a whit about any of the news, but instead purely focused on what the charts are saying. And what is he hearing?

This sort of pattern typically resolves in a continuation of the previous trend - meaning a fresh bull run lays ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Making Parets even more optimistic is market sentiment. He notes that pessimism today - with equity markets globally more or less at all-time highs - is greater than it was last December, when markets were falling apart. Strong price action alongside terrible market sentiment is a \"killer combination,\" he says.</p>\n\n<p>It's not just stocks. Bitcoin, gold, and the dollar also have price charts, and J.C. has interesting outlooks on all three.</p>\n\n<p>Ahead of the chat with Parets, Task and Alpher mull last week's surprisingly hawkish comments from the usually dovish Chicago Fed President Charles Evans.
