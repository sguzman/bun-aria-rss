  "description": "<p>The gang’s all here! Phil, Skye, Christian, & Kaitlyn are all in the studio for the first time ever to record this very special episode of the Holy Post. They retell the show’s origin story dating all the way to Phil’s talkshow dreams in the 1980s, how that accidentally gave rise to VeggieTales, why Skye got roped into the scheme, how Christian went from TV producer to podcast co-host, and how Kaitlyn is leveraging her new Holy Post notoriety. The crew then countdown the Top 10 stories of the last 10 years, and speculate about what the future holds for faith in America. Featuring original songs by Phil, voice messages from the audience, and a mythological Inuit knife, this is an episode for the ages!</p> <p>Holy Post Quiz Show: <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgIOoK0BpkY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgIOoK0BpkY</a></p> <p>Holy Post Patreon (now with book club!): patreon.com/holypost</p> <p>Episode 500 merch: holypost.com/shop</p> <p>Special thanks to: Waylon Klix, creator of brick characters included on episode 500 art card and in the video; Ellie Kleinsasser, creator of episode 500 merch design; and all our Patreon supporters who submitted voice messages!
