  "description": "Jessi Alexander is the type of songwriting talent that only comes around once in awhile. She's penned \"I Drive Your Truck\" recorded by Lee Brice, which won Song of the Year from the 2013 CMA Awards, 2014 ACM Awards and 2013 NSAI Awards. Jessi also wrote the hit No. 1 Blake Shelton songs  \"Mine Would Be You\" and \"Drink On It,\" as well as Miley Cyrus' \"The Climb,\" which became the anthem for her box office hit \"The Hannah Montana Movie\" and won the 2009 MTV Movie Awards 'Best Song From A Movie'. \n\nIn addition, she's written songs for Tim McGraw, Celine Dion, Dierks Bentley, Miranda Lambert, Thomas Rhett, Trisha Yearwood, and Ashley Monroe, among others.\n\nHit after hit, Jessi's become the envy of songwriting Nashville. Now after all the songwriting cred, Jessi launches her own album, Decatur County Red, with a song called 'Momma Drank.' \n\nJessi's a huge bourbon fan!\n\nIn this interview, Jessi drinks the last of Fred's King of Kentucky and gives him all the secrets to the songwriting trade. \n\nJessi Alexander on Spotify \n\nJessie Alexander on Apple Music\n\nFollow Jessi\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jessilalexander/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JessiLAlexander/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JessiLAlexander\n\nSponsors\n\n291 Colorado Whiskey: https://distillery291.com/ \n\nMichter's: https://michters.com/ \n\nB-Line (Northern Kentucky Bourbon Trail): https://findyoursippingpoint.com/ \n\nFOLLOW FRED\n\nNew Podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fred-minnick-show-podcast/id1490483021 \n\nFree Drinks Newsletter: https://www.fredminnick.com \n\nBourbon Plus: https://BourbonPlus.com \n\nSpirits Network: https://explore.spiritsnetwork.com/fredvip/ \n\nBourbon Pursuit: https://BourbonPursuit.com \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fredminnick/ \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/fred.minnick/ \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FredMinnick \n\nBooks: https://www.amazon.com/Fred-Minnick/e/B002N1IVXW?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1&qid=1581362119&sr=8-1\n\n \n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
