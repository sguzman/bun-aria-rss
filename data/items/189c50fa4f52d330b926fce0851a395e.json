Next, current QB Coach for the Bucs, former QB Coach of Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck, and Pat, Clyde Christensen joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about preparation for this week, what it's like coaching Tom Brady, the differences between the styles of Brady and Manning, how too much coaching can be a bad thing in the two weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, and much more (42:42-1:12:02).
