  "description": "<p>Americans spend WAY too much on groceries! After housing and transportation, we spend more money on food than anything else- close to 15% of our expenses. On a recent episode Matt mentioned how his family eats on $1 per person per meal, and so we figured it was time to spend an entire episode discussing how you can cut your grocery bill like crazy! If you’re not really into cooking we give some very easy and helpful tips that you can start trying out today, but we also talk about some more advanced and cost savings ways of putting meals together if you’re ready to take it to the next level.</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we enjoyed a Darkness by Surly Brewing Company which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. A huge thanks to listener Mike in Minnesota for donating this beer and supporting the show!
