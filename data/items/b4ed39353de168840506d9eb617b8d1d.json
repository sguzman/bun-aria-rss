  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrat Party doesn’t stand for Americanism, it stands for violence. As the list of statues coming down increases, the list of statues toppled still doesn't include any segregationists like Woodrow Wilson, FDR, or Robert Byrd. Also, Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer are stopping an African American Congressman Jim Clyburn from becoming Speaker — so why exactly are they standing in his way? Yet, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries says that a Black Speaker of the House is not needed and that Pelosi is “legendary.” Then, education has become indoctrination. It’s why the Black Lives Matters Marxists are solidly behind Joe Biden in 2020, despite his support for segregationists. As if knowledge has been purged and replaced with brainwashing to reinforce a leftist viewpoint. They are cherry-picking history to form a monopoly of ideology, to never be challenged by debate or discussion. Later, radical activist Shaun King says that statues of Jesus Christ should come down if they're White and have European features. This insanity would cross a line that would be very bad. Mobs should not unlawfully pull down any monuments. Afterward, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy calls the show to discuss Republican support for Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to annex portions of Palestinian territory in the West Bank.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
