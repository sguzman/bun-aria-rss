We review the film “Nitram” starring Caleb Landry Jones, Judy Davis and Anthony LaPaglia. This disturbing but important film is based on the horrific mass shooting massacre that happened in Port Arthur, Tasmania on April 28th, 1996 — that killed 35 people and wounded 23 others. The film spotlights the behavior of the lone shooter leading up to the murders and highlights several opportunities of intervention that might have derailed his terrifying plan. Joining us is Dr. Tim Watson-Munro, a renowned forensic psychologist who has analyzed the minds of some of the worst criminals of our times.&nbsp;Dr. Tim is not only an expert on mass shooters, but he actually treated many of the victims who survived the Port Arthur attack.
