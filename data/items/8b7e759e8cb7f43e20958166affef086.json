A specialized unit within a police force, they more often resemble tactically equipped soldiers rather than  a  normal street police officer. These units are trained to handle situations beyond the capabilities of standard police departments. Using military grade weaponry and equipment, these  tactical units are able to tackle counterterrorism operations, hostage situations, dangerous search and arrest warrants, and other dangerous situations that are threatening public order. \n\n2nd Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPdc6bs3I8s6Y4QE_3g3MZw\nBecome a Simple History member: https://www.youtube.com/simplehistory/join\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/simplehistory\n\nCopyright: DO NOT translate and re-upload our content on Youtube or other social media.\n\nSIMPLE HISTORY MERCHANDISE \n\nGet the Simple History books on Amazon: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner-%60/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\nT-Shirts\n\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/simple-history-official-merch\n\nSimple history gives you the facts, simple!\n\nSee the book collection here:\n\nAmazon USA\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nAmazon UK\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Simple-History-549437675141192/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SimpleHistoryYT\n\n\nCredit:\nCreated by Daniel Turner (B.A. (Hons) in History, University College London) \n\nNarrator:\n\nChris Kane\nhttps://vocalforge.com/",
