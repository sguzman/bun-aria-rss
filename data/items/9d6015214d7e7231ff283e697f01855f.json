About 50% more volume for considerably more than 2&#xD7; the power isn't a bad deal!)</p><p>I chose the Streacom DA2 as my personal build, because after experimenting heavily with the DAN A4 SFX, I realized you need more room to deal with extremely powerful CPUs and GPUs in this form factor, and I wanted a truly powerful system:</p><ul><li>Intel <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/core/i9-processors/i9-9900ks.html\">i9-9900KS</a> (8 core, 16 thread, 5.0 GHz) CPU </li><li>Samsung 970 PRO 1TB / Samsung 970 EVO 2TB / Samsung 860 QVO 4TB SATA</li><li>64GB DDR4-3000</li><li><a href=\"http://www.cryorig.com/h7.php\">Cryorig H7</a> cooler (exact fit)</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU</li></ul><p>Compared to my old 2015-2017 system, a slightly overclocked i7-7700k, that at least gives me 2&#xD7; the cores (and faster cores, both in clock rate and IPC), 2&#xD7; the memory, and 2&#xD7; the M.2 slots (two versus one).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2020/04/streacom-da2-9900ks-stats.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>The DA2 is a clever case though less perfect than the A4-SFX. What's neat about it is the hybrid open-air design (on the top and bottom) plus the versatile horizontal and vertical bracket system interior. Per <a href=\"https://streacom.com/downloads/ug/da2-user-guide-180901.pdf\">the manual (pdf)</a>:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2020/04/streacom-da2-overview.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Check out all the bracket mounting options. Incredibly versatile, and easy to manipulate with the captured nut and bolt design:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2020/04/streacom-da2-bracket-options.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Note that you can (and really <em>should</em>) pop out the top and bottom acrylic pieces with the mesh dust net.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2020/04/streacom-da2-dust-nets.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>I had <strong>dramatically better temperatures</strong> after I did this, and it also made the build easier since the case can fully \"breathe\" through the top and bottom. You'll note that the front of the DA2 is totally solid, no air holes, so you do need that extra airflow.</p><p>I only have a few criticisms of this Streacom DA2 case:</p><ul><li>The side panels are tool free, which is excellent, but the pressure fit makes them fairly difficult to remove. Feels like this could be tweaked?</li><li>(Don't even think about using a full sized ATX power supply. In theory it is supported, but the build becomes so much more difficult. Use a SFX power supply, which you'd expect to do for a mini-ITX build anyway.)</li><li>My primary complaint is that the <strong>power extension cable gets in the way</strong>. I had to remove it and re-attach it during my build. They should custom route the power cable upwards so it blocks less stuff.</li><li>Less of a criticism and more of an observation: if your build uses a powerful GPU and CPU, you'll need two case fans. There's mounting points for a 92mm fan in the rear, and the bracket system makes it easy to mount a 140mm fan blowing inward. You will definitely need both fans!</li></ul><p>Here's the configuration I recommend, open on both the top and bottom for maximum airflow, with three fans total:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2020/04/streacom-da2-fan-config.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>If you are a water cooling kind of person &#x2013; I am definitely not, I experienced one too many traumatic cooling fluid leaks in the early 2000s &#x2013; then you will use that 140mm space for the radiator.</p><p>I have definitely <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/is-your-computer-stable/\">burn-in tested this machine</a>, as I do all systems I build, and it passed with flying colors. But to be honest, if you expect to be under full CPU and GPU loads for extended periods of time you <em>might</em> need to switch to water cooling due to the space constraints. (Or pick slightly less powerful components.)</p><p>If you haven't built a PC system recently, it's easier than it has ever been. Heck by the time you install the M.2 drives, memory, CPU, and cooler on the motherboard you're <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/drvb47/your_scientists_were_so_preoccupied_with_whether/\">almost done</a>, these days!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2020/04/open-air-mini-itx-build.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>There are a lot of <a href=\"https://yuel-beast-designs.myshopify.com/products/motif-monument\">interesting compact mini-itx builds</a> out there. Perhaps that's the primary innovation in PC building for 2020 and beyond &#x2013; <strong>packing all that power into less than 20 liters of space! </strong></p><p>Read a <a href=\"https://www.ibidemgroup.com/edu/traduccion-como-construir-minipc/\">Spanish translation of this article here</a>.</p>"
