  "description": "<p>DON’T GET DISTRACTED BY SHINY THINGS. It can be exciting to receive connections to the rich and powerful. Fancy dinners, galas, and White House dinners can be tempting. But if these things are keeping you from accomplishing what you set out to do, you’re better off without them. Money comes with strings. If the people pulling those strings don’t align with your message, that money has too great a cost. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Jacob Lief where he shared what has made his non-profit Ubuntu so successful. Jacob Lief is the Founder and CEO of Ubuntu Education Fund, a non-profit organization that takes vulnerable children living in the townships of Port Elizabeth, South Africa from cradle to career. Ubuntu's programs form an integrated system of medical, health, educational and social services, ensuring that a child who is either orphaned or vulnerable can, after several years, succeed. Jacob has been able to stay focused on one area and one community of people by being consistent about what Ubuntu says yes to. It’s not the most glamorous route, but it’s the most impactful. Learn how to stay disciplined and focused on your goal in Episode 849.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nThe thing that has worked the best for Ubuntu (2:00)<br />\nWhy you sometimes have to say “no” to things (2:30)<br />\nAbout the struggle to keep people interested in your cause (3:00)<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode, check out the video, show notes, and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/849 and follow at instagram.com/lewishowes</p>\n",
