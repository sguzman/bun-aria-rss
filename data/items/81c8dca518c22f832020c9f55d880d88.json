  "description": "What’s Going On? 1969 -1974 (Lighted Square Media, 2015) is Ken Light‘s ninth book. Ken started his professional life as a photojournalist at his college newspaper in 1969 and has developed a career as a documentary photographer who tells stories about social and political life in the United States. Ken is the Reva and David Logan Professor of Photojournalism at the Graduate School of Journalism at U.C. Berkeley and director for its Center for Photography. He was also the co-founder of Fotovision and the International Fund for Documentary photography. What’s Going On? 1969 -1974 is project born out of Ken’s observations that many of the significant politically based movements of our time have their roots, and are mirrored, in the social and cultural landscape of the early 1970s – from the Occupy movement of 2011 to the riots in Ferguson, Missouri and the many forms that Black Lives Matter has taken since the hashtag was first used in 2013.

The timeline describes day by day, year by year the significant incidents that occurred in the United States and shaped Ken’s perception and experience of the time period.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
