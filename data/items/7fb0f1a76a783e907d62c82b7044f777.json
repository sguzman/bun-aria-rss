  "description": "<p>&nbsp;On today’s show, Pat and the guys cover pretty much everything that happened over the weekend. First they are joined by a couple of former greats to break down Wild Card Weekend. Former Colts QB, current cohost of Sunday NFL countdown, and friend of the show, Matt Hasselbeck calls in. They cover the Colts victory over the Titans in Houston, how they’ll fare against the Chiefs, what he thinks of Patrick Mahomes no look passing, and why guys like Tom Brady and Drew Brees play winning football in the playoffs (4:44-19:36). Next, 2x All-Pro, creator of the Lights Out clothing brand, potential future MMA fighter and friend of the show, Shawne Merriman calls in. They chat about the Chargers moving on and why he thinks this might be their year, and also gives his take on why the Patriots may be dead. He also talks about what he’s been doing off field, ranging from his clothing brand to fighting MMA, and does a little lightning round to answer the guys’ questions (19:37-42:11). Later the guys dive deeper into everything that happened on Wild Card weekend and what it means moving forward for the rest of the playoffs. They close out the show by talking a little Golden Globes, and making a few suggestions on how it could be better in the future, and looks ahead to who they think may potentially be hosting the Oscars. It’s a good one, come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
