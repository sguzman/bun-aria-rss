  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys chat about the side show that was the House Oversight Committee's hearing on the Washington Commanders work place culture, if that's politics in general, and what it all means. Joining the show to parse through everything that was said in the House Oversight Meeting and whether we'll ever get any real answers from the whole situation is the Neuralink, NFL Insider for the NFL Network, Tom Pelissero (17:02-48:02). Later, 13 year NHL veteran at Goalie, NHL Insider for NHL Network and ESPN, Kevin \"Weekesy\" Weekes joins the progrum to chat about tonight's Stanley Cup Finals Game 4, what we can expect, when a goalie knows whether or not he has it, how the ice conditions are in Tampa compared to Colorado, who he likes in tonight's game and ultimately the series, and he gives the boys a nice little tour of Amalie Arena (1:08:06-1:25:14). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show, and listen on Sirius XM Channel 82, Mad Dog Radio. We appreciate the hell out of all you. See you tomorrow, cheers.</p>\n",
