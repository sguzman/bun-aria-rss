  "description": "This is a complex moment for America and for the world. It is a far cry from the euphoria of the immediate post-Cold War, tech boom era. But there were foreshadowings we would grapple with today's problems and three-time Pulitzer Prize Winner, NY Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman identified them more than two decades ago in his book \"The Lexus and the Olive Tree.\" We talk with Tom about how we got from then to now and where potential answers to the challenges we face may lie...including why Joe Biden may be precisely the man the world and the US need in the Oval Office right now. It's a must-listen conversation. Join us.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
