  "description": "<p class=\"\">The Panpsycast is now five years old. In which time, we have never failed to release a weekly instalment of the show. We’re exceptionally proud of what we’ve accomplished with your support. From our audiobook and upcoming book series to our big interviews and collaborations with leading organisations – it’s incredible that so many of you tune in week in, week out and support us on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/panpsycast\">Patreon</a>.</p> <p class=\"\">Producing the podcast takes a lot of work, and every project has its peaks and valleys. The beginning of the pandemic marked a difficult time for us behind the scenes, and we’ve reached a point where we need to take a short step back.</p> <p class=\"\">So, The Panpsycast will be taking a break; set to return on November 7th, 2021. </p> <p class=\"\">Throughout our hiatus, we’ll be pausing all Patreon payments. So, for August, September, and October, you won’t be charged anything if you’ve already pledged your support. We hope that you’ll stick around so we can keep producing the show when we return, and we’re incredibly grateful for your patience and understanding.</p> <p class=\"\">If you’re missing us over the next three months, we’ve got over 250 instalments of the show in our back-catalogue, a 24-chapter Christianity audiobook on our website, and absolutely loads of bonus content over on our Patreon – including heaps of After Shows and insider interviews. If you’ve already been through our content… then, wow! You should really check out <a href= \"https://philosophybites.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Philosophy Bites</a>… just kidding. We’re incredibly grateful for your support and hope the content we’ve released will inspire you to hit the book shops whilst we’re away.</p> <p class=\"\">We know how much the show means to so many of you, and we haven’t taken this decision lightly. Producing the show means so much to all of us, and we can’t wait to get back. </p> <p class=\"\">We’ll see you back here on <strong>November 7th, 2021</strong>.</p> <p class=\"\">___</p> <p class=\"\">‘The Cave’, written and performed by Andrew Horton.</p>",
