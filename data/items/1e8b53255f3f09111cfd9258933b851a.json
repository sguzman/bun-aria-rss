Maybe he’s always on time and you tend to run a few minutes behind? If you’ve ever wondered if you’re the only ones who seem frustrated by these differences, Jordan is here to tell you that’s simply not true, sister. On this special episode, Jordan brings on her husband, Matt, as they discuss tangible tips on how to play to your strengths, overcome weaknesses, and turn those frustrations into fruitful solutions. And you may find yourself just walking away with some tidbits on how to navigate those work, friend, and family relationships, too.</p>  <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/jordanleedooley\" target=\"_blank\">@jordanleedooley</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/shepodcast\" target=\"_blank\">@shepodcast</a></p>  <p>Episode Details: <a href=\"https://jordanleedooley.com/play-to-your-different-strengths-weaknesses/\" target=\"_blank\">https://jordanleedooley.com/play-to-your-different-strengths-weaknesses/</a></p>  <p>The SHE Podcast is a part of the Lasting Media network of podcasts.
