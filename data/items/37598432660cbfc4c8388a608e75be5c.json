  "description": "<p>Often when we discuss health care reform, we're talking about issues of accessibility and affordability. It is assumed American medicine is great, top notch. The only problem is how expensive it is and how broken the insurance networks are. But patients with pain, headaches, chronic illness are too often not only not cared for in American medicine but mistreated. Cassie Thornton talks with Jessa about what a new form of care might look like, and how the pandemic and its long haulers are making this conversation urgent. (Just a note: there were connection issues, audio is a little janky at points.) </p> <p>Support this podcast: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/publicintellectual\">http://patreon.com/publicintellectual</a></p> <p>http://jessacrispin.com</p>",
