It’s important to consider all of these additional costs that tag along when making purchases, and not just the initial sticker price. In this episode we explain how there are hard secondary costs and then how there are soft or lifestyle secondary costs which are similar to lifestyle creep. And then finally, we go over some helpful and specific tips to remember when making purchases or financial decisions. Keeping all this in mind will help us to manage our money better, specifically when it comes to our spending because everything really does cost more than you think.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Pretty Willie’s Imperial Stout by Against the Grain which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
