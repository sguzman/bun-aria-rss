  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">“What really happened?” That’s a question many people bring to their reading of the Gospels. As a result, some Christians stitch together divergent accounts from Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John to create a single narrative of Jesus’ life and ministry. According to Juan Hernandez, professor of biblical studies at Bethel University, this is a huge mistake. He talks with Skye about common errors we make when reading the gospels and why we must understand them literarily and not just literally. Also in this episode: Russian priests bomb a city with holy water to stop the drinking and fornication. Skye supports a mass wedding at a Dallas megachurch for cohabitating couples. The Methodists are planning a split over LGBT ordination. One writer believes 2016 marks the biggest crisis for evangelicals since the Scopes Monkey Trial in 1925. And Phil bends the knee to the invisible hand of the almighty Bezos.</p>",
