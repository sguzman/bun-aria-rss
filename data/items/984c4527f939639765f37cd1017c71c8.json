  "description": "As Fall finally arrives and brings with it the deaths of millions upon millions of poor, innocent leaves, let's take a moment to reflect on the comedic genius that is Macy Rodamn's Caitlyn Jenner impersonation. As the Bald creative team puts the finishing touches on the next great American novel, we revisit the time that artist, singer, actor, and IGTV Hall of Famer Macy Rodman joined the girls in the studio to discuss her Caitlyn Jenner Impersonation, Lana Del Rey-fueled Twitter Mobs, and the absolute insanity of Wendy Williams. This one was all over the place topic-wise, but it's not about the destination. It's about the journey, folks.\n\nFollow Macy: @MacyRodman\nFollow Macy/Caitlyn Jenner Updates: @CaitUpdate\nFollow Trixie: @TrixieMattel\nFollow Katya: @Katya_Zamo\n\n\nTo listen to our podcast on YouTube: http://bit.ly/TrixieKatyaYT\n\n\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the podcast for free wherever you're listening or by using this link: http://bit.ly/baldandthebeautifulpodcast\n\n\nIf you want to support the show, and get all the episodes ad-free go to https://thebaldandthebeautiful.supercast.com/\n\n\nIf you like the show, telling a friend about it would be helpful!
