  "description": "<p>We’re back into the cold of winter today as we bring you an amazing chat with two-time Australian Olympian in the sport of Alpine Skiing, Greta Small! We learn from Greta how having plastic skis strapped to her feet at the age of two helped her on a journey to being a two-time Olympian and just what other unique sports she participated in as a child. We also learn more about her experiences at the first ever Winter Youth Olympics in 2012 and how that lead to a meeting with the IOC President Thomas Bach (Olympic Champion, Fencing). Added to this we learn about what prize she won for winning a race that is maybe the greatest prize ever won by an athlete and just how she is tracking ahead of the 2022 Olympics. It’s an epic chat that you will want to listen to over and over again, so get to it!</p>",
