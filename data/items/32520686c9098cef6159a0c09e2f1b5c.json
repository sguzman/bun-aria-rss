  "description": "While you were busy fretting about Nazis and the sudden implosion of Donald J. Trump, the Deep State Radio team maintained its steady focus on nuclear apocalypse. With David still away in an undisclosed location, Rosa, Kori and special guests Jeffrey Lewis and Alice Hunt Friend wonder about Trump and the nuclear codes, and argue about whether military personnel have a duty to obey a presidential order to launch a preemptive nuclear strike, or a duty to disobey. Moving along, they ask whether the Iran deal is on the chopping block, when Japan and South Korea will demand nukes of their own, and why everyone seems to have lost interest in Pakistan.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
