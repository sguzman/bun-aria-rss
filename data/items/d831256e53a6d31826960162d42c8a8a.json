  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week on The First Run, Chris and Matt catch up with another movie Matt has never heard of with George Miller’s (yes, that George Miller) ‘Three Thousand Years of Longing’. Tilda Swinton plays a scholar that specializes in storytelling, of legend and myth. She finds a bottle and releases an honest to goodness Jinn, played by the overly handsome DJ Idris Elba. So what wishes will be granted? And what stories will be told? Then it’s time to wrap up the Malick Marathon with both versions of “documentary”, ‘Voyage of Time’. Malick’s telling of the birth and end of the universe with two distinct versions, one narrated by Cate Blanchette and the other by Brad Pitt. There’s the loving rundown of the big physical media releases for the week and the guys share the Straight to DVD and Streaming Picks of the Week. Finally, Matt and Chris award their personal “best ofs” from the Malick Marathon.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">00:00-11:16: <strong>Intro/Three Thousand Years Of Longing</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">11:17-22:57: <strong>Physical Media Picks & Darkplace(?)</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">23:58-33:22: <strong>Voyage Of Time</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">33:23-42:59: <strong>Malick Marathon Awards</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">43:00-44:41: <strong>Wrap Up</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Theme music by Jamal Malachi Ford-Bey</p>",
