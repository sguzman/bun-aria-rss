  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, many of us are worried that our current lockdown strategy is leading us quickly into an economic collapse unlike anything this country has ever seen. But the left wing media says if you’re worried about the economy in a time like this, then you are a heartless Scrooge putting money over people. That’s nonsense. Also Five Headlines including, for a change of pace, rather than toilet paper, an altercation in a supermarket over Mountain Dew. And a listener writes to explain why I’m wrong in advocating that we open the economy back up to avoid a depression.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
