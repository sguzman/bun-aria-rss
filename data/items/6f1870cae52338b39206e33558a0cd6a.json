  "description": "<p>This week, we go back to a much different time, with a man who had his first boxing match in 1891, after learning to fight against \"hobos\" in train cars at age 13! He wasn't some boring, old timey guy, though. He was a scammer, and a flamboyant fighter, who did many things for the first time. He invented \"your shoes are untied\", then knocking someone out, when they looked down. He employed thumbtacks. He was a part of fixed fights. He did it all. Including appearing in many silent films, and even teaching Charlie Chaplin to box. All of this leads to a terrible murder, of course. A murder that sends him to prison, where he does more interesting things!
