It's actually kind of sad, and we feel bad for her... but not bad enough that we don't give her a good working over on this week's \"Watch What Crappens.\"  Ben Mandelker (twitter.com/bsideblog) and Ronnie Karam (http://trashtalktv.com) are joined again by Katie Cazorla (twitter.com/thepaintednail) to rehash the best moments from \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\" \"Vanderpump Rules,\" and \"Real Housewives of Atlanta.\"  (Sorry, our brains were dead by the time we attempted to talk about \"Shahs of Sunset.\")<br />\nBe sure to listen as we rake Yolanda, Kyle, and Brandi over the coals.  And if you have a passing interest in conjugating some \"verbage,\" be sure to hear our always sunny take on \"Vanderpump Rules.\"  Finally, we bust out the Momma Joyce and Kandi voices for some good ol' fashioned fun on \"Atlanta.\"  Come listen everyone!<br />\nOh and enjoy our stupid new theme song!<br />\nCheck out our Facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/watchwhatcrappens) for announcements and to hang out with us and other listeners.
