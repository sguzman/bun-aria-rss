  "description": "Rachel was just 19 when she vanished while jogging in her quiet neighborhood in Georgetown, Texas.  Fifteen years later, her disappearance is still a mystery.  Many people witnessed Rachel running that morning but no one witnessed what happened to her.  Was she abducted by a stranger or did someone she know have a motive to harm her?  There will be a memorial run for Rachel this weekend.
