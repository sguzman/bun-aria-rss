In “Hope Is In Our DNA,” Lisa Harper teaches on some of the most “hopeless” passages in the Bible <em>—</em> only to show that hope is often where we least expect it.</p>\n<p>From the Garden of Eden to King David to Jesus Himself, Lisa reveals how, just when you think nothing can change, God can change everything. And when things seem dark and we feel alone and we’re not sure how things are ever going to get better... He is there with restoration, redemption, and hope.</p>\n",
