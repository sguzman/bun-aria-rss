  "description": "<p>On this week's episode, the duo is joined by none other than Dustin Ross, 1/3 of the Friend Zone Podcast and co-host of Keepin it Bute with Star Brim. The three of them catch up with one another before digging into the issue in the community we have with the respect of trans women and the men who love them. The three amigos then dig into a somewhat odd kink of the week and boy do the jokes fly!! (We apologize if anyone felt offended during this segment this week) For this week's Whoreible Decision, the ladies use assistance from Dustin with trying to break down dating terms and their actual meanings. Could it be possible that we just all don't know what the hell we are doing with dating? Why can't we have universal meanings for these terms?
