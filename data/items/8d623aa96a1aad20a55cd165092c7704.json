  "description": "Contrary to Mars Hill lore, Mark Driscoll didn’t plant his church alone. Though he prized the image of a solo, entrepreneurial pastor, Driscoll found early success thanks to two co-planters, a sending church, and a network of support. And three thousand miles away in Boca Raton, Florida, the concept of the Acts 29 church network was already taking shape as an offshoot of the Spanish River Church Planting Network.\nChurch planting requires a certain audacity, and in the early 1970’s nobody had more than David Nicholas. Founder of Spanish River Church, David’s burden for evangelism took shape in mentoring relationships with pastors starting congregations of their own. A planter himself, David empathized with those who felt lonely in that particular calling, and he sought to encourage and empower leaders by offering them community -- a network in which they could receive the care, training and accountability to do their jobs well. \nIn this episode of The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill, host Mike Cosper invites us into the room with David Nicholas and Mark Driscoll -- two church planters with widely divergent visions for what constituted successful church growth. Tracing the Acts 29 network from its beginnings, Cosper asks whether any leadership potential is worth overlooking red flags, and whether the broader church actually has what it takes to mentor young leaders with issues of character. \n“The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill” is a production of Christianity Today\nExecutive Producer: Erik Petrik\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Mike Cosper\nAdditional Editing: Resonate Recordings and Matt Linder\nAssociate Producer: Joy Beth Smith\nMusic, Sound Design, and Mix Engineer: Kate Siefker\nGraphic Design: Bryan Todd\nSocial Media: Nicole Shanks\nEditorial Consultant: Andrea Palpant Dilley\nEditor in Chief: Timothy Dalrymple\nTheme song: “Sticks and Stones” by Kings Kaleidoscope\nClosing song: “Citizens” by Jon Guerra\nLearn more about your ad choices.
