  "description": "The mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, TX has parents and students worried about safety at school. Data gathered by the Washington Post estimates that more than 300,000 students have experienced shootings at school since the 1999 school shooting in Columbine, Colorado. But experts say the impact of school shootings is far more extensive, and even children who don't come into direct contact with violence can be traumatized.<br/><br/>We speak with Hannah Rubin, a 16-year-old activist with March for Our Lives, a youth-led movement pushing for gun control measures.  <br/><br/>In <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this\">participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at considerthis@npr.org.
