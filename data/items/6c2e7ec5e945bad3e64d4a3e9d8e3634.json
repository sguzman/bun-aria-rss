  "description": "Few high-profile musicians fit into the SXSW crowd as seamlessly as Dan Deacon, who doesn't exactly cut a lithe, otherworldly, Mick Jagger-esque figure offstage. But everything about his live show is a raving, raging bundle of surprises: Deacon puts on some of the most rivetingly unpredictable, oddly interactive concerts in the business, whether he's teaching the crowd how to move in choreographed unison or issuing a long spoken riff that somehow invokes both Avatar and the mom from the movie Big. Hear Dan Deacon's set, recorded live from Stubbs during SXSW on March 14, 2012. ",
