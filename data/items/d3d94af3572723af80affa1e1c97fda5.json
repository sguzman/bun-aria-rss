  "description": "<p>There are many hotels in the United States that carry the name Biltmore as part of their title. Three of them are well known for being one of the most haunted locations in their respective states. One of them is the Millineum Biltmore in Los Angeles, which will be an episode of its own one day. Another is the Providence Biltmore and based on its ominous past, that is not surprising. The fancy lobby belies the legends that claim that a Satanist not only financially backed the hotel, but performed rituals within its halls. There are tales of Prohibition fights and murders and people have literally disappeared from the hotel. The stories about this haunted hotel have inspired the likes of Stephen King and Robert Bloch. The Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables also has tales from the days of Prohibition and has a long list of spirits said to be haunting its halls. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Biltmore Hotels in Rhode Island and Florida! The Moment in Oddity features Jeremy Bentham's dead body and This Month in History features the first Income Tax Bill signed into law.</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br /> <br /> Show notes can be found here: http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2020/07/hgb-ep-345-biltmore-hotels.html</p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>The following music is from https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/:</p> <p>\"Vanishing\" by Kevin MacLeod (Moment in Oddity)<br /> \"In Your Arms\" by Kevin MacLeod (This Month in History)</p> <p>License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Tappin' In Manhattan by 5 Alarm Muic</p>",
