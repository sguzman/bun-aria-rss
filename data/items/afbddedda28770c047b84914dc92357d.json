  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, Rep Trey Gowdy is giving bad advice to President Trump by telling him to sit down and speak with Robert Mueller. No sane defense lawyer would suggest that Trump sit down with these prosecutors, who would love to catch him on something. Nothing good can come out of this, especially when we have seen where these investigations have already gone. It's not a matter of what Trump knows, but what the Prosecutor tries to do to Trump. Also, William Jacobson from Legal Insurrection.com calls in to discuss Mueller’s timing on his raid on Paul Manafort’s home. Rod Rosenstein’s secret special counsel memo was written after the feds already raided Paul Manafort’s house. So, Mueller decided to go after an American citizen under the pretenses of authority which are highly questionable. Later, Trump signed a proclamation to send the National Guard to the Mexican border, to help the border agents, which is not extraordinary, it’s been done before. Trump has to draw the line and say these caravans of immigrants won’t be tolerated. We have so many politicians and media hosts who are advocates for lawlessness when it comes to securing our border. If you don’t support the agenda of Al Sharpton, or Tom Perez you’re called a racist. How is it that Trump is racist, as they say? Trump’s policies have done more to help black Americans and other people of color than did President Obama’s.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
