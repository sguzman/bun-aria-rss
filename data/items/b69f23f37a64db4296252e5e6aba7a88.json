  "description": "<p>Derek Du Chesne, President and Chief Growth Officer at Exactus, a company that recently pivoted into the hemp space, tells Rena Sherbill why he's looking forward to industry consolidation. We also discuss what's going to drive exponential growth in the hemp and cannabinoid industry, discovering how different cannabinoids affect us and why CBD is just the tip of the iceberg.
