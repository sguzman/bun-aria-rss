  "description": "<p>Everyone who watches this has one weakness they are aware of. Something they aren't good at. Something they haven't addressed. Everyone. That is the beginning of the process of self-awareness.<br /><br />One of the most important things for me when it comes to running a team is making everyone feel safe. Because when people feel safe, they start telling the truth. And that is an enormous upside in running a business. If everyone can be honest with themselves, be truthful about who they actually are versus who they want to be, that is when the magic happens.<br /><br />This video speaks to all of that, and more. I hope you enjoy it. Let me know in the comments what you think, and would love to hear your story about self-awareness.<br /><br />Music: \"Blessed\" by Wake<br /><a class=\"yt-uix-redirect-link\" dir=\"ltr\" title=\"https://soundcloud.com/alt1985\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/alt1985\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://soundcloud.com/alt1985</a></p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/1826867.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
