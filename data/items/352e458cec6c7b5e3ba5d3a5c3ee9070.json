  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the news that Case Keenum will be starting for the Browns on Thursday Night Football against the Broncos, as the list of players Cleveland won't have continues to grow and grow. They also cover some unrest in Chiefs Kingdom as the war between super fans X-Factor and Red Xtreme wages on. Joining the program to chat about how things are going so far this season fresh off a big win and performance against the Houston Texans, is Colts RB Jonathan Taylor. Pat and Jonathan chat about his relationship with Carson Wentz, the culture in Indy, how he's starting to adapt to the NFL game, the time he's almost certain he saw a UFO, and much more (27:51-42:07). Next, former Head Coach of the Indianapolis Colts, Chuck Pagano joins Pat and AJ for his weekly segment to chat about all the different questionable coaching decisions made in the NFL this week, if he thinks Mike McCarthy is going to clean up some of his decision making, who has the easiest contact to a Head Coach's headset on game day, his thoughts on the Bills going for it on 4th down on Monday Night instead of kicking a field goal and going to overtime, and much more (48:36-1:26:48). Later, NBA Insider for The Athletic and Stadium, Shams Charania, joins the show to get us caught up on what's going on around the NBA including Ben Simmons potentially getting traded, Kyrie maybe never playing a basketball game again, Zion Williamson's weight issues, and ultimately, who is going to win the NBA Title this year (1:28:20-1:41:52). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> and listen every day on Mad Dog Radio, Sirius XM Channel 82. We appreciate you all for listening, come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
