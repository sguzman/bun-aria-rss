But when was the last time you allowed yourself to fail spectacularly—to fail so badly and so openly that you really did learn something?\nToday on Business Casual, we continue our exploration of moonshot ideas with a founder who’s openly done just that...failed. She’s also succeeded, and she’s opening up about the lessons both experiences taught her.\nKathy Hannun is the cofounder and president of Dandelion, a home geothermal company that spun out of Alphabet's X moonshot factory in 2017. She was a Product Manager on the Rapid Evaluation team at X before turning to Dandelion full-time.\nSo yeah. She knows a thing or two about what it takes to succeed and fail spectacularly in moonshots...and anywhere else.",
