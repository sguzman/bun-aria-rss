See you in battle!\n\n'Project 100,000' One of the cruellest most controversial experiments of the Vietnam War in the 1960s..\nPhysical strength, intelligence, and courage might be some of the values generally demanded in the ideal soldier, but in times of war, a desperate country may find that relaxing these conditions is necessary in order to swell its ranks with more troops. Put simply, the  day dreamers who normally sat at the back of  the class now became viable options for military service, to be followed by a few years of brutal combat operations overseas.  The Authorities would find it more convenient looking the other way when someone failed an English paper if they can now be shipped off to fight on the front line of Vietnam.\n\n2nd Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPdc6bs3I8s6Y4QE_3g3MZw\nBecome a Simple History member: https://www.youtube.com/simplehistory/join\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/simplehistory\n\nCopyright: DO NOT translate and re-upload our content on Youtube or other social media.\n\nSIMPLE HISTORY MERCHANDISE \n\nGet the Simple History books on Amazon: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner-%60/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\nT-Shirts\n\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/simple-history-official-merch\n\nSimple history gives you the facts, simple!\n\nSee the book collection here:\n\nAmazon USA\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nAmazon UK\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Simple-History-549437675141192/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SimpleHistoryYT\n\n\nCredit:\nCreated by Daniel Turner (B.A. (Hons) in History, University College London) \nScript: \nNatasha Martell\nLuke Ursone\n\nNarrator:\n\nChris Kane\nhttps://vocalforge.com/",
