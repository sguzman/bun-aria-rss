  "description": "<p>The climate is a complex non-equilibrium dynamical system that relaxes toward\na steady state under the continuous input of solar radiation and dissipative\nmechanisms. The steady state is not necessarily unique. A useful tool to\ndescribe the possible steady states under different forcing is the bifurcation\ndiagram, that reveals the regions of multi-stability, the position of tipping\npoints, and the range of stability of each steady state. However, its\nconstruction is highly time consuming in climate models with a dynamical deep\nocean, interactive ice sheets or carbon cycle, where the relaxation time\nbecomes larger than thousand years. Using a coupled setup of MITgcm, we test\ntwo techniques with complementary advantages. The first is based on the\nintroduction of random fluctuations in the forcing and permits to explore a\nwide part of phase space. The second reconstructs the stable branches and is\nmore precise in finding the position of tipping points.\n</p>",
