In those moments, your willingness to survive, fight back, and come out on the other side unscathed is critical. But, when the odds are stacked against you in the form of corruption that leads to being wrongly convicted and railroaded into a life sentence in prison, it takes an immense amount of resilience and fortitude to strategically plan a way through a broken unjust system. Isaac Wright, Jr. has experienced this first hand after 7 years imprisoned and 9 additional years under investigation after passing the New Jersey State Bar exam. Isaac speaks to patience, calculated moves, and what it takes to turn anger and bitterness into usable skills that have a real impact.   SHOW NOTES: 0:00 | Introduction to Isaac Wright 1:33 | Self Representation And No Believers 3:52 | Having a Voice Most Important 5:07 | Surrounded by Corruption 6:38 | Sentenced but Setting The Next Move 10:45 | Creating New Case Law From Jail 15:44 | Moving Through System As 2 People 18:30 | Managing Emotions In Midst Of Chaos 23:36 | Isaac Defending Self In 3rd Person 29:45 | Running For Mayor of NYC 33:33 | Making Complex Problems Small 44:23 | Breaking Injustice With Minute Details   QUOTES: “Because at that point, I was going to be a slave to somebody else's strategy, somebody else's thought process, and someone else's motives” [2:30]   “The level of corruption that had engulfed me as a young man alone, the book was written before the indictment came down, and that was really my reality.” [5:39]   “My strategy shifted to making sure that when I went to prison, they wasn't going to be able to keep me.
