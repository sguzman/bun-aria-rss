  "description": "The Left has long blamed President Trump for just about every political problem under the sun. They’ve blamed him for the sun itself and how much it’s heating our planet. That’s par for the course. But Trump Derangement Syndrome has now progressed to so advanced a stage that the American Left is blaming President Trump for schoolyard bullying. We will examine who the real bullies are and how they get away with it. Then, Postmodern Pete Buttigieg declares that words have no meaning, everyone comes out as queer, and President Trump pardons a couple of jailbirds.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Michael Knowles Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: KNOWLES and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Knowles\nLearn more about your ad choices.
