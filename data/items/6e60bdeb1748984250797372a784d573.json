  "description": "Before Albert Einstein, our understanding of space, time, and gravity hadn’t really shifted from the theories that Sir Isaac Newton developed in the 1700s. But in 1905, Einstein published his theory of special relativity; he’d discovered that time can warp in the universe. Then, he published his theory of general relativity and gave us a completely new understanding of gravity. These theories liberated scientists, artists, and the public to think in radical new ways.  Peter Galison is a professor at Harvard University in Physics, History of Science, and related areas of Philosophy. Some of his works include the film Ultimate Weapon: The H-bomb Dilemma (2000, Director), and books Einstein’s Clocks and Poincaré’s Maps. His current work focuses on the relationship between the self and modern technologies. See more information on our website, WritLarge.fm. Follow us on Twitter @WritLargePod.
