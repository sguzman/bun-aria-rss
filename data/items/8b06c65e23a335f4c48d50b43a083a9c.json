  "description": "<p>Thirty years ago this week, a little girl in Fort Wayne, Indiana, was abducted, sexually assaulted, murdered and now, forgotten by everyone. It is one of the most horrific crimes we've ever researched, and yet when we ask people if they know about April Tinsley, we only get blank stares. This man, who police believed was local, not only committed the crime, but taunted police and the community for 16 years after. He could still be walking among us - You could very well know him.</p><p> </p><p>For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit <a href=\"https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/\">https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/</a>. </p><p>Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.
