  "description": "There's a hot NEW diet pill! It’s called a toxic relationship - and you probably already take it daily!\n We have a new Sloot in town! This week Sofia is joined by her FAVORITE cousin Anto, who happens to be producer Alex’s older sister. Together the girls open pandora's box by unleashing stories from their most TOXIC relationships. Anto tells us about the time her impoverished ex stole her car and made her perform X-Games moves outside of a Wells Fargo. Sofia then tells us a tale about one of her former Prince Charming’s and a not-so-sweet threesome they had...some real notebook-esque sh*t going on here. The girls then let us in on TWO new hacks about how to achieve your BEST selfie yet, and how to COMPLETELY compromise your partners Instagram. We never said we were the healthiest b*tches out here, but we’re definitely helpful. \nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n Episode promo codes:\nBetter Help: http://www.betterhelp.com/SOFIA\nEarnest: http://www.earnest.com/SOFIA\nMeUndies:  http://www.meundies.com/SOFIA\nHello Fresh: http://www.hellofresh.com/12sofia\nStitch Fix: http://www.stichfix.com/SOFIA\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
