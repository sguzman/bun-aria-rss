Check him out on Twitter at @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/weinrich_noah\">weinrich_noah</a>.</p><p><strong>Noah’s Music Pick</strong>: Weezer<br />What kind of a band starts its career with two stone-cold classic albums, takes a nearly five-year hiatus, and then returns to mixed results for a 20+ year tail? We're about to find out. Covering the good (<i>Maladroit</i>! <i>Everything Will Be Alright In the End</i>!), the bad (<i>Make Believe</i>!) and the ugly (<i>Raditude</i>!), we try to lend some perspective on what made the band great, why perceptions have changed over the years, and what keeps them going.</p><p>Of course, we spend a huge portion of the show discussing Weezer’s twin pillars of excellence: the debut (Blue) and <i>Pinkerton</i>. One beloved from the moment of release and the other taking years for fans and critics to fully appreciate. The response to <i>Pinkerton</i> clearly changed the trajectory of the band and influenced musical decisions for years to come.</p><p>The second self-titled (Green) album heralded a comeback in 2001, but it was a different kind of band, divorced from much of what made the first two albums so consequential. Regardless, fans, some new and some old, embraced most of these sonic moves. There’s lots to discuss about the last 20 years and how Weezer should be considered so long after the early success.</p><p>There’s also Rivers Cuomo’s lyrical journey from sharing ultra-personal thoughts and desires to crafting pop songs from spreadsheets and syllable counts. It’s . . . weird. </p><p>One of the longest-lasting rock bands of the 1990s, but should it be considered one of the best? That question and many more get tackled on this <i>Political Beats.</i></p>\n",
