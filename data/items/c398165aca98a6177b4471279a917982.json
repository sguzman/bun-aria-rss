Estonia joins the UK and the Netherlands in an effort to clarify EU cyber sanctions. But Italy pumps the brakes. (Do Putin's Angels rejoice?) Rick Howard from Palo Alto Networks on exponential technologies, and how they could change the notion of scarcity.\n For links to all of today's stories check our our CyberWire daily news brief: https://thecyberwire.com/issues/issues2018/October/CyberWire_2018_10_15.html\n Support our show",
