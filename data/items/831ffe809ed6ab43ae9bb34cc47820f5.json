  "description": "Guest links at http://blog.patsloan.com/radio-shows/\n-------------------\nTina Curran is an award winning art quilter and designer of some pretty fun project patterns. I first noticed her work when someone share a photo of a quilt they did from her pattern. Tina is known for her use of color both in her art quilts and her patterns.\n---------------\nMary Kerr always comes up with pretty amazing projects, often incorporating vintage textiles and vintage quilts or quilt ‘parts’. You know .. those pieces you made but didn’t use? Quilters have done this for years and Mary takes those parts and uses them in her quilts. Her book ‘Twisted, Modern Quilts with a Vintage Twist’ is brilliant! She not only took quilt parts, made unique tops, but then asked well known quilter to quilt the pieces. She shares their process for taking that blank canvas to the next extraordinary level. I’m excited to hear about the project from Mary and get tips and how to do something like this myself… maybe we’ll even get an insider story out of her.. wink!\n-----------------------\nI’m delighted to have Linda Thielfoldt as my quilt expert joining me every month in 2017. She is an award winning quilter, a teacher, designer, author and she quilts for hire too. But besides all that Linda has a very deep technical knowledge of the quilt making process. Each month we’ll have a chance to dig deep into a topic everyone wants to know about! To kick off the year, we’ll talk about teaching. And more importantly, teaching someone else to quilt so that they love it as much as we do. You are in for a real treat this year getting to know Linda!\n-------------\nThe first show of every year I have the American Patchwork & Quilting editor on the chat about what we’ll find in the issues this 2017! I’ve worked with Jody Sanders for many years and not only is she a great editor, but she is so talented! You should follow her at Instagram to see all her really neat projects.\nvisit American Patchwork & Quilting at http://allpeoplequilt.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/apqmagazine\nVisit host Pat Sloan at http://www.patsloan.com\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
