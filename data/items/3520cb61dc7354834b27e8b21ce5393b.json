  "description": "For the MEGA-Morbid this week Alaina dives into the real life, “Scream” murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart. Cassie was murdered by two friends and classmates, Torey Adamcik and Brian Draper, while she was house sitting in a big house in the middle of nowhere: everyone’s worst fear. These two jerks terrorized Cassie in her final hours all because they wanted to make a movie and know what it felt like to kill someone. Alaina roasts these Billy and Stu wanna-bes almost as hard as BTK as we cover what happened prior to, during and after the murder. <br>\n<br>\nSources:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.thecriminaljournal.com/murder-of-cassie-jo-stoddart-16-year-old-brutally-killed-by-her-classmates-brian-draper-and-torey-michael-adamcik/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thecriminaljournal.com/murder-of-cassie-jo-stoddart-16-year-old-brutally-killed-by-her-classmates-brian-draper-and-torey-michael-adamcik/</a><br>\n<br>\nBailey Sarian!! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qDCRHc7XwA\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qDCRHc7XwA</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.idahostatejournal.com/members/house-where-murder-of-cassie-jo-stoddart-took-place-proving-hard-to-sell/article_57694590-5cdb-11e4-876d-270a4ac0f093.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.idahostatejournal.com/members/house-where-murder-of-cassie-jo-stoddart-took-place-proving-hard-to-sell/article_57694590-5cdb-11e4-876d-270a4ac0f093.html</a><br>\n<br>\nSome of the videos of the killers:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXRYxhN_Rg0\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXRYxhN_Rg0</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR1QRjCU32U99xz2WyAxZWmBuZcF2HezGks4Q9A87YxSl45co0aNwt2LlVI&v=ZXRYxhN_Rg0&feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR1QRjCU32U99xz2WyAxZWmBuZcF2HezGks4Q9A87YxSl45co0aNwt2LlVI&v=ZXRYxhN_Rg0&feature=youtu.be</a>\n\n<br>\n\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:\n<br>\n\nSkylight Frame: Special offer, you can get $10 off your purchase of a Skylight Frame when you go to Skylight <a href=\"http://Frame.com\" target=\"_blank\">Frame.com</a> and enter code MORBID. \n<br>\n\nHelloFresh: Go to <a href=\"http://HelloFresh.com/80morbid\" target=\"_blank\">HelloFresh.com/80morbid</a> and use code 80morbid to get a total of $80 off, including free shipping on your first box.
