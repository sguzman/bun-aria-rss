Hutchinson said that Rudy Giuliani and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows sought pardons.<br/><br/>And, in an interview with NPR's Asma Khalid, Vice President Kamala Harris refused to say whether she supports ending the filibuster — a tool that allows senators to force a 60-vote majority to pass legislation and has stymied the administration's goals. She said that right now, there is not enough support among the party's lawmakers to make that change and that voters who are concerned need to elect more Democrats to Congress.<br/><br/>This episode: White House correspondent Scott Detrow, congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh, senior political editor and correspondent Ron Elving, and White House correspondent Ron Elving.<br/><br/><em>Support the show and unlock sponsor-free listening with a subscription to The NPR Politics Podcast Plus.
