  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we finally descended upon Loudoun County yesterday, my new home, to make our voices heard. Though the school board threw every possible roadblock in the way.

Also, the chairman of the joint chiefs is asked why he won’t resign for his failures in Afghanistan. His answer is less than sufficient. Greta Thunberg babbles incoherently and receives raucous applause. A black teacher in California is not pleased with the special gift basket she's given for being black. And Will Smith says that his open marriage with his wife is perfect, beautiful, and loving. Somehow I doubt that. \nYou petitioned, and we heard you.
