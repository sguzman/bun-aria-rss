Fetterman's wife says, \"Swimming in America is very racist.\" Buck addresses Trump and Twitter: \"I don't think Trump will be able to pull off with the same panache what he did in 2016 without going back on Twitter.\"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
