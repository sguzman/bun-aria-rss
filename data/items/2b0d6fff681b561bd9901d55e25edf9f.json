This questionnaire is used by healthcare providers to evaluate someone’s level of depression and identify resources that would be most suitable to their needs.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_8mXFkkwKF4/YFBHr4rgG0I/AAAAAAAACxI/RyvBqpP7QOc2XrD0oc1d-QjSndlnp0BdACLcBGAsYHQ/s1566/depression-screener-aus-1.gif\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1566\" data-original-width=\"814\" height=\"595\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_8mXFkkwKF4/YFBHr4rgG0I/AAAAAAAACxI/RyvBqpP7QOc2XrD0oc1d-QjSndlnp0BdACLcBGAsYHQ/w309-h595/depression-screener-aus-1.gif\" width=\"309\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div>After completing Google’s new self-assessment, people can see their risk for depression as well as connect with evidence-based resources, crisis hotlines, and additional support from our teams at Black Dog Institute and Lifeline.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>With over 3 million people in Australia living with anxiety or depression, the more access to support that is offered the better. 1 in 5 Aussies will experience symptoms of mental illness in any given year – and roughly 60% of these people won’t seek help. So when organisations take steps to ensure people are aware that support is available and how to access them, we know it will help save lives.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Over the past year, Lifeline’s Volunteer Crisis Supporters have been on the frontline, holding people safe as they battle the invisible effects of disaster – the impact on mental health.  At Lifeline, the ‘new normal’ is responding to over 3,000 calls every day.  That’s a person in crisis now reaching out for support every 30 seconds.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Meanwhile the Black Dog Institute was quick to conduct research on how Australians were coping with the pandemic. Realising three quarters of participants said their mental health had worsened as a result of COVID-19, the medical research institute stepped up support through its online clinic offering telehealth support so everybody has the same access to support, no matter their location in Australia.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Collectively, the Black Dog Institute and Lifeline welcome new resources that help people better understand their condition and empower them to seek out appropriate mental health support services. We are glad to work with Google to extend <a href=\"https://australia.googleblog.com/2017/02/a-remedy-for-your-health-related.html\">existing, clinically-validated tools </a>to meet the needs of Australians, especially during this critical time.   <span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; max-height: 0px; overflow: hidden;\"> <!--INSTRUCTIONS   In order to support google.com/about site blog syndication, fill in the info below (after the example).
