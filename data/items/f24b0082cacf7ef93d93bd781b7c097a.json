  "description": "<p>On The Literary Life podcast today, Angelina Stanford and Cindy Rollins discuss G. K. Chesterton’s essay “A Defence of Penny Dreadfuls.” Before diving in to today’s episode, don’t forget to register for the amazing <a href= \"https://cindyrollins.net/back-to-school-webinar-conference/\">Back to School online conference</a> coming up on August 26-29, 2019!</p> <p>Angelina opens with a brief history of the Victorian era and the more prevalent availability of the novel to the masses. She also gives several examples of the “penny dreadful.” Cindy and Angelina discuss why they agree with Chesterton that people need these simple, even formulaic stories. They remind us that childhood is a time for good books, not a time to worry about reading all the “Great Books.”</p> <p>Another topic that Cindy and Angelina chat about is the importance of developing imagination. They talk about the truth that fiction and story-telling are necessary parts of human culture. Cindy highlights the importance of the heroic adventure stories for boys. Angelina brings out the point that the elite critic is out of touch with the masses who long for stories of good winning over evil. The penny dreadful should not be judged as art, since that was never what it was intended to be.</p> <h3><a href= \"https://www.theliterary.life/summer-of-the-short-story-links/\">Summer of the Short Story:</a></h3> <p>Ep 13: “The Garden Party” by Katherine Mansfield</p> <p>Ep 14: “Adventures of a Shilling” by Joseph Addison</p> <p>Ep 15: “The Necklace” by Guy de Maupassant</p> <p>Ep 16: “Why I Write” by George Orwell</p> <p>Ep 17: “The Celestial Omnibus” by E.
