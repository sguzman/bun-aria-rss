  "description": "<p>Founded in San Francisco in 1948, <a href=\"https://kneedlerfauchere.com/\">Kneedler Fauchere</a> was among the first multiline showrooms in the country. By elevating future icons like Jack Lenor Larsen as well as burgeoning giants like Clarence House and Glant, it came to define the look and shape of the 20th century design industry. Today, Kneedler Fauchere is still going strong, with showrooms in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Denver, and a “house” brand under its umbrella, the home furnishings company Gregorius Pineo. </p><p>On this episode of the podcast, the leadership team of George Massar and Doug Kinzley tell host Dennis Scully the story of their company, and talk about its plans for the future. They explain how Kneedler survived a rebellion among some of its biggest brands, why the rise of Restoration Hardware doesn't concern them and how the company has stayed strong by sticking to the basics, focusing on designers, and keeping things simple. </p><p><i>This episode was sponsored by </i><a href=\"https://www.theshadestore.com/customer-service/to-the-trade\"><i>The Shade Store</i></a><i> and </i><a href=\"www.onsidedoor.com\"><i>SideDoor</i></a><i>.  </i></p>\n",
