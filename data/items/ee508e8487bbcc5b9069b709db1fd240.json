  "description": "Between 1979 and 1981, a handful of girls and young women disappeared around the jolly small town of North Pole, Alaska, only for their remains to show up later. When their cause of deaths matched up, local State Troopers knew they had a serial killer on their hands. And eventually, they flew out of state to track down the man behind it all. This is the story of Glinda Sodemann, Doris Oehring, Wendy Wilson, Marlene Peters, and Lori King, also known as the North Pole Murders.\nBONUS EPISODES\npatreon.com/goingwestpodcast\nCASE SOURCES\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/114362966/glinda-sodemann\n\nhttps://robinbarefield76.medium.com/the-north-pole-murders-2df18db4c864\n\nhttps://www.lelandhale.com/wordpress/murder-alaska-terrible-80s/\n\nhttps://frankweberauthor.com/blog/its-just-another-manic-bunday\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Murder-40-Below-Stories-Alaska/dp/0945397992\n\nhttps://murderpedia.org/male.B/b/bunday-thomas-richard.htm\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt2550860/\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Murder-40-Below-Stories-Alaska/dp/0945397992\nLearn more about your ad choices.
