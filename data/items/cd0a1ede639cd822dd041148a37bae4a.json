  "description": "<p>“Women cheat for emotional connection, men cheat for sex.” “Men are horn dogs, women are frigid.” Heard any of this before? Did you know these are factually untrue? In this fan favorite episode, cultural anthropologist and bestselling author Wednesday Martin joins me to talk about female sexuality research findings, now that more females are entering the field of sex research. Believe me when I say: her revelations will change your life.</p><br><p>Wednesday’s book <em>Untrue: Why Nearly Everything We Believe About Women, Lust, and Infidelity is Wrong and How the New Science Can Set Us Free</em> was a major conversation starter. Today, we’re more open to alternative relationship models, and a huge part of that is because of Wednesday. In this conversation, she debunks the lies we’ve been told for decades about female sexuality, including: men just want to spread their seed, while women want to protect their precious eggs. Wrong! Turns out, monogamy is pretty rough on female desire. How about this one: women cheat because they crave emotional care. Nope! Sometimes, women just want sex with someone new. Finally, how did these lies get started in the first place? Wednesday walks us through the faulty science that got us here, and how accurate measures of female desire are radically changing the way we understand sex – for all genders.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>For More Information About Wednesday Martin:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://wednesdaymartin.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wednesdaymartinphd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wednesdaymartin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Untrue-Everything-Believe-Infidelity-Science/dp/0316463612\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Untrue: Why Nearly Everything We Believe About Women, Lust and Infidelity is Wrong</a></p><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
