  "description": "In the past month, I&rsquo;ve spent some time on my album cover classification project. The goal of this project is for me to learn about deep learning by working on an actual problem. This post covers my progress so far, highlighting lessons that would be useful to others who are getting started with deep learning.\nInitial steps summary The following points were discussed in detail in the previous post on this project."
