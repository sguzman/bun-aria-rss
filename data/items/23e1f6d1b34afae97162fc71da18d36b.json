  "description": "Hey HBs! We're here with an old-but-goody! Back when we were baby podcasters we rang in the new year with Icecapade by Josh Lanyon! Are you in the mood for forbidden love between a jewel thief and the FBI Agent who has tailed him for a decade? Are you ready for that love story to involve llamas? WE ARE! This was a quick little novella, but it was jam-packed with stuff to talk about! \n Someday we'll do a *true* New Years book, because this turned out to be more of A Christmas Carol retelling... not that we noticed at first! We added new banter shouting out many of those who were EMBRACED by us in 2019! Also, the 2020 HB Reading Embrace is live and ready for your eyeballs! \n And head over to our Patreon for our recap and comments on the current RWA/Courtney Milan/Systemic Racism shitshow! \n Self-Love Recommendations: \n - Don't be afraid of a grown up friend sleepover. Erin spent a wonderful weekend with some lady friends in a cabin with board games and it was an experience that fortified the soul. \n - Take some time to do for others. Melody went to an annual party her friend throws where, instead of birthday presents, he requests unwrapped toys to give to the salvation army. She gets a little misty talking about it and reminiscing about other volunteer experiences that have helped her in the process of helping others. \n Patreon Shout Out: \n Lawren G., you are a Billywig, a beautiful Australian insect. You are beautiful, shiny iridescent blue, but you are too fast for the average muggle to see. You have a stinger that is pretty intimidating, but when you sting people, it just makes them so giddy and happy, sometimes even making them fly! You're like a happiness fairy, spreading joy wherever you go.\nMentioned in this episode:\nPreorder Naima Simone X Friends Book Boyfriend Box!!\nThis box has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a book boyfriend from Tessa Bailey, Avery Flynn, Farrah Rochon, Jayci Lee, Kennedy Ryan, Adriana Herrera, and Naima Simone.\nYou can look forward to paperbacks, signed book plates, limited edition book boyfriend mugs, the book boyfriend pajamas/loungewear, bookmarks and more!\nTiers include:\n- Cinnamon Roll - $114.99\n- The Alpha - - $169.99 \nEnter the promo code BONKERS10 at checkout to receive $10 off!!! \nONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT 10, 2022!\nIf you have any questions, email orders@honeymagnolia.co.\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/nsbookboyfriends (Naima's Book Boyfriends)",
