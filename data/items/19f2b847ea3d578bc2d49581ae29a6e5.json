  "description": "<p>A number of recent books, magazines, and television programs have emerged that promise to take viewers inside the exciting world of professional chefs. While media suggest that the occupation is undergoing a transformation, one thing remains clear: being a chef is a decidedly male-dominated job. This week on <em>Eat Your Words</em>, host Cathy Erway is on the line with “Taking the Heat:<br />\nWomen Chefs and Gender Inequality in the Professional Kitchen” co-author Deborah Harris. Deborah goes on to highlight the book, examining big issues like how the world of professional chefs is gendered, what conditions have led to this gender segregation, plus how women chefs feel about their work in relation to men.
