  "description": "<p>Don't forget to subscribe, rate five stars, and leave a review!\n\nWe kick off the episode the same as usual talking about a dream we had where there was a finger shoved up our a**. If you don't remember a dream did you still have a dream? Barstool DVR: We discuss the latest criticisms over The Last Dance and Feits new favorite show Normal People. AITA Thursday returns with pickles & cheese in the fridge, stealing your wife's inheritance, hiring a coworker as a stripper, and pee pee pads. We address the email Dave received from a literal clown attempting to write another hit piece. Voicemails include good or bad dreams, when to ask about stds, and when to share you have talents like Heather Brooke. \n\nPatton Oswalt returns to the show! We discuss his upcoming comedy special 'I Love Everything', his inspiration for the title, the HBO documentary he produced 'I'll Be Gone in the Dark', and much more.\n\nNick Swardson joins the show. We discuss his upcoming Netflix movie The Wrong Missy, a time he elbowed Adam Sandler in the face, and a time him and Danny McBride went to see The Black Swan but decided to go on a little bender instead.\n\nLet us know what you think on twitter: @kfcradio, @kfcbarstool, @feitsbarstool, @pattonoswalt, @nickswardson</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
