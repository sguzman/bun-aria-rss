  "description": "<p>r/Entitledparents In today's episode, we have a chilling story from 2019, before all of the craziness of 2020. OP went on a cruise ship, and also on this cruise ship was an entitled mom and her extremely sick entitled kid. The entitled mom could have made the sick kid stay in his room while he recovered, but nope! She allowed her kid to spread the disease all over the cruise ship until virtually the entire ship was sick. It got so bad that ports wouldn't even allow the ship to dock!</p>\n",
