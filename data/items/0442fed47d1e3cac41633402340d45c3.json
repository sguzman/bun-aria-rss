  "description": "Antiques expert, designer, and author Tara Shaw joins the show to share her passion for antiques and how to decorate with them in our homes. She talks about sourcing antiques, steps for bringing beautiful pieces in our space, and the inspiration behind her new book Soul of the Home: Designing with Antiques. \nWhat You’ll Hear On This Episode:\n\nTara’s new book, Soul of the Home: Designing with Antiques ties in education about designing with antiques and explanations of how furniture that is both old and modern can work together. Take it from us, it will be the kind of book you want to bring out on a relaxing morning and savor with a cup of coffee.\n\nTara’s amazing story of how she made the transition from antique importer to working on Harry Connik Jr.’s home in Connecticut, and how the experience of “doing it afraid” opened the door to take on new clients.\n\nHow she went to school for education, worked in apparel, and ended up in antiques.\n\nWhat an exponent is, and why personal carvings are so special when shopping for the right antique piece.\n\nHow Tara’s suggestion of purchasing one nice piece a year can really lead to an entire home of beautiful antiques after some time.\n\nTara’s real confessions on what she keeps for herself, and how she decides just what items she can’t live without personally.\n\nWhy Tara loves mid-century and how to effortlessly mix different styles of furniture.\n\nWhy she buys mid century and its a good thing to mix with antiquity so it doesn’t feel stale.\n\nA glimpse into Tara’s process of shopping for antique items and bringing them home for her now sought after container parties.\n\nStart with one room and an anchor piece. Take a minute to find your voice and be fearless to execute it.\n\nHow her love of canopy beds and hand forging them keeps artisans in New Orleans employed.\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\n Tara Shaw \nSoul of the Home \n@tarashawdesign\nMatthew Carter Interiors\n\nDecorating Dilemma:\nWe love that you encompass exactly what talk about in this episode - you know what you like and you are fearless about it! This room screams pink and green to Tara, a Palm Beach look that is congruent with the Lily Pulitzer type fabric. It would also look more bespoke if you found trim that you could trim your draperies with, and use a drapery hook with pointy edge rings instead of a clip. Some art that can thread the colors in together would be great, and we love the pink chair.",
