  "title": "180 - Dr. Death: Harold Shipman",
  "description": "<p>Harold Frederick Shipman AKA Dr. Death. Quite possibly the world's most prolific serial killer. From 1975 to 1998, he killed at least 215 people. The real number may be much, much higher. Harold Shipman was a British medical doctor who used the trust his patients placed in him to overdose them with morphine. Most of his victims were elderly. Most also were not terminally ill. He just decided, for reasons only known to him, that it was time for them to go. Head with me to England this week for a look into the life and mind of a very mysterious and quiet killer on another true crime edition of Timesuck. </p>\n<p>Check out Lynze and I's new horror podcast <strong>Scared to Death.</strong> Listen on Spotify, Stitcher, iTunes, Youtube, and more!
