  "title": "Cervidology Part 2 (DEER) with Rhiannons Jakopak & Kirton",
  "description": "<p>The spirited, laughy chatter with a duo of deer scientists named Rhiannon continues in the thrilling conclusion with Part 2. Buckle up for listener questions addressing everything from social structure to hunting to Chronic Wasting Disease to how *not* to hit a deer with your car. Also the weirdest animal fact Alie has ever learned in the history of Ologies. Soul-rattling. And if you missed Part 1, circle back and catch up to learn all about ungulates and deer and moose and elk and fawns and … some Stevie Nicks trivia and Welsh mythology for good measure. These episodes may change the way you look at our furry backyard friends forever. </p>\n<p>Rhiannon Kirton:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rhiannon_kirton\">https://twitter.com/rhiannon_kirton</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rhi_kirton/\">https://www.instagram.com/rhi_kirton/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/blog/rhiannon-kirton/\">https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/blog/rhiannon-kirton/</a></p>\n<p>Rhiannon Jakopak:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rhiacoon\">https://twitter.com/rhiacoon</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rhiacoon/\">https://www.instagram.com/rhiacoon/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jakopakresearch.wordpress.com\">Jakopakresearch.wordpress.com</a></p>\n<p>September 14-19: Black Mammalogists Week:<a href=\"https://blackmammalogists.com/\"> https://blackmammalogists.com/</a></p>\n<p>September 20: Free Atlatl Making Workshop by Angelo Robledo: 9/20, 10am-1pm Pacific Time:<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqLMRT1PPLslrJyG5srbokkWrof3XFujIDEC2RzzrRaQ4LJA/viewform\"> https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqLMRT1PPLslrJyG5srbokkWrof3XFujIDEC2RzzrRaQ4LJA/viewform</a></p>\n<p>A donation went to: The American Society of Mammalogists -- Sponsored Membership Fund:<a href=\"https://asm.wildapricot.org/Donate\"> https://asm.wildapricot.org/Donate</a></p>\n<p>For more links:<a href=\"http://alieward.com/ologies/cervidology\"> alieward.com/ologies/cervidology</a></p>\n<p>“Howdy, I’m John Ware!” kids’ book: https://redbarnbooks.ca/products/john-ware</p>\n<p>Transcripts & bleeped episodes at:<a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-extras\"> alieward.com/ologies-extras</a></p>\n<p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month:<a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\"> www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ologiesmerch.com/\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes and uh...bikinis?
