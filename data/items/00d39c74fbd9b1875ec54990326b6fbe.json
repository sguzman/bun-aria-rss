  "itunes:summary": "My father, like many Jews, never lived in Israel. The Jewish people are scattered all over the world. In 1948 the state of Israel was re-established. Around 7.5 million people live in Israel today, of whom approximately 6 million are Jews. There are many other Jews still scattered around the world today.\nI like how Eugene Peterson translates the New Testament passage for today using the term ‘insiders’ for the Jewish people and ‘outsiders’ for the non-Jewish people.\nMany individual Jews over the years have become Christians. In fact, all the very earliest Christians were Jewish ‘insiders’. But now the vast majority of Christians are non-Jewish ‘outsiders’. What does the future hold for the ‘insiders’?\nThe key to Paul’s understanding lies in Romans 11:29: ‘For God’s gifts and his call are irrevocable.’ This is a theme that runs throughout the Bible as we see in today’s passages.",
