  "description": "Today I will be reviewing Shoe Dog by Phil Knight. An autobiography of the man behind the establishment and growth of Nike, 'Shoe Dog' gives a first-hand look at its trials and tribulations from day one. I was impressed by the detail provided by the author. As such a large brand Nike seems so significant that one person cannot tell a story to define it. However, it is what Knight does exceptionally well in the book. At times it felt like reading fiction. The characterisation of the people that helped bring Nike to its current position, alongside the sadness surrounding Knight's personal life makes the reader emotionally invested in the story. As a fan of stories, sports and business separately, I have never read a book that intertwines all three so brilliantly. If you're a business owner, this book has countless pieces of wisdom. This book is for anyone who is a fan of great stories, sport and business, or all three! There is no doubt that this book is a five-star read.\n\n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
