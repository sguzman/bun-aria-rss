  "title": "Marketplace Roundtable #70: What To Look For In Auto And Transportation, With Doron Levin",
  "description": "Doron Levin joins the Marketplace Roundtable podcast to discuss his views on the transportation sector and picks for 2020 as featured in his Auto/Mobility Investors research service.\nLevin is a longtime journalist covering the auto and transportation sector. Based in Detroit, he focuses on the global automobile \"plus mobility\" industry. This includes not just cars and automotive suppliers, but \"the idea that personal transportation is changing its nature.\" It's not just about car ownership, in fact many people may not even want to own a car at all.\n\"We're really moving to an autonomous future where cars I believe will drive themselves and of course all of this will change the investment picture in the automobile and mobility sector,\" says Levin. This begs the question: How close are we to fully autonomous vehicles? Nobody knows for sure, but advances are being made all the time. Companies to watch are often outside the automobile sector, including Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Intel (INTC) that recently acquired a company called Mobileye. Many are startups.\nWhen it comes to \"traditional\" auto stocks, Levin likes Hyundai Motor Corp. (HYMLF) and is bearish on Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY).\nTopics Covered\n\n1:45 - Background, specifically regarding the auto sector.\n\n5:00 - How close are we to having autonomous vehicles?\n\n8:15 - How does this translate into picking stocks in the auto sector?\n\n11:45 - The future of individual car ownership\n\n16:45 - Short term issues in the auto sector\n\n19:15 - What concerns you?\n\n21:45 - Something that gives you confidence\n\n25:00 - Favorite picks (HYMLF) (INTC) and companies to avoid (NSANY) (RNSDF)",
