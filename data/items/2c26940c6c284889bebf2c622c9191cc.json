  "description": "<p>Napoleon! A man who knew before he died he would be remembered as being one of the most important European leaders in history - and boy was he right. He's regarded by many military historians as being one the best military strategists of all time. Dude was SUPER hard to beat on the battlefield but he was defeated several times - mostly because pretty much every other nation in Europe joined forces and ganged up on France to defeat him. He'd be born on a little island not bothering anyone and he'd die on a little island not bothering anyone over fifty years later. In between - he'd bother a LOT of people. He'd lead millions to their deaths, rise to rule France not once, but twice, and do so, so, so much more. And he's our topic of the week, here on Timesuck!</p>\n<p>Donate to our charity of the month! <strong>Cameron Owens National Fallen Firefighter’s Foundation Stair Climb</strong> <a href=\"http://events.firehero.org/site/TR?px=1053239&fr_id=2061&pg=personal\"><strong>http://events.firehero.org/site/TR?px=1053239&fr_id=2061&pg=personal</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>TEAM MONK GOFUNDME LINK</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/team-monk\"><strong>https://www.gofundme.com/f/team-monk</strong></a></p>\n<p>Upcoming<strong> Happy Murder Tour</strong> <strong>Standup</strong> dates:</p>\n<p><strong>April 11th Des Moines, Iowa</strong> - The Funny Bone <a href=\"http://desmoines.funnybone.com/ShowDetails/3016a329-7cb5-42f5-b12f-8ae6a4bc7d4e/1a2b0b25-ed7e-4180-abd5-8d8f6545ba17/Dan_Cummins__The_Happy_Murder_Tour/Des_Moines\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>April 12-13 Kansas City, Missouri </strong>- The Improv <a href=\"http://www.improvkc.com/Comedian/eb54eeee-6f82-46fa-81f1-66a6f3b315ba/_Dan_Cummins__The_Happy_Murder_Tour_\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p>** <strong>LIVE ANT HILL KIDS CULT TIMESUCK April 14 Nashville - </strong>Zanies <a href=\"http://zaniesnashvilletickets.laughstub.com/event.cfm?cart&id=524467\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix! </p>\n<p><strong>April 26th Dallas, Texas</strong> The Texas Theatre <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dan-cummins-the-happy-murder-tour-tickets-53986076809?aff=aff0bandsintown&comeFrom=242&artist_event_id=100627234&appId=wf_qnaphzzvaf.gi\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>April 27th Houston, Texas </strong>The Secret Group <a href=\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1806509/\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>May 1-4 San Francisco, CA</strong> Punchline Comedy Club <a href=\"http://www.punchlinecomedyclub.com/dancummins\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>May 9-11 Boston, MA</strong> Laugh Boston Comedy Club<a href=\"https://tickets.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?t=tix&w=39e070cdb5cc12c953b435276267bdff&vqitq=108cf05b-9b53-4a52-866e-5fedb74b457e&vqitp=098991a9-9094-4964-99fb-d694a0927b38&vqitts=1543852457&vqitc=vendini&vqite=itl&vqitrt=Safetynet&vqith=fc9553808faff274d5d2830d60e6c945\"><strong> CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>Listen to the best of my standup on Spotify!</strong> (for free!) <a href=\"https://spoti.fi/2Dyy41d\"><strong>https://spoti.fi/2Dyy41d</strong></a></p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you by the following <strong>sponsors</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Indochino!</strong> Get any premium Indochino suit for just $359 at <a href=\"http://Indochino.com\"><strong>Indochino.com</strong></a> when you use the code TIMESUCK at checkout (AND you get free shipping!)</p>\n<p><strong>The Great Courses Plus! </strong>Get your Free Trial, plus 50% off your monthly plan now at <a href=\"http://thegreatcoursesplus.com/TIMESUCK\"><strong>TheGreatCoursesPlus.com/TIMESUCK</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on Youtube!: </strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/xzi_Gu2gwaU\"><strong>https://youtu.be/xzi_Gu2gwaU</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Merch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
