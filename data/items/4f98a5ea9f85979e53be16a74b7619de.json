  "description": "After Brandon Ingram scored 49 points to outduel Donovan Mitchell, we wonder whether it’s realistic to think he’s already better than Ben Simmons and on a path to be in the class of Anthony Davis (1:34). Then, we discuss Zion Williamson’s imminent return and what it could mean for night-to-night interest in the league (13:00). Finally, we close with some thoughts on how Denver has set itself up with a deep roster, and how this year’s NBA draft is shaping up to be a real stinker (29:10).\n\nHosts: Chris Vernon and Kevin O’Connor\n\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
