  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week, we tried something a little different—recording a live interstitial episode! We’re talking about Jen’s formative queen, Julie Garwood, and we dig into dialogue, alphas who are instantly gone for their heroines, heroines who tame wild animals, arranged marriages between children, and why every Garwood historical feels medieval whether or not it actually is. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We recorded this episode live during a Fated States postcard-writing party to get out the vote for the January 5th runoff election in Georgia. If you’re a Georgia voter, please vote for Jon Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock, and let’s finish what we started with the blue wave! If you’re up for it, please consider <a href=\"https://indivisible.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYuceCuqTIvHt1hR31_Xxi19Ew7Pyl0GqOM\">joining us for a phonebanking session on the evening of January 4th</a>!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Next week, in advance of the launch of the Bridgerton series on Netflix (coming December 25th!), we’re reading Sarah’s favorite Julia Quinn novel, <em>The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever</em>.

FWIW, Jen mentioned it in regards to The Bride because Jamie is so isolated and largely without women friends.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/11/25/s0212-lord-of-scoundrels\">We like prologues and epilogues here at Fated Mates</a>, but we understand&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.heavingbosoms.com/\">not everyone</a>&nbsp;agrees.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The feud between the families in The Gift is “<a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/house-of-montague-2985036\">like the Montagues and the Capulets</a>, but worse.” Speaking of which, Kate Clayborn’s upcoming book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3oBmQh2\">Love At First</a>, is an homage to Romeo and Juliet.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This isn't exactly about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/lifespans-of-the-european-elite-8001800/BE252C4B25C4AAC29ED62D591A1675AC\">life expectancy in Scotland was in 1100</a>, but it's close enough.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://vanessariley.com/blackpeople.php\">Vanessa Riley’s site has a great explainer about Black people during the Regency on her site.</a>&nbsp;We talked about the Carribean in the Regency when we read&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/10/7/s025-gentle-rogue\">Gentle Rogue.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It wasn't a \"rip off\" of Home Alone, it was just an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://literarydevices.net/allusion/\">allusion</a>.
