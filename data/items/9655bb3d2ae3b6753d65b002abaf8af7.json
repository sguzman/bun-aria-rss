  "description": "<p>Foxing are a great band. Their new record Dealer made my top 10 list for 2015 so it only made sense to me that I get to know them a bit better. Josh Coll plays bass in the band (and contributes a portion of the lyrics as well) and we spoke one afternoon over Skype. It was a delightful discussion about coping with attention being paid to your band, the military and the Midwest. Please do enjoy. - - This weeks show is brought to you by Adam & Eve want to make your Valentines Day spectacular.
