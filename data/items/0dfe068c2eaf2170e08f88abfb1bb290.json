  "description": "<p>Are GMOs Safe To Eat? | This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://betterhelp.com/drhyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BetterHelp</a></p><br><p>Over twenty years ago, Europe banned genetically modified organisms (GMOs) while the United States went full steam ahead, especially with soybeans and corn. In fact, it’s estimated that about 75 percent of the food in our supermarkets contains genetically modified ingredients. The promise of GMO foods held lots of promise—they would produce high yields, solve our world hunger problems, and be insect resistant, thereby decreasing our dependence on toxic pesticides. But did GMOs live up to their promise? Dr. Hyman explored these topics in his interview with Ocean Robbins.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Ocean Robbins is the author of 31-Day Food Revolution: Heal Your Body, Feel Great, & Transform Your World. He serves as CEO and cofounder of the Food Revolution Network—one of the largest communities of healthy eating advocates on the planet, with more than 500,000 members. Ocean comes from a long line of food-lovers, though they didn’t all necessarily fit the same bill. His grandfather and great-uncle founded Baskin Robbins and his father walked away from the family fortune to pursue a career that promoted a cleaner and more nourishing diet. Ocean continues the legacy his father started by encouraging people to vote with their fork and think of the impacts our food choices have on the environment, socioeconomics, and of course health.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Betterhelp.
