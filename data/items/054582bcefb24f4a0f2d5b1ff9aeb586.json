  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week, we’re talking Superheroes! Why is it so rare to see a great romance in a superhero story? Is there really no room for love and capes? Do heroes eat? (spoiler: obviously) — We’re joined by author Barry Lyga,  a comics and superhero expert, to discuss all this and more…and to chat about the new YA Superhero anthology, Generation Wonder, in which Sarah has a short story (it’s a romance). We also recommend some great superhero romances and comics, because of course we do. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Do yourself a favor — be sure to check out show notes this week. The visuals are a delight.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fated Mates Live, in person, is happening!!! We’ll be in Alexandria, VA on July 30th — join us there!

It will be Saturday evening July 30th in Alexandria. Stay tuned for details. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://barrylyga.com\">Welcome Barry Lyga</a>, comics author and editor of the YA superhero anthology <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3zHfZvl\">Generation Wonder</a>. Sarah has a story in the anthology, and we’ll hope you’ll buy one for the young reader in your life. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There was no kissing in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9419884/\">Doctor Strange</a>, but we’ve been promised there will be in <a href=\"https://thedirect.com/article/thor-4-captain-marvel-valkyrie-rumors-lgbtq-relationship\">Thor: Love and Thunder</a>. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/thor-love-and-thunder-mills-and-boon-inspiration-mcu/\">Taika Waititi said Mills & Boon</a>, so...that's official.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Back in the day, romance comics were just as popular as superhero comics. Check out the site <a href=\"https://www.sequentialcrush.com\">Sequential Crush</a> to see the history of romance comics. If after this episode you think you might want to check out more comics, Suzanne’s site <a href=\"http://www.loveinpanels.com\">Love in Panels</a> is the best place to start. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Comics writer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markwaid\">Mark Waid</a> wrote about manhood and comics in an essay that is no longer available online, but Mark is also the author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3QpUrJx\">Irredeemable</a>, a comic about Superman turning villainous. Another essay about how modern superhero movies are romance and sex-free is called <a href=\"https://bloodknife.com/everyone-beautiful-no-one-horny/\">Everyone is Beautiful and No One is Horny.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you have little kids, check out <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3MSKlOy\">the Mia Mayhem series</a> of graphic novels. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/heaving-bosoms-578005/episodes/ep-91-cinnamon-blade-knife-in-41489348\">Jen was on Heaving Bosoms to discuss Cinnamon Blade.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The TV Show about the superheroes going to work is called <a href=\"https://collider.com/the-boys-series-different-from-comics/\">The Boys.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Exactly one year ago (well, one year ago yesterday), Justin Halpern and Patrick Schumacker, co-creators of the DC Entertainment-HBO Max adult animated series “Harley Quinn,” told <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/tv/features/subverting-superhero-tv-wandavision-harley-quinn-umbrella-academy-1234992069/\">Variety</a> that DC Comics removed a scene from the show of Batman \"dining feline\" (h/t <a href=\"https://bleedingcool.com/tv/dc-tells-harley-quinn-eps-batman-doesnt-dine-feline-selfish-lover/\">bleedingcool</a> for this delightful euphemism), saying \"Heroes don't do that.\" As is right and just, the internet disagreed and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=top&q=%23heroeswhoeat&src=typed_query\">#HeroesWhoEat</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=top&q=%23batmangoesdown&src=typed_query\">#BatmanGoesDown</a> were born. It was a great day.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">For what it's worth, it wasn't just the internet that disagreed. Zach Snyder confirmed that Batman in fact <em>does</em> eat, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pikaso_me/status/1407034041598050304/photo/1\">one of the greatest tweets of all time</a>. At least, we think so. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/1405702805948538881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1405702805948538881%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleedingcool.com%2Fcomics%2Fdc-removes-zack-snyder-cut-of-batman-going-down-on-catwoman%2F\">DC apparently did not care for it</a>. While we like Snyder's version very much, here are some other NSFW images we like almost as much (eye headphones in): From artist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mrs_Van_Damn/status/1406701910644625408\">@Mrs_Van_Damn</a>; commentary from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realAgdtwinkie/status/1405428794568044558\">@realAgdtwinkie</a>; from artist (with excellent commentary) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArtKhobra/status/1406120646342553600\">@ArtKhobra</a>; and this one, from artist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rpace/status/1486066384090058756\">@rpace</a>, with special love for the pegging crew.</p>",
