  "title": "Dungeons & Dragons, Drunk Tom Brady, And Russell Wilson Being A Weirdo",
  "description": "<p>Tom Brady got drunk on a boat (as he should have) and we recap the Bucs parade and lingering funny story lines from the Super Bowl (10:19). Russell Wilson clearly wants a trade after his Dan Patrick Show appearance and the GQ article (10:19 - 25:37). Urban Meyer take swap (25:37 - 30:52). Timm Woods is back and we continue our saga on Dungeons and Dragons with some incredible current events woven into the story (30:52 - 93:27). We finish with Fyre Fest of the week.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
