  "description": "<p>What Is Your Mouth Telling You About Your Overall Health? | This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://athleticgreens.com/hyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Athletic Greens</a></p><br><p>Traditional medicine approaches the body by isolating single organs and dividing them up into medical specialties. Yet, by seeking to identify the root cause of symptoms and correcting imbalances, long-lasting healing can be attained. It comes as no surprise then that oral health is connected to full-body health in myriad ways. From infectious and chronic diseases, chronic low energy, inflammation, and even protection from Alzheimer’s—it appears everything is tied to the health of your mouth, gums, teeth, and saliva.</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. Cynthia Li about how a trip to the dentist’s office led to valuable insight in her journey through autoimmune disease. He also speaks with Dr. Todd LePine about the important link between oral health and systemic health.</p><br><p>Dr. Cynthia Li received her medical degree from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. She’s practiced as an internist in many settings, including Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, San Francisco General Hospital, and St. Anthony Medical Clinic serving the homeless. She currently has a private practice in Berkeley, CA and is the author of, <em>Brave New Medicine: A Doctor's Unconventional Path to Healing Her Autoimmune Illness.</em></p><br><p>Dr. Todd LePine graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, specializing in Integrative Functional Medicine. He is an Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years. Dr. LePine’s focus at The UltraWellness Center is to help his patients achieve optimal health and vitality by restoring the natural balance to both the mind and the body. His areas of interest include optimal aging, bio-detoxification, functional gastrointestinal health, systemic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and the neurobiology of mood and cognitive disorders. Dr. LePine teaches around the world, and has given lectures to doctors and patients at American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM), Age Management Medicine Group (AMMG), the University of Miami Integrative Medicine Conference, The Kripalu Center in Lenox, MA, and is on the faculty for American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M). Dr. LePine is the head of the Scientific Advisory Board for Designs for Health and a consultant for Diagnostic Solutions Laboratory.
