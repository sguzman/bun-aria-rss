    "media:description": "So let’s go back, eh?\nBooks what I wrote, yo ► https://tinyurl.com/ycnl5bo3 \nMore spacey stuff and some recommendations below ►\n\nEnormous liberties have been taken with this one; some of the footage isn’t from Apollo 11 (the mission we chat about here), but subsequent missions to the moon. Footage was really quite difficult to find, so hopefully you can forgive me playing a little visually loose with the truth.\n\nAlso the Soviet space program was barely even mentioned in the video. I’ve often thought it’s a bit sad that the Soviet Union got the first satellite into space, the first doggos (let’s not discuss it), the first man, the first woman, the first probe to the moon, the first spacewalk, and the first robot on another celestial body – yet the winner’s medal generally goes to the US for reaching the moon, and doing it so brilliantly. (Which they did, and which it was.)\n\nNot in any way meaning to discredit the US here, I’d just like to urge you to spare a thought for those other clever men and women a continent away who were – at the very same time – also taking marvellous and brave strides into space. \n\nI’ve had quite a fascination with the Apollo program over the years, and space in general. If it’s something you’re interested in too, here’s the stuff I really, really enjoyed reading and watching. (No one’s paying me for this, I just dig them. The audiobook versions are great too.)\n\nMike Massimino - Spaceman\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Spaceman-Astronauts-Unlikely-Journey-Universe-ebook/dp/B01A4B1SK0\n\nRobert Kurson - Rocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Man's First Journey to the Moon\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Men-Odyssey-Astronauts-Journey/dp/B075H2P225/ref=sr_1_2keywords=apollo+8&qid=1581704489&s=digital-text&sr=1-2\n\nAndrew Smith - Moondust: In Search of the Men Who Fell to Earth\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Moondust-Search-Men-Fell-Earth/dp/0007155425\n\nApollo 11 \nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt8760684/\n\nIn the Shadow of the Moon (THE DOCUMENTARY, NOT THE OTHER ONE) \nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0925248/\n\nBefore uploading this video I had a fairly long conversation with a meme-knowledgeable friend about whether dabbing would be appropriate in a thumbnail.
