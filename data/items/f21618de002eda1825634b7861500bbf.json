  "description": "When sirens splinter the night, do you go toward the noise? Or take it as a sign to run away?

Next, that sound you hear is a catchy jingle beckoning to be heard. After that, we hear skittering scratching away in the night. And finally, the cries of children call for you in a park late at night.\n\nLink to survey: https://bit.ly/2EcYbu4\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
