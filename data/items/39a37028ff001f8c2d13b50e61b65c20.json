  "description": "<p>Justin Tranter is one of the top songwriters and collaborators in the music industry, writing with everyone from Lady Gaga, Dua Lipa, and Selena Gomez to Demi Lovato, Bebe Rexha, Brandy Clark, Shea Diamond and countless others. With their astonishing success and abundant self-love, you’d never imagine Justin was bullied mercilessly as a kid growing up in Chicago. Every day was torture until the Chicago Academy For The Arts high school provided a place of refuge and emergence and ultimately saved their life. Starting out in the business, Justin began their career on stage as the figurehead of the glam-punk band Semi Precious Weapons, but eventually discovered something surprising. They didn’t actually need to be on stage to do the part of the work they loved; collaborating, writing and helping other leading artists create works of art that told their stories in a powerful way and moved millions.&nbsp;</p><p>Justin has since become a pioneer in the music industry, working tirelessly to elevate the voices of everyone around them — whether marginalized people, emerging artists or global pop icons. Along the way, Justin’s also remained a committed philanthropist & GLAAD Board member, using their platform to rally for change across a number of causes, including representation/inclusion for LGBTQIA+ people, women & women of color. And, in 2018, coming full-circle, Justin made a donation to fund a state-of-the-art recording studio and part-time music teacher at that very same place that was their salvation as a kid, the Chicago Academy For The Arts.</p><p>You can find Justin at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tranterjustin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> : https://www.instagram.com/tranterjustin</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
