  "description": "<p>Trusting Who We Are (retreat talk) - (2017-12-30) - The sign of spiritual freedom is a deep trust in our essential nature, and in the light of awareness that lives through all beings.  This talk explores the conditioning that entraps us in a trance of separation and believing in a limited self.  We then explore the evolutionary shift in identity that is possible as we deepen our attention and presence to the life that is here, and the loving awareness that is the source of existence.</p> <p>This talk was given at the IMCW 2017 New Year's Retreat.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely.
