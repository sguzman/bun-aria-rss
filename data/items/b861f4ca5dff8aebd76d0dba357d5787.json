  "description": "<p>In this work, we perform a systematic study of the mass spectra, the root\nmean square(r.m.s.) radii and the radial density distributions of the doubly\ncharmed baryons $\\Xi_{cc}$ and $\\Omega_{cc}$. The calculations are carried out\nin the frame work of Godfrey-Isgur (GI) relativized quark model, where the\nbaryon is regarded as a real three-body system of quarks. Our results show that\nthe excited energy of doubly charmed baryon with $\\rho$-mode is lower than\nthose of the $\\lambda$-mode and $\\lambda$-$\\rho$ mixing mode, which indicates\nthat the lowest state is dominated by the $\\rho$-mode. According to this\nconclusion, we systematically investigate the mass spectra, the r.m.s. radii of\nthe ground and excited states($1S\\sim4S$, $1P\\sim4P$, $1D\\sim4D$, $1F\\sim4F$\nand $1G\\sim4G$) with $\\rho$-mode. Using the wave functions obtained from quark\nmodel, we also study the radial density distributions. Finally, with the\npredicated mass spectra, the Regge trajectories of $\\Xi_{cc}$ and $\\Omega_{cc}$\nin the ($J$,$M^{2}$) plane are constructed, and the slopes, intercepts are\ndetermined by linear fitting. It is found that model predicted masses fit\nnicely to the constructed Regge trajectories.\n</p>",
