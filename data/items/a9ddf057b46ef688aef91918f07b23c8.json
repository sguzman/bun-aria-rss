  "description": "<p>Parenting alongside your husband can sometimes feel awkward and bumpy. We want to be intentional, but it can seem like we have wildly different styles and strategies than our spouses! In this episode, Emily and Laura dive into the topic of marital unity. Even though we have different upbringings, personalities, strengths, and weaknesses, God has joined us in marriage for his mission. He designed for us to do it together! Through Christ, we can have humility, forgive one another, refocus on our mission, and live in unity with our husbands as we parent together.</p> <p>We’re grateful to singer-songwriter Janet Blair for making this week’s show possible. She is looking for inspiration for future music and wants to tell <em>your</em> story through song.
