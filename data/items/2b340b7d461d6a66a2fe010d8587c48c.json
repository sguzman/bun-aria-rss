  "description": "<p>The University of Montevallo in Alabama has roots back to the Civil War and even back beyond that time period. The college started off as an all girls school using many antebellum buildings in town to serve as campus buildings. It was an educational experiment that worked and eventually led one day to the college becoming a co-ed institution. It's success continues to this day. The campus is part of a historic district and has seen quite a few tragedies in its time. Massacres, horrific deaths and war have led to unrest in the afterlife. It would seem that the university is quite haunted. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the University of Montevallo. Thanks to listener Lisa Atkinson for this suggestion! Moment in Oddity features an overnight in Madame Tussaud's by Bob Sherfield and This Day in History features Bell making the first successful phone call by Steven Pappas.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/03/hgb-ep-111-university-of-montevallo.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/03/hgb-ep-111-university-of-montevallo.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
