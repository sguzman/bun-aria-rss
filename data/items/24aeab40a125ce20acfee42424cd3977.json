  "description": "Wajahat Ali is a columnist, commentator and a wise, funny commentator on American politics and life. His latest book, \"Go Back to Where You Came From\" is a memoir of his experiences growing up a Muslim-American in the US both before and after 9/11. While the societal dysfunction he addresses is real, by illustrating it through his own story and that of his family, Ali brings it to life and, through all of it, never loses his sense of humor. Our conversation with him is, as a consequence, as engaging and vital as his book.
