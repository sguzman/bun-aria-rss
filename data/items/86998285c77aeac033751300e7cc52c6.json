  "description": "<p>&nbsp;“The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.” – Dr. Seuss&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you want to be a great student of economics or just be well-informed about the world, then reading widely is without question the magic ingredient. &nbsp;We at EconomicsInTen are great believers in the power of reading. &nbsp;Therefore in this Summer Reading special, your friendly neighbourhood economists Pete and Gav answer one simple question 10 times. What book would they recommend and why? All the books are linked to economics in some way and if you read them all, you will become a better economist and who knows, perhaps a better human being too! So while away those long summer days catching up with our podcast and reading these beauties. &nbsp;&nbsp;As always, this podcast comes with technical support from the great Nic and comes with music from Jukedeck – create your own at jukedeck.com.</p>\n",
