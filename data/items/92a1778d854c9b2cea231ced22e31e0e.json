  "content": "At Telefonica Research we are looking for young and talented researchers willing to expand their horizons by working in an exciting environment in beautiful Barcelona. And, as you will know if you follow this blog, I am particularly interested in working with PhD students whose research focus is Recommender Systems but also neighboring areas such as Data Mining, User Modeling, Social Networks, and Information Retrieval. We offer three month internships and interesting conditions.<br /><br />Work from previous interns has been published in top conferences such as SIGIR, WWW, Recsys, Web Intelligence... (see my <a href=\"http://xavier.amatriain.net/index_publications.html\">list</a> of recent publications, most of which include interns)<br /><br />And, if you want references of what an internship in Telefonica is like, you might want to contact some of our previous interns in the group:<br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://an.kaist.ac.kr/%7Emycha/\">Meeyoung Cha</a>, currently Assistant Professor at KAIST</li><li><a href=\"http://an.kaist.ac.kr/%7Ehaewoon/\">Haewoon Kwak</a>, PhD student at KAIST</li><li><a href=\"http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.lathia/\">Neal Lathia</a>, currently Researcher at UCL<br /></li><li><a href=\"http://www.sis.pitt.edu/%7Ejahn/homepage/Home.html\">Jae-wook Ahn</a>, PhD student at U.
