  "description": "Buck calls media coverage of Biden's covid \"slanted,\" especially in regard to how they covered Trump's covid. Attempted assassination: New York GOP gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin attacked by man with knife. Zeldin attacker quickly released from jail, just as candidate predicted. January 6th kabuki theater is just red meat to looney lefties. Clay says, \"I hate to say it, but if I'm a politician on the road campaigning  in the midterms this fall, I want a level of security around me that I have never had before.\" Rep. Elaine Luria, one of last night's hearing leaders, who spent her career as a 20-year Naval officer, wants Trump fully charged. NY Times columnist Paul Krugman continues his streak of not being correct, admits he was wrong on Bidenflation. NY Times columnists admit to being \"wrong\" in series of mea culpas. Kiev and Moscow agree to deal to resume Ukraine grain exports from Black Sea ports to prevent global food shortage.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
