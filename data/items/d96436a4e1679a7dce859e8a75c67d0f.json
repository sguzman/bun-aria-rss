  "description": "<p>To address practical challenges in establishing and maintaining robust\nwireless connectivity such as multi-path effects, low latency, size reduction,\nand high data rate, the digital beamformer is performed by the hybrid antenna\narray at the frequency of operation of 10 GHz. The proposed digital beamformer,\nas a spatial filter, is capable of performing Direction of Arrival (DOA)\nestimation and beamforming. The most well-established machine learning\ntechnique of support vector machine (SVM) for the DoA estimation is limited to\nproblems with linearly-separable datasets.\n</p>\n<p>To overcome the aforementioned constraint, in the proposed beamformer, the\nQS-SVM classifier with a small regularizer has been used for the DoA estimation\nin addition to the two beamforming techniques of LCMV and MVDR. The\nQS-SVM-based beamformer has been deployed in an FPGA board, as demonstrated in\ndetail in this work. The implementation results have verified the strong\nperformance of the QS-SVM-based beamformer in suppressing undesired signals,\ndeep nulls with powers less than -10 dB in undesired signals, and transferring\ndesired signals. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the performance of the\nQS-SVM-based beamformer consists of other advantages of average latency time in\nthe order of milliseconds, performance efficiency of more than 90\\%, and\nthroughput of about 100\\%.\n</p>",
