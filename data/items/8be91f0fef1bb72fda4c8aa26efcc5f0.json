  "description": "<p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Motherhood offers no shortage of reasons to fear, which is why we’re doing a deep dive into the topic in this mini-series. In the first episode in this 7-episode series, Laura and Emily talk about some of the fears they’ve faced in the past year. Not all fear is bad though, so they give us examples of different types of fear and talk about the best kind—the fear of the Lord. If you find yourself in a state of fear, you’re not alone. Let’s fight our fears together with the truth of God’s word.</p> <p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">_____</p> <p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">We’re so thankful for <a href= \"http://www.crossway.org/risenmotherhood\">Crossway</a>, publisher of <a href=\"http://www.crossway.org/risenmotherhood\"><em>Journey to the Cross</em> by Paul David Tripp</a>, for helping make this mini-series possible!
