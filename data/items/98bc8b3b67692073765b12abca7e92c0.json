  "description": "East Timor is choosing a president. What is the significance of the 2022 presidential elections in Timor Leste? Has Asia’s youngest and newest country become a prisoner of its short but turbulent political part? How do young people view the older generation of former freedom fighters who continue to dominate the political order? What has the atmosphere been like on the ground during the election campaign?\nIn the first of a short series of East Timor-focused Nordic Asia Podcasts, Amber Woortman, a master’s student in political science at the University of Copenhagen, talks to NIAS Director Duncan McCargo from Dili about her observations and her conversations with candidates and voters in Timor Leste over the past couple of weeks. This is a rare opportunity to hear about an election that has received very little mainstream international media coverage.\nThe Nordic Asia Podcast is a collaboration sharing expertise on Asia across the Nordic region, brought to you by the Nordic Institute of Asian Studies (NIAS) based at the University of Copenhagen, along with our academic partners: the Centre for East Asian Studies at the University of Turku, and Asianettverket at the University of Oslo.\nWe aim to produce timely, topical and well-edited discussions of new research and developments about Asia.\nTranscripts of the Nordic Asia Podcasts: http://www.nias.ku.dk/nordic-asia-podcast\nAbout NIAS: www.nias.ku.dk\nLearn more about your ad choices.
