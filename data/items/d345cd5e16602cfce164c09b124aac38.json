Rinse and repeat.</p><p>We all do the best we can.&nbsp;But the pressures of daily life can leave us stressed and exhausted. Sedentary and stiff, our shoulders slump. Our spine rounds and our stance is lopsided. Without corrective action, we can't function properly. And everything we do -- including exercise -- only exacerbates the problem.</p><p>Let's just say&nbsp;<strong>Sadie Lincoln</strong>&nbsp;can relate.&nbsp;When her career with a global fitness brand almost broke her, she knew something had to change.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadie and her husband Chris quit their jobs and downsized their lives to pursue an idea most said was bat shit crazy.</p><p>Hence was born&nbsp;<strong>barre3</strong>,&nbsp;a fitness company focused not on weight loss but rather on body positivity and personal empowerment.</p><p>What started out as a workout Sadie devised to help restore personal equanimity blossomed into a daily practice embraced by millions that focuses not on weight loss but rather on body positivity and personal empowerment.
