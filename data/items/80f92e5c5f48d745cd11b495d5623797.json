  "description": "Do you feel forgotten today? Have you gone through situations that are so painful and hard to forget, you don’t know how you’ll ever feel light again?If there’s anyone who understands heartache and betrayal, it’s Joseph. He was betrayed by his brothers, thrown into a pit, and eventually sold into slavery. But all along, God had a plan for Joseph. After his trials, Joseph ended up being in charge of all Egypt. He was blessed in such a way that he said in Genesis 41:51 (AMP), “God has made me forget all my trouble and hardship.” He named his son Manasseh which means in Hebrew “causing to forget.”Like Joseph, God wants to bless you in such a way that you won’t remember the pain of the past. You may feel forgotten, but God hasn’t forgotten about you. He’s seen your heartache and has collected every tear you’ve shed. He’s going to turn your pain around in such a way that you’re overwhelmed with His goodness. God is going to cause you to forget!<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
