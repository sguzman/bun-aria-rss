    "media:description": "Join the Amoeba Sisters as they explore the excretory system! This video will first discuss two major functions of the excretory system before focusing on the nephron. The majority of this video will tour through the nephron while listing major items reabsorbed and secreted.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nFactual References:\nBetts, J.
