  "description": "<p>Nick Cody joined me from Melbourne, Australia to tell me about his epic trip he took across America at 19 years old. Went from Portland to NY by train to save like $90. Idiot. But also very cool. The entire trip was just so he could go see the O&A show where Bill Burr would end up doing his Philly rant that I always refer to as \"7 more minutes\" and that still makes me laugh. Nick was in the audience for that amazing comic/crowd fight and I'm so jealous of that and this whole trip.</p> <p>Listen to Nick's podcast, \"<a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/mid-flight-brawl/id1503319805\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mid-flight Brawl</a>\" on Apple podcasts or anywhere else (this link is just for Apple I guess)</p> <p><strong>Follow Us on Instagram</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thenickcody/?hl=en\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@TheNickCody</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/arishaffir/?hl=en\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@AriShaffir</a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong><em>The Music</em></strong></p> <p>Sister Rosetta Tharpe - This Train (great song that made me cry)</p> <p>The O'Jays - Love Train</p> <p>Soul Asylum - Runaway Train</p> <p>Bill Burr - Philly Rant (still made me laugh 15 years later)</p> <p> </p>",
