  "description": "<p>On this Summer Edition of MBB, Mayim and Jonathan are joined by Mayim’s very own vocal cord surgery doctors, ENT + Anesthesiologist practitioners Doctors Shawn Nasseri and Bita Nasseri! They discuss ways they’re able to manage the mental health of their patients, how stress levels and sleep cycles can impact overall health, and their holistic approach to treating patients. The Drs. Nasseri explain the importance of analyzing your environment and getting to the root causes of symptoms rather than quelling them with medication. They open up about the experience of taking on all of a patient’s anxieties, the physical manifestations of psychological causes, and Eastern vs Western approaches to medicine.
