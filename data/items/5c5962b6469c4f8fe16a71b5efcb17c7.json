Real estate is a&nbsp;<strong>relationship business</strong>, so eventually, you need someone— an agent, contractor, cleaning lady, or handyman. At times, your success depends on these people, so you need to build a relationship with them. Once you cultivate a relationship, maintenance becomes the next step, but how do you do that? How do you find&nbsp;<strong>the balance between too friendly and impersonal</strong>? How do you&nbsp;<strong>turn a transactional relationship into a transformational one</strong>?</p><p>Today’s guests,&nbsp;<strong>Evan and</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Katie Miller,</strong>&nbsp;have prioritized relationship building in their business and have seen tremendous success. The advantage of&nbsp;<strong>investing as a couple</strong>&nbsp;is they&nbsp;<strong>balance each other out</strong>. Evan enjoys numbers, while Katie enjoys working with people—creating the balance they need to be a well-oiled real estate machine. They have&nbsp;<strong>sixteen units amongst seven properties in Florida, Denver, and Nebraska.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While growing their real estate business, they&nbsp;<strong>both work full-time jobs with a baby at home</strong>. Katie is the&nbsp;<strong>general manager at the BiggerPockets publishing division,</strong>&nbsp;which motivated her to invest because she sees the power of real estate every day.
