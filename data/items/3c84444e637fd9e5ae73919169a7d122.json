  "description": "Today’s show kicks off with Frank’s take on last night’s presidential debate. Spoiler alert: He gives it an “F.” But there’s one sector that will do well for investors no matter who wins in November... [00:30] Then, David Garofalo, a 30-year resource sector veteran and former CEO of Goldcorp, shares how he helped build the largest gold-producing company in the world. David also explains why this bull market is different from others... what he thinks will be the next move in gold prices... and how it will benefit his brand-new venture. [29:52] In the educational segment, Frank explains the importance of listening to opinions you disagree with… how politics has taken hold of the coronavirus discussion… and the sectors (outside of tech and e-commerce) set to explode higher after the election.
