  "description": "<p>We study neighbourhoods of submanifolds in generalized complex geometry. Our\nfirst main result provides sufficient criteria for such a submanifold to admit\na neighbourhood on which the generalized complex structure is B-field\nequivalent to a holomorphic Poisson structure. This is intimately tied with our\nsecond main result, which is a rigidity theorem for generalized complex\ndeformations of holomorphic Poisson structures. Specifically, on a compact\nmanifold with boundary we provide explicit conditions under which any\ngeneralized complex perturbation of a holomorphic Poisson structure is B-field\nequivalent to another holomorphic Poisson structure. The proofs of these\nresults require two analytical tools: Hodge decompositions on almost complex\nmanifolds with boundary, and the Nash-Moser algorithm. As a concrete\napplication of these results, we show that on a four-dimensional generalized\ncomplex submanifold which is generically symplectic, a neighbourhood of the\nentire complex locus is B-field equivalent to a holomorphic Poisson structure.\nFurthermore, we use the neighbourhood theorem to develop the theory of blowing\ndown submanifolds in generalized complex geometry.\n</p>",
