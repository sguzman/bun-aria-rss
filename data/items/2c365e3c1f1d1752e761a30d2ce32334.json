  "description": "In 1993, Colin Hatch was responsible for a sickening murder which shocked and disgusted the entire nation.  In this episode of the weekly UK True Crime Podcast we explore the circumstances leading up to this murder, including the refusal of authorities to accept the recommendation that Hatch should be sent to Broadmoor to stop him killing - as he was not dangerous enough.  We then look at Hatch's own murder in prison, at the hands of a convicted Armed Robber who had already attempted to murder the Soham Killer, Ian Huntley.\n\nWe look at all the families affected by these three crimes and the differing emotions generated.",
