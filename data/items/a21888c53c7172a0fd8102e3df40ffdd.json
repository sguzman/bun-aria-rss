  "description": "<p>This week we’re beginning a new series called “What Your Attitude Can Do for You!” But, just to keep things interesting, in part one, we’ve decided to let John tell you what your attitude CANNOT do for you. You see, many leaders think that attitude can make up for necessary traits like competence, or experience, or even personal growth. But, as John says, “Attitude isn’t everything, but it is one thing that can make a big difference in your life.”</p> <p>So, John is going to help us navigate what attitude cannot do for us, then for the application portion of this episode, Mark Cole and Traci Morrow dive deeper into John’s lesson and share how they’re applying this teaching to their own lives and leadership. Next week we’ll be back to discuss what your attitude CAN do for you!</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the “What Your Attitude Can Do for You Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/MyAttitude and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/The-Difference-Maker-Hardcover_p_2782.html\"> <em>The Difference Maker</em> by John C.
