  "title": "Introducing Smartr-  Episode 1: Puel with Tim Heidecker",
  "description": "<p>Smartr is a new scripted Podcast from Team Coco that follows tech genius, Noa Lukas, as he profiles the monopolies of tomorrow and gives them advice on how to grow without being hindered by the dinosaur concepts of regulations, public opinion, and basic morality. In the first episode of Smartr, Noa Lukas visits Puel, whose pool-match algorithm finds the perfect pool filled with swimmers like you based on your demographic profile. Noa and CEO Alex Patterson (Tim Heidecker) dive into Puel's business model and navigate the choppy waters of early growth, like being banned from twenty states for accidentally violating the Civil Rights Act. Check out Smartr now on Luminary at <a href=\"http://luminary.link/conan\" target=\"_blank\">luminary.link/conan</a>.</p>\n",
