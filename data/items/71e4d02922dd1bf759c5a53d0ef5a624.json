  "description": "America is just over 4% of the world's population but home to 25% of its COVID-19 cases. While European nations like Italy and Spain are wracked with the disease, Europeans typically do not have the added anxiety of trying to figure out how to pay for healthcare or worrying that their government will not support them if they lose their job. We congratulate ourselves on having the strongest economy in the world but are importing basic PPE supplies from China and Russia. Our fragility and our flaws are being revealed as never before. On this episode Dr. Leana Wen, former public health commissioner of Baltimore and an emergency room physician, Edward Luce of the Financial Times and co-host Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and \"Just Security\" join host David Rothkopf to discuss and consider the whys of all this and where it will lead. An essential episode. Don't miss.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
