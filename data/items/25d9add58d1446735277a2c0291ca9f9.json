  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, we bring you the Best of Mark Levin. Isolationists fit right into the fusion of George Soros and Charles Koch parroting the pacifistic propaganda of keeping America out of endless wars or radical interventionism. President Reagan's view was that enemies couldn't be contained therefore prudently going on offense was his preferred alternative. However, the leftist and/or the pacifist pigeonhole any activity that doesn't bow down to an opposing regime as an \"escalation\" to weaken the U.S position and prevent America from asserting any dominance against aggressive foreign actors. Then, the candidates for the US Senate primary in Pennsylvania are in court as David McCormick has filed a slip-and-fall lawsuit. The Pennsylvania Constitution is clear that the Secretary of State and the Supreme Court cannot change election laws, yet they did years ago. Moreover, all of the extras like forced mail-in ballots, poll workers dating and 'curing' ballots for voters and skipping the signature verification of ballot envelopes; all of these actions legally void a ballot (but they didn't in 2020). This is not a civil rights issue; this is a legal issue. If McCormick’s campaign wins this lawsuit it will pave the way for Democrats to follow suit for the next election. Later, following President Biden’s remarks China announced Taiwan military drills. Notice how more confrontational China is becoming? China and Iran are on the move against us and if Washington politicians keep fooling around, we will end up effectively arming Iran with nuclear weapons.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
