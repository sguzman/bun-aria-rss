The word cartoon has a childish connotation, and so we think that's why we started using illustrated. Sometimes we hear the phrase&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1278510835321786368?s=20\">\"photo-realistic\" to describe the previous illustrated style</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Did Jane Austen write Contemporaries?</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahmaclean/status/1358442913408155649?s=20\">Yes.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Historical romance are set in the past, and an example of one set in the recent past is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3t66Wh6\">Loud is How I Love You</a>&nbsp;by Mercy Brown.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Why are Cover Reveals Important?</strong>&nbsp;Publicity, and if you want to see a great new cover, check out the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CMAUBNCA8Eq/\">new cover for The Kiss Quotient.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Can You be a Casual Romance Reader?</strong>&nbsp;Yes!
