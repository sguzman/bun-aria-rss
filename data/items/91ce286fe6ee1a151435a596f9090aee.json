  "description": "You know what they say, Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result; that same thing is true for our listener’s husband.\nWendy has been married for a total of one month and is ready to call things quits. Her husband is going to dinner with the woman he had an affair with in his last marriage!\nOf course, he claims that they’re only friends and that Wendy has nothing to worry about, but seriously, whom does he think he’s fooling; at least that’s what Moe says.\n“He clearly doesn't want to be married! Why do you keep getting married and then running back to this woman? This is one of the situations where somebody will say \"It's not that easy.\" Of course, it's not, it is never easy to leave someone, but I am leaving... ONE HUNDRED PERCENT!”\nKristin on the other hand would handle things a little bit differently.\n“I'm pissed too and I agree with everything you said, however, I am not leaving. We're a month into this marriage, when he gets home, be like \"we need to talk.\" and I expressed how I felt and you still went. That was your one and only time to go out to dinner with her. This is how I feel, I need you to respect that and not turn this around on me; and then if he's adamant that he's gonna go out with her again, that's your chance to bow out.”\nTo make matters worse, he completely manipulates the situation and accuses our listener of being controlling, and threatened to leave her over this.\nHer husband has no intention of missing this dinner, leaving Wendy so very confused. So, she reached out to the Bert show for advice.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
