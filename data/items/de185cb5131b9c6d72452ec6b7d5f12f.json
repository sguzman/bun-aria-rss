  "description": "In Corridor Ecology: Linking Landscapes for Biodiversity Conservation and Climate Adaptation, 2nd Edition (Island Press, 2019), Dr. Jodi Hilty and her co-authors expand on concepts and practices important to maintaining and restoring land connectivity. In the book and during the interview, Dr. Hilty discusses how the field as evolved over the last 15 years. She highlights a newer part of the field, Climate-wise connectivity. Climate-wise connectivity considers the effects of climate change on habitat and offers recommendations on designing effective corridors as landscapes change with shifting climate conditions\nIn this lively interview, Dr. Hilty describes the consequences of fragmented landscapes and defines corridors. We talk about the biological and human benefits of corridors as well as the design objectives of practitioners like herself. As she tasks listeners travelling through successful projects connecting landscapes, Dr. Hilty also speaks honestly about potential pitfalls or disadvantages of linking landscapes. As we wrap up the conversation, Dr. Hilty discusses the current tools and technologies available today that are helping the field continue to make advances and aid in science-based decision-making.\nChris Gambino is an Assistant Professor of Animal Science at Delaware Valley University.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
