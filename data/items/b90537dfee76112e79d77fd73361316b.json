Food is our #1 killer, even more so than smoking and guns.Our government supports the overproduction of the top crops for processed foods—corn, soy, and wheat—and Big Food reaps the benefits by turning them into sugary, starchy, highly addictive foods that cause chronic diseases. Diseases that are killing us and could be prevented.</p><br><p>This all comes down to our food system. The way food is grown, transported, processed, consumed, and wasted in our country is contributing to these problems and so much more—especially some of our most urgent ones like climate change. That’s why I wrote my new book Food Fix: How to Save Our Health, Our Economy, Our Communities, and Our Planet—One Bite at a Time. And today on The Doctor’s Farmacy I’m excited to trade places and be the interviewee with my good friend, business partner, and host of The Broken Brain Podcast, Dhru Purohit. When I got very sick decades ago, I took on the mission to use Functional Medicine to help myself and my patients get over needless suffering. There are so many things we can do to prevent unnecessary health struggles and related deaths, and food is one of the most powerful.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Thrive Market.
