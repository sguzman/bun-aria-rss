  "description": "<p>Incentives that compensate for the involved costs in the decentralized\ntraining of a Federated Learning (FL) model act as a key stimulus for clients'\nlong-term participation. However, it is challenging to convince clients for\nquality participation in FL due to the absence of: (i) full information on the\nclient's data quality and properties; (ii) the value of client's data\ncontributions; and (iii) the trusted mechanism for monetary incentive offers.\nThis often leads to poor efficiency in training and communication. While\nseveral works focus on strategic incentive designs and client selection to\novercome this problem, there is a major knowledge gap in terms of an overall\ndesign tailored to the foreseen digital economy, including Web 3.0, while\nsimultaneously meeting the learning objectives. To address this gap, we propose\na contribution-based tokenized incentive scheme, namely \\texttt{FedToken},\nbacked by blockchain technology that ensures fair allocation of tokens amongst\nthe clients that corresponds to the valuation of their data during model\ntraining. Leveraging the engineered Shapley-based scheme, we first approximate\nthe contribution of local models during model aggregation, then strategically\nschedule clients lowering the communication rounds for convergence and anchor\nways to allocate \\emph{affordable} tokens under a constrained monetary budget.\nExtensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.\n</p>",
