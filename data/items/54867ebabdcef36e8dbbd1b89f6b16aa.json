  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys continue to react to everything that has happened during Brinks Week so far as we are on the cusp of the new league year and free agency officially starting tomorrow, plus they dive into the Patriots signing basically everyone and whether or not they become a real threat next year. Joining the program is former GM of the Cleveland Browns, author, host of the Lombardi Line & GM Shuffle Podcast, The Daily Coach, Michael Lombardi to chat about the Patriots retooling, the piece of paper he has from Bill Belichick about building a team from 1991, what he projects for the rest of free agency, and what he thinks Bill is thinking throughout this whole process (21:51-39:12). Later, 11 year NFL veteran at WR, 2013 leader in receptions, former Colts, Football Team, and 49ers legend, Pierre Garcon joins the show to chat about his new company, what it's like being a free agent and how teams recruit players in the NFL, playing with Peyton Manning, and why he's trying to become a professional golfer (1:02:38-1:19:44). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk welcome Green Bay Packers RB, 2020 2nd round draft pick, AJ Dillon, to chat about his Oklahoma Drill with Connor, what he learned from his rookie year, taking on a larger role next year, and at what point this season things started to click for him (1:21:44-1:34:16).
