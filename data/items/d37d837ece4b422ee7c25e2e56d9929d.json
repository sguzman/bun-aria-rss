  "description": "<p>    Michael and Steve welcome the one and only Vincent Pastore back to the podcast. Vinny has a blast sharing his favorite memories from the show, and how he thought he got whacked for smoking weed at a concert. He also shares a really funny story about how he screwed up introducing Bruce Springsteen at a concert, and of course whether he thinks Tony is alive or dead.</p><p>     Then Michael and Steve take on the third episode of the final season. Tony is questioning Paulie’s loyalty, Phil is making big moves and the series is starting to build to that final ending.  Check out Talking Sopranos #83 “Remember When” S7-Ep3.
