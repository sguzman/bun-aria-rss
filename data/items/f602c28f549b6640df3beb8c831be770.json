This topic was inspired by an email I recently received: <em>“Since dreams come from our busy minds, can we slowly over time change our dreams in some way?&nbsp; I do not always remember dreams obviously but when I am awakened by dreams (often) or remember the next day, I do have a recurring pattern of always hurrying or being super frustrated, anxious!&nbsp; I cannot help but think this is part of why I get so tired some days as I do not rest peacefully at night.&nbsp; I’m just thinking dreams must be all part of the mental mind and I would love to have my dreams peaceful, pleasant, restful, whether I remember the dream or not, I feel like not having all the anxiety and frustration in the dreams would be very helpful to my awake hours.”&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>We need to remember that <strong>detoxing the mind and brain doesn’t just take place when we are awake</strong>. We also detox our thoughts when we sleep. in fact, our dreams can help us sort out our thoughts and clean up our mental mess. They have a purpose—recurring dreams may even indicate an unresolved issue in our lives, so it is important that we try and pay attention to what we dream about.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Read the show blog here:&nbsp;https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/the-neuroscience-of-dreams-nightmares-how-to-have-better-dreams-help-your-children-process-understand-nightmares</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sign up to Patreon to get access to bonus ad-free podcasts, exclusive downloads, live Q&As, and more: https://www.patreon.com/drcarolineleaf.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>OFFERS FROM OUR SPONSORS:</p>\n<p>-<strong>Nootropics by BiOptimizers: Just go to </strong><a href=\"http://nootopia.com/drleaf\"><strong>nootopia.com/drleaf</strong></a><strong> and enter coupon code DRLEAF10 for an extra 10% off your order, and experience your best mood and mental performance with personalized Nootropics!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Thrive Causemetics: Right now, you can get 15% off your first order when you visit&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://thrivecausemetics.com/DRLEAF\"><strong>thrivecausemetics.com/DRLEAF</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Bonafide:&nbsp;My listeners get a special offer when they subscribe to any product by going to </strong><a href=\"https://hellobonafide.com/\"><strong>HelloBonafide.com</strong></a><strong> and using promo code DRLEAF.</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:</p>\n<p>-Get my new book Cleaning up Your Mental Mess here: https://www.cleaningupyourmentalmess.com</p>\n<p>-Get a free Cleaning up Your Mental Mess workbook when you subscribe to my weekly email at drleaf.com!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>-Visit my website at https://drleaf.com for more free resources</p>\n<p>-Instagram: @drcarolineleaf: https://www.instagram.com/drcarolineleaf/-</p>\n<p>-Facebook: Dr. Caroline Leaf: https://www.facebook.com/drleaf</p>\n<p>-Twitter: @drcarolineleaf: https://twitter.com/DrCarolineLeaf</p>\n<p>-Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/drcarolineleaf</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>*DISCLAIMER: This podcast and blog are for educational purposes only and are not intended as medical advice.
