  "description": "<p>In this passage, we see Jesus reaching the height of his popularity with the crowds, cutting across national and ethnic divides. How does Jesus respond to this popularity? By going up into a mountain and naming and renaming people. In this sermon, we learn how Jesus transforms people: 1) We receive a new name; 2) How we receive a new name; 2) Why we receive a new name.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 26, 2006. Series: King's Cross: The Gospel of Mark, Part 1: The Coming of the King. Scripture: Mark 3:6-19.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
