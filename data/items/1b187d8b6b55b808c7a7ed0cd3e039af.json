  "description": "When it comes to copyright law, stand-up comedy recordings have generally been treated differently than music recordings. At least, until now.\nThe estates of Robin Williams and George Carlin are among several plaintiffs in a copyright infringement lawsuit against Pandora that centers on whether the streaming service has the proper license for their work. Spotify is also having similar disputes with comics, though out of court.\nOn today's episode of our weekly legal news podcast, On The Merits, Bloomberg Law reporter Isaiah Poritz explains how the copyright discrepancy between comedy and music started, why it may be going away, and why the comics suing these streaming giants will probably end up laughing all the way to the bank.\nDo you have feedback on this episode of On The Merits?
