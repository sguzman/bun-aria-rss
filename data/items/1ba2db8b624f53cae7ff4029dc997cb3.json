We’ve reviewed cigars, magazines, and even a movie or two. But now it’s time for us to share your brutal honesty.</p>\n<p>We do that while lighting up the cigar we named Cigar of the Year in the first hour. The Aganorsa Leaf Connecticut Robusto. The over/under on Barry referring to this as not your Grandfather’s Connecticut sits at 4.5.</p>\n<p>We also have the usual suspects such as Versus, Offer Of The Day, Asylum, Classic 3-Way and Cigar News on the number one downloaded cigar podcast in the world.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='http://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n",
