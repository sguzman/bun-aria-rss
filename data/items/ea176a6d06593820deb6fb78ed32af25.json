  "description": "<p>Chelsea is joined this week by #1 NYT bestselling author of <em>Untamed</em>, <em>Love Warrior,</em> and <em>Get Untamed: The Journal</em> Glennon Doyle, her wife, soccer icon Abby Wambach, and co-host of the trio’s podcast We Can Do Hard Things, Amanda Doyle. They discuss what Abby thought the moment she first saw Glennon, taking a leap of faith when there’s nothing there to catch you, and Abby and Glennon’s not-so-secret move to LA.  Then: A couple negotiates whether to spend their money on home improvements or a fabulous wedding.  A 30-year-old is frustrated by a dating double-standard.  And a victim of childhood abuse weighs her options as she’s finally forced to confront her abuser.  </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Need some advice from Chelsea?
