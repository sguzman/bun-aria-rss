  "description": "<div>Three young women vanish months apart from each other. Massive searches ensue for each. Days or weeks later, each one is found dead in the location they were last seen. In each case, their deaths are ruled hypothermia even though there's evidence of foul play. How could they have been missed by searchers? Were they abducted, murdered, and then brought back to the place they vanished?
