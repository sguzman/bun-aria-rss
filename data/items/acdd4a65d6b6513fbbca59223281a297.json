  "description": "<p>There’s nothing more practical than getting to know the true God of the Bible— because everything we do wrong and every experience of inordinate anxiety or anger or pride always comes because, at that moment, we’re forgetting who God really is. </p>\n<p>In this passage from Exodus 3, we see the first time in the Bible when somebody says to God, “Who are you?” God shows us that he is not an ineffable, indefinable force, but a God with a name. We will see that he is the God of 2) Brilliant delay; 2) Fiery reality; 3) Absolute sufficiency; and 4) Mysterious nearness.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 21, 2010. Series: To Know the Living God – The God Who Can Be Known. Scripture: Exodus 3:1-14.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
