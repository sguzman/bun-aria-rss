  "description": "In 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee subpoenaed dozens of Hollywood workers to come to Washington and testify to the presence of Communists in the film industry. 19 of those who were subpoenaed announced that they wouldn't co-operate with the Committee; of those 19, 10 \"unfriendly\" witnesses were called to the stand and refused to answer \"The $64 Question\": \"Are you now or have you ever been a Communist?\" Those 10 men were subsequently denied employment, imprisoned; afraid of collateral damage to the industry, the studio moguls were thus moved to design the Blacklist. This episode will explore the work and politics of the Hollywood Ten – and films on which they came together, such as Crossfire – and delve into the far-reaching consequences of their false assumption that the Constitution would protect them.
