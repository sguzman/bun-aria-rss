I am a huge believer in Pinterest's product. You might have noticed recently that they've created a term of service in which you can't do affiliate sales. I think that means that they are going to be running that for themselves. If you start thinking about the amount of commerce that goes on on Pinterest, even if thye make 5% of every transaction, it could easily be one of the 5 to 10 top companies in revenue in the digital space.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Like I said, I'm a big believer in the business. We've seen great results already in a company that my fund, VaynerRSE, is incubating: Faith Box. We ran some promoted pins to great success. We're also definitely seeing it in clients here at Vayner. Wine Library, same thing. I'm massively bullish. In fact, I think that Pinterest's ad product is going to be huge. 18 months from today, we will come back to this video and create a piece of content to talk about this video where I make this claim: Pinterest's ad product is a MAJOR competitor to Google AdWords for e-comm businesses.
