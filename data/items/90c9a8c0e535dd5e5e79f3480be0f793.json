  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys give a lengthy Shahk Gang update as some tension has arisen in the ranks with Tony and Big Motor having second thoughts. Connor also details his weekend which included buying a Calypso plant from Lowe's, knocking his computer off his second story deck, and tying his plant to the deck using two shoes. The guys also dive back into Connor's formative years at the Winchester Boat Club, plan Digs' memorial golf tournament in his honor after he dies, and try to remember what they've been watching as of late.
