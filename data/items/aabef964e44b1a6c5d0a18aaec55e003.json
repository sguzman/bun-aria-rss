  "description": "<p>My Religion is Kindness - Part 1 (2017-12-13) - Authentic kindness must include the life within us. These two talks examine the movement from an armored to a free and loving heart. The first looks at how we can awaken from the trance of unworthiness and establish a genuinely caring relationship with our inner life. In the second we explore how self-kindness awakens us to the heartspace that naturally includes all of life.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <a href= \"https://www.tarabrach.com/donation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">www.tarabrach.com/donation/</a>.</p> <p>With gratitude and love, Tara</p>",
