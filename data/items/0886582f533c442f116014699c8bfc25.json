Then: people have a moral obligation to grapple with the downstream effects of their own arguments, from medical claims to cries to defund and vilify the police. In the wake of yet another mass shooting at a school, what is the state of the 2nd Amendment? What is the interface of modern politics with homelessness, addiction, mental illness, and crime? And what is happening in the governor’s race in California?</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p> </p><p>MUD\\WTR: is a coffee alternative with mushrooms and herbs (and cacao!) and is delicious, with 1/7 the caffeine as coffee.
