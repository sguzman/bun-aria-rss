  "description": "Houston residents and elected officials are trying to stop the largest urban highway project of their lifetimes -- one that would clear out more than 1,000 homes in primarily Black and Latin neighborhoods and, they say, introduce additional flooding and health risks. Now, residents have a powerful new ally in Washington: the Biden administration. The fate of I-45 may tell us something about what 21st-century infrastructure will look like. \nGuests: Tomaro Bell, Houston resident and community leader, and Oni Blair, executive director of LINK Houston. \nSlate Plus members get bonus segments and ad-free podcast feeds.
