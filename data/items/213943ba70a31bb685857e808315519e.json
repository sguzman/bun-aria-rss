In this, our season finale (don't cry, we'll be back!), we are paying close attention to the very special voices that make us feel stuff. _And thangs_. We go South, and sample the very specific delights of Big KRIT, travel to England for a slice of Andrew Lincoln's honeyed tones, hop a plane to Denmark to swoon at the voicebox talents of Mads Mikkelsen, and land back in the velvet embrace of Jeffrey Wright's rasp. Along the way, we reflect on Kathleen Turner's husky whisper, Cree Summers' epic career, and Jennifer Tilly's starlet's twinkle. And there's Fanfic Wars, obviously, and well, your ears are in for even more of a treat.\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line! Leave us a message at (765) 8-THIRST (765-884-4778) with your name and what kind of crush advice you're looking for, and maybe we'll answer your question in an upcoming Thirst Sommelier. \nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit.
