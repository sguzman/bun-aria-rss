  "description": "<p>When it comes to sex, why was the world set up so that vulva owners are the ones in charge of preventing a pregnancy? That’s the central question of a Twitter thread that went viral in 2018, and on today’s show I’ve got Gabrielle Stanley Blair, the author of that thread – and a forthcoming book, <em>Ejaculate Responsibly</em> – here to talk about it. I’m also joined by anthropologist, author, and my dear friend Dr. Wednesday Martin, to unpack this fascinating topic.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In a post-Roe world, Gabrielle is calling for a wholesale shift in the way we think about pregnancy prevention: namely, by inviting penis owners and their bodies into the conversation. On today’s show, we talk condoms and sexual pleasure, how society pressures vulva owners to become mothers, how to talk to young men about ejaculating responsibly, why MORE sex ed leads to LESS unwanted pregnancies, and why Gabrielle – mother of six and a Mormon – is passionate about arguing that women’s lives matter, and so does their pleasure.&nbsp;</p><br><p>One more thing: Can pre-ejaculate, or pre-cum, cause unwanted pregnancy? Pre-ejaculate actually does NOT contain sperm. However, any sperm remaining in the urethra <em>from a previous ejaculation</em> may be carried out with pre-cum which would have a chance of causing a pregnancy.</p><br><p>The solution? Urinate before having sex to flush out any leftover sperm, and, as always, wear a condom!</p><br><p>For more information, visit <a href=\"http://teenhealthsource.com/blog/faq-can-precum-get-you-pregnant/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Teen Health Source</a>.</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>More Gabrielle Blair: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/designmom/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/designmom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"https://designmom.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/designmom/status/1040363431893725184\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gabrielle’s Viral Twitter Thread</a></li><li><a href=\"https://designmom.com/ejaculate-responsibly-book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">More information about her forthcoming book: <em>Ejaculate Responsibly</em></a></li><li>More Dr Wednesday Martin: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wednesdaymartinphd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WednesdayMartin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter </a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://wednesdaymartin.com/books/untrue/v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/the-secret-to-better-sex-talking-about-it/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Secret to Better Sex?
