When aiming for perfection hinders your performance and ability to execute, it’s time to rethink your strategy. Being imperfect still allows you to achieve more than most ever will if you are willing to value the sincere pursuit of your goal over feeling good enough trying to avoid failure along the way.<br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction<br />0:21 | Perfectionism Doesn’t Serve You<br />5:30 | Value the Sincere Pursuit <br />10:19 | Is It Perfection or High Standards?<br />14:00 | How to Set Standards<br />18:42 | Constructive Self-Criticism<br /><br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />“Kicking yourself in the ass is super powerful, but my rule is, I never do anything that diminishes my sense of self.” [5:52]<br /><br />“Reach for the farthest star in the world, but don't value yourself for whether or not you achieve it.
