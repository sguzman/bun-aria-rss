  "description": "For people with autism, navigating a neurotypical world can be exhausting. Many deploy strategies to fit in with others, a tactic often referred to as <em>masking. </em>Social psychologist Devon Price spoke to Eric Garcia, author of <em>Unmasking Autism</em>, on <em>Life Kit</em> about the freedom that comes from unmasking. Price says neurodivergent people can find greater self-acceptance by getting in touch with the person they were before they started trying to fit in. Price and Garcia, who both have autism, talk about how unmasking means progress for disability justice. This is an encore episode from May 2022. ",
