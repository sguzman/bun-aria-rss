  "description": "<p>Ray Bradbury once described his first novel,&nbsp;The Martian Chronicles,&nbsp;as a collection of short stories \"pretending to be a novel.\" In fact, many of the Martian stories were published individually, and it wasn't until 1950 that Bradbury stitched them all together. </p><p>This patchwork storytelling made it hard for us to get a bead on&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;. Craig liked it, but we found it hard to discuss why without the benefit of a central character or singular narrative.
