When I contacted her it was fun to learn she has only been quilting two years.\n------\nMany quilters are involved with the Quilts of Valor. By volunteering and making quilts to be given. The organization was started in 2003 by founder Catherine Roberts after her son Nat was deployed in Iraq. Since 2003 they have given 200,000 quilts. Their website has a wonderful history section where you can learn how the organization progressed from her initial idea to what it is today. I have Sue Reich the Board President with me today.\n------\nJenni Smith is one of the few designers I had a chance to meet in person first! She was at the Aurifil Booth at one of the trade shows.
