  "description": "<p>Immortalized in Tom Wolfe’s famous book, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, the Merry Pranksters were a pivotal link between the Beat Generation of the 1950s and both the Grateful Dead and the hippie generation that emerged later in the 1960s. Mountain Girl was romantically involved, and had children, with both the Pranksters’ leader, Ken Kesey (author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest), and the Grateful Dead’s, Jerry Garcia. She thus was both witness to and participant in many of the central events of the 1960s counterculture, including the famed Acid Tests. MG and I talked about the incredible cast of characters she got to know, the role of LSD and other drugs, and the challenges of raising young children in the midst of it all. And we discussed her more recent involvement with cannabis and psychedelics, including co-founding the Women’s Visionary Congress.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
