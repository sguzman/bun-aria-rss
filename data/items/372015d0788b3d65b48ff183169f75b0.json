  "description": "I just came back from Baltimore, where I recorded a new special report I'm excited to share with you… how to make an absolute fortune from future government policies. [0:17] The Russia-Ukraine crisis is creating tons of market volatility and uncertainty—but this will be a short-term problem for investors. [4:00] I call out Europe for talking a big game against Russia… without any serious consequences. I also call out Germany and Great Britain for their weak actions in the conflict. [5:57] Why Russia has the most leverage of any country in the world right now… why it may not invade Ukraine after all… and why Ukraine isn’t as innocent of a country as it seems… [10:15] While Russia/Ukraine tensions have taken center stage… the bigger risk investors should be worrying about is the Fed and how it plans to control runaway inflation. Some believe this risk is already priced in based on a leading indicator… [14:10] I highlight companies/sectors you should continue to avoid… while explaining how to structure your portfolio to take advantage of the volatility.
