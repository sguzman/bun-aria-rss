  "title": "Thanatology — NEW Interview (GRIEF & MOURNING) with Cole Imperi + tips for Going Through It",
  "description": "<p>If you have a physical body, or know someone who does, this episode is for you! Hello, we’re all going to die. And we’re probably all going to lose someone we love. Thanatologist Cole Imperi has become a dear friend and on July 17, 2022 we pulled up a street corner in LA to chat about what she’s been up to and how to cope with the loss of a loved one. Hear about the blooming of friendship and the passing of your Grandpod, then after the break it’s a solo advice dump from me – your internet dad –  with all of the handy tips that listeners and Cole gave me as I have been Going Through It. Everything is going to be okay. It might suck here and there, but the best we can do is love hard, live fully, and cherish the memories. Also: cut bangs, text your crush, eat a tiny ice cream cone. </p><p>Cole Imperi's <a href=\"https://coleimperi.com\" target=\"_blank\">website</a></p><p>Follow Cole on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/imperi/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ColeImperi\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@coleimperi\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok</a></p><p>A donation was made to <a href=\"https://americanthanatology.com\" target=\"_blank\">The School of American Thanatology</a></p><p>Follow The School of American Thanatology on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/schoolofamericanthanatology/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.greatfallstribune.com/obituaries/gft050187\" target=\"_blank\">Grandpod’s obituary</a></p><p>You may also enjoy our episodes on: <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/thanatologyencore\" target=\"_blank\">Thanatology Encore (DEATH &DYING)</a>, <a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/ologies-with-alie-ward/fearology-pt-1-fear-with-mary-poffenroth-encore-pr\" target=\"_blank\">Fearology (FEAR & ANXIETY)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/eudemonology\" target=\"_blank\">Eudemonology (HAPPINESS),</a> <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/awesomeology\" target=\"_blank\">Awesomeology (GRATITUDE FOR LITTLE THINGS)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/hematology\" target=\"_blank\">Hematology (BLOOD)</a></p><p><a href=\"https://alieward.com/smologies\" target=\"_blank\">Smologies (short, classroom-safe) episodes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://alieward.com/ologies-sponsors\" target=\"_blank\">Sponsors of Ologies</a></p><p><a href=\"https://alieward.com/ologies-extras\" target=\"_blank\">Transcripts and bleeped episodes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Become a patron of Ologies</a> for as little as a buck a month</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ologiesmerch.com\" target=\"_blank\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, masks, totes!</p><p>Follow @Ologies on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Follow @AlieWard on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Sound editing by <a href=\"https://www.jarrettsleeper.com\" target=\"_blank\">Jarrett Sleeper</a> of <a href=\"https://www.mindjammedia.com\" target=\"_blank\">MindJam Media</a></p><p>Transcripts by Emily White of <a href=\"https://www.thewordary.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Wordary</a></p><p>Website by <a href=\"https://www.kellyrdwyer.com/photo\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly R.
