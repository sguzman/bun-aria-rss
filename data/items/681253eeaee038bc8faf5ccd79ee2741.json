  "description": "<p>It's time to return to the sport of gymnastics today as we chat with Aussie Tokyo Olympian Georgia Godwin about her Olympic experience and her amazing career. We find out from Georgia about her trampoline roots and switching focus into artistic gymnastics and at what point she realised it was the sport for her and something she could pursue as a career. We also learn about overcoming the disappointment of narrowly missing out on the Rio Olympics and how a sneaky week away was the turning point in making her strive towards the Tokyo Games. Added to this we learn more about the strategic side to gymnastics and just which legendary Aussie Olympian she is backing to light to cauldron at the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. It's a chat that you simply must listen to so get to it!</p>",
