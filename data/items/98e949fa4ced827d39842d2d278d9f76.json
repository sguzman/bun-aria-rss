  "description": "Today on the show, I have a question that deals with the ethical issues tied up in the response to the China Virus. Lots of people think the response is overblown and will do more harm than good. They might be right. Which is why I hope this question might help clarify things. Also, Five Headlines, including some expert medical advice from the esteemed scholar and thinker Vanessa Hudgens. And the Philadelphia police department has officially canceled itself. \n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
