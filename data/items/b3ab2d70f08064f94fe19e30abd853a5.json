  "description": "\"<em>To</em> Asian women, not for—there's no speaking for us, splendidly vast and manifold as our people are.\" So writes Korean-American novelist R.O. Kwon in an essay in <em>Vanity Fair</em>. The essay explores the reasons that R.O. was unable to talk openly with her own mother about rising anti-Asian rhetoric and violence in the past year, and how she finally broke that silence. In this episode, <em>Rough Translation</em> producer Justine Yan talks with R.O. about what the essay meant to her, and how to break familiar silences surrounding Asian American communities.",
