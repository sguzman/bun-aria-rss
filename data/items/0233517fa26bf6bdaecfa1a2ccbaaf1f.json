In truth, diagnoses are just names we associate with a collection of symptoms. They tell us nothing about why someone has those symptoms—the root causes of the “disease.” Functional Medicine seeks to dig deeper to look for the root cause of symptoms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Dr. Elizabeth Boham, Dr. Todd LePine, and Dr. George Papanicolaou about how patients miss out on true healing when the root cause of their symptoms is not addressed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing, she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Todd LePine graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and is board certified in Internal Medicine, specializing in Integrative Functional Medicine. He is an Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years. Dr. LePine’s focus at The UltraWellness Center is to help his patients achieve optimal health and vitality by restoring the natural balance to both the mind and the body. His areas of interest include optimal aging, bio-detoxification, functional gastrointestinal health, systemic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and the neurobiology of mood and cognitive disorders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. George Papanicolaou is a graduate of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and is board certified in Family Medicine from Abington Memorial Hospital. He is also an Institute for Functional Medicine Practitioner. In 2000, he founded Cornerstone Family Practice in Rowley, MA. He practiced with a philosophy centered on personal relationships and treating the whole person, not just not the disease. He calls his philosophy “Whole Life Wellness.” Over time, as the healthcare system made it harder for patients to receive this kind of personal care, Dr. Papanicolaou decided a change was needed. He began training in Functional Medicine through the Institute of Functional Medicine. In 2015, he established Cornerstone Personal Health, a practice dedicated entirely to Functional Medicine. Dr. Papanicolaou joined The UltraWellness Center in 2017.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens and InsideTracker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Right now when you purchase AG1 from Athletic Greens, you will receive 10 FREE travel packs with your first purchase by visiting <a href=\"http://athleticgreens.com/hyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">athleticgreens.com/hyman</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>InsideTracker is a personalized health and wellness platform like no other.
