  "description": "I went to the movie theater last night to see Spider-Man: No Way Home… and it was absolutely packed. I highlight what that says about Omicron (and a few new trailers that have me excited). [0:30] But today’s show is all about answering your most asked questions… Why did I choose to list the Curzio Equity Owners (CEO) token on tZERO instead of another platform like Coinbase? What’s the difference between exchanges that trade utility tokens vs. security tokens? And tZERO’s huge advantage when it comes to the latter... [3:05] What’s the best trade of my career? I share a couple of my big winners—from energy to crypto… and why most investors should focus on investing vs. trading. I also go over the incredible opportunities you can find with private placements. (By the way, members of our most elite club, Curzio One, have had the chance to get into several of these exclusive deals.) [15:12] Finally, what are my favorite—and least favorite—large-cap stocks for 2022? [26:26] And… we have several incredible deals for you to end the year—including a 50% discount on our entire library of products. [36:40] Enjoyed this episode?
