  "description": "<p>A listener writes “I sent you an encounter that has left me terrified and I look to your show for answers and my experience was in freaking Iowa. I’m a rational man,this display of what I’m trying to this day to grasp was unlike anything I can compare. I have listened to many of your shows and what happened to us hasn’t quite hit the mark.i have a horror show to tell and I have more questions than answers. My whole life this creature only excited in Rudolph the red nosed reindeer and growing up in Nebraska where you can see for miles I of course felt safe. What I thought is a Crack from hell itself had opened up and unleashed a beast unlike anything I could understand. My perspective is so much different than what I have been listening to is well close but this beast wanted to invoke sheer terror. This creature was almost 10 feet high and wrecked an oak tree. It was only 30 feet away bellowing out a sound that I can only describe as prehistoric. We had a bonfire burning for maybe 5 hours while moving these people into an old farmhouse. It must have smelled the fire. It was like a horror movie. We put the fridge in front of the back door and ran to the front room to block the front door and there was a giant window. We were to afraid to make any noise so we waited and watched tire dwindle. Nothing else happened but we watched for what seemed like days waiting for this beast to walk right through the house and certainly devour us. We found only a destroyed old oak that had spread branches and bark,it’s limbs as thick as my waist twisted and cracked from the main trunk. This was true terror. I think these things should be treated as homicide maniacs…”</p>",
