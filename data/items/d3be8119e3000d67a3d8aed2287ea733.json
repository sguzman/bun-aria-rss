  "description": "<p>The Driskill Hotel was built in Austin, Texas and it's no surprise that this location was chosen as it is the terminus of the Southern most route of the Chisolm Trail. The hotel was built in the late 1800s and serves guests to this day. It emanates a timeless charm and the hotel claims that \"every room tells a story.\" There are stories here for more than just the living. Some consider this to be the most active paranormal location in Austin. There is a legend of suicidal brides and there are spirits of others who have died here. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Driskill Hotel. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Anna Prado-Frias and features the Mannequins of the John Lawson House and This Day in History is by April Rogers-Krick and features a Peruvian Soccer Match Riot. Our location was suggested by and researched by Whitney Land.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/05/hgb-episode-126-driskill-hotel.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/05/hgb-episode-126-driskill-hotel.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",
