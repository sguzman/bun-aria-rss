  "description": "In Temporal Politics: Contested Pasts, Uncertain Futures (Edinburgh UP, 2022), Adrian Little demonstrates how different conceptions of past, present and future contribute to the nature of political conflict in the world today. Reacting against narratives of political disillusionment and apathy, he focuses on how a new understanding of political temporality can inform our approach to political problems. He forms his argument around three major cases in which the nature of past, present and future is contested: Indigenous politics in settler colonies; the politics of bordering and migration; and debates over the future of democracy.\nLittle shows how to rethink ways in which we can act on intractable issues in politics beyond philosophical analysis. In doing so, he brings together a theory of temporality with a model of political action derived from process philosophy to reinvigorate temporal understandings of the problems that political actors face.\nProf. Adrian Little is Pro Vice-Chancellor at the University of Melbourne.   \nGargi Binju is a researcher at the University of Tübingen.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
