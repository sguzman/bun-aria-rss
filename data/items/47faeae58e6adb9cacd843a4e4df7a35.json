When it ended, El Chapo’s son was released. So why did the Mexican government give into the Sinaloa cartel’s demands? And what can be done on both sides of the border to stop such brutal violence?\nGuest: León Krauze, journalist at Univision and Slate columnist\nPodcast production by Mary Wilson, Jayson De Leon, Danielle Hewitt, and Mara Silvers.\nSlate Plus members get bonus segments and ad-free podcast feeds. Sign up now.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
