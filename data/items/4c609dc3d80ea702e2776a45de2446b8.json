  "description": "<p>Do you own your dream for your life? Do you even have a dream for your life? Those are a couple of the questions John C. Maxwell asks in this new series, Put Your Dream to the Test, based on his book of the same title. Many people don’t have a dream for their life or they give up too quickly on the one they do have. Sometimes their dream isn’t actually their dream––it’s someone else’s dream for them.</p> <p>In John’s book and online course, he asks 10 questions that will help you make your dream a reality. This series covers the first of those 10 questions––the ownership question––which asks, “Is your dream really your dream?” This episode will help you identify if you truly own your dream and how you can make it a reality.</p> <p>During the discussion, Mark Cole and Jason Brooks point out that having a dream takes courage and hard work. They challenge you to start betting on yourself, take an inventory of your dream(s), and ask, “Do I own my dream?”</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Put Your Dream to the Test Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Dream and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Put-Your-Dream-to-the-Test--Paperback_p_1686.html\"> <em>Put Your Dream to the Test</em> by John C.
