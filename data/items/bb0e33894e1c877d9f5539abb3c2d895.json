  "description": "Today on the show we'll discuss a real attack on the press. But this is one that the press itself ignores, and maybe even defends, because of their ideological allegiances. Also, in the wake of an embarrassing Ben Carson video, we'll try to figure out why Trump made Carson head of HUD rather than appointing him Surgeon General or head of Health and Human services. And finally, why have we decided that it's smart for young married couples to begin their lives together by bankrupting themselves on expensive rings and fancy wedding receptions? Date: 05-22-19\nLearn more about your ad choices.
