  "description": "<p>This one's chuck FULL of the good stuff. The \"good stuff\" in question is, of course, culture and our guest Shalewa Sharpe, host of the new podcast The War Report (new episodes every Thursday!) is a damn expert on it. From the straight camp of Meat Loaf to the pop stylings of Ashlee Simpson and the aesthetic design impact of the recent premium streaming services' logos, there is nothing Shalewa cannot culturally dissect. She and the hosts get into it about Sesame Street and ask the hard questions about the block: Who is the biggest legend on the street? What is the deal with Snuffaluffagus? What is the true nature of the Bert and Ernie relationship? Do we, as a society, tolerate Elmo too much? And what can we learn about impulse control from Cookie Monster? All this, thoughts and reflections on Billie Eilish's new aesthetic, the music videos that had the biggest impact on Shalewa's life sartorially, the culture of clubbin', hideous aughts clothing and why we were dressing in it, The Circle season two, Queen Latifah, and the ancient rivalry between Verizon Fios and Spectrum wireless internet. So, yeah. Did we miss anything? It's Rule of Culture #128: \"No!\" Listen now, check out The War Report and follow Shalewa @silkyjumbo after you fall in love with her.
