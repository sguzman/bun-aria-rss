  "description": "<p>Tonight I will be speaking to two eyewitnesses. Jacob writes \"I'm 32 years old Oregon woodland firefighter. I have hiked around a lot of woods. I am also a skeptic, I'm not sure what exactly it was that I saw or experienced.<br /> I will also be speaking to Roland. Roland writes \"I live on Northern Ute tribe here in Utah. I have seen a lot of things being an outfitter and guide here for about 20 years I have had run-ins with Bigfoot and we did see one that we almost shot But I didn’t realize what it was until now. I have seen some strange things, I grew up 2 miles from Skin Walker Ranch\"</p>",
