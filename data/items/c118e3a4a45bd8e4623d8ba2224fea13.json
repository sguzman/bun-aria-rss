    "media:description": "Should billionaires exist? According to the new AppleTV series “Loot,” no.\n\nHowever, the show is missing a key point when it comes to the situation. \n\nEntrepreneurs have to provide value to their customers, strive to innovate and keep their customers happy. \n\nAnd in a free market, they have to continuously produce value for consumers or risk losing it all. \n\nAs long as their wealth is accumulated by serving customers, billionaires should be celebrated not condemned.\n——————————\nCREDITS: \nWritten by Abby Richardson & Sean W.
