So in 2004, the following year, they initiated what they called a reform to the religious field, haql dini.\"\n\nAnn Wainscott is an assistant professor of political science at Miami University in Ohio where she teaches Middle East politics. She is currently on leave to serve as the American Academy of Religion senior fellow at the United States Institute Institute of Peace (USIP). Prior to teaching at Miami, she taught at Saint Louis University for four years. She has conducted fieldwork in Morocco, Senegal, Ghana, and Mali. She earned a PhD from the University of Florida in 2013.\n\n\"I see this movement away from a very rigid religious policy and towards an effort to absorb other ideologies that the Moroccan state sees as threatening and then to find a way to position the Moroccan monarchy as in some way superior.\"",
