  "title": "PMS 2.0 394 - Julian Edelman Retires, James Jones, Tom E. Curran, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about Julian Edelman's retirement after 12 seasons in the NFL and why he was such an incredible player and why it's unfortunate that people jump directly to the Hall of Fame discussion, plus they look more at Aaron Rodgers' contract situation and why it is so interesting. Joining the show is Super Bowl Champion, 2012 NFL leader in receiving touchdowns, Green Bay Packer legend and friend of the program, James Jones to chat about what he thinks will happen with Aaron Rodgers, who he thinks the best QB is in this draft class, what it is about rookie WR's coming into the NFL and being successful right away, and how long it took to develop his chemistry with Aaron Rodgers (19:37-43:24). Next, NBC Sports Boston Insider and friend of the show, Tom E. Curran joins the program to chat about Julian Edelman's retirement (he co-wrote a book with Edelman) if he thinks the Patriots are a playoff team now, and much more in a hilarious conversation (45:41-1:02:52). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk chat about everything happening in the NFL and the world and potentially book a big guest (1:14:53-1:46:03).
