  "description": "<p>Good morning and welcome to the ride! Big Dog don't do sick too well.  The CLO and his descriptions and sound efx tho!  There is a difference between buying a chicken sandwich than saving a soul.  What happened after the beep today?  Bitterman is being hella hateful towards lightskinned individuals that are the lead in their musical groups.  Big Dog has another viral video and he talks about high and low points.  March Madness is here and it still is not enough for Steve because of who went to Cleveland.  This round of Would You Rather will make your comfort level fluctuate!  It's Bitterman's Birthday and Fool #1 has a recommendation for Fool #2.  There is a special 102 year old nun out there that is very important.  Today in Closing Remarks, Steve talks to us about chances and calculated risks.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
