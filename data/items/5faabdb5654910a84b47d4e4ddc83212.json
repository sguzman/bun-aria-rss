So we reached across our mentor network to bring you podcasts on everything from how to finish that project, to how to take care of your beautiful mind. Wish we’d bring in an expert about something? Email us at cgessler@gmail.com or dr.danamalone@gmail.com. Find us on Twitter: The Academic Life @AcademicLifeNBN.\nIn this episode you’ll hear about: the steps to creating a writing career after college; the children’s book market; the difference between a pitch, a hook, a logline, and a synopsis; the importance of building a support network; and a discussion of the book Premeditated Myrtle.\nOur guest is: Elizabeth C. Bunce, the author of the Myrtle Hardcastle mystery book series. Elizabeth’s books are inspired by real places and cultures of the past, often with otherworldly or magical elements. She has been writing for as long as she can remember, and has always been interested in literature, folklore, history, and culture. She studied English and anthropology in college. When she’s not writing, she’s usually making something—cosplay, needlework, historical costuming, quilting—but not cooking.\nYour host is: Dr. Christina Gessler, a historian of women, gender, and sexuality. She specializes in decoding diaries written by rural women in 19th century America. She belongs to a critique group for children’s book writers, and has been an active member of SCBWI for over a decade. When she’s not reading, writing, podcasting, or teaching, she can be spotted taking walks along the shore and working on her nature photography. She seldom cooks.\nListeners to this episode might be interested in:\n\n\nPremeditated Myrtle by Elizabeth Bunce\n\n\nWired for Story by Lisa Cron\n\n\nThe Magic Words: Writing Great Books for Children and Young Adults by Cheryl Klein\n\n\nBook in a Month by Victoria Lynn Schmidt\n\n\nStealing Hollywood: Screenwriting Tricks for Authors by Andrea Sokoloff\n\nThe Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators\n\nThe Highlights Foundation\n\nThe Vermont College of Fine Arts MFA in Writing for Children and Young Adults\n\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
