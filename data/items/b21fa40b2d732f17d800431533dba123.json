  "title": "The end of Stalinist rule in Albania",
  "description": "In 1990 Albania’s communist government agreed to allow independent political parties following a wave of protests. Lea Ypi was an 11 year old schoolgirl at the time and watched events with consternation – she was a firm believer in what she had been taught about communism at school, and an admirer of Stalin. But she soon discovered that her parents had a secret past that they had been afraid to reveal to her before 1990. Lea talks to Rob Walker about her life growing up inside the world’s last Stalinist state.\n\nPicture: Lea Ypi as a child in Albania with her grandmother. (Credit: Photo provided by Lea Ypi)",
