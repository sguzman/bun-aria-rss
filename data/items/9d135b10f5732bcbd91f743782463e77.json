  "title": "Byron Katie: Set Yourself Free",
  "description": "<p>Best-selling author, speaker and teacher Byron Katie shares how she believes we can end our own suffering forever. Katie, as she is known, guides us through her powerful process of inquiry she calls “The Work.” She says we can radically shift our stressful beliefs about our lives, other people and ourselves. Katie explains that all the problems in the world originate in our thinking and gives us the tools to open our minds and set ourselves free. Based on her own experience of how suffering is created and ended, Katie says her simple process is accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds and requires nothing more than a pen, paper and an open mind. Katie is the founder of “Byron Katie International,” an organization that includes The School for the Work and Turnaround House in Ojai, California. TIME magazine describes her as \"a spiritual innovator for the 21st century.\" </p><p><br /></p>\n",
