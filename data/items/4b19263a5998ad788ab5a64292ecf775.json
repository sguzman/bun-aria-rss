Despite its long association with gout and kidney stones, it’s involved in so much more—especially our metabolic disease epidemic. There are three things that raise our levels of uric acid: purines, alcohol, and fructose. The latter is the biggest challenge, due to its overwhelming presence in our Standard American Diet. That doesn’t mean all fruit is bad or even that all alcohol and purine-rich foods have the same effect. Like all parts of health and nutrition, there are nuances we need to consider to create optimal health.</p><br><p>That’s why I’m so excited to take a deep dive into the topic of uric acid with my friend and colleague Dr. David Perlmutter.
