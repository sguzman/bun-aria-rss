  "description": "I can’t wait to chat with Deb Tucker! She has been creating and teaching quiltmaking for 30+ years and her specialty is piecing efficiency. From patterns to tools to demos Deb can help us get it right easily!\n------------\nAuthor, Moda fabric designer and curator of fun project, my friend Amy Ellis always has something going on! We are going to chat about some of her collaborations including her new modern quilt publications that are very unique!\n------------\nI love when Heidi Kaisand of Hen & Chicks Studio joins me! Heidi and I have worked together for many years and we have shared a lot of creative ideas. What I love about her and what she does in her shop, is that she explores ways to be creative that are not just making quilts. We are going to share a few top ways to be creative that are similar, but different to quilt making.\n------------\nI have long admired the work of Janine Vangool, who is the publisher, editor and designer of UPPERCASE, which a quarterly print magazine for ‘the creative and curious’. I love that tag line! Her publications are inspired by design, typography, illustration and craft. Her magazine and books celebrate the process of making, the commitment to craft and the art of living creatively, my kind of gal! She is also a fabric designer for Windham and today we are going to talk about her creative process.\n================\nVisit American Patchwork & Quilting at www.allpeoplequilt.com.\nVisit host Pat Sloan at www.patsloan.com.\n================\nBONUS for our podcast subscribers!
