  "description": "It’s the Team Chase at the Stables; the opening of the cross-country course.  Mia is asking questions about the horses.  She seems very engaged with it.  Her interest grows in the work of the Stables, though Alice says there are no job opportunities there just now.  Mia’s a bit shocked by some of the riders’ use of the whip.  Mia also talks to Oliver about the Hunt Ball which is on again at last. When she learns there could be work available there, she tells Oliver she might be keen.  \n\nElizabeth is impressed with the whole event.  Elizabeth and Oliver think the return of the Hunt Ball is something to celebrate, though we hear that Peggy is not in celebratory mood. She’s boycotting St Stephens over the stained-glass window saga.  \n\nMeanwhile Beth is surprised when Chelsea turns up on the doorstep.  She’s looking for Ben, who isn’t there, but Beth is welcoming.  When Ben arrives, it’s difficult for Chelsea. She tells him she’s decided to have a termination.  It will have to be next week, because she’s decided late.  Ben is quiet. He tells Chelsea how brave she is, and says he wants to come with her.  But Chelsea doesn’t want him to – her mum will be there, and she doesn’t know he’s the father.  Later with Beth, Ben is tense. Beth is trying her best to back him up, but Ben is volatile.  He despises himself.  He can’t bear to talk about it, and leaves.",
