  "description": "<p>We consider a variant of the charge-Q compact Abelian-Higgs model, in which\nan Nf-dimensional complex vector is coupled with an Abelian Z_q gauge field.\nFor Nf=2 and Q=1 we observe several transition lines that belong to the O(4),\nO(3), and O(2) vector universality classes, depending on the symmetry breaking\npattern at the transition. The universality class is independent of $q$ as long\nas q&gt;=3. The universality class of the transition is uniquely determined by the\nbehavior of the scalar fields; gauge fields do not play any role. We also\ninvestigate the system for Nf=15 and Q=2. In the presence of U(1) gauge fields,\nthe system undergoes transitions associated with charged fixed points of the\nAbelian-Higgs field theory. These continuous transitions turn into first-order\nones when the U(1) gauge fields are replaced by the discrete Z_q fields: in the\npresent compact model charged transitions appear to be very sensitive to the\nnature of the gauge fields\n</p>",
