  "description": "The growth of new reading platforms in the past decade drove a ton of growth in the publishing industry, leading to the consolidation of some of the biggest names in the business. While that might be good news for publishers…it’s not so great for authors, editors, and readers. Fewer publication houses means fewer books being promoted, fewer authors being discovered, and fewer stories being read. Today, Cindy Spiegel, the CEO of independent publishing house Spiegel & Grow, joins us to discuss the implications of this consolidation and the importance of indie publishing houses for the future of the industry.",
