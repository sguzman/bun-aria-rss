  "description": "<p>Dear Steve and Miss strawberry. I have been dating my boyfriend for over a year and I love him so much. We hardly ever argue or fight because we live an hour away from each other so when we are together we make the best of our time. We do everything together except one big thing when we do see each other. I always find a way to avoid having sex with him. He is very handsome but when it comes to the bedroom he just doesn't have it. I hardly ever get in the mood with him. He doesn't complain much but I can tell he gets frustrated sometimes I just lie there and fake moan and lie about how good he is in bed............</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
