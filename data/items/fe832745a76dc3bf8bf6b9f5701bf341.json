  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, the American Marxist elements in America, backed by the media and embraced by the Democrat party, have brought us the crime wave we are seeing across the country. The George Floyd riots in 2020 were seen as an opportunity for a war on cops, capitalism, and society. The Democrat party has the help from George Soros to destroy America from within. Until Soros and the Democrat Party are held to account this crime will continue. We have a lack of leaders who will stand up to these radicals. Also, a Wall Street Journal poll shows Hispanic voters are evenly split between parties and split between backing Donald Trump and President Biden. It’s all about economics. A lot of people who have come to America have suffered through socialism or autocracies. They see what's happening now and reject it. They want the benefits of a free society. Later, Mark Meadows has sued January 6 committee members and Nancy Pelosi because they are trying to compel him to violate executive privilege. They needed to go on offense and they are doing it; they are fighting back!  Finally, Scott Atlas calls in to discuss his new book, A Plague Upon Our House: My Fight at the Trump White House to Stop COVID from Destroying America.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Plague-Upon-Our-House-Destroying/dp/163758220X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=scott+atlas&qid=1638914455&sr=8-1\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
