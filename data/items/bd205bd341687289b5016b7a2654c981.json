Read <em>Waking Up With the Duke </em>at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ReCfWR\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/waking-up-with-the-duke-lorraine-heath/1100050545?ean=9780062022455\">Barnes & Noble</a>, <a href=\"https://books.apple.com/us/book/waking-up-with-the-duke/id421967388?app=itunes&at=1l3vpAR&mt=11\">Apple Books</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/waking-up-with-the-duke\">Kobo</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Show Notes</p><p class=\"\">Jen's disappointed with the <a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast-awards/#packages\">iHeartRadio Podscast awards</a>. It's an honor just to be nominated, and that didn't even happen! For your consideration: Best Pop Culture Podcast and Best Fiction Podcast! Come on! <a href=\"https://www.literarydisco.com/\">Literary Disco</a> wasn't even nominated!</p><p class=\"\">Everyone loved <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/12/31/s0217-pegging-romance-interstitial\">The Pegging episode</a>! Jen found this really <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ev55aj/my-first-time-pegging-someone-changed-how-i-think-about-sex\">interesting article</a> too late for those show notes, but why not drop them here? We don't really think that we <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark\">jumped the shark</a>. Oh, and any chance to drop the \"<a href=\"s://twitter.com/shutupaida/status/1116548553906774018\">smashing from the back</a>\" rap.</p><p class=\"\">The 20 minutes Eric cut were about RWA. So just read <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/romance-writers-america-sinking-ship/\">Jen's article for Kirkus instead</a>. Just kidding. We don't really need <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directors_and_officers_liability_insurance\">D & O insurance</a>. Do we?
