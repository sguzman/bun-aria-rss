We are the FuseSchool Team, who work alongside talented teachers, translators, designers and volunteers from Ukraine, South Africa and Europe.\nFuseSchool has more than 800 educational videos on Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics, but they are in English.\n\nWe want to support Ukrainians and help students in their war damaged studies, so we decided to translate our videos to Ukrainian. Itâ€™s BIG TASK AND WE HAVE USED  AI  TECHNOLOGY to translate our videos. Sometimes AI technology is pretty stubborn, and refuse to say certain words the right way and sounds just like a robot, still it makes surprisingly correct emphasis on words, problematic for some Ukrainian native speakers. \n\nWE HOPE TO SERVE THE UKRAINIAN STUDENTS ALL OVER THER WORLD BY HELPING THEM EDUCATIONALLY DURING THIS TIME. \n\nThere must be more and more Ukrainian content! The world stands with Ukraine",
