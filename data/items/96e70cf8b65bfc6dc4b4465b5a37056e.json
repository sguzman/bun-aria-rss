  "title": "Uncle Si's COVID-19 Story",
  "description": "Si went to the hospital (under protest, of course). We knew something had to be wrong when he was quiet and wouldn't laugh or smile. He was diagnosed with COVID-19, drove everyone at the hospital nuts, came home, and took a turn for the worse. But as Martin said, \"It ain't gettin' Si. Not on my watch.\" Many of you reached out to find out where Si's been, so we decided to share the whole story of his ups and downs with the coronavirus, along with some of our favorite memories of the often headstrong, always hilarious, one-of-a-kind Si Robertson.  \nLearn more about your ad choices.
