  "title": "[Unedited]: Thomas Piketty On Creating A More Equal Society",
  "description": "French economist Thomas Piketty is one of the leading intellectuals documenting inequality, with his 2013 book “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” becoming widely read and cited. His new book, \"A Brief History of Equality,\" is more optimistic: In it, Piketty documents how our world has become relatively more equal since the end of the 18th century.\n\nIn this unedited conversation, Piketty talks to Bethany and Luigi about the lessons from this movement toward equality and where it could go next – especially regarding policy choices such as taxes, reparations, and redistribution toward more racial, democratic, and global equality. Among others, they discuss: Would people favor massive redistribution? What kind of institutions would be required to oversee markets? Can true progress be achieved without equality?",
