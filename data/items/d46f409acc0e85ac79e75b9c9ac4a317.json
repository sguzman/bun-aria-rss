  "description": "<p>Episode 223 - This is the most unique podcast I have done to date. Patrick Kindlon is the vocalist for Self Defense Family and Drug Church. He’s a man of many talents and was one of my most requested guests on social media and finally, we have him on. We have a wide ranging discussion about internet culture, context and racist music. No stone is unturned in this chat and we hardly address any of the questions I prepared for him, but the conversation was incredible nonetheless. Consider being a Bone Marrow donor, like me.
