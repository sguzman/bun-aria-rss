  "description": "Emma’s suspicions are well founded after George offers to help with the housework and then asks for an advance on his allowance to buy a gaming chair.  Emma agrees, if he commits to more housework.  Later Eddie catches George buying the chair and points out that George still owes him seventy five pounds for the pheasants.  When he asks George why he isn’t at college, George says his lecturer is off sick.  But just as Eddie’s about to check if this is true with the college, George admits he’s skiving because he hasn’t done his course work.  He loves the practical stuff, but finds the writing side much harder. He tells Eddie he’s been thinking about dropping out of college and getting a job on a farm.  Later Eddie tells Emma about George struggling at college.  When Eddie suggests Mia helping him, Emma thinks it’s a good idea and says she’ll ask her.  George isn’t pleased and wonders if the day can get any worse.\nAlan and Usha try to remove the pigeons from St Stephens and clean up the mess they’ve left.  There’s still one pigeon on a high ledge that won’t budge.  Usha’s happy to leave it there, but Alan won’t risk it creating more mess before Friday’s wedding.  Alan gets a ladder and a broomstick, but as he struggles to reach the pigeon, the ladder topples over taking Alan with it and smashing the Jack Woolley window.  Alan’s fine apart from a minor injury to his hand – but the window isn’t.",
