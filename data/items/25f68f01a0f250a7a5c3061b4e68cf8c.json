  "description": "<p>By all accounts, Jordan DeMay was a well-liked, sports star at his Michigan high school. The 17-year-old committed suicide last week, just hours after someone demanded money to keep a compromising photo from being sent to his parents and friends. The extortionists initially contacted DeMay over a fake social media account, posing as a teen girl who sent him a nude picture. Jordan reciprocated. The photo then became the center of a sextortion scam. The perpetrator pressured DeMay to pay to keep the photo private. The teen sent $300. The perpetrator wanted more. Police say the entire sequence of events appeared to have taken about six hours, until deputies responded to the DeMay home just after 7:30 a.m.</p><p><br></p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Dr. Justin Patchin, Ph.D. - Professor of Criminal Justice, University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, Co-Founder and Co-Director of the Cyberbullying Research Center, Author: \"Bullying Beyond the Schoolyard: Preventing and Responding to Cyberbullying”, justinpatchin.com</li>\n<li>Dan Ellis - Attorney, Herman Law (New York and Florida) Specializing in victims of sexual abuse and harassment, Hermanlaw.com, Instagram: @Dan_Ellis_Esq.</li>\n<li>Dr. Angela Arnold - Psychiatrist, (Atlanta GA) www.angelaarnoldmd.com, Expert in the Treatment of Pregnant/Postpartum Women, Former Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology: Emory University, Former Medical Director of The Psychiatric Ob-Gyn Clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital</li>\n<li>Dr. Michelle DuPre - Former Forensic Pathologist, Medical Examiner and Detective: Lexington County Sheriff's Department, Author: \"Homicide Investigation Field Guide\" & \"Investigating Child Abuse Field Guide\", Forensic Consultant DMichelleDupreMD.com</li>\n<li>Lowell A.
