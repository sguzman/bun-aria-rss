  "title": "Episode 29: The Need for Forgiveness",
  "description": "If ever there was an episode where the video is needed, this would be it. We begin with everyone bickering about the video, and it turns into full-fledged arguing by the end. Spangle threatens to \"harm it.\" Deon is dying to talk about Amber Guyger, the Dallas police officer that killed Botham Jean in his own apartment. Ms. Pat talks about the need to forgive those that hurt us. White Boy Chris gets mad at Ms. Pat. Then Deon gets mad at Ms. Pat. Then Ms. Pat gets mad at a little girl that lied about her hair getting cut. Then Deon gets mad at Chris for not watching black movies. The video will be posted on Wednesday. \n\n- Get the Crack Baby T-Shirt! https://www.mspatcomedy.com/product/crack-baby-t-shirt/\n- Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/patdown\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/patdown\n- Website: https://www.mspatcomedy.com/\nLearn more about your ad choices.
