He tells Sam why he created another podcast, <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/dolly-partons-america\">Dolly Parton's America</a>, examining the life and work of music legend Dolly Parton.  Jad himself grew up in Nashville, where his physician father, a Lebanese immigrant, struck up an unlikely friendship with the singer.  Jad uses this podcast to ask what divides us, and how we can transcend those divides like Dolly does. Maybe. Email the show at <a href=\"mailto:samsanders@npr.org\">samsanders@npr.org</a>. ",
