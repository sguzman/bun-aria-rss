  "description": "<p>The Minifans are locked in a heated and vitriolic war with the Lambily. What is the Lambily? Why are we at war? Those questions will likely haunt Matt Carano until he has dinner at Mamma Mia's. Disgraced actor Kevin Spacey is likening his plight to that of the tens of millions of low-income workers who are now jobless and desperate across the planet thanks to the coronavirus pandemic (0:34:00). Kirk reacts to the some KMS Youtube shit-stirrers -- the good, the bad, and the ugly (0:42:00). A shooting in Georgia raises questions about race and justice in America (1:24:30). A stellar day on the phone lines featuring crying Blind Mike, Blind Mike's MeeMaw, the owner of Mama Geary's Fuck Shack, and Blind Mike's Dad.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
