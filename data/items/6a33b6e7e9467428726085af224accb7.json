  "description": "Hey HB's! This week Erin is telling Melody all about Tikka Chance On Me by Suleikha Snyder. It's a delicious novella about a motorcycle club enforcer (or so we think!) and the dutiful daughter working at her parent's Indian restaurant. After months of eyeboning, they learn that the only thing this Chris Evans lookalike might love more than samosas is the Heroine. \n Bonus Content: \n Sing Movie takeover, the Lunar Eclypse in Alaska, Doggy Genetics, how we'd handle a cease and desist order (with champagne!), and the fact that we can't handle it when Romancelandia is angry. \n Lady Loves: \n Erin - Schitt's Creek. Come for the Canadian sitcom, but stay for the best portrayal of a gay romance that she's seen in a while. \n Melody - the band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes! If you love dancing like a fool to punk covers of great songs, these cats are for you! They're happiness in your speakers. \n Patreon Shout Out: \n This is a gifted shout out from Susan. Sarah R., you are descended from Maui, the great demigod if Polynesia. Maui was a trickster, a creator, and a survivor. Like Maui, you are beloved for your selfless sense of caring and protection. Maui pulled the Hawaiian islands from the bottom of the ocean and defeated Tuna The Long Eel; similarly, you will bend over backwards to make miracles happen for those you love. And the trickster isn’t quite out of your system. Your red hot sense of humor keeps everyone in belly laughs, and in check, when you’re in their orbit. Maui was dedicated to making the world a better place for all humans and that lives on in you. Your commitment to serving our country, your family, your rescue animals, and your tireless, sometimes biting positivity make him proud. And on a very personal and immediate level: Lady, you’ve got an entire cult, an entire coven behind you. Your light cannot be diminished.\nMentioned in this episode:\nPreorder Naima Simone X Friends Book Boyfriend Box!!\nThis box has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a book boyfriend from Tessa Bailey, Avery Flynn, Farrah Rochon, Jayci Lee, Kennedy Ryan, Adriana Herrera, and Naima Simone.\nYou can look forward to paperbacks, signed book plates, limited edition book boyfriend mugs, the book boyfriend pajamas/loungewear, bookmarks and more!\nTiers include:\n- Cinnamon Roll - $114.99\n- The Alpha - - $169.99 \nEnter the promo code BONKERS10 at checkout to receive $10 off!!! \nONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT 10, 2022!\nIf you have any questions, email orders@honeymagnolia.co.\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/nsbookboyfriends (Naima's Book Boyfriends)",
