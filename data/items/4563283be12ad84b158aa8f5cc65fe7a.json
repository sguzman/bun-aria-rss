  "description": "<p>Malvika Iyer had both her hands blown off by a grenade when she was thirteen years-old. The blast also turned her legs into a mangled mass of blood and bone. Alex Lewis lost both legs, both arms, and part of his face to a savage and rare infection. And both of them swear their lives are now better than they were before.</p>\n<p>What would you do if something that tragic happened to you? Would you give up? Would you want to die? How big would the problems and concerns you had before suddenly seem?
