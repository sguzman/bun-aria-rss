  "description": "<p>In this episode of The Model Health Show we're getting into the bare basics of health and feeling good. Too many people today are up on their soapbox talking about advanced theories on changing your body. But how does someone actually get started?!</p> <p>I think that when we start living a life of true health and wellness, we lose touch with what it feels like to be sick, tired, and not knowing where to turn. One of the greatest opportunities we have as we get healthier is to step up and take people with us... but we have to start from where people are NOT where we are.</p> <p>This episode is for people who want to live a healthy lifestyle and need some honest guidance to get started. You can literally be at McDonald's listening to this on your iPhone right now. This is for you, and I want you to know that somebody's got your back!</p> <p>And don't worry, all of the amazing people out there that are more advanced, I promise that you'll get some huge nuggets (sheesh, I guess it's the McDonald's that made me think of nuggets) from this episode that will help elevate you to the next level.
