And how Hip Hop has evolved from creating beats out of old drum samples—known as breakbeats—to sampling and referencing itself.</p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear old and new interviews, often with bonus content:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord\">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/</a></p><p>You can find the playlist for this episode <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5VytosW2GsD0Uv6L5vjLqK?si=7venvRQGSEKdrmQIoxJ2Kw\">HERE — enjoy!</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
