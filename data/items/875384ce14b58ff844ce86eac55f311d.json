  "title": "Ep 162 | How Elites Will Create a New Class of Slaves | Whitney Webb | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Journalist Whitney Webb has worked to uncover some of the most dangerous stories of our lifetime, and she joins Glenn to reveal just how eye-opening it’s been. Her new two-volume book, “One Nation Under Blackmail: The Sordid Union Between Intelligence and Crime that Gave Rise to Jeffrey Epstein,” examines Epstein’s elaborate network of corruption and power, from Bill Clinton to Ghislaine Maxwell and many more. Her research into transhumanism has given her a terrifying perspective on the World Economic Forum and tech elites, including Elon Musk. And she tells Glenn the dark truth about Biden’s push for electric vehicles that she noticed while living in Chile.\n\nSPONSORS:\n\nWhen you buy Grip6 socks, you’re supporting American ranchers and American manufacturers.
