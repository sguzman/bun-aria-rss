  "title": "Weekly Wrap: Violence Against Latinos, Angry Online Men, Victoria's Secret's Future",
  "description": "Americans continue to wrap their heads around last week's mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. Our panel examines two big threads behind them: the history of violence against Latinos in the U.S. and websites where men often share violent views and hateful rhetoric. Plus, Victoria's Secret announced the hire of its first transgender model this week, but does the company still have the cultural cache to carry itself through an ongoing business downturn? Guest host Julia Furlan is joined by Tanzina Vega, host of WNYC's 'The Takeaway,' and BuzzFeed News senior reporter Ryan Broderick.",
