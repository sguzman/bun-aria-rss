  "title": "167 - The Son of Sam: Serial Killer David Berkowitz",
  "description": "<p>David Berkowitz. The Son of Sam. One of America's most infamous serial killers. The man who terrorized the already terrible New York City in the mid-1970s. Berkowitz would kill six, injure nine others, and terrify millions. Why did he do it? Because demonic dogs told him to? Because he was mad that his birth mother abandoned him? Because of his romantic failures with women? It's a fascinating true crime tale, and we examine it thoroughly today, on Timesuck. Happy Thanksgiving and Hail Nimrod!</p>\n<p>Check out Lynze and I's new horror podcast <strong>Scared to Death.</strong> Listen on Spotify, Stitcher, iTunes, Youtube, and more!
