  "description": "<p>NFL Week 7. Fastest 2 minutes (2:27 - 8:48). Recapping every game. Seahawks play another insane game. The Falcons invent a new way to lose a game. Baker was on fire. The Steelers hold off on the Titans and we disagree on who the Titans are. Cowboys continue to be laughably bad but Mike McCarthy is now relatable. Cam Newton looked off and the Bucs officially are a problem (8:48 - 101:28). World Series talk (101:28 - 107:11). Deion Sanders joins the show to talk NFL Week 7 (107:11 - 120:50). Who's back of the week and football guy of the week.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
