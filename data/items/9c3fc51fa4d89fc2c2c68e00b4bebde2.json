I'm re-publishing a chat I had back in October 2014 with my friend Dr. Alice Bandy, which was the final episode of my first podcast Radio Enso. At the time of this taping, I had just met Alice about a month before, but she's since become a good friend and teacher to me. I'm re-publishing our chat now because Alice was recently diagnosed with stage four breast cancer. The cancer has spread to her bones and she's had a series of radiation treatments and surgeries to keep the cancer from moving to other parts of her body. She is also receiving very strong hormone and chemo therapies that are built for her specific type of cancer. </span></em> <div><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style= \"font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';\"><span class= \"Apple-style-span\"><br /> All of this has incapacitated her and she is working to regain her ability to walk. She requires round-the-clock care, the cost of which is very high. Alice’s income is derived from working with students, clients and organizations, which she is unable to do at this time.
