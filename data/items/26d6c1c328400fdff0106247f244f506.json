  "description": "In today's podcast we hear predictions that terabit-per-second DDoS attacks may be on their way toward becoming the new normal. We consider the real threat that lies in the IoT.

Dr. Charles Clancy from Virgnia Tech's Hume Center explains software defined networking. Netsparker's Ferruh Mavituna shares advice on securing content delivery networks. InfoArmor looks into the Yahoo! breach and finds more crooks than spies. But the crooks may be fencing data to the spies.",
