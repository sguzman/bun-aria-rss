  "description": "<p>It's time to get inspired and entertained all at the same time today as we sit down with two-time Canadian runner Malindi Elmore to learn more about her extraordinary career! We find out what brought her into the sport of running and why she pursued distance running over the shorter distances. We also learn more about her unique experiences at the Athens Olympics and just what she had to go through post-Athens as she attempted to return to the Olympics in both Beijing and London. Added to this we find out more about how a simple suggestion from her husband helped her return to the Olympics in a completely different discipline 17 years later and just what lies ahead for a tilt at a third Olympics in Paris in three years time. It's another extraordinary chat that you will get much out of, so listen and don't miss out!</p>",
