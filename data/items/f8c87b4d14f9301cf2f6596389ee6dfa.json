  "description": "A New York Times reporter is pushing HARD for banks to monitor and restrict gun sales, and the media is walking lockstep toward MORE government tracking. Bill O’Reilly has the ratings for CNN’s climate change town hall, and ironically, it was outperformed by the hurricane. Also on the cutting block are Biden’s health, global warming’s bias against people of color, Trump’s Sharpie skills, and the odd 911 call from Kevin Hart’s car crash. Dave Rubin calls in to discuss joining the BlazeTV family, his personal evolution, and the importance of God in society. And the Impossible Whopper is finally given a taste test by the meat connoisseurs themselves. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
