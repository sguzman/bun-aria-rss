  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down Cocktails. We start this episode off by discussing your questions about David Wallace's house, the hilarity of Jan and Michael going public, and Jenna shares some fun memories from her journal. Then, we get another great fan catch about The Office's loose mentions of Casual Fridays, we chat about the \"Don't call me Pammy\" moment, and we get some fun Poor Richard's trivia. Finally, grab a snack for your cocktail because we discuss what kind of food we like to bring to a party, and we try to figure out what the weird thing is in the background of Michael's talking head.
