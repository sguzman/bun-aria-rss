  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, the Department of Justice’s Inspector general sent a criminal referral regarding Andrew McCabe to the U.S. attorney office. This means that James Comey will now be a witness if charges are brought because McCabe has said that he leaked and Comey knew about it. Also, the DOJ’s internal watchdog put out a report on leaks from the Clinton email investigation. Comey’s friend is hinting that this report could be damning for Loretta Lynch. So, McCabe is a liar and was caught; his defense in part is that Comey made me do it. Comey says Lynch made me do it. Meanwhile we have a special councel investigating President Trump, not Comey, McCabe or Lynch. So far this inspector general is getting more information about who did what than Robert Mueller is because Mueller has no interest in Lynch, Comey, McCabe, Hillary or the DNC. Later, the long-held official policy of the Department of Justice is that a sitting president of the United States cannot be indicted, according to official DOJ memoranda. So, if a sitting president can’t be indicted how can he be a target of an investigation? Finally, Rep Ron DeSantis calls in to discuss attacks ads against him during his run for Governor.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
