  "description": "<p>Maybe you’ve seen this week’s guest, Arian Moayed, playing the role of Stewy on <a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/succession\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HBO’s Succession</a>. Or in the breakaway hit, <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81008305\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Inventing Anna</a>, as Anna Sorokin’s lawyer, Todd Spodek. Or, Agent Cleary in last year’s megahit, <a href=\"https://www.sonypictures.com/movies/spidermannowayhome\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spider-Man: No Way Home</a>. And, you’d think, “wow, he’s everywhere, how lucky is he!” And, you’d be half-right. Arian is everywhere these days. But, luck? Not a chance. There is something much bigger at play. With a stunning work ethic, fueled by genuine passion. </p><br><p>Arian's family fled Iran under threat of violence when he was a child, taking a years-long journey that split the family between different countries, and eventually landed them just outside Chicago, where they set about building a new life in a radically different world. Acting became a fast passion, a way to express his feelings, his passion, and experiences and, in short order upon becoming an adult, his career. So, while honing his craft and acclaim as an actor, he also began devoting more and more energy to writing, producing, and teaching. Co-founding the theater/film production and arts education venture, <a href=\"https://www.waterwell.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Waterwell</a>, his heart is most boldly on display in guiding the growth of teachers and 6-12th graders in New York City’s free theater training program, and exploring not just performance, but citizenship, service, equality, advocacy, justice, and what it means to be human.
