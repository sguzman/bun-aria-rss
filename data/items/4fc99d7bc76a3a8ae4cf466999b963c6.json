  "description": "<p>Feeling overworked?! Between trying to get ahead at your 9-5 and pursuing side hustles, chances are really high that you feel like your work-life balance is out of whack. That doesn’t even take into account that more of us are working from home. We find ourselves chronically fatigued and exhausted because we give too much to our work, leaving little left for ourselves and those around us who we love. For instance, as a result most Americans don’t take all their vacation time- and when they do, they find it impossible to actually stop working! This ongoing cycle of never-ending work is leading more folks than ever to despise the work they once loved while other important areas in their lives like relationships, health, and hobbies continue to suffer. This is an important topic for us to cover as we seek to implement some practices to restore that work-life balance and then create boundaries to maintain that balance.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an I Learned It by Watching You by Burial Beer Co and Other Half Brewing - a big thanks to our friends Waffles on Wednesday for donating this collaboration beer to the show.
