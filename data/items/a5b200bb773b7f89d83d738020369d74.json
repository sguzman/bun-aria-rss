Mini-stories are quick hit stories that were maybe pitched to us from someone in the audience, or something interesting we saw on twitter, or just a cool tidbit that we found in our research that stuck in our heads, but didn’t warrant a full episode for whatever reason. We’ll have stories of mysterious ice boats, green ruins, sack dresses, steampunk violins, and a little update from a couple of the notable city flags that have been redesigned around the country.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=23020&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">Mini-Stories: Volume 3</a></p>\n",
