They are taking part in &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; joint drills, which Austin called <em>&ldquo;one of the largest exercises &hellip; in recent history,&rdquo;</em> involving over 240 aircraft.</p>\n<p><strong></strong>Lee made it clear that Seoul&rsquo;s policy on de-nuclearization had not changed, and therefore his government was currently not requesting the US to redeploy its tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565844-north-korea-icbm-launch/\"></a></p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.11/thumbnail/63634c4185f54005914ce3f9.jpg\" alt=\"A TV showing a news report about North Korea&#039;s missile launch is seen at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, November 3, 2022.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565844-north-korea-icbm-launch/\">North Korea fired intercontinental ballistic missile – Seoul</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    \n\n<p>North Korea <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565810-north-korea-more-missiles/\">fired</a> around 100 artillery shells and six more missiles into the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan on Wednesday, and tested an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Thursday morning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong></strong>Pyongyang has criticized Seoul and Washington for extending the &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; air drills, calling it an <em>&ldquo;awful mistake.&rdquo;</em> DPRK has repeatedly condemned the exercise as a rehearsal for an invasion of North Korea. The annual joint exercise had been put on hold in 2018, when North Korea and the US opened peace talks, but resumed on Monday.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong></strong>Speaking on Thursday, Austin insisted the US alliance with South Korea was <em>&ldquo;ironclad&rdquo;</em> and that Washington was <em>&ldquo;fully committed&rdquo;</em> to defending Seoul &ndash; and other allies in the <em>&ldquo;Indo-Pacific&rdquo;</em> &ndash; with <em>&ldquo;the full range of our nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities.&rdquo;</em></p>",
