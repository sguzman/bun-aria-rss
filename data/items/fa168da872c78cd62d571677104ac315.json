  "description": "The Heard Opera House is located in Arcadia, Florida. This building has served a variety of purposes through the years from bank to theater to retail business. Artifacts, antiques and collectibles have come through. The history is murky for this spot, but something has caused there to be a lot of spiritual residue here. Is it all the years of ghost hunts that have been hosted here drawing spirits from other places? We joined a group paranormal investigation at this historic site and we are going to share the results of that on this episode! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Chelsea Flowers and features Mithridates VI immunity to poison and This Month in History features Marian Anderson singing at the Lincoln Memorial.
