As HPC platforms are being deployed in the cloud for shared services, high-performance computing is becoming much more accessible, and its use is benefiting organizations of all sizes. Increasing investment in the industrial internet of things (IIoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and electronic design automation (EDA) and silicon IP for engineering development are a few factors that are driving increased use of high-performance computing systems. In general, increasingly complex models for big data processing, simulation, and forecasting are driving a need for more compute power and greater storage capacity & performance.</p> <p>This white paper highlights how different storage technologies can maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of HPC systems while providing high capacity and low latency storage, and minimizing network bandwidth and power consumption.</p>",
