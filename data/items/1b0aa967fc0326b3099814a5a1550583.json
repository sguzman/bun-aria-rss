Steve is ridin' high baby!!! \"Boy....shut up!\" - Steve Harvey The Chief Love Officer has a reality check for a \"tricker\" and it is profound!

Be careful! We here at The Steve Harvey Morning Show ask The Steve Harvey Nation to keep DMX in your prayers for a full recovery. Congratulations Baylor University. Saturday really spelled 4321 and the crew speculate on why it is significant. There is more testimony covering the video of George Floyd and the crew have some things to say about the latest going on with this trial. Today in Closing Remarks, Steve talks about what God is looking for in us.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
