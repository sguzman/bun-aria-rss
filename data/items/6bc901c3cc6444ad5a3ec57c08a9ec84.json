The process extracts data from a variety of sources and formats, transforms it into a standard structure, and loads it into a database, file, web service, or other system for analysis, visualization, machine learning, etc.</p>\n<p>ETL tools come in a wide variety of shapes.  Some run on your desktop or on-premise servers, while others run as SaaS in the cloud.  Some are code-based, built on standard programming languages that many developers already know.  Others are built on a custom DSL (domain specific language) in an attempt to be more intentional and require less code.  Others still are completely graphical, only offering programming interfaces for complex transformations.</p>\n<p>What follows is a list of ETL tools for developers already familiar with Java and the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to clean, validate, filter, and prepare your data for use.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1564\"></span></p>\n<h2><b>1.

It&#8217;s an ETL framework you plug into your software to load, processing, and migrate data on the JVM.</p>\n<p>It uses a single API, modeled after the Java I/O classes, to handle data in a variety of formats and structures. It&#8217;s single-piece-flow approach to data allows it to handle huge amounts of data with a minimum overhead while still being able to scale using multi-threading. This approach also allows it to process both batch and streaming data through the same pipelines.</p>\n<p>Data Pipeline comes in a range of versions including a free Express edition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>2.

Apache Spark</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2251 size-full\" src=\"https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/apache-spark.png\" width=\"1569\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/apache-spark.png 1569w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/apache-spark-300x108.png 300w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/apache-spark-768x276.png 768w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/apache-spark-1024x367.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1569px) 100vw, 1569px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Spark</a> provides stream as well as batch processing.</p>\n<p>This library acts as a fault tolerant framework that can process real time data at high throughputs. Data is dealt in streams and can be read from a wide variety of sources including Kafka, Twitter and Zeromq. In addition, custom streaming sources can also be defined for wider data coverage.</p>\n<p>The Spark engine processes data by dividing it into a series of successive batches, with each batch corresponding to a different processing stage. This processing makes use of several different algorithms including MapReduce, movable window, machine learning and graph processing. The end results can be presented in a series of visualizations involving graphics and dashboards.</p>\n<p>Spark programs can be written in Java, Scala and Python. This provides you with a range of convenience for integration with existing software frameworks. Due its flexibility, robustness, scalability and easy adoption, Spark is being used by a number of industry giants such as Uber, Pinterest and Netflix.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>17.
