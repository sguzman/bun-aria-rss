  "description": "In her new book, Being-Time: A Practitioner’s Guide to Dogen’s Shobogenzo Uji (Wisdom Publications, 2018), Shinshu Roberts focuses on the practical study of the inner self and perception of all phenomena through the famously complex work of Dogen Zenji, “Uji” (or being-time). In doing so, she illuminates aspects of how we perceive the present reality before us with great nuance, kindness, and articulation.\n\nTo tackle such a document with the elegance and understanding that Shinshu Roberts puts forth is an achievement in itself. Her approach leads one to a more subtle understanding of one of the great texts on self discovery and understanding. Shinshu Roberts gives us a wise and wonderfully patient guide to one of Dogen’s most important and enigmatic texts. Approaching complex topics with sincerity and ease, she shows just how much care and work went into crafting the subtle wisdom found in Dogen’s words.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
