    "media:description": "Today's video is about my favorite microscope ever. I did a lot of work in gradschool on this STEM, or Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope, and today I get to share how it works! Extra thanks to the Materials Department at UCSB for letting me film in the lab!\n\nAdmittedly it's old footage, but since it's REAL research, I was waiting for the paper to get published. If anybody's super-curious, here's the doi:\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.cgd.2c00188\n(unfortunately it's not indexed on SciHub yet - I'm trying to figure out how to get the manuscript posted elsewhere for you guys - check back in a couple days if you're curious!)\n\nMusic and graphics:\n\nI Dunno by grapes is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\nhttp://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626\n\nMap of Kikuchi line pairs down to 1/1Å for 300 keV electrons in hexagonal sapphire (Al2O3), with some intersections labeled\nP.
