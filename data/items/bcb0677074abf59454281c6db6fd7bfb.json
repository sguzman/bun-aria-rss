  "description": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Y’all know, I live my life like an open book.</p> <p>Every week, I shamelessly share the up’s and down’s of my weightloss journey and all about my relationships with my friends, family, and No BS Women.</p> <p>Today, I want to share more vulnerably about my feelings toward my drinking.</p> <p>Like many women, there was a time I used several glasses of wine to take the edge off of an exhausting day.</p> <p>Over the last two years, I’ve worked hard to understand and even redefine my relationship to alcohol.</p> <p>I didn't decide to quit drinking cold turkey. Instead, I used the same mindset for handling my food urges to reduce my drinking by 75%.</p> <p>I listened to other No BS women talk about the similarities in food and drinking urges, just like in my own experience. My response was to have a special overdrinking course created in my private membership to support their needs.</p> <p>In today’s podcast, I’m talking to Angela Mascenik, who happens to be one of our No BS women and a life coach and podcaster committed to helping women stop overdrinking.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Topics discussed in this episode:</strong></p> <p><strong>Topic 1:</strong> What overdrinking actually is, and why so many of us are using it, like food urges, to deal with our emotional baggage.
