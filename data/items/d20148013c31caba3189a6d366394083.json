  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiffany, 52, would like to lose about 5 kilos. For many years, she’s worried about what to eat, and believes that if she could only learn to “think like a thin person,” she could stop focusing so much on food. And that would in turn help her to lose weight. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiffany also holds a variety of other beliefs around food and body, such as what her ideal weight should be, that weight loss should be effortless, that she should never overeat, and many more. And she’s not alone: all of us hold beliefs about our health, bodies, and our patterns with food.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as Marc David teaches, many of the beliefs we hold end up getting in the way of achieving the goals we hold so dear.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s the thing: it’s natural to focus on food when we’re trying to lose weight. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, what so many people don’t realize is that nutritional changes alone don’t automatically lead to weight loss. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that’s because weight challenges arise from the level of our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. In order to create lasting change, we have to do more than tinker with our nutrition – and instead dive into the key mindset issues that hold us back. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So be sure to tune into this fascinating episode, where we take a closer look at the psychology of weight loss, as well as the key nutritional, metabolic, and mind body factors that are influenced by our thoughts and beliefs about food. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">---------------</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about us at The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:</span> <a href= \"https://psychologyofeating.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://psychologyofeating.com/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same. 👉Tune into The Ultimate Health Coach webinar here:</span> <a href= \"https://psychologyofeating.com/become-a-coach-h/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://psychologyofeating.com/become-a-coach-h/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow us on social: </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- YouTube:</span> <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/c/Psychologyofeating\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.youtube.com/c/Psychologyofeating</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- Facebook:</span> <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- Instagram:</span> <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- Pinterest:</span> <a href= \"https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#psychologyofweightloss #weight #bodyimage #eatingpsychology #limitingbeliefs #mindset #selfcontrol #sustainableweightloss #selflove #bodypositivity #bodyconfidence #foodfreedom #marcdavid #psychologyofeating</span></p>",
