We’ll walk through the architecture of how the Data API is built and discuss how it can fit into your development process, including covering more advanced features like Authentication, Permissions, Schema and extending your development with custom HTTPS Endpoints.\n\nSpeaker: Drew DiPalma, Director, Product Management",
