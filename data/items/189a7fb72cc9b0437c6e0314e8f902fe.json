  "title": "Eva Chen and Tom Bannister on Granola and Passion Projects",
  "description": "<p>Eva Chen is one of the most multi-hyphenated folks in New York City. The head of fashion partnerships at Instagram, she’s also a mom of three, former editor in chief and beauty editor, social media influencer, and New York Times bestselling children’s book author. The last thing she expected to be is a granola muse, but that’s her latest role thanks to her husband Tom Bannister’s passion project, Tom’s Perfect 10 Original Granola. Tom, the creative director at the Billion Dollar Boy agency during the day, transformed his fondness for granola into an actual business during the pandemic and now it’s a buzzy brand, thanks to a playful Instagram strategy, a two-way conversation with customers, and feedback from Eva. The college sweethearts join host Kerry Diamond to talk about granola as well as Eva’s latest book, <i>I Am Golden</i>, which she describes as a celebration of AAPI joy and her most personal book yet. </p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.americanunagi.com/\">American Unagi</a> and <a href=\"https://lukeslobster.com/\">Luke’s Lobster</a> for supporting today’s show.
