    "media:description": "For years, the Stanford Biomechatronics Laboratory has captured imaginations with their exoskeleton emulators – lab-based robotic devices that help wearers walk and run faster, with less effort. Now, these researchers will turn heads out in the “wild” with their first untethered exoskeleton.\n\nMB01JHOXLBAWBB0",
