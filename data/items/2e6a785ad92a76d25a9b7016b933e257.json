  "description": "<p>5 Rounds In The Magazine: \n\nROUND 1: If the National Guard tries to make eye contact with you avoid them at all costs… they are going big time BROKE & will probably try to ask you to borrow a $20\n\nROUND 2: Breaking Bad, but make those tighty whities camo instead… we’ve got an Air Force Walter White who got caught selling an AK47 and meth…. Not great!\n\nROUND 3: The story of ‘The 10,000 meter thriller’ and no we’re not talking about Buzz Aldrin’s penis. It’s the story of a young Devil Dog who became an unlikely champion in the ‘64 Olympics!\n\nROUND 4: Interpreters are in the news big time. Kate got to speak to two sides of those COIN operations. One from a local commander who served with Interpreters and from a congressman who is trying to right this wrong. \n\nINTERVIEW TIMESTAMPS:\n(37:37:21) - Rep. Mike Waltz\n(50:31:12) - Former Army Captain Sayre Payne\n\n\nROUND 5: (01:18:59:23) We speak with founder of Team RWB, LTC Mike Erwin, about how his former soldiers not allowing him to get soft sparked a movement in the veteran community. \n\nSAVED ROUNDS to close out the show!\n\nFind ZBT: https://linktr.ee/ZeroBlog30</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
