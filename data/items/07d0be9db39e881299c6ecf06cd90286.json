  "description": "<p>This fourteenth episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast is a special new edition of the show. It's the first of what we are calling a \"Breadcrumb.\" A Breadcrumb is a short, 8-15 minute episode that was cut off from a longer show, or that's a collage of little clips. We may occasionally also record short Breadcrumb episode to have a little more time for a proper \"You Tell Me\" segment, in which we get to reply substantively to listener feedback. This first Breadcrumb includes questions that Dr. Anthony Cashio really wanted to add after our interview with <a href= \"https://phil.washington.edu/people/jana-mohr-lone\" target= \"_blank\">Dr. Jana Mohr Lone</a>, especially about how one can get started teaching philosophy to children. </p> <p>Recall that Dr. Lone is the Director and founder of the University of Washington's <a title= \"University of Washington's Center for Philosophy for Children\" href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/nwcenter/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Philosophy for Children</a>. The Center brings philosophers and students trained in philosophy into K-12 public school classrooms to facilitate philosophy classes. She is also the author of <em><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2o7oloD\" target=\"_blank\">The Philosophical Child</a></em>, which explores ways that parents and other adults can stimulate philosophical conversations about children's questions, co-author of <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2p9OHau\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Philosophy in</em> <em>Education: Questioning and Dialogue in Schools</em></a>, and co-editor of <em>Philosophy and Education: Introducing Philosophy to Young People</em>, which examines various issues involved in teaching philosophy to young people.</p> <p>As always, you can reach out to us on Facebook <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/\" target= \"_blank\">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href= \"http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB\" target= \"_blank\">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at <a href= \"mailto:philosophybakesbread@gmail.com\" target= \"_blank\">philosophybakesbread@gmail.com</a>; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.
