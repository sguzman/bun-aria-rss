  "description": "<p>Today we have the pleasure of speaking with Meg Nordmann who is the author of “Have Yourself a Minimalist Christmas: Slow Down, Save Money, & Enjoy a More Intentional Holiday”. With the holidays quickly approaching, we can often find ourselves wondering where all of our time, <em>and</em> money is running off to- but Meg wants to change that with her approach to minimalism. Her book presents strategies to help us to resist the clever marketing and cultural expectations that this season often brings. We talk about Meg’s own history with consumption, the relatively new history of Santa, how she approaches gift giving with her children, convincing extended family to give fewer gifts, and how she creates a minimalist calendar around the holidays.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Empire of Eternal Nothingness by Burial!
