  "description": "It's Friday: Sam is chatting this week with NPR Morning Edition editor Ashley Brown (@hey_hashbrown) and NPR political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben (@titonka).  They're talking about the record number of women running ahead of the midterms and how that has Dems particularly excited for November, President Trump's denial about the death toll in  Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, and the police officer who shot and killed Botham Jean in his own home. To top it off, a chat about how we're all focused on Washington when our local politics is what counts.  Buy tickets to our next Los Angeles live show at kp.cc/IBAM.",
