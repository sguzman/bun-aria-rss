  "description": "Cybercriminals are motivated by one simple incentive - money. Their favorite tools are bots to leverage sophistication, scalability, and ease of use. The effect is the creation of the underground bot ecosystem. This community allows threat actors to work together and continually improve their tactics. They sell bypasses for rule-based anti-bot solutions to other less technical fraudsters.\nIn this episode of CyberWire-X, the CyberWire's CSO, Chief Analyst, and Senior Fellow, Rick Howard, is joined in the first half by Hash Table member Etay Maor. Cato Networks’ Senior Director Security Strategy. They discuss this reality that has put defenders at a serious disadvantage and the mitigation steps to consider for future attacks.. In the second half of the show, CyberWire podcast host Dave Bittner talks with our episode sponsor Kasada's founder Sam Crowther talking about what he saw first-hand as a red teamer at a major Australian bank and what inspired him to reimagine bot mitigation with the founding principle of undermining the attacker’s ROI.",
