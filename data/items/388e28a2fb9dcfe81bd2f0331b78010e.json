  "description": "<p>Easily our most exhaustive topic, assisting is the reality of our day-to-day in the salon. It's where Stew started and it's really where a hair stylist's journey begins. They are your right hand - they style, wash, dry, ready supplies we're going to use on a client - and their responsibilities grow as their talent and skillset increase. We're sharing what our assistants do, the behind-the-scenes of our very well-known assistant program, and everything you need to know about hiring or becoming an assistant. </p>",
