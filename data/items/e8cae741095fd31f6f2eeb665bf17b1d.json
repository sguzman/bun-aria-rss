Russia is expanding aggressively and will likely invade Ukraine again. Iran is months away from having a nuclear weapon and is prepared to go to war. President Biden is not prepared for the coming conflict. Then, former Ambassador and National Security Advisor Ric Grenell calls in to share how the Reagan Library's board has dramatically changed to eliminate Reaganites and Trump supporters. Grenell added that the rise of China has been steady as they infiltrated the power structure of many institutions. The U.S must refrain from doing business with the CCP. Later, the philosophy of Americanism embraces things that are proven to have worked for the betterment of society. This was the difference between Trump and the Democrats, it was peace and common sense versus uncertainty and a radical leftist ideology.
