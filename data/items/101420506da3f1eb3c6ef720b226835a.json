  "description": "<p>Searching for exotic multiquark states and elucidating their nature remains a\ncentral topic in understanding quantum chromo dynamics--the underlying theory\nof the strong interaction. Two of the most studied such states are the\ncharmed-strange states $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$. In this work, we\nshow for the first time that their production yields in inclusive $e^+e^-\\to\nc\\bar{c}$ productions near $\\sqrt{s}=10.6$ GeV measured by the BaBar\nCollaboration can be well explained in the molecular picture, which provide a\nhighly nontrivial verification of their nature being $DK/D^*K$ molecules. In\naddition, we predict the production yield of the $D\\bar{D}K$ three-body bound\nstate, $K_{c\\bar{c}}(4180)$, in $e^+e^-\\to c\\bar{c}$ collisions and find that\nit is within the reach of the ongoing Belle II experiment.\n</p>",
