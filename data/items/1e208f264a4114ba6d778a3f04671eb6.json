  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, Back in February 2018 Mark was furious that there was an absence of defense for Paul Manafort. When the conservative media was backing away from Manafort, Mark explained his admiration for him not buckling. It wasn’t about him being guilty or not, it was about what our government is turning into. Now there’s finally a judge who gets it in this case and suggested that Mueller lied about the scope of his investigation and that Mueller just wants to get President Trump. Also, almost a year ago Mark laid out the case that, according to Department of Justice policy, you can’t indict a sitting President. If a president can’t be indicted, what’s the purpose of Mueller’s investigation? To get to the bottom of what happened in election? No, not according to Mueller’s questions to Trump. Mueller’s appointment was illegitimate because there is no crime for him to investigate. Trump needs to use his constitutional powers and fight back against Mueller’s probe. Later, we’re now seeing the democrats plans to fight Trump if they win the House. They’re not interested in bipartisanship. Trump is up against radical leftists who don’t believe in shared government. Finally, Ainsley Earhardt calls in to discuss her new book, The Light Within Me.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
