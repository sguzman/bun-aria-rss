  "description": "<p>August 6, 2018 / At trial, the State would argue that in his first interview with investigators, Dennis Perry made statements indicating he knew more about the murders than an innocent person would know, and that in his last interview, he had basically confessed. But did Dennis Perry's allegedly incriminating statements show any special knowledge about the crime? And how can a statement in which a suspect denies any personal involvement or knowledge of a crime be a confession?</p>\n\n\n<p>Episode scoring music by Blue Dot Sessions, Patrick Cortes, and Chris Zabriskie.</p>\n\n\n<p>This episode was sponsored by Boll and Branch and Quicken Loans.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.BollandBranch.com\">www.BollandBranch.com</a> promo code UNDISCLOSED</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.RocketMortgage.com/Undisclosed\">www.RocketMortgage.com/Undisclosed</a> </p>\n\n\n<p>#undisclosed #dennisperry</p>\n",
