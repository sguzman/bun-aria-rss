  "description": "Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan is playing the role of the adult in the room while the Republican presidential candidates one-up each other with increasingly outrageous rhetoric. The new house speaker chided Donald Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the country, saying it's \"not what this party stands for.\" With Ryan potentially playing a leading role should the party wind up in a brokered convention next year, we went back into the archives to our chat with him, in which we discussed his views on crony capitalism, taxes and entitlements.
