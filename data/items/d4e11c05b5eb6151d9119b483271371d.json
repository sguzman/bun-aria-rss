  "description": "<p>We revisit the local well-posedness theory of nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger and\nwave equations in Sobolev spaces $H^s$ and $\\dot{H}^s$, $0&lt; s\\leq 1$. The\ntheory has been well established over the past few decades under Sobolev\ninitial data regular with respect to all spatial variables. But here, we reveal\nthat the initial data do not need to have complete regularity like Sobolev\nspaces, but only partially regularity with respect to some variables is\nsufficient. To develop such a new theory, we suggest a refined Strichartz\nestimate which has a different norm for each spatial variable. This makes it\npossible to extract a different integrability/regularity of the data from each\nvariable.\n</p>",
