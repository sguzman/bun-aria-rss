  "description": "<p>WHAT TURNS YOUR CRANK? We often define ourselves by what job we do. I’m an accountant. I’m a teacher. I work in finance. But maybe we’re thinking about our careers in the wrong parameters. Instead of finding a job, we should be trying to find a way to feel excited and fulfilled every day. If you wake up with dread, you feel like you’re in a suit that’s too small, or you’re uninspired, you’re probably not in the right place. So how do we figure out what we’re meant to do? It’s not easy. But it’s worth trying to figure out. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Suzy Welch where she shares how to find your “Area of Destiny.” Suzy Welch is a business journalist, TV commentator, and public speaker. A popular Today Show and CNBC contributor, Suzy is the author of the New York Times bestseller 10-10-10: A Life Transforming Idea, a guide to values-driven decision making. With her husband, Jack Welch, Suzy founded the Jack Welch Management Institute, ranked as one of the top online MBA programs in the world by Princeton Review and CEO Magazine.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nAbout the sermon that gave Suzy the idea of the “Area of Destiny” (2:30)<br />\nThe two types of “Super Highways” (3:30)<br />\nHow to find what you’re uniquely good at (4:00)</p>\n",
