  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease Podcast we’re back in the Open Country of Southeast Arizona. This is part 2 in our series on life of a living legend – Warner Glenn. We’ll learn more about Kelly, Warner’s daughter, and her life in movies and modeling. We’ll dive deep into dry-ground lion hunting, which I believe will aid in us getting our PHD’s as American woodsmen. We'll learn about his dogs and what characteristics it takes to make a good mountain lion hunting hound. We’ll also learn about when Mr. Warner almost went to prison and how it impacted his life including his involvement in the founding a very influential conservation group called the Malpai Borderlands Group. You won't want to miss this one.</p><p><br></p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p><p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p><p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p><p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/products/bear-grease-hat\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
