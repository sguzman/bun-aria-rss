  "title": "PMS 2.0 385 - The Return Of Dan Orlovsky, Justin Simmons, Tom Pelissero, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about last night's Elite 8 games and look ahead to the Final Four and wonder if anyone has a chance to beat Gonzaga, plus they follow all the storylines from Florida's Pro Day, and what we learned yesterday about Mac Jones and Justin Fields. Joining the show for a first time in a long time is 12 year NFL veteran at QB, ESPN NFL Analyst, and friend of the program, Dan Orlovsky. Pat and Dan catch up a little bit and chat about the ban, plus Dan makes some waves with what he's heard from certain coaches about Justin Fields, and why he thinks Mac Jones is probably going to end up in San Francisco (24:27-50:08). Next, Pro Bowler, All-Pro, the highest paid safety in the NFL, Justin Simmons joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about what he thinks Denver needs to do to get over the hump, his thoughts on Drew Lock, how he prepares for games, doing incredible things in the community, and if he was close to playing Quarterback during the season for the Broncos when their QB's were out with Covid (50:10-1:11:36). Later, NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero joins the program to chat about the league meetings, the 17 game season, what he's hearing from all the different Pro Days, and why he thinks Justin Fields draft stock dropped after the season ended (1:13:54-1:31:24). To close out the show, Pat and AJ also react to all the different things being said about Justin Fields, Mac Jones, and how some players adjust to live in the NFL being a job and not a game (1:31:26-1:52:38).
