  "description": "Episode 572 - Being successful is so much easier than it used to be because most people don't even follow through anymore. They say they are going to do something and they don't. They say they are going to show up at a certain time and they are 15 minutes late. It's sad. So if you want to set yourself apart, all you need to do it follow through consistently and don't give up. If you do that, you will set yourself apart from 95% of people who are out there. That alone puts you in the top 5%. From there everything else gets easy.<p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
