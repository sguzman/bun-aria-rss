  "description": "This week was a slam-bang episode of “Louder With Crowder.”  Firstly, the one and only Dean Cain stops by to discuss his Michael Moore comments. Not only did he double-down, but he backed them up in style, as only superman himself could! He also gave some insight on “American Sniper” Chris Kyle.   Not only that, but Imam Anjem Choudary stopped by. For REAL. Not a joke.  He told us how he plans to bring Shariah to Britain, America and his support for the current regimes in Iraq and Syria.  Also, veiled threats on my life.  Do not miss this episode and remember, you can always SUBSCRIBE ON ITUNES to take “Louder With Crowder” on the go. It’s all free!",
