  "description": "Jalen & Jacoby bask in the glory of Kyrie Irving's career high 60 points against the Magic. He was a bucket, and we need to talk about what it means. And it reminded us -- EXACTLY 20 years ago, Jalen Rose had his career high 44 vs the Rockets. There's a lot of other great stuff in the show - Deshaun Watson, Baker Mayfield's sad letter to Cleveland, Myles Turner's legos - but really the best part of the show is Jalen narrating highlights of Jalen. Also he hit a game winner that didn't count, so we get into that, too. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
