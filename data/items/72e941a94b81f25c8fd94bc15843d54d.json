A long-time friend and mentor as much as a coach, I have been under Chris’ tutelage since 2008, during which time he deftly guided me&nbsp;through three <a href=\"http://ultramanlive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ultraman World Championships</a> (’08, ’09 & ’11),&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.epic5.com/\" target=\"_blank\">EPIC5</a> in 2010 and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://otilloswimrun.com/races/otillo/\" target=\"_blank\">Ötillö Swimrun World Championships</a> in 2017, an event we raced together as a team.</p><p>I could have never achieved the level of athletic success I have enjoyed without Chris’ deft counsel,&nbsp;so it is with pleasure that I share more of his wisdom&nbsp;with you today.</p><p>Today's discussion centers around maintaining fitness engagement during the cold winter months, when the halo effect of your New Year's resolutions have faded and inspiration tends to wane. We cover a wide variety of topics, including:</p><br><p>* setting proper goals;</p><p>* creating enthusiasm for your yearly resolutions;</p><p>* maintaining connection with your fitness when motivation fails;</p><p>* how self-care can provide clarity, reflection and intention;</p><p>* why this is the season for functional strength work; and</p><p>* the importance of connecting with self and nature through physical activity</p><br><p>2019 is now. Who you want to be come summer begins today. So let's get after it.</p><p>I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.
