  "description": "Tonight's guest is Bart Sibrel who's here to discuss his book Moon Man: Moon Man: The True Story of a Filmmaker on the CIA Hit List. Get it on Amazon.\nMoon Man is Bart Sibrel’s revealing memoir recalling his harrowing journey investigating what really happened during America’s famous “Apollo” missions. It features truly hair-raising and life-threatening encounters with agents from the US government’s secret agencies. Sibrel’s memoir divulges, for the very first time, his real-life espionage adventures while uncovering one of the CIA’s greatest secrets, including Sibrel’s discovery of privately recorded audio of an Apollo astronaut plotting his assassination by the CIA, which would not be necessary if the Apollo missions were real.\nMoon Man also exposes, for the very first time, the official CIA Code-Name for the real Apollo project, the military base where the first fake Moon landing was filmed, as well as the names of fifteen US government scientists and officials who were recorded in attendance for the first Moon landing falsification, some of whom are still alive today. This highly revealing information was provided to Sibrel by the Chief of Security of this secretive military base, who finally confessed his regrettable participation in this despicable government fraud on his deathbed.\nBart Sibrel is an award-winning filmmaker, writer, and investigative journalist, who has produced television programs and documentaries for over 35 years. He has been employed by two of the three major US networks, worked as a television news reporter, and has produced segments for ABC, NBC, and CBS. Sibrel regularly speaks as a guest commentator regarding the Moon landing fraud, and has appeared as such on NBC, FOX, CNN, and HBO to discuss his films A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon and Astronauts Gone Wild.\nBart Sibrel grew up as a devout supporter of the supposed Moon landings, yet over the years, gradually began to recognize their unfortunate falsification. In Sibrel’s mind, the claim that astronauts walked on the moon on the very first attempt with antiquated untried 1960s technology, when today with five decades of more advanced technology the US can only send astronauts one-thousandth the distance to the Moon, simply defies logic. Sibrel is convinced that until the Moon landing fraud is exposed, the governments of the world will continue deceiving the people under their care until their eventual demise.\n\nKim our producer has a new book out! \nPre-order Kim's new book 'Say This, Not That: When Someone You Know Is Grieving on Amazon\nFollow Kim's Page on Facebook\n\n\nBECOME A PLUS PASS MEMBER TO ACCESS ARCHIVED EPISODES AND MORE!\n\nAPPLE IPHONE USERS: LISTEN AD-FREE BY BECOMING A PLUS PASS MEMBER ON APPLE PODCASTS\n\nANDROID USERS: LISTEN AD-FREE BY BECOMING A PASS MEMBER AND LISTEN FROM MOST PODCAST APPS\n\nPLUS PASS MEMBER BENEFITS:\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO MYSTERIOUS RADIO PLUS:\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO PARANORMAL FEARS!\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO SEVEN!\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO OVER 150 HOURS OF ARCHIVED EPISODES!\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO CONTROVERSIAL EPISODES!\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO BONUS EPISODES FOR MEMBERS ONLY!\n\nRequest To Join Our Private Community \n\nVisit our home on the web: https://www.mysteriousradio.com\n\nFollow us on Instagram @mysteriousradio\nFollow us on TikTok mysteriousradioTikTok\nFollow us on Twitter @mysteriousradio\nFollow us on Pinterest pinterest.com/mysteriousradio\nLike us on Facebook Facebook.com/mysteriousradio\n\nWant All Paranormal Episodes?
