  "description": "My most current guest is Mark R. Anderson, author of The Battle for the Fourteenth Colony: America’s War of Liberation in Canada, 1774-1776 (University Press of New England, 2014). Anderson’s award-winning book presents the most detailed and nuanced study of the entire Quebec campaign in print today.Long an under-represented campaign in the general historiography of the American Revolution, the 1775 Canada expedition is brought to life in Anderson’s treatment, as he presents the story from multiple perspectives, including the American expeditionary force, the British Loyalists, and the Canadien inhabitants of the Quebec parishes.Anderson’s book addresses a major oversight in the historiography of the Revolution, and in the process, is a highly detailed political and military narrative that is destined to be the standard work in the field for years to come.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
