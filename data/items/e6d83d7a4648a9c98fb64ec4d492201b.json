  "description": "We have lots of opinions about the trends we think should go, which is very polarizing, so don’t be offended if you have something we don’t like and love it. You do you, but we definitely have some opinions to share. This kind of got sparked in our idea bank when we were looking at an article called “Ten Designers Share What Trends Need to Disappear Forever.” Naturally this caught our eye, and we were curious to see if we agree or disagree. These are some of the greats that we look up to and have all heard of, so we’ll let you know who the designer was, what they thought, and then what our own thoughts are on each item or topic. <br /><br />Ashley Hicks and feature walls 2:58<br />Drew McGukin on macrame 4:59<br />Fern Santini and suites of furniture 9:38<br />Charles de Lisle’s opinion on waterfall countertops 13:32 <br />Caleb Anderson - Barn doors and accent walls 18:22<br />Natalie Kraiem - Edison light bulbs 20:53<br />Young Huh - Neon signs for art 22:10<br />White walls 23:59<br /><br />“If you are in the price point of a granite and you’re looking for it, there are interesting granites. Don’t get the one that looks like mystery meat. Don’t get the pebbly one because that one is just cacophonous for the eye, but there are ones that just have still some interesting, larger scale veining and we’ve seen some of these pop up, and we’re like ‘What is that?’ and they’re like ‘It’s a granite,’ and we’re like ‘Oh my gosh! Thank the heavens that there’s more than just the one mystery brown.’” 16:14<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
