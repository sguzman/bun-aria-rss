  "description": "William Shatner is heading to space! Daniel and I open today’s show with some banter about our favorite Shatner roles... and whether we’d go to space for a thrill. [0:40] Earnings season is officially underway... And now is a great time to sift through company reports for the best ideas… We discuss what stood out to us about Delta Airlines’ quarterly results... and why this company has a fantastic long-term outlook. [4:10] On JPMorgan’s earnings call, CEO Jamie Dimon said he doesn’t think supply chains will be a talking point by next year. While I disagree with this, Daniel believes a recent sign is pointing to the bottom of supply chain woes. [8:50] On BlackRock’s earnings call, CEO Larry Fink pointed out the obvious—that inflation isn’t transitory… and energy prices will continue rising for the foreseeable future. Daniel and I discuss the factors behind rising costs... and why you need to prepare for higher prices across the board. [15:55] And finally, the U.S. is now the leader in bitcoin mining. Daniel explains why this is a great teachable moment about innovation… and yet another example of how cryptos are maturing into a dominant asset class. [27:20] Enjoyed this episode?
