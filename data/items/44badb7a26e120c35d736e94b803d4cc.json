  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about last night's Thursday Night Football game between the Bucs and the Eagles, the Same Game Parlay getting absolutely shafted by Tom Brady kneel downs at the end of the game, if we can trust betting on the Bucs, and if there is much process for Nick Sirianni and the Eagles. Next, Pat and AJ Hawk go through the entire week 6 NFL slate and make their picks against the spread. Later, NFL legend, NFL QB for 14 years, the Cass Dogg, Matt Cassel, joins the show.
