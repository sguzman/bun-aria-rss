  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, Mr call screener and WABC host Rich Valdes fills in for Mark. We’re under attack by Iran, Russia, and China, but the overall attack is by an ideology that rejects God. People are kneeling at the altar of big government but liberty is making a comeback. We absolutely have to take this election fight all the way and go as far as we have to go. That’s what we do in any fight, whether it’s a boxing match or an election. Also, President Trump deserves tremendous credit for standing up for Americans once again by calling for an end to waster and more money for Americans in the COVID Relief Bill. Trump stuck up for small businesses, who are getting hit hard. Later, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and Charles Kushner have all been pardoned by President Trump. The only crimes they were guilty of were being part of Trump world.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
