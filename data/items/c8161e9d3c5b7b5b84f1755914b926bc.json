  "description": "<div>Sam's guest in this week's Book Club podcast is Kevin Birmingham, whose new book <em>The Sinner and The Saint: Dostoevsky, A Crime and its Punishment</em>, tells the extraordinary story of how Dostoevsky came to write Crime and Punishment – and the under-explored story of the real-life murderer whose case inspired it. Physical agony, Siberian exile, vicious state censorship, old-school nihilists – and the astonishing personal resilience of one of Russia's greatest writers... it's all here.</div>\n",
