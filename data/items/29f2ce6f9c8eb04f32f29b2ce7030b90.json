  "description": "<p>Some of the audio is a bit shit on this one fellas. My apologies. I'll get it fixed!</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>This weeks review is all comedy with Tom Papa 1333, Fahim Anwar 1334 and Jim Gaffigan 1335. It's great when Joe has these heavily stacked Comedian weeks as we here think they are the most interesting people to listen to.. Tom is happy with his bread as always.. Fahim say goodbye to Boeing and Jim releases his new special to Amazon for some major cash!!</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Follow me on Instagram at <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview\">www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview</a></p>\n <p>Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw?</a></p>\n <p>Please email me <a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">here</a> with any suggestions and questions for future shows..</p>\n",
