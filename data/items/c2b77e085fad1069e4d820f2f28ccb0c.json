  "description": "<p>r/AmITheA**hole In today's episode, OP finds a lost dog and decides to take it in. To OP's credit, he takes the dog to the vet to check for a chip, but the vet doesn't find one. So, he decides to keep the dog as his own! After he posts pictures of the dog online, the original owner quickly discovers the dog and asks for it to be returned to her. OP refuses, arguing that he's had the dog for a year and that he's come to emotionally rely on the dog. So, OP wants to know if he's the butthole for keeping the dog and refusing to give it back.
