  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew turn straight to the phones and start with a caller who wants to talk about the BYU Duke volleyball scandal where it was alleged that BYU fans were shouting racial slurs at Duke players. They also speak to a caller who has concerns surrounding a proposed law that would require reporting of people with mental illness potentially being limited in practices like buying a gun or other things and how that may lead to people avoiding treatment. Drew also brings up Adam's recent Adam Carolla Show interview of Sid Krofft and how pleasantly surprised Drew was with how it went. They also touch on Puff, The Magic Dragon before heading back to the phones to speak to a caller with a question about echocardiograms & affirmative action.\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nLiquidIV.com use code ADS\nRoman.com/ADS",
