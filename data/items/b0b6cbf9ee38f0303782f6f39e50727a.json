  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the people, plants and animals once living on land now under the North Sea, now called Doggerland after Dogger Bank, inhabited up to c7000BC or roughly 3000 years before the beginnings of Stonehenge.  There are traces of this landscape at low tide, such as the tree stumps at Redcar (above); yet more is being learned from diving and seismic surveys which are building a picture of an ideal environment for humans to hunt and gather, with rivers and wooded hills.  Rising seas submerged this land as glaciers melted, and the people and animals who lived there moved to higher ground, with the coasts of modern-day Britain on one side and Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium and France on the other.\n\nWith \n\nVince Gaffney\nAnniversary Professor of Landscape Archaeology at the University of Bradford\n\nCarol Cotterill\nMarine Geoscientist at the British Geological Survey\n\nAnd\n\nRachel Bynoe\nLecturer in Archaeology at the University of Southampton\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
