  "description": "<p>There is probably no other industry that passes off pseudo-science as science more than the fitness industry. More often than not this is done to build authority and to earn a profit. Of course, most fitness enthusiasts are hungry for results and are NOT scientists so they have to take the “experts” word on it, even if they are being fed pure BS. It is Mind Pump’s mission to call out this BS and to expose the massive misinformation for profit mindset that seems to pervade the Fitness Establishment. Please subscribe, rate and review this show!
