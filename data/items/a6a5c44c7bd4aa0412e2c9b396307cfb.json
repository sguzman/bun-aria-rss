  "description": "<p>Job loss, addiction, a break up, the death of a loved one, illness… these are the kinds of struggles that have the potential to break us wide open. Oprah says that before you ask the question <em>Why me, Why me</em>? Realize that nothing is happening out of order.  Your life is always speaking to you. When that wake-up call comes, understand that it’s your life trying to push you in another direction… onto the next leg of your journey. Don’t resist. Instead let the truth break you open. No experience is ever wasted. In this episode of Super Soul, Oprah sits down with acclaimed spiritual teachers: Elizabeth Lesser, Gabrielle Bernstein, Father Richard Rohr, Ali McGraw, Sarah Ban Breathnach, Caroline Myss, Lewellyn Vaughn Lee, Reverend Michael Beckwith, Elizabeth Gilbert, Glennon Doyle, Michael Singer, Iyanla Vanzant, Dr. Shefali Tsabary, Pema Chödrön, Cheryl Strayed, Deepak Chopra and Adyashanti to reveal the true meaning of what it means to be <em>broken open </em>and what to do when those life-challenges arise. Interviews with these talented writers, speakers and thought leaders are excerpted from Oprah’s Emmy Award-winning show <em>Super Soul Sunday. </em>You can also find this compilation and other insightful conversations, in Oprah’s best-selling book <em>The Wisdom of Sundays.</em></p>\n",
