It doesn’t matter that things never go your way. It doesn’t matter that every time you try to step up you get overlooked. The only thing that matters is that you’re willing to be honest with yourself about where you are and that you’re ready to turn your life around and take total ownership of your life. Every success and every failure is 100% yours if you get unstuck and become unstoppable.<br /><br />Tom Bilyeu went from being broken, scared, and insecure to becoming confident enough to develop his leadership skills and earn massive respect.
