  "description": "The Shoemaker. January 8th, 1975. Leonia, New Jersey. A man and his young son posed as salesmen to gain entrance to a New Jersey home. They attacked the people inside. One of them, a woman who lived nearby, was taken to the basement and her throat was slit. This was the last in a series of attacks by a man who believed that he was instructed to do these things. The ultimate goal; the deaths of three billion people. With all killers a question seems to come up. Was it nature or nurture? In Joseph Kallinger's case, the answer seems to be nurture. His abusive and isolated upbringing by Stephen and Anna Kallinger may have triggered paranoid schizophrenia in a young boy who would go on to have dark fantasies that involved women and knives. \n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
