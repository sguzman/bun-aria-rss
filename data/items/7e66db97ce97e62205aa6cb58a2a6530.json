  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that Facebook has kicked some Russian trolls out from under its bridge. Why? Because they're Russian trolls, that's why. Facebook CEO Zuckerberg will testify about data security before a House panel next Wednesday. Privacy for the Old World, but maybe not as much for the new. The YouTube shooting may have been motivated by anger over the platform's policies. European air traffic control problems were a glitch, not a hack. Pipeline operators recovering from IT hack. Homeland Security tells the US Senate hostile intelligence services have stingrays in Washington. Panera Bread's response to its potential data exposure. Rick Howard from Palo Alto Networks on whether security platforms are putting all of your eggs in one basket. Guest is Jim Routh, CSO at Aetna, on Model-driven security and the rise of unconventional controls.",
