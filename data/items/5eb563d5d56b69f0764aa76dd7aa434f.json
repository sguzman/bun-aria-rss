  "description": "<p>In Episode 180 we called for a REVOLUTION to spread Raw Fitness Truth around the world. This episode is more of a wake-up call. The reality is there are a lot of fitness icons with a tremendous amount of social influence who continue to promote absolute garbage fitness and nutrition advice. Because they look a certain way the masses blindly drink it up. This has to stop but we are currently no match for this collective of fitness frauds. However, with enough Pump Heads spreading the TRUTH we can reach a tipping point and win the truth hungry masses to our cause. Please subscribe, rate and review this show!
