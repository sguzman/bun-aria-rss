  "description": "Adam and Mark open the show discussing a case that Mark was just on the radio discussing where his client ended up dead after multiple calls to LAPD for assistance. The conversation then turns to the recent ruling from SCOTUS in the case of the Washington based High School football coach who was let go over his decision to pray at the end of games. They also review a recent interview between Kamala Harris and CNN anchor Dana Bash and marvel at Harris's inability to appear as articulate as they know she is. They also discuss some questionable testimony from the January 6th Committee before wrapping up the show discussing Ghislaine Maxwell's sentencing to 240 months in prison and John Eastman having his phone confiscated by federal agents.\n\nWatch this episode & subscribe on YouTube at YouTube.com/AdamCarolla\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nPlayBackbone.com/Doubt\noffers.americanhartfordgold.com/reasonabledoubt/\nMudWtr.com/doubt\nGeico.com",
