  "title": "284 - After Doubt - with A.J. Swoboda",
  "description": "Today, we sit down with author and professor of Bible and Theology, A.J. Swoboda, to discuss his new book, ‘After Doubt.’ We have a great conversation on deconstruction: the natural elements of it; and what’s helpful vs. what isn’t. How can we rebuild after tearing down the faith that was handed to us? What role do dead authors and past theologians play in the lineage of our faith and doubt? What does the Bible have to say about questioning? Is there room for anger and hate?\n\nYou can pre-order A.J.’s book at: https://www.ajswobodawrites.com/\nFollow A.J. on twitter: @mrajswoboda\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
