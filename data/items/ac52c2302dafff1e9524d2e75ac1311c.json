You’ll hear us talk about: </p> <ul> <li dir=\"ltr\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Using joy as a throughline to integrate every part of your life—even if you’re on a slightly scary Uber ride. I’ll share how I turned an uncomfortable moment into an opportunity for joy. </p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Demystifying what it means to be a person of faith. As Reza said, “Living a spiritual life is an active choice—there’s nothing magical about it. Being a person of faith is a decision that you make.”  </p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The power of humility. I love what Rainn said about humbling ourselves to pray: “Prayer is an ability to say I need help. And there is a beautiful, bountiful, power coursing through this Universe that can help me along my journey—if I attune to it.”  </p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">How to approach therapy as a spiritual practice. (I LOVE what Rainn had to say about this!)   </p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Why service to others is integral to spiritual growth. “You can't just sit in your walled garden and become more spiritual staring at a tree or a crystal with some incense burning,” Rainn said. True spirituality  also means “Serving others, connecting with others, trying to make the world a better place,”</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div><span style=\"font-family: georgia, serif;\"> </span></div> <div> <div class=\"gmail_default\"><span style= \"font-family: georgia, serif;\"><strong>RESOURCES</strong></span></div> <div class=\"gmail_default\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">The following are helpful resources and books I mention in the episode. </p> <div class=\"gmail_default\"> </div> <div class=\"gmail_default\"> <div class=\"gmail_default\">ABOUT RAINN WILSON & REZA ASLAN: Rainn Wilson is an actor (you might know him as Dwight Schrute from The Office), a comedian, and the New York Times bestselling author of <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/The-Bassoon-King-Rainn-Wilson-audiobook/dp/B01477MZW2\"> The Bassoon King: My Life in Art, Faith, and Idiocy.</a> He’s also the founder of the YouTube Channel <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaDVcGDMkvcRb4qGARkWlyg\">SoulPancake</a>, and the cohost of the <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/metaphysical-milkshake-with-rainn-reza/id1566052074\"> Metaphysical Milkshake</a> podcast. </div> <br /> <p dir=\"ltr\">Reza Aslan is also a host of <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/metaphysical-milkshake-with-rainn-reza/id1566052074\"> Metaphysical Milkshake</a>!
