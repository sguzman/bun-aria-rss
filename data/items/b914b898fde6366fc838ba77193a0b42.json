  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the Aaron Rodgers situation and where things currently stand while they wait for the Insider's Insider, AJ Hawk to join the show and divulge more information, plus they get down to the meaning of May the Fourth be with you. Joining Pat and AJ is NFL Insider, co-host of Good Morning Football, NFL Insider for Fox and friend of the show, Peter Schrager to chat about what he's hearing from the other side of things with the Aaron Rodgers situation, why he doesn't think Rodgers leaked the news to Schefter, what he thinks will ultimately happen, and if there was ever a chance he was going to be dealt on draft night (28:34-43:14). Pat and AJ also chat about swimming in the waters of the insider game, if he has any more thoughts on the Rodgers situation, and much much more. Later, US Congressman and friend of the program, Anthony Gonzalez joins Pat and AJ to give an update on the status of sports gambling in Ohio, and how the show might have been a driving contributor in getting a bill to be processed (1:31:27-1:41:05).
