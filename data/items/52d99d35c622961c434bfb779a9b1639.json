  "description": "<p><p>NFL Week 12 Fastest 2 Minutes. (2:35-9:44) Recapping every game from Sunday.(9:45-1:44:08) Jameis is the most entertaining QB in the league, Dan Quinn is back on his bullshit. Frank Gore for the Hall of Fame and he reminds us how great Barry Sanders was. Mitch played average and that's great. Browns are hot thanks to Swagger Jr and we say something nice about the Dolphins. The Raiders very bad day, an honest discussion about Carson Wentz. The Titans make no sense and understanding Dak Prescott. Who's back of the week including Thanksgiving, (1:44:09-1:57:28) Football Guy of the Week, (1:57:29-2:01:30) and a quick Elon Musk roast. (2:01:31-2:04:16)</p><p> </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
