Born into slavery in North Carolina, he became a sergeant of an all-Black brigade when the Civil War broke out. <em>Black Cloud Rising</em> is a fictionalized version of these events; Etheridge goes back down to North Carolina to free enslaved people and fight guerillas. Falade told NPR's Scott Simon that it was really important for him to try to get to know the human behind the extraordinary acts.",
