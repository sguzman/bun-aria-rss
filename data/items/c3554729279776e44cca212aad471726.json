  "description": "<script src=\"https://www.datascienceblog.net/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js\"></script>\n\n\n<p>I was recently alerted because my Bioconductor package <a href=\"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/openPrimeR.html\">openPrimeR</a> was failing the automated package tests.\nThe reason for this is that the Bioconductor team has decided to set a new environment variable when testing the packages."
