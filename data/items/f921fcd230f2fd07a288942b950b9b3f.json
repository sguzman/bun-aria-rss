He has miraculously healed himself from chronic kidney, liver, and lung diseases, pulmonary hypertension, hepatitis C, and severe injuries from a near fatal auto accident in 2010! Now, FULLY RECOVERED FROM ALL, and in excellent health, he actively serves the holistic health community. For the past twenty years, he has helped to facilitate the healing of more than a 1000 others from around the world.<br>\n<br>\nWayne has also garnered international acclaim by conducting healing sessions, classes, and workshops in Great Britain, Italy, and Japan, as well as in most major cities across the United States.
