  "description": "<p>I will be speaking to Nick who was driving in Montana, and he and his wife saw one of these creatures on the side of the road. Nick will go into the full encounter and what he saw. </p> <p>Also I will be having return guest Derrill from <a href= \"https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep293-throwing-rocks/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SC EP:293 Throwing Rocks</a> on the show. He will be giving us an update on the picture taken (shown <a href= \"https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep343-sasquatch-encounters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a>). Derrill writes \"My stepdaughter took this pic of red eyes staring in at her while at her aunts house. She told me that she woke up around 2am and saw two red eyes staring in at her. She heard no sounds but she did say that it blinked at her several times before it went away. I went over there to ck out the house and the bedroom window is over 6.5 feet in the side of the house. So what was ever looking in was at least 7' tall! This window is about 20' away from small creek that has lots of tree cover. I will include pics of the window, the bank, and the tree cover. This is in York county near York city in PA. What do you think? Bigfoot, or dogman? With the glowing red eyes I go for the latter. This house is at the end of a street and there are no streetlights, so at 2am it's really, really dark outside. Let me know what you think\"</p> <p>I will be also welcoming back to the show Brenda Harris. Brenda investigates encounters around the reservation in New Mexico and will be sharing with us some updates and encounters. The photos Brenda and I discuss can be found on the episode page of our website <a href= \"https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep343-sasquatch-encounters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a>.</p>",
