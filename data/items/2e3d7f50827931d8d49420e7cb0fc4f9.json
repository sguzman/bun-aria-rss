That success means walking a fine line: Annie wants to celebrate Wikipedia's oddities and encourage her followers to edit pages, but not to intentionally contribute false info or \"bad writing for the sake of humor.\"\n\"Sometimes I'll post something and then it'll start getting vandalized a bunch,\" she says. \"Like when I posted the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mammals_displaying_homosexual_behavior (List of Mammals Displaying Homosexual Behavior) — don't do this, by the way — people started editing it to add in their name.
