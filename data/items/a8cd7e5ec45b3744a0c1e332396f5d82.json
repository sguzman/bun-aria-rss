Do visit them for further inspiration!\n\nwww.poetrylibrary.org.uk\n\nMartin is in conversation with The Poetry Exchange team members, Alastair Snell and Sarah Salway.\n\n'The Lake Isle of Innisfree' is read by Alastair Snell.\n\n*****\n\nI will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,\nAnd a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:\nNine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee;\nAnd live alone in the bee-loud glade.\n\nAnd I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,\nDropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;\nThere midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,\nAnd evening full of the linnet’s wings.\n\nI will arise and go now, for always night and day\nI hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;\nWhile I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,\nI hear it in the deep heart’s core.",
