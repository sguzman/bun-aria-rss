  "description": "A police officer in Los Angeles told women he'd let their cars pass inspection if they had sex with him. In the San Francisco, Bay Area, another woman says an officer used police resources to harass and stalk her. The California Highway Patrol quietly fired both men for sexual harassment, but never looked into whether their misconduct was criminal. The second episode of the NPR series <em>On Our Watch</em> examines the system of accountability for officers who abuse their power for sex and exposes where that system falls short.",
