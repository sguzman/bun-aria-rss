  "description": "Buster Olney remembers the life and tragic passing of Roberto Clemente on New Year’s Eve of 1972 with three distinct voices. First, Buster talks to former Pirates pitcher Steve Blass about meeting Clemente as an 18-year-old minor leaguer, when he heard the news of the plane crash, spring training of 1973 feeling like an extension of the memorial, what Clemente was like in the clubhouse and why no one could take their eyes off of him. Then David Maraniss, author of Clemente: The Passion and Grace of Baseball's Last Hero, stops by to talk about his live broadcast relaying the news of Clemente’s death, why he decided to write a Clemente biography, the awe Clemente inspired in fellow players and Manny Sanguillén searching for Clemente’s body. Finally, longtime MLB player and coach Joey Cora discusses learning of Clemente’s death at the age of seven, Clemente putting Puerto Rico on the map, how Clemente paved the way for all Puerto Rican players in MLB and his favorite Clemente highlight.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
