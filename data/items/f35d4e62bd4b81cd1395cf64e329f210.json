An honest look at history shows that white people certainly don’t carry unique guilt for the sin of slavery. Today we’ll take that honest look. Also Five Headlines including a vicious assault on an elderly woman by a man who has been arrested up to 100 times already in the past. And in our Daily Cancellation, I’ll be canceling the public apology. \n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
