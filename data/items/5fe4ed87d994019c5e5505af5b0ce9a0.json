  "description": "<p>The one and only Fred Armisen (Portlandia, Saturday Night Live) stopped by the podcast this week to discuss his first concert experience: Seeing DEVO at Radio City Music Hall on October 31st, 1981, right down the street from where Fear were destroying the SNL set at 30 Rock. In this largely music-themed episode, we also discuss Fred's love of all things goth, playing drums alongside his heroes like The Clash and his personal connection with Halloween that goes back to childhood. Equal parts hilarious, educational and sentimental, this truly is an episode for the ages—and for those who want a quick and easy way to get rid of their garbage!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
