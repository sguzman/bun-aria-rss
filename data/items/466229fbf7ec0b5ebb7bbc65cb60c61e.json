But this is how you've chosen to spend your day. This week, Connor and Dan revisit the philosophy Simone de Beauvoir—a philosopher and writer they haven't discussed in years—to see how well her most famous text, A Second Sex, holds up all these years later. Also discussed, Dan's celebrity sighting, the boys' advice on not getting dates in high school, and the return of Star Wars corner.</strong></p>",
