    "media:description": "The CLWT-067-PCIe™, is a unique closed loop wind tunnel for thermal characterization of components, boards and heat sinks. The unit is made of Aluminum, sheet metal and LEXAN™ and produces flows up to 1400 ft/min (7 m/s) and temperature up to 85°C. The CLWT-067-PCIe™ uses the proven technology of the CLWT-067 and adds a new m test section specially designed for the thermal testing and characterization of either full or half-height standard PCIe cards\n\nLearn more here - https://www.qats.com/Products/Wind-Tunnels/Closed-Loop-Wind-Tunnels/CLWT-067-PCIe\n\nhttps://www.qats.com&#13;\nAdvanced Thermal Solutions, Inc.&#13;\nA leading-edge engineering and manufacturing company focused on the thermal management of electronics.&#13;\n&#13;\nService, Products and Training&#13;\n• Cooling Solutions – From Chip to System&#13;\n• Mechanical Packaging and Design&#13;\n• Design Services&#13;\n• Air and Liquid Cooling Solutions&#13;\n• Rapid Prototyping&#13;\n• Custom Heat Sink Design&#13;\n• Research Grade Thermal Instruments&#13;\n• Engineering Training&#13;\n• State-of-the-art Experimental Laboratories&#13;\n• Qpedia Thermal eMagazine",
