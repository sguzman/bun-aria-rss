Unlikely. But if for some reason this exciting filmmaker has eclipsed your radar, you can read my in depth thoughts on his extraordinary life and listen to our prior conversations <a href=\"http://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-73-casey-neistat-on-making-it-count-and-how-to-do-more/\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a> (RRP #73) and <a href=\"http://www.richroll.com/podcast/casey-neistat-2/\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a> (RRP #144).</p><p>If you're well on board the Casey train, you’ve witnessed quite an evolution in his recent trajectory. Since Casey began&nbsp;daily vlogging —&nbsp;posting a new movie on his YouTube Channel every single day since March 27, 2015 — his already incredibly popular YouTube Channel has exploded, growing from around 500,000 subscribers to well over 1.1 million in less than five months. On average, each vlog amasses around 500,000 views. This one tops out at 1.5 million (which incidentally has absolutely nothing to do with what occurs at the 4-minute mark):</p><br><p>A major network television show would kill for these numbers. But Casey has no interest in such matters. He's not making videos to capture the interest of the system&nbsp;he consciously placed in his rear view. For&nbsp;Casey, YouTube&nbsp;is the finish line — a&nbsp;juggernaut channel he built all by himself. DIY on the most democratic video platform in the world. And that is far more powerful and compelling than anything HBO, NBC, Disney or any other traditional mainstream outlet could ever offer him. Ever.</p><p>If you’re not yet hip to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat\" target=\"_blank\">his channel,</a> get on it. A unique voice delivered with expert&nbsp;filmmaking acuity, each and every movie hooks you emotionally and never fails to captivate. His movies are so popular in fact, crowds of people congregate daily outside his downtown New York City studio, pining for a mere glimpse of the populist artist.</p><p>And&nbsp;now thanks to the new social media video sharing platform he co-founded called <a href=\"https://appsto.re/us/Z6C67.i\" target=\"_blank\">Beme,</a> Casey can add technology entrepreneur to his expanding resume.</p><br><p>Intended to change how we view and use social media, Beme allows users to post successive 4-second video snippets&nbsp;without the opportunity to preview, review or even view the clips before they publish.
