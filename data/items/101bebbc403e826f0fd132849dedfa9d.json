That means we've read and talked about 100 books, which isn't a lot in the grand scheme of things but it sure feels like a lot for our little podcast.</p><p>For our last milestone episode, we read EL James'&nbsp;Fifty Shades of Grey. Now that we've done another 50 shows (and since the major motion picture is in theaters now), we've gone back to the sexy, sexy well to read&nbsp;Fifty Shades Darker.</p><p>Our frustrations with the original book are joined by some new complaints, and just like last time you can find some nearly-compelling threads amid the wreckage if you try hard enough. We also talk a little about the actual BDSM community, and how poorly Christian Grey would fit in among real-life practitioners. One of our listeners provided us with some links, which we've included below for added reading. </p><p>Added reading:</p><p>\"Feminists can be kinky too\" from&nbsp;Femmeuary:&nbsp;https://femmeuary.wordpress.com/2014/02/03/feminists-can-be-kinky-too/</p><p>\"The two mantras of BDSM\" from&nbsp;The Kink&nbsp;Factory:&nbsp;http://thekinkyfactory.com/bdsm-for-beginners/ssc-rack/</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
