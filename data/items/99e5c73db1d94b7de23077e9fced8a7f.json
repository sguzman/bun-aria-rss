  "description": "<p>Meditation: Cultivating a Mindful Awareness (2016-11-02) - Mindfulness means paying attention on purpose to our moment to moment experience. This meditation invites us to collect our attention with the breath and use the breath as a home base for mindful presence. We then include whatever is predominant, recognizing and allowing the changing flow. The blessing of this practice is simple and beautiful: We are learning to be here for our life.<br /> <br /></p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely.
