  "description": "<p>This week, in Dingess, West Virginia, the brutality is striking, when a woman's body is found, murdered, several times over, in a shallow grave, covered with twigs, but it's obvious that this was just the last stop, on a horrific ride. After rumors begin to swirl around this small town, the perpetrators of this heinous attack are brought to light, but their fingers are pointing in so many different directions, that it's hard to know who is telling the truth. One thing is for sure, and that's multiple people need to pay the price for what happened! Plus, an extra bonus short murder story, also from the backwoods of West Virginia, that is just as crazy as the main story!</p><p> </p><p>Along the way, we find out that just because the town is named after you, doesn't mean you aren't trash, that some people have the capacity to inflict absolute horrors upon others, and that we have the best audience in podcasting!!
