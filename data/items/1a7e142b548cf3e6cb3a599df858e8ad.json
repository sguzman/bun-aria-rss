  "description": "<p>This is a simple explanation of the bitcoin halving event that occurred in May of 2020.<br/><br/><br/><b>=== VIDEO SUMMARY ===</b><br/><br/>In this video we will be talking about the bitcoin halving, or \"halvening,\" event that took place in May 2020.<br/><br/>We go over what halving is, why halving takes place, and what implications halving has for the future of bitcoin.<br/><br/>The bitcoin blockchain is basically a live, running record of all the bitcoin transactions.<br/><br/>Once a certain amount of transaction data has been collected, a block is formed and added to the ledger.<br/><br/>The basic structure of the bitcoin blockchain consists of a network of computers around the world with bitcoin software installed on them.<br/><br/>The verification and posting of transactions on the blockchain is completed by miners via a process called mining.<br/><br/>The basic concept you need to know about bitcoin mining to better understand the bitcoin halving event, is that miners are rewarded with bitcoin each time they verify a new block of transactions.<br/><br/>These rewards are in place to incentivize miners to participate in the mining process to ensure the bitcoin network continues to be audited and essentially maintained.<br/><br/>Halving, in terms of bitcoin, refers to the reduction in bitcoin block rewards issued to miners by half.<br/><br/>When the halving occurred in May 2020, the block reward halved, or reduced by half, which gives miners 6.25 BTC of newly minted bitcoin per validated block.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>=== LINKS TO ACCESS SITES SAFELY ===</b></p><p>♦ Recommended Hardware Wallet:</p><p>Ledger Nano X Backup Pack Link - https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/befe</p><p>♦ BC Vault Crypto Hardware Wallet Link - https://bc-vault.com/shop/bc-vault/?wpam_id=22</p><p>♦ Coinbase - Receive $10 of FREE BITCOIN when you use this link to sign up for Coinbase and invest $100: https://www.coinbase.com/join/57605a33b9140001c900020b</p><p>♦ Kraken Exchange Link: https://r.kraken.com/r5XmG</p><p>♦ KuCoin Exchange Link - https://www.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup?rcode=2Q2fbRg</p><p>♦ Binance Signup Link: https://www.binance.com/?ref=11055137</p><p>♦ Bittrex Signup Link: https://bittrex.com/Account/Register?referralCode=M0U-UDK-WU5</p><p>♦ Coinmama Signup Link - https://go.coinmama.com/visit/?bta=51862&nci=5343</p><p>♦ BitBuy Canadian Exchange Link - https://bitbuy.ca/sign-up?c=X66OWECQP<br/><br/><br/><b>=== SOCIAL MEDIA LINKS ===</b><br/><br/>● Facebook Page - <a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcryptocasey%2F&redir_token=L7WF2_MizDjEhG939Lc7cq3_yZ58MTU5MzUyODM4OEAxNTkzNDQxOTg4&v=0mZ22iBFAOA'>https://www.facebook.com/cryptocasey/</a><br/><br/>● Twitter: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fcryptocasey&redir_token=L7WF2_MizDjEhG939Lc7cq3_yZ58MTU5MzUyODM4OEAxNTkzNDQxOTg4&v=0mZ22iBFAOA'>https://twitter.com/cryptocasey</a><br/><br/>● Instagram: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fcryptocasey%2F&redir_token=L7WF2_MizDjEhG939Lc7cq3_yZ58MTU5MzUyODM4OEAxNTkzNDQxOTg4&v=0mZ22iBFAOA'>https://www.instagram.com/cryptocasey/</a><br/><br/>● Telegram: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&q=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Fcryptocasey%2F&redir_token=L7WF2_MizDjEhG939Lc7cq3_yZ58MTU5MzUyODM4OEAxNTkzNDQxOTg4&v=0mZ22iBFAOA'>https://t.me/cryptocasey/</a><br/><br/>● Business Contact - Casey@CryptoCasey.com<br/><br/>● Website - <a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&q=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptocasey.com%2F&redir_token=L7WF2_MizDjEhG939Lc7cq3_yZ58MTU5MzUyODM4OEAxNTkzNDQxOTg4&v=0mZ22iBFAOA'>https://cryptocasey.com/</a><br/><br/><br/><b>=== DONATIONS ===</b><br/><br/>♥ BTC - 12XfdCJqEuRRzMrcD1YaE5kHeSShdkcW3G<br/><br/>♥ ETH - 0xf94c719621E358890Dd33dD010a1fb4717EbdaE4<\n\n--- \n\nSupport this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/cryptocasey/support\" rel=\"payment\">https://anchor.fm/cryptocasey/support</a>",
