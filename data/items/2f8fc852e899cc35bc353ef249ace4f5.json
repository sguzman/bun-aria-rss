  "description": "In this special live episode recorded at the 2012 Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism, Massimo and Julia discuss the \"simulation argument\" -- the case that it's roughly 20% likely that we live in a computer simulation -- and the surprising implications that argument has for religion. Their guest is philosopher David Kyle Johnson, who is professor of philosophy at King's College and author of the blog \"Plato on Pop\" for Psychology Today, and who hosts his own podcast at philosophyandpopculture.com. Elaborating on an article he recently published in the journal Philo, Johnson lays out the simulation argument and his own insight into how it might solve the age-old Problem of Evil (i.e., \"How is it possible that an all-powerful, all-knowing, and good God could allow evil to occur in the world?\"). As usual, Massimo and Julia have plenty of questions and comments!",
