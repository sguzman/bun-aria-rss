    "media:description": "In our new show, 3 Ideas, an expert will share three suggestions about where to put your money right now. \n\nThis is not advice but rather a launching point for you to do your own due diligence and to make decisions that suit your risk tolerance and your objectives. \n\nWe begin with precious metals investor Lawrence Lepard, the founder and managing partner of gold-and-silver-focused Equity Management Associates. In the inaugural episode of 3 Ideas, Larry goes deep on three mining stocks at the top of his current watch list – and, because he thinks it’s important to be diversified within the space, he names a bunch more potential outperformers too. Recorded on September 22, 2022. \n\nDisclosure: Larry Lepard and his firm own all of the stocks discussed in this interview. His fund holds a roughly 2% stake in Guanajuato Silver Co.\n\n👉 Do you want even more content like this? And to see this video before we release it here?
