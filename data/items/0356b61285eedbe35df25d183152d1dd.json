  "description": "<p>Fees are a major pain and they’ve worked their way into so many different industries! We recently talked about travel lodging and discussed the annoyance of the countless fees that might get tacked on: resort fees are some of the most confusing, but parking and WiFi fees abound too! With fees becoming so prevalent across our financial lives, we need to be aware of how and when we encounter them so we can be vigilant and intentional to avoid them whenever possible. While we understand and will readily admit that certain services and products have a cost, we really don’t like it when those fees are hidden until the last minute or when companies go about adding them in an underhanded way.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Bourbon Barrel Dark Apparition by Jackie O's Brewery- a big thanks to Art, Mackenzie, and all of our friends there at the brewery!
