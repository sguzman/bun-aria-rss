  "title": "148 - Robert \"The Butcher Baker\" Hansen",
  "description": "<p>Serial killer Robert Hansen abducted and killed at least seventeen women and hunted many of them down in the Alaskan wilderness in the 1970s and 80s around Anchorage. This bakery owner and sport hunter was convicted in 1984 after confessing to killing seventeen women, mostly dancers and prostitutes, during a twelve-year reign of terror. Hansen led a very strange dual life - a happily married, donut-making father of two, while at the same time frequenting Anchorage's strip joints looking for young women to kidnap, rape, and then sometimes also hunt and kill.
