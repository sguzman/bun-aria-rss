  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, this is the greatest hijacking of an election in American history. Joe Biden is an illegitimate President-Elect. Attorneys like Marc Elias, who once represented Democrat Hillary Clinton, took advantage of partisan Democrat activists in state judiciaries and various county election boards. Most Americans don't believe this election was genuine and Joe Biden and the media could care less about it. All while, spineless Republicans and Supreme Court Justices turn a blind eye and fail the country. Yet the media, and critics, continue spreading lies about a lack of evidence like the super spreaders they are. Then, Democrats in the executive branch of several contested states rushed to certify electors even before their state legislatures could even hold a single investigatory hearing. Michigan has certified their votes despite the legislature's request for an investigative hearing. Yet for Democrats, the bar is extremely low. A phone call, the emoluments clause, or any other sham they could come up with. However, they see blocking inspectors, double votes, and unconstitutionally changing state election laws as appropriate to prevent another 2016. Later, re-imagining is the new buzz word being pushed in Biden speeches because it’s a positive-sounding, innocuous-feeling term that's been used by Marxists in writings and classrooms for decades. Biden and Kamala Harris have served in the senate and are not new to this. They could have made changes in Washington if they wanted to, but they didn't. Now they want to reimagine? A reimagined America, or a cabinet that might look like America, might stink like Castro and think like Putin and acts like Xi once it's been reimagined. Afterward, Dr. Robert Epstein calls in with an update on data he collected on ephemeral experiences showing a very strong liberal bias for election-related searches. Epstein's group is investigating data from the current Georgia senate election. Finally, journalist Sharyl Attkisson joins the show to discuss her new book, Slanted: How the News Media Taught Us to Love Censorship and Hate Journalism.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
