  "description": "<p>In this paper, three major objectives were pursued. To construct a coaxial\npulsed plasma thruster operating with 10s to 100s of volts, to characterize the\ntemporal evolution of the discharge parameters in this low-voltage operation\nscenario, and to study and understand the parasitic erosion of the tungsten\ncathode due to conventional cathode spots that were found at low local\npressures when the first configurations of the coaxial PPT were tested. A\ncoaxial PPT was designed, built, and tested. This design confirmed pulsed\noperation at discharge voltages less than 100 V across the plasma, achieving\none of the project's aims. Using air as a propellant, the discharge generated a\npeak current of 10.4 kA at a mass flow rate of 2 mgs. The PPT cathode was\nimaged with an ICCD camera over a wide range of pressures, and the photos\nindicated \"spotless\" diffuse arc attachment to the cathode at higher local\npressures, and the appearance of conventional cathode spots at lower local\npressures. Two pressures were tested for lifetime erosion studies: a local\npressure of 4 Torr saw an erosion rate of 9.93 micrograms per Coulomb, and a\nlocal pressure of 3.5e-5 Torr saw an increase in erosion rate of 411 percent at\n40.785 micrograms per Coulomb.\n</p>",
