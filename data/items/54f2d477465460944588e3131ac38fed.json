Sometimes, I will ask for help and even then, I may choose not to take your advice. Launch the game yourself if you want to see it played your way or at least pay money to yell at me (」ﾟﾛﾟ)｣$$$\n\nReading chat is part of the fun and why I love streaming, if you refuse to follow the rules, then you won't be able to join in. o7\n\nhttps://twitter.com/watsonameliaEN\n#amelive #hololiveEnglish #holoMyth #ameliaRT\n\n＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝\n\n[Fan Work Guidelines]\nhttps://en.hololive.tv/terms\n\n＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝\n\n[Official Online Shop]\nhttps://hololive.booth.pm/\n\n[Holoschedule] (Check all members streaming schedules)\nhttps://schedule.hololive.tv/#hololive\n\n＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝\n\n[Hololive Production]\n・Hololive English YouTube Channel: https://t.co/LcYDgFF9V0?amp=1\n・Hololive Production Official Twitter: https://twitter.com/hololivetv\n・Hololive English Official Twitter: https://twitter.com/hololive_En\n・Hololive English Official Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/\n\n＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝\nBGM used\n- DOVA-SYNDROME\nURL: https://dova-s.jp\n\n#holoMyth \n#hololiveEnglish",
