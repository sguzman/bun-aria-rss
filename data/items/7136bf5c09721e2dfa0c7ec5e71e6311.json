  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, this program is tired of pontificators who haven't spent any time on the issue of Supreme Court nominations weighing in with their misinformation. To think that Democrats can do whatever they want because they control the White House is absurd. They can't just hand out judgeships! The judicial philosophy of any jurist on the high court should be known before a Justice is confirmed. For Ketanji Brown-Jackson to claim that she has no judicial philosophy means she's hiding it, but obviously the hard left has endorsed her because of her judicial philosophy. Then, parents in Florida now have protection against the sexualization of their kindergarten-3rd grade curriculum. The HB 1557 bill reinforces parents' rights and prevents teachers from imposing perverse and inappropriate sexual content on children as young as five years old in grades K-3. LGBTQIA+ activists have joined Disney and ESPN's pushback against the bill claiming that teaching small children about gay sex is a ‘human right.' Later, the Putin wing of the Republican and Democrat Parties and the media reject being called pro-Putin despite their support for Putin. These isolationists and pacifists label anyone against Putin's depravity as neo-con. The truth is that if Putin is not stopped this will impact and threaten America. Afterward, Former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani joins the show and explains that isolationism will only put the U.S in a position to be a secondary world power behind Russia which will inevitably partner with China to dominate globally. Giuliani also reiterated the importance of the Hunter Biden laptop and what exactly it proves.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
