  "description": "<p>Waardenburg Castle sits in the woods of Waardenburg Village in the Netherlands. The castle has survived for centuries, enduring wars including World War II, pillaging, passing through the hands of many families and severe demolition. The castle is both magnificent and creepy at the same time. The odd shape of the castle and its unique turrets add to the mystique. The long history of the castle includes some tragic and horrific events. Bodies have been found buried in the cellar, ghosts haunt the hallways and the legend of Dr. Faust has found a home here. Blood stains that cannot be removed are testament to the strange and creepy stories of this castle.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures are here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/06/hgb-podcast-ep-48-waardenburg-castle.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/06/hgb-podcast-ep-48-waardenburg-castle.html</a></p>",
