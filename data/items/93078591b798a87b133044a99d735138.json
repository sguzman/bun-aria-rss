  "description": "Today we’ve got indoor plant and tree expert Brock Saucier with Northland Design and Landscape Architecture. They do land planning, we use them a lot in our projects, and Brock is kind of a unicorn because he has a background in interiors and landscape, so he’s the perfect one to whom we can really ask these questions. A great trending plant right now is cactus, which are low maintenance and you can even find some like euphorbias, which are actually poinsettias, but they do well in lower light. If you feel your home is over-decorated, a great way to help your eye “rest” from the extra decor is by adding plants. <br /><br />What’s trending right now 1:21<br />What is the source for larger trees? Trees for low light? 5:20<br />What plants are best for the kitchen vs living room vs dining room 10:28<br />What type of olive tree to use 14:26<br />Fertilizers 17:40<br />Plants, pets, and babies 20:23<br />Plants for lazy people 26:38<br />How to get the Fiddly Fig to branch out instead of straight up 27:31<br />Height and size of tree relative to windows, placement, scale, and pot size 29:11<br />Plants and design styles 31:18<br /><br />“There are a lot of palms that are great. There’s the Parlor Palm that is great for low light. I love a Fishtail Palm, I think people overlook Fishtail Palms. They’re super hearty and you can’t kill one. It’ll do great in medium light, it’ll do great in high light. They’re really, really easy to take care of.” 6:55<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.northland-design.com/team/brock-saucier/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.northland-design.com/team/brock-saucier/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
