  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! This week’s show is a special one… It’s the moment we’ve all been waiting for. My brand-new flagship newsletter, Curzio Research Advisory, is finally live. That’s right, it’s official. And before my guest signs on, I’ve prepared a special segment to tell you all about it. These are specific instructions, tips, and details on how listeners can make the best out of this limited-time opportunity. I’m then joined by Managing Director & Portfolio Manager at Point View Wealth Management - John Petrides. Today, John and I break down a number of topics - politics, emerging markets, economics, you name it… John knows it all. But to start off the interview, John brings up something that’s rarely addressed… It’s a period of time he calls the “Beartrap.” And we’re in the middle of it. It’s the time in between earnings seasons and, as John explains, when investors must be alert. This is when there’s a ton of headline risks... and when individual investors overly focus on short-term economic data. As John puts it, \"we don’t want to make long-term decisions based on short-term risks.” Switching gears, John shares with listeners his favorite play in the energy sector. Just last week, this company announced a “home-run” deal. And as it continues to free up cash, lower debt, and buy back shares… this under-the-radar stock is poised for something huge. As always, before John signs off, he highlights his favorite sector going forward… The ultimate hedge against Trump.",
