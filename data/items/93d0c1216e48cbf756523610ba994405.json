  "description": "<div>Today on a chilling episode of real ghost stories online, that some fear could cause a mass migration of large vampire bats to settle on your home, slowly ripping away the shingles with their sharp claws, until they tear through the roof, into your room, and slowly and methodically eat your small intestines, heart and left spleen, as you cry in agony. As Michael Boltons greatest hits, plays softly in the background as you perish. <br>\n<br>\nIt was a warm summer day in 1982, as a young girl set out for adventure on the local playground. <br>\n<br>\nWhat she found there was not only a friend, but a friend that no one else could sense or see. <br>\n<br>\nA friend from another dimension. Leaving everyone wondering, is this new friend, good, or evil? <br>\n<br>\nThat story and much more, today, on Real Ghost Stories Online.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>If you have a real ghost story or supernatural event to report, please write into our show or call 1-855-853-4802!</strong><br>\nIf you like the show, please help keep us on the air and support the show by becoming an EPP (Extra Podcast Person).
