  "description": "Listen to All Things Covered wherever podcasts are found\n\nThe Hall of Fame will welcome a handful of new members this weekend, but maybe none as unique as Edgerrin James. On this episode Bryant McFadden chats with the HOF inductee about his early days in Immokalee, Florida, all the way to what landed him in Canton. The guys of course have to fit in a bit of Miami/FSU trash talk to start. Edge then discusses what it means to enter the Hall with former teammate Peyton Manning and why he chose Jim Irsay as his presenter. He then takes us back to his youth, the importance of staying true to his image and his breakout moment at 'The U.' James then details his pro career starting with his incredible rookie campaign with the Colts and setting sights on records. BMac of course has to mention some defeats his Steelers dished the Colts and later, the Cardinals. Edgerrin shares which running backs he likes watching now, Indy expectations for 2021 and advice he gives his sons during the recruiting process before diving into Superlatives. \n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
