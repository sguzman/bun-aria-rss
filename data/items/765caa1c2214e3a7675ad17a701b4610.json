For most angles, this creates visible structure such as defined spiral arms. But at the golden angle the corners are spread out relatively evenly. Nature takes advantage of this in plants like the <a href=\"http://mathforum.org/mathimages/index.php/Romanesco_Broccoli\" target=\"_blank\">Romanesco Broccoli</a> to evenly spread out the disgusting-tasting broccoli florets as they grow. [<a href=\"http://pastebin.com/ikeLbJH6\" target=\"_blank\">code</a>] </p>",
