  "description": "It's no surprise that two Kentucky singer-songwriters would come together to bond over their love of mountain life. But the first album-length collaboration by cellist Ben Sollee and guitarist/banjo player Daniel Martin Moore, 'Dear Companion,' is about little else. Recorded to raise money and awareness for Appalachian preservation -- most pointedly in opposition to mountaintop-removal coal mining -- the album was produced by another likeminded Kentuckian, Jim James of My Morning Jacket. Here, Sollee and Moore perform live at the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, R.I.",
