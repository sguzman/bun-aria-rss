  "description": "What a great and busy start to the year… I just returned from the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2022)... and today, I’ll highlight the best and worst companies that showcased at the event. [0:30]  But first, Goldman Sachs just increased its prediction for the number of interest rate hikes we’ll see this year as the Federal Reserve attempts to control inflation… I pound the table on why inflation is the biggest risk to the markets today… the single, painful solution I see for the Fed… and how to start protecting your portfolio NOW. [1:30]  Cryptos are also seeing a lot of volatility, with Bitcoin dropping from $60,000 to around $40,000 over the past month or so. I explain why the pullback is creating a great buying opportunity. [7:50] Turning to CES, while Omicron had an obvious impact on the number of attendees (several companies ended up canceling last-minute)... there were still plenty of amazing products being showcased—like BMW’s new electric vehicle (EV), which I got to test-drive.

[25:50] Finally, a new cross-industry alliance is a huge deal for the smart home trend. [29:20] Check out our , , and the  for all of my deep-dive updates from this year’s event.
