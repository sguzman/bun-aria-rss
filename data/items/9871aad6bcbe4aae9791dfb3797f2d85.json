  "description": "With John Bolton loose in the West Wing, what will happen to US foreign policy? Deep State Radio's Rosa Brooks hosts in David Rothkopf's absence, joined by regulars Kori Schake of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and Ed Luce from the Financial Times, with a special guest appearance by Stanford University's Colin Kahl. Colin assures DSR listeners that Bolton's a nixer, not a fixer, and suggests we kiss the Iran nuclear deal goodbye. Ed and Kori wonder if there's any such thing as a Trump Whisperer, and contemplate the likely (non)-impact of French President Macron's visit to Washington. Rosa provides prophecies of doom and suggests that Trump's election was all Ed's fault. In this episode of Deep State Radio, the Ministry of Snark team covers the terrain from Mike Pompeo and Gina Haspel to prospects for progress on North Korea.
