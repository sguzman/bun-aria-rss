  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys give the first annual McAfee Movie Review Monday after Pat saw Jurassic World: Dominion and Hustle this weekend, his overall thoughts on both, his war with the NFL social media team that is now a ceasefire, and everything going on with the NBA Finals, Stanley Cup Finals, and all the different NFL stories. Joining the progrum fresh off guest hosting Good Morning Football, is 9 year NFL veteran, host of The Man-To-Man Podcast, friend of the show, Darius Butler. Pat and D But chat about how he liked doing Good Morning Football, guys looking incredible or sloppy when they show up for camp, Tyreek Hill talking about how much of a game changer he is on his It Needed To Be Said podcast, the Eagles now potentially having the fastest man in the NFL, and everything else happening around the league (26:30-54:12). Later, NFL Network Insider and friend of the progrum, Ian Rapoport joins the show to chat about the NFL's social media accounts restricting Pat's account, when he thinks we'll hear about Deshaun Watson, Terry McLaurin not showing up for mandatory minicamp, and whether or not DK Metcalf could be moved (1:26:05-1:39:11). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show, and listen on Sirius XM Channel 82, Mad Dog Radio.
