For thousands of years its been passed down through translators.   And sometimes the words that we read today in our Bibles don’t fit with the context the authors were originally using.   Tim and Jon have a quick discussion on a popular Hebrew word “Shema.”  It originally meant \"to listen\" and to the ancient Hebrew it was one of the most powerful words in the Scriptures, but today its importance is mostly lost.</p>\n<p>This podcast accompanies the first in a new video series called \"Word Studies.\"   For more info, check out our YouTube channel and the video called \"Word Study: Shema - Listen\". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQLOuIKaRA</p>\n<p>Thanks for being part of this!</p>\n<p><strong>Music Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Defender by Rosasharn Music<br />\nShine by The Album Leaf</p>\n",
