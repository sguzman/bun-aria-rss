This week, Connor and Dan continue their discussion from a few weeks ago about the problems encountered when trying to define knowledge. Clearly, the JTB system doesn't work, so what about Causal Theory or Reliabilism? Want to know what all those words mean? Listen to the pod you dummy! Also this week: an insane number of tangents into all sorts of semi-related topics, and a live reading of a TMNT Topps trading card. Enjoy!</strong></p>",
