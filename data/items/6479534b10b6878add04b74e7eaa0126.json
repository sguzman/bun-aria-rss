  "description": "Earlier this week we got a look at one of the highest-profile scientific photo dumps of all time. The James Webb Space Telescope is the most powerful telescope ever sent into space, and it is producing some of the most detailed, rich, and far-reaching images of the universe we have seen – including the birth of stars, galaxies colliding, and the bending of space-time itself. Today, Host Emily Kwong talks with Short Wave Scientist-in-Residence Regina G. Barber and NPR's Joe Palca about these mind bending new portraits of our universe and our origins. <br/><br/>You can follow Emily on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emilykwong1234?s=20&t=uBtB65D0HRqCURMxl2laHg\">@EmilyKwong1234</a> and Regina <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScienceRegina?s=20&t=uBtB65D0HRqCURMxl2laHg\">@ScienceRegina</a>.
