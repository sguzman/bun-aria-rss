  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys are joined in studio by comedian, AGT Superstar, and America's newest sweetheart, Ryan Niemiller, fresh off the most recent round of judges cuts on America's Got Talent. They chat about his journey thus far and what still needs to be done in order to reach his goal, the influx of opportunities that he has gained since being on national TV, some of the things that go on behind the scenes on America's Got Talent, what his relationship is like with some of the other acts on AGT, and where he see's his career going from this point forward. It's another hilarious and heartfelt interview that will leave you wanting to vote for Ryan as many times as possible (3:39-47:41). Also joining the show is up and coming country musician, and all-around hilarious human, Mitchell Tenpenny. Mitchell and Pat chat about his road to where he's currently at, what it's like being a non-traditional country artist, what made him decide to start his own label and go for it on his own, his songwriting process, how hard it is trying to make it in a place like Nashville where the music scene is competitive as can be, and what some of his hobbies are whenever he's not making music. You're going to like this guy. (53:07-01:13:23). Pat and the guys also discuss the NFL being back as several teams have started to report for training camp. They cover some of the things making waves around the league, and dive into Taylor Lewan being suspended for the first four games of the season, and why testing for certain supplements has become a slippery slope in the NFL. Today's a great one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
