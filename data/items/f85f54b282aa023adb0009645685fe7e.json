    "media:description": "The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 93 \n\nRedefine the words; redefine the society. That's the basic idea of \"critique\" and the way so much of Marxist activism proceeds. Recently, James Lindsay explained this phenomenon in an essay (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/09/three-terms-communists-redefined-to-subvert-society/) on New Discourses with relation to three key terms that allow a subversion of society: \"inclusion,\" \"democracy,\" and, most concerningly, \"citizenship.\" In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, host James Lindsay reads through and elaborates on his own essay on this topic. Join him to understand this important maneuver.\n\nSupport New Discourses: https://newdiscourses.com/support\n\nSubscribe to New Discourses on other platforms: https://newdiscourses.com/subscribe\n\nFollow James Lindsay: https://linktr.ee/conceptualjames\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
