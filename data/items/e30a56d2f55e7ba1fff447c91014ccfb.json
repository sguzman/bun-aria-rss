  "description": "<p>Show Notes:<br />\nThis is our 100th podcast episode! We hosted a live Q+R before an audience of our friends and supporters in our studios in Portland, Oregon. We also had our good friends, the band Tents, play our podcast theme music live for us. You can find the video release of this Q+R here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh2Xwja6M4s</p>\n<p>Tim and Jon responded to three questions:</p>\n<p>Q1: (7:40) Parker from Twitter: Why does God in Genesis 1 say let us make humanity in \"our\" image instead of saying let us make humanity in \"my\" image if he is speaking to the divine council? And how does this affect the imago dei?</p>\n<p>Q2: (22:04) Andrew from Nottingham, UK: Does an emphasis on the heavenly council lead people away from a trinitarian view of God and rather see Jesus as one of the lesser elohim? For instance, from my limited understanding, that's how Jehovah's Witnesses view. Thanks for everything you do I find it really helpful!</p>\n<p>Q3: (29:30) Ryan Craycraft from Middletown, Ohio: Tim, you mentioned that elohim only refers to a non-physical spiritual being. However when reading John 10:34-35, when being accused of blasphemy by the Jews for making Himself God, Jesus appears to quote Psalm 82, \"Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods,\" when speaking directly to Jews. What is your take on Jesus' response here? And how do both the Scriptures of John 10 and Psalm 82 relate to elohim used in Exodus 22, where the word \"judges\" was translated from elohim?
