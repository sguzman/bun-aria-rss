  "description": "<p>Lenny is a comedian from back in the day when Joe first started out as a stand up in Boston. He was a huge influence on Joe and helped him get gigs and pay his rent way back  then. I’m sure we owe Lenny great thanks for getting Joe where he is today. This was a fun conversation between a few really old friends.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p><a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</a></p>\n",
