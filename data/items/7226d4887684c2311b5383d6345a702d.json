  "description": "<p>Do insects see the world in slow motion? Do animals see the same rainbow we do? How do eagles see so far away? Our listeners have a lot of questions about the way animals see the world, and this episode tackles lots of them. We'll visit a lab where scientists are observing predatory insects to find out how their brains work, we'll drop in on the Eyes Open Wider support group for animals, and give you a catchy melody that will help you remember the electromagnetic spectrum -- that's all the light that's both visible and invisible to us. And our Moment of Um answers the question: Why are we lighter in a pool of water?</p>\n<p>Todayâ€™s episode is sponsored by The Great Courses Plus (thegreatcoursesplus.com/brainson) and KiwiCo (kiwico.com/BRAINSON).
