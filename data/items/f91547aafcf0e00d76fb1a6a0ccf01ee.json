  "description": "Named as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time Magazine, V.S. Ramachandran sits down with Tom Bilyeu on Impact Theory to discuss the correlations between the brain, poetry, and living a better quality of life. V.S. is one of the most respected minds in all of neuroscience. His name is often uttered in the same breath as some of the most enduring names in the history of science. His insightful experiments, coupled with his ability to boil the complex down to the super simple, has made him one of the most sought after lecturers living today. He has done multiple TED talks and, like Michael Faraday, Thomas Huxley, and countless Nobel Laureates before him, he has had the immensely grand honor of being invited to give a Friday evening discourse at the Royal Institution of Great Britain.  Additionally, he was the Gifford Lecturer of 2012, an honor reserved for history's brightest minds that dates back to the 1800s and has included such legendary figures as Niels Bohr, Roger Penrose, Werner Heisenberg, and Carl Sagan. He obtained his PhD from Trinity College at Cambridge, received two additional honorary doctorates, as well as the Henry Dale Medal. Richard Dawkins once called him \"The Marco Polo of Neuroscience.\" He is the Director of the Center for Brain and Cognition, a distinguished professor with a Psychology Department and Neurosciences Program at UC San Diego and is an adjunct Professor of Biology at the Salk Institute. V.S. is also the best-selling author of The Tell-Tale Brain, Phantoms in the Brain, and A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness. Watch this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu to learn about the secrets of the brain and how you can build winning mental habits. WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:  Understanding Brain Interconnectivity How Metaphors and Poetry Relate to Neuroscience How to Unlearn Pain How Music Builds a Bridge In the Brain Why You Should Cultivate a Poetic Mindset Why The Solution Is Often Simple The Difference Between Seeing and Observation",
