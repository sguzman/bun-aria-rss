We describe—again, unfortunately—domestic abuse in great detail.</p><p><a href='https://rottenindenmark.org/2020/01/06/the-d-c-snipers/'>Continue reading →</a><br/><br/>Support us:<br/><a href='http://patreon.com/yourewrongabout'>Subscribe on Patreon</a><br/><a href='https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ywapodcast'>Donate on Paypal</a><br/><a href='https://www.teepublic.com/stores/youre-wrong-about?ref_id=10420'>Buy cute merch</a></p><p>Where else to find us: <br/><a href='http://linktr.ee/whyaredads'>Sarah's other show, Why Are Dads</a> <br/><a href='http://maintenancephase.com/'>Mike's other show, Maintenance Phase</a></p><a rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://patreon.com/yourewrongabout\">Support the show</a> (http://patreon.com/yourewrongabout)",
