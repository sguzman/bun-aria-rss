  "description": "In the past few months, two essays on America’s changing relationship to work caught my eye. The first was Anne Helen Petersen’s viral BuzzFeed piece defining, and describing, “millennial burnout.” The second was Derek Thompson’s Atlantic article on “workism.”\nThe two pieces speak to each other in interesting ways, and to some questions I’ve been reflecting on as my own relationship to work changes. So I asked the authors to join me for a conversation about what happens when work becomes an identity, capitalism becomes a religion, and productivity becomes the way we measure human value. The conversation exceeded even the high hopes I had for it. Enjoy this one.\nBook recommendations:\nKids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennialsby Malcolm Harris\nWhite: Essays on Race and Cultureby Richard Dyer\nThe Vertigo Years: Europe, 1900-1914by Philipp Blom\nA Visit from the Goon Squadby Jennifer Egan\nIf you’ll be in Washington, DC, on Thursday, April 25, join us for a morning of live podcasts in celebration of our fifth birthday.
