  "description": "<p>In order to protect intellectual property against untrusted foundry, many\nlogic-locking schemes have been developed. The main idea of logic locking is to\ninsert a key-controlled block into a circuit to make the circuit function\nincorrectly without right keys. However, in the case that the algorithm\nimplemented by the circuit is naturally fault-tolerant or self-correcting,\nexisting logic-locking schemes do not affect the system performance much even\nif wrong keys are used. One example is low-density parity-check (LDPC)\nerror-correcting decoder, which has broad applications in digital\ncommunications and storage. This paper proposes two algorithmic-level\nobfuscation methods for LDPC decoders. By modifying the decoding process and\nlocking the stopping criterion, our new designs substantially degrade the\ndecoder throughput and/or error-correcting performance when the wrong key is\nused. Besides, our designs are also resistant to the SAT, AppSAT and removal\nattacks. For an example LDPC decoder, our proposed methods reduce the\nthroughput to less than 1/3 and/or increase the decoder error rate by at least\ntwo orders of magnitude with only 0.33% area overhead.\n</p>",
