  "description": "Last week, America lost an iconic jurist and a life long advocate for equal rights. In memory of the Honorable Ruth Bader Ginsburg, we replay Katie's interview with Lauren Moxley, the host of The Ginsburg Tapes Podcast  -- which chronicles Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s oral arguments before the then all-male United States Supreme Court from 1972 to 1978 —before she became #Notorious RBG.\nThe Ginsburg Tapes allows the listener to be a fly on the wall for some of the most important cases in American jurisprudence as future Justice Ginsburg challenged laws treating men and women differently. In between the actually Supreme Court recordings, Lauren puts the cases, the law and even the Justices themselves in historical context and explains how as a lawyer, RBG really did change the World.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/words-matter.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
