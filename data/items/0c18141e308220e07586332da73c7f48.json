What they revealed in the interview has left not just the UK and the Commonwealth reeling, but challenged the entire world’s perception of the monarchy. BoF’s Imran Amed sat down with Elizabeth Holmes, a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, notable ‘royal watcher’ and style expert to contextualise the conversation with Winfrey and what it means for the future of royal fashion.</p> <p>”When Princess Diana left the Royal Family, she made it very clear she did not need fashion in the same way, because she was able to use her own voice… And I think Meghan — now in her move to California — definitely doesn’t need it either,” Holmes said. “She will still continue to use it and promote brands that she believes in and has connections to, but when you can use your voice, you’re not relying on your fashion to talk for you.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/marketing-pr/have-we-reached-peak-royalty'> Have We Reached Peak Royalty?</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/monetising-meghan-markle'> Monetising Meghan Markle</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/media/could-meghan-markle-cash-in-on-her-powerful-influencer-status'> Could Meghan Markle Cash In on Her Powerful Influencer Status?</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>External clips courtesy of Today, India Today, Sky News Australia, CPAC, Good Morning Britain, Harpo Productions/CBS, and CTV News.</em></p> <p> </p> <p><em>To subscribe to The BoF Podcast, please follow</em> <a href= 'https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-business-of-fashion-podcast/id1225204588?mt=2'> <em>this link.</em></a></p> <p>Join <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?coupon=PODCASTPRO&utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description'> BoF Professional</a> for the analysis and advice you need. <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/packages?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=trial'> Get 30 days for just $1</a> or <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/memberships/group/contact?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=podcast-description&utm_content=groups'> explore group subscriptions</a> for your business. </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
