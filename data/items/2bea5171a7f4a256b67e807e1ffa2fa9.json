  "description": "<p>Jackson Galaxy (Host & Executive Producer of My Cat from Hell, animal advocate, cat behavior expert, author, musician) opens up about his struggles with social anxiety, substance abuse, and disordered eating. After an illuminating installment of \"What Mayim Hears\", Jackson discusses growing up wanting to be a rock star and how playing guitar and busking at an early age helped him combat anxiety. He details his use of food as a comfort tool and alcohol as a social lubricant before he discovered the benefits provided by the structure of rituals. Mayim and Jackson break down how misdiagnoses and ineffective prescriptions can lengthen one’s mental health journey, the biological instincts tied to social anxiety, and navigating society as an empath. They bond over their shared love for the energetic minefield that is New York City, disordered eating as a public person, desires to be terminally unique involutes, and of course, their love of cats.</p><p>Jackson Galaxy's Website: <a href=\"https://www.jacksongalaxy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.jacksongalaxy.com/</a></p><p>Jackson Galaxy's Books: <a href=\"https://shop.jacksongalaxy.com/collections/books\" target=\"_blank\">https://shop.jacksongalaxy.com/collections/books</a></p><p>Jackson Galaxy Cat Camp: <a href=\"https://www.catcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.catcamp.com/</a></p><p>Jackson Galaxy Project: <a href=\"https://greatergood.org/jackson-galaxy\" target=\"_blank\">https://greatergood.org/jackson-galaxy</a></p><p>Best Friends Animal Society: <a href=\"https://bestfriends.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://bestfriends.org/</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
