  "description": "<p>This is Great British Bosses by Anything but Footy. We profile the women and men responsible for sport in this country - many at national governing bodies - who manage teams, staff, budgets, grass-root participation and overseeing those medal moments at Olympic, Paralympic and elite level.</p><br><p>Triathlon was only invented in San Diego in 1974, but now the swim bike run event is an integral part of the Olympics and Paralympics and is expanding in 2020 for the first time since started in Sydney 20 years ago. In this episode, we're back in Loughborough and the base of British Triathlon with Chief Executive Andy Salmon. Andy joined British Triathlon in November 2017, having previously chaired Triathlon Scotland. He talks us through the challenges ahead for a sport that's had great success in GB - the joint most successful nation in the Olympics and medals on debut in Rio at the Paralympics. Andy admits he had sleepless nights about the heat of Tokyo for his competitors following the test events there last August, but is also confident the event will be a huge success. We talk about the possibility of double Olympic champion Ali Brownlee returning for Tokyo, and also his delight at him not retiring after a disappointing performance at his home World Triathlon event in Leeds earlier in 2019. And Andy gives us his personal view on how many medals British Triathlon will win at Tokyo 2020!</p><br><p>This is episode six of the first series of Great British Boss - Badminton, Gymnastics, Fencing, Swimming and Table Tennis covered off so far - watch out for more in 2020!
