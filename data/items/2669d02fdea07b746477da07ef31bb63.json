  "title": "Packers-49ers TNF Recap: Aaron Rodgers dismantles a beat up San Francisco squad (Football 11/6)",
  "description": "Even though this game was over pretty early, that doesn't mean there aren't a ton of angles to discuss. Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson and John Breech to break down the Packers 34-17 victory over the 49ers on Thursday Night Football. It appeared to be a revenge game for Green Bay after getting dominated by San Fran last year, but that revenge was enacted vs a JV team. And despite the big win, it's still apparent that the Packers could use another wide receiver. Will Fuller could have been a great fit, but they were unable to get a deal done at the deadline. Are the 49ers completely out of contention? It'll be tough for them to re-enter the playoff conversation, but that could change if the league admits 8 teams in each conference to the postseason. And where does Aaron Rodgers sit at now in the MVP race? He's currently 3rd in odds at 5/1, but Brinson provides a better value bet down the board.
