  "description": "<p>Embodied Spirit - Mindfulness of the Body ~ The Buddha taught that mindfulness of the body is a direct path to the realization of truth, to peace and freedom. This talk explores how we leave a present-centered awareness of our body, and the pathways of homecoming - a favorite teaching from the 2010 archives.</p> <p>\"The most profound and full presence can only be experienced if we're awake right here in this body - with a quality of sacred presence that comes when, without any resistance, without any grasping, we really plant ourselves in the universe, in this body, in this being right here.\"</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely.
