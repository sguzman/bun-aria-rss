  "description": "<p>Filmmakers Lisanne Pajot and James Swirsky discovered the rich stories behind independently produced videogames, and turned some preliminary interviews into first one Kickstarter campaign, and then another. The resulting film, \"Indie Game: The Movie,\" won an award at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2012. But then, rather than accept deals for conventional film distribution, the two organized their own tour, renting theatres and meeting Kickstarter backers around North America. They ultimately controlled their own digital distribution as well. We discuss their journey of the last two years, which remains underway as they ready special features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsored by</p>\n\n<p>Canine design that fits your style at <br /><a href=\"http://www.domesticbeast.com/?utm_source=mule&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=dec\">Domestic Beast</a>.</p>\n\n\n",
