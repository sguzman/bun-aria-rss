Hot Seat/Cool Throne including Bryson vs Brooks and MLB fucked up again (25:15 - 42:57). Jay Cutler joins the show to talk Father's Day, his favorite throw ever, his least favorite interception, being used in the wildcat and tons more (42:57 - 86:46). Suns in 4 guy joins the show to talk about his fight, the Suns, and new t-shirts we have with him in the Barstool Sports Store (86:46 - 99:13). We finish with the boy Will Compton who joins the show to do some FAQ's and more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
