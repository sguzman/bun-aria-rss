  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the fallout from the Miles Teller situation after Miles responded to Pat's tweet on Friday Night SmackDown, and how he was in the trenches taking flak from people in Hollywood all weekend, and how AJ happened to get caught in the middle of everything. Joining the program is friend of the show and Insider for NFL Network, Ian Rapoport, to chat about what he's hearing about Aaron Rodgers and the Packers and what the post June 1 designation means now that we're there, what he thinks is going to happen with Julio Jones, if he thinks Tebow will be used as a Taysom Hill type in Jacksonville, and everything else going on around the NFL (19:16-41:02). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk chat more about the Miles Teller situation and how AJ is done playing mediator, what they think is going to happen with Julio Jones, if he has any updates on the Aaron Rodgers situation, Chelsea vs. Manchester City, and everything else that happened over the long weekend in the sports world (45:37-1:54:52).
