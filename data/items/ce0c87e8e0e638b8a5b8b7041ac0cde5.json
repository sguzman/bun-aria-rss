Dr. Thomas Doherty, a clinical and environmental psychologist in Portland, Oregon, and Dr. Ashlee Cunsolo, a public health researcher who studies how environmental loss is affecting the mental health of the indigenous Inuit community in Canada, discuss the mental health effects of climate change and what can we do to cope and build resilience in ourselves.</p> <p><em>Are you enjoying Speaking of Psychology?
