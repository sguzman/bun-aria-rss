  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys chat about last night's Thursday Night Football game between the Chiefs and Chargers and whether or not the Chiefs are back, Brandon Staley's 4th Down decisions, and look ahead to the entire week 15 slate and make their picks (49:00-1:03:57). Joining the program is an all-time broadcasting legend, a guy who has been calling games and sporting events for more than 50 years, and current play-by-play announcer for Sunday Night Football, Al Michaels. Pat and Al chat about his career as a whole, his relationships with coaches around the league and what kind of information he and Cris are looking for during these conversations, if he plans to retire anytime soon, what his future might look like, if this NFL season seems crazier than ones in the past and much more (13:50-46:58). Next, Pro Bowler, friend of the program, Running Back for the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Jones joins Pat and AJ to chat about the increased protocols and what that means for the locker room, how his knee is holding up, if he's always been able to catch the ball the way he does, how difficult it was to get used to Aaron's cadence, his thoughts on this weekend's game against the Ravens, and more (1:03:59-1:17:23). Later, comedy legend Bill Burr joins Pat and the boys in studio to chat about his upcoming tour dates, potentially working on a new special, this weekend's Patriots/Colts matchup, his general thoughts on comedy as a whole right now, and more (1:17:25-2:16:32).
