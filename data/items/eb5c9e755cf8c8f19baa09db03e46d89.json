  "description": "<p>In this episode, we get to hang with BET style director Danielle Prescod, and we are obsessed! She is a self-proclaimed over sharer so this episode was extra fun to record! Danielle is a pop-culture expert, style icon, and fitness enthusiast. We asked her all your questions in a fun lightening round (including tips on how to take the best selfie and of course, DATING) and she walks us through her career thus far, and how she ended up at BET! </p> <p>Also in this episode, Becca and Danielle decide to have a SoulCycle date, and Grace can’t stop binge-watching <em>You</em> (and she is creeped out). Don’t forget to read our first book club pick of the year, Little White Lies, by Jennifer Lynn Barnes. We can’t wait to talk about it next week!  </p> <p>You can find our friend crush at <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/danielleprescod/\">@danielleprescod!</a></p> <p> <strong>Can't get enough Bad On Paper?</strong></p> <p>Join our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/yapod\">FB group</a> for amazing book recs & more</p> <p>Follow us on Instagram <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/badonpaperpodcast\">@badonpaperpodcast</a></p>",
