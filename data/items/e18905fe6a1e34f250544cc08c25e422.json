Once an anorexic, NOT always an anorexic.”</p><p>Dotsie Bausch</p><br><p><br></p><p>We tend to think Olympic athletes live perfect, charmed lives. Genetically gifted, they inhabit a world beyond mortal challenges — physical specimens oozing talent so rare, it effortlessly skyrockets them onto the global stage.</p><p>I would stridently challenge such a notion. I don't think that is the experience of any Olympian. And it’s definitely not the experience of this week’s guest – an Olympic silver medalist with an almost unbelievably improbable story. A very human story of struggle and pain that underpins her athletic accomplishments, fueling them with a fundamental sense of purpose and meaning.</p><p>A 7-time U.S. National Champion, former world record holder and two-time Pan American gold medal winner in track cycling, Dotsie Bausch earned silver in team pursuit at the 2012 London Olympics. Not only was she a long-time vegetarian at that time (she’s now vegan), she was almost 40 years old&nbsp;when she won that medal – the oldest ever in her discipline and one of the oldest athletes to ever compete in an Olympic Games.</p><p>Dotsie's accomplishments are extraordinary. But more remarkable is the hard-fought road this exceptional athlete trudged to achieve such heights. Because Dotsie's greatest achievement isn't athletic. Her biggest victory&nbsp;is&nbsp;the battle won to resurrect her life from the depths of an eating disorder so severe, it very nearly claimed her life.</p><br><p>Now retired, Dotsie is a public speaker (check out her TEDx Talk, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Dgofa-v4MA4\" target=\"_blank\">Olympic Level Compassion</a>), a mentor to aspiring female professional cyclists, and a color commentator for NBC Sports. But most importantly, she is a role model for women and men around the world in their battle to return to healthy eating and living habits as an ambassador for <a href=\"https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The National Eating Disorders Association</a>.</p><p>I know Dotsie through the vegan athlete world as a staunch advocate for animal rights and the health benefits of plant-based eating for health and performance. She is also the force behind a recent anti-dairy commercial that aired during the closing ceremonies of the recent PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games. Entitled <a href=\"http://switch4good.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Switch 4 Good,</a>&nbsp;think of it as an anti- “Got Milk” campaign featuring an array of former Olympic athletes.</p><p>Disordered eating is a subject I have been wanting to explore on this podcast for quite some time. I just needed the right guest. Dotsie delivers. Her experience as both a sufferer and survivor of this surprisingly common malady is as powerful as it is instructive.</p><p>This is a conversation about facing and overcoming a&nbsp;disease that affects up to 30 million Americans and 70 million individuals worldwide. A disease so formidable, it drove Dotsie to a suicide attempt.</p><p>It’s an exchange about the bewildering nature of that disorder and the process she undertook to rebuild her life – from fashion model to athlete. It’s a conversation about her most unlikely route to Olympic glory. It’s about eating plant-based for performance. And it’s about advocacy – what it means to live in service to your ideals.</p><p>If you suffer from an eating disorder or know someone who does, this is appointment listening. Towards that end, Dotsie conducts a free mentorship program for those in need. Her door is open to any and all reaching out for help.
