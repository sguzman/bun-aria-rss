We are each sharing our opinions about the novel: the storyline, the characters, the ending and much more! We're also answering your questions about the book and sharing our casting choices for a Hollywood Treatment of this novel. As always we're also sharing the other books we read this month and whether or not we'd recommend them. The next book is Jackie's choice and she chose A Slow Fire Burning by Paula Hawkins.
