  "itunes:summary": "The Wall Street Journal once described Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny as the man Vladimir Putin fears the most on the planet. And judging by the activity of both the Russian President and the fearsome anti-corruption advocate, there is definitely a case to be made about just that.\n\nNavalny has been a staunch critic of the controversial Russian President and the epidemic of corruption within his government for nearly a decade, taking his cause to civil society through various NGOs and to the public at large not only through a storied political career, but also through powerful social media campaigns and self-produced documentaries.\n\nAmassing a following of millions online, Navalny has become the face of the modern reformist movement in Russia. And while he has inspired a new generation of activism in his embattled homeland, he has also endured the brunt of its retaliation from the Kremlin through a myriad of criminal allegations, prison sentences and even attempts on his life.\n\nIn August of 2020, Navalny was poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent â€“ a substance developed and used by Russian authorities against enemies abroad. This was the third time Navalny had been attacked using a chemical agent since 2017, but the outcome was by far the worst, with Navalny being forced into a medically-induced coma for nearly two weeks. Upon returning to Russia in January of this year, Navalny was immediately detained and later sentenced to two years in a remote prison for violating his parole.\n\nThe response among Russian citizens has been nothing short of historic, with protests emerging throughout the country in the days and weeks following Navalnyâ€™s detainment. Calling not only for his release, but for a transformation of Russian governance towards greater accountability, transparency and respect for the rule of law, the current protests are the largest Russia has seen in over a decade and marks a potential critical juncture in the Putin regimes two decade control over the state.\n\nThis week on the Carleton University Political Science podcast we are joined by Professor Andrea Chandler. Dr. Chandler is a professor here with the Department of Political Science at Carleton specializing in Russian politics and governance, and the politics of gender in post-communist states.\n\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nFollow us on social media:\ninstagram.com/cu_poli.sci\nfacebook.com/carletonu.polisci\ntwitter.com/CU_PoliSci\ncarleton.ca/polisci\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nThanks so much for listening, and an extra thanks to Sappheiros for use of his music for our theme.\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nLights by Sappheiros @sappheirosmusic\nCreative Commons â€” Attribution 3.0 Unported â€” CC BY 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: bit.ly/LightsSappheiros\nMusic promoted by Audio Library youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nðŸŽµ Track Info:\nTitle: Lights by Sappheiros\nGenre and Mood: Dance & Electronic + Inspirational\nâ€”â€”â€”\nðŸŽ§ Available on:\nSpotify: open.spotify.com/album/4KnoJn...\niTunes: music.apple.com/us/album/ligh...\nDeezer: deezer.com/us/album/88114572\nYouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=xq3_uCEtiJI\nSoundCloud: @sappheirosmusi...\nâ€”â€”â€”\nðŸ˜Š Contact the Artist:\nzachremick1@gmail.com\nsappheiros.bandcamp.com\ndeezer.com/us/artist/13811001\n@sappheirosmusic\nmusic.apple.com/us/artist/sap...\nyoutube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC...\nopen.spotify.com/artist/5ZVHX...\npaypal.com/paypalme2/sappheiros\ninstagram.com/sappheirosmusic\nfacebook.com/SappheirosMusic\ndiscordapp.com/invite/Pk87yN9\ntwitter.com/SappheirosMusic\npatreon.com/sappheiros",
