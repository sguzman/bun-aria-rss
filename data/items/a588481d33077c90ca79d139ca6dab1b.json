  "description": "<p>A bit of a House Cleaning episode with Brian Redban. Brain was with Joe from the start of JRE and is always a great guest to have on. In their conversation Joe discusses the controversy with Jack Dorsey the CEO of Twitter and how fans reacted to his podcast last week. I really enjoyed reviewing this one as I think it shows a very reflective side of Joe when he self-examines like this.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
