  "description": "Cuba Rica and Costa Rica, say that 10 times fast. This week on The Cigar Authority we  interview Stephen Adib from Cuba Rica and smoke the new Limitada in the first hour and the Barrabas in the second hour. We step into the Aging Room with Old Fart Freddy, Dive in the the Asylum with Mr. Jonathan, and get Debonaire with Chuck Morrison before looking at the tweets of the week from Recluse Cigars. All that and Cigar News with Barry in a week that saw a lot of change before finally hearing from David Garofalo on how his blind tasting went for Cigar Journal Magazine. ﻿",
