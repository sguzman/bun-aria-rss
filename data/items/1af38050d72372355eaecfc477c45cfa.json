    "media:description": "People have tried to cancel MrBeast many times. The reasons for which vary, but with so many cancellation attempts over such a long period of time, some of them are bound to be a lot pettier than others. This video will cover three of those incredibly stupid attempts, from people being angry at Chris and MrBeast for dressing up as a helicopter, to That Vegan Teacher claiming that MrBeast was destroying the environment by not having pineapple on his \"Worlds largest slice of pizza\".\n\nThese are, The Dumbest Attempts To Cancel MrBeast.\n\nThank you guys for watching, like and sub if you enjoyed, SunnyV2 XO ‚ù§",
