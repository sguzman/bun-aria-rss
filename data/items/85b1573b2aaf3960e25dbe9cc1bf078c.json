  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, I appeared on Dr. Phil to argue about gender and pronouns with a couple of non-binary diversity consultants and a woke college professor. We’ll talk about the experience today and watch a few of the clips together. Also, my opponents on the stage are now complaining that I have caused them to plunge into depression and they’re having nightmares because of me. What did I do to cause such trauma? We’ll try to figure that out. And Joe Biden held just his second press conference in a year and it was a total disaster. The media gets caught in yet another fake news scandal. And a major car company goes woke, though as always it’s not clear what they hope to accomplish. \nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.
