  "description": "We are so excited to welcome back one of our favorite guests, Philip Mitchell, of Philip Mitchell Designs to the show! He is a Toronto and New York-based designer with a full-service firm. He has been featured in House Beautiful, Better Homes & Gardens, House & Home, Veranda, Architectural Digest, and more. His upcoming book, Collected Interiors: Rooms That Tell a Story, is available for pre-order now. We talk about Philip’s love of storytelling, finding joy in the unexpected, a commitment to loving your space, and ART!\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nDiscussing Philip’s new book and his belief that a house should tell a story.\n\nPhilip’s two questions he asks all clients.\n\nWhat are some exercises we can do to edit our own design ideas?\n\nHow Philip breathes new life into old pieces.\n\nPhilip’s philosophy and approach to art.\n\nWhy Philip thinks loving a piece is more important than style or investment value.\n\nPhilip loves unconventional places to display art.\n\nWhen does Phillip like to place lighting on art?\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Sarah,\n\nYour space and your view are extraordinary! These are all great questions. For me, the number one thing regarding the paint is that Northern rooms are tricky. It looks as though you are in a very tropical location. I would tend to go very neutral, use one of the whites you have because then it will not fight with all of the colors that will change throughout the day with the light. Regarding the shelves, I agree with all of your suggestions. I love the idea of doing a new pair of chairs. I would also add a third chair by the fireplace. I love the family gallery wall, but I would move it to where you have that contemporary piece of art. Then you can move that piece to the “gallery” wall. Just swap them! It’ll be a great focal point. I know you are on a budget, so I would find similar fabric drapery panels to match what you already have on some of those bare windows. I don’t feel that your lamps are too small, but I would probably move the side table with the lamp over to the sofa backing to the dining room. Then I would look into adding another small side table where we are taking that one away. Then possibly a floor lamp there and over by the small chair next to the fireplace. Instead of having a giant ottoman in that big floor space, how about more than one thing? Maybe a rectangular ottoman (forget the tray...it always falls with kids!), round table, and square table. It will add some flexibility and practicality with a room that the family uses often. Let’s also toss some color in here with pillows, drapery, or other accents.\n\nWe are so jealous of your view and think buying this place was the RIGHT move! Thank you so much for listening and please send us some after photos!\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nPhilip Mitchell Design\nPhilip Mitchell Design on Instagram\nPre-order Collected Interiors: Rooms That Tell a Story\nEp 54. with Philip Mitchell",
