  "description": "<p>As we inch closer and closer to Beijing it's a perfect time to tick off another sport on the show that we have never covered before in Speed Skating as we chat with two-time Australian speed skater Daniel Greig about his amazing career and experiences in the sport! We find out more from Daniel just how he transitioned from roller sports into ice sports and how difficult that transition was as an Australian in a sport in which there are no full sized facilities anywhere the country. We also find out just how it is impossible to ever skip leg day in speed skating and just how grueling of a sport it is to compete in. Added to this we learn more about just how his devastation at his first Olympics actually helped him further in life and how he could technically be classed as an Olympic silver medallist in an unofficial Olympic event. It's a great chat that you will want to hear so make sure you don't miss out!</p>",
