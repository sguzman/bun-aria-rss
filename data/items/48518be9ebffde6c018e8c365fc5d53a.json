  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormonal health is not often talked about, though it affects everyone. It starts at puberty, goes through pregnancy, postpartum hormones, perimenopause, menopause; it is constantly in our lives. Yet, I was a little stunned at how uninformed a lot of us are. Today, we are speaking to Dr. Tara Scott. She is a doctor and a national speaker passionate about educating the medical community on the advances in evidence-based hormone therapy. In our conversation, we will talk about the most common symptoms of hormonal imbalance and why not everyone needs to take hormones. This discussion will open your eyes to what you need to be putting up with and what you don't.</span></p>",
