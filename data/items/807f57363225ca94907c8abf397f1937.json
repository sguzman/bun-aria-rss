  "description": "Oh it's DOUBLE FULLCAST WEEK. This one might as well be the Brunch episode, because it involves a few prime ingredients (look, we're talking about Florida State, an excellent football team) mixed in with the lesser leftovers from the week you might not want to serve by themselves. (Hello, Indiana and Vanderbilt.)\nTopics include:\n--More yelling about FSU's Dalvin Cook, who should have been the Heisman winner last year, and how his football team might be real, real good around him already before you add in his unearthly talents.\n--Vanderbilt discussion centers mostly around a.) Vandy improving to a lofty five win standard again, and b.)  a lot of reminders about how dismal Vandy has been historically, like that's something that will make Vandy feel better about getting their teeth kicked in by Tennessee consistently again.\n--Indiana! AMERICA'S MOST ZANDER DIAMONT TEAM.\n--Texas Tech! They're just Indiana football, but dustier and blessed with Pat Mahomes at quarterback.\n--Finally, Kansas State, which just gets kind of sad because it really, really feels like Bill Snyder's last season. (Even though it turns out that Bill Snyder is younger than man/chicken hybrid  Kenny Rogers.)\nLearn more about your ad choices.
