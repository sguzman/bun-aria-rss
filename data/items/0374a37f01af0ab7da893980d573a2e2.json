Fast forward to today, and every month more than 700 million people in over 95 countries ‚Äì and across 29 languages! ‚Äì get things done reliably with their Assistant. As voice has become a primary way we engage with technology, Assistant makes it easy to get things done across different devices, whether you're at home or on the go.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"8rqft\">Today at <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/made-by-google-2022\">Made by Google</a>, we shared some of our latest improvements to Assistant‚Äôs powerful AI capabilities, including new ways to interact more naturally with Assistant across <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-7-pixel-7-pro/\">Pixel 7</a> and the <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-watch\">Google Pixel Watch</a>. Here‚Äôs a look at a few of our favorites.</p><p data-block-key=\"lsc1\"></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2 data-block-key=\"8rqft\">Use your voice to get things done faster and more easily</h2></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"8rqft\"></h3><h3 data-block-key=\"2rfip\">Send messages faster with Assistant voice typing</h3><p data-block-key=\"8k1pu\">With Assistant voice typing, you can easily talk to Google to type, edit and send messages on average 2.5x faster than typing on the keyboard, and now in more languages ‚Äì Spanish, Italian and French. It‚Äôs also getting more fun! When you‚Äôre writing a message, Assistant voice typing can now suggest emojis relevant to your messages and lets you search the emoji to insert with your voice even without knowing the exact name for it. Just say ‚ÄúLOL emoji‚Äù and Assistant will know what you mean üòÇ.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--8\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><video alt=\"Assistant Voice Typing\" autoplay=\"\" class=\"article-image__media\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/AssistantVoiceTyping.mp4\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"An image of a smartphone using assistant voice typing\" type=\"video/mp4\">Video format not supported</video></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"47rx5\">Assistant voice typing with emoji suggestions and search</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"5w3is\">Discover more delightful calling and messaging experiences powered by Assistant</h3><p data-block-key=\"8qpmj\">At <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/calling-messaging-pixel-7/\">Made by Google</a>, we shared some ways Google is creating a more delightful calling and texting experience on Android-powered devices and how Assistant‚Äôs speech models are helping to make it even easier to communicate:</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><ul><li data-block-key=\"5w3is\">Call Screen helps you avoid unwanted calls and it has handled over 600 million calls for users last year.</li><li data-block-key=\"a8phv\">Direct My Call, powered by Duplex, will now show call menu options right away, so you can tap to get where you need without waiting to hear lengthy recorded menus and has helped Pixel users navigate over 50 million calls with businesses.</li><li data-block-key=\"b5it9\">Voice Message Transcription enables users to easily read audio messages on Google‚Äôs Messages app when you‚Äôre not in a great place to listen to one.</li></ul></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"5w3is\"><a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/meet-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro/\">Launched last year on Pixel 6</a>, quick phrases give you hands-free help on specific tasks, without needing to say ‚ÄúHey Google.‚Äù On Pixel 7, you can now say ‚ÄúSilence‚Äù to dismiss incoming calls when you are not ready to pick up.
