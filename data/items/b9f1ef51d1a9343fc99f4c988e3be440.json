  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden's administration is redefining language to justify his horrific policies. Marxists lie over and over again until people believe it. The word infrastructure has always meant physical structures like roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports. Yet, a big percentage of the bill has nothing to do with infrastructure. This is the biggest rip-off of the American people by redistributing the wealth of red states to blue states in order to weaken the Republican party so they can have one-party control. Democrats didn't just stop at redefining the meaning of infrastructure but they're redefining, racism, gender, and a plethora of others. The left defined the term trickle-down economics which does not exist, the American economy works from the bottom up because the consumers decide where and how they will spend their money, what Biden is creating is a trickle-down government economy that reaches the people last, not first. Then, why does George Soros attack America? Soros is so wealthy because he manipulates currency and is betting against America. Later, Lebron James would rather speak about systemically racist America than systemically genocidal communist China. Lebron is a typical liberal and a fraud. Major League Baseball has now entered into an agreement with a Chinese firm backed by the Communist Party of China. Texas Governor Greg Abbott rejects MLB in Texas from throwing out the first pitch to hosting an all-star game. Afterward, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis corrects the media's fake narrative on vaccine distribution after CBS News's 60 Minutes airs deceptively edited clip to push disinformation. DeSantis lauded the Publix supermarket chain and pharmacies as the most successful vaccine distribution option for Florida's seniors. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
