  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, Gina Haspel was given a tough assignment after 9/11, find out who these terrorists are and find out if they will attack us again. These Senators at the CIA director confirmation hearing were disgusting, questioning Haspel about her moral authority when she stepped into the breach to try and protect the American people from enemies unknown. They should be thanking Hapel for keeping us safe after 9/11. Also, Iranian-backed forces in Syria have launched missiles into Israel. War is inevitable not because of President Trump or Israel but because of Iran - they want war and you can thank Barack Obama for laying the foundation. Finally, Salena Zito calls in to discuss her new book, The Great Revolt: Inside the Populist Coalition Reshaping American Politics. She explains who the Trump supporters are, who they used to be and why they voted for Trump. These are the same people that are in the Tea Party movement.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
