  "description": "<p>I will be welcoming Blane Hajicek to the show. Blane has appeared on MonsterQuest. Apart from being a part time editor and camera grip, his father Doug Hajicek producer of MonsterQuest, has invited him on several research expeditions involving Sasquatch in northern Ontario.</p> <p> </p> <p>In 2007 During the filming of “Sasquatch Attack,” the cabin, in which he was staying, was attacked by something unknown. A year later Blane and his father went back to do more research in the same location, this time without the camera crew. During the second trip to Ontario’s Snelgrove Lake, the cabin was once again attacked. These experiences have opened his eyes to the existence of a large primate living in North America.</p> <p> </p> <p>Blane will be sharing with us an encounter he had a couple of years ago when he came within 30 feet of two of these creatures. Blane said “I never really believed in these creatures existing up until the Snellgrove lake incident and since then I have had a curiosity that has pushed me to look for answers. During the Snellgrove lake incident I never saw what was throwing rocks but years later I got a really good look at two of these creatures. I am still searching for answers.”</p> <p> </p> <p>I will also be welcoming Preston to the show. Preston was hunting during his encounter. Preston says “I was hunting when I saw a deer. The deer passed by me and minutes later the deer came running back towards me. I thought for sure I would see an elk chasing it and when I looked up I saw this gorilla looking creature coming from the direction the deer had come from. This thing stopped and looked at me and than continued on the direction it was heading. I only saw it for a couple seconds but those couple seconds changed my life.”</p>",
