  "description": "<p>Today we kick off Modernism Week coverage with internationally known architect <strong>Moshe (mo-shay) Safdie</strong>. He’s been famous for over 50 years for many brilliant buildings; first as architect for Habitat 67 in Montreal, in the 2000’s as architect for the Marina Bay Sands, that crazy rich Singapore hotel featured in the movie Crazy rich Asians; and for a special small chapel you might not know about. Safdie won the 2019 Wolf Prize in Architecture and his other honors include the AIA Gold Medal, Canada’s Royal Architectural Institute Gold Medal, and The Cooper Hewitt National Design Award for Lifetime Achievement.  Host <strong>George Smart</strong> talked with Safdie from the somewhat noisy atrium lobby of the Hyatt Palm Springs.</p>",
