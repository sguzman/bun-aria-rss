  "description": "A final girl in the horror genre is the woman who is left to deal with the aftermath of surviving a terrifying killer. From <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, to <em>Friday the 13th</em>, to <em>Halloween</em>.<br/><br/>The term 'Final Girl' was first coined by writer Carol J. Clover in her book <em>Men, Women, and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film</em>. <br/><br/>Society knows this trope well. But after the credits roll, audiences typically don't know much about what actually happens to that final girl. Or whether she can live a normal life after being hunted down by a masker killer. <br/><br/>Author Grady Hendrix unpacks that in his latest novel,<a href=\"https://www.gradyhendrix.com/the-final-girl-support-group/\"> <em>The Final Girl Support Group</em>.</a><br/><br/>\"The ultimate faceless killer they can't escape is the forces of market capitalism. There's always a sequel. So even if you survive Part I and II, they're going to get you in Part III. And there's something terrible about that to me, that you never get to let your guard down,\" Hendrix said.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this\">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:considerthis@npr.org\">considerthis@npr.org</a>.
