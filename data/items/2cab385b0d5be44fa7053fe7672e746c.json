In his new book, The Spirit of Green: The Economics of Collisions and Contagions in a Crowded World (Princeton UP, 2021), Nordhaus tackles the \"externality\" that is pollution and carbon emissions. By making several adjustments to how we treat this externality in economic terms, it can be brought back into the \"system\" whereby sensible regulation, market relations, and innovation can lead to markedly lower levels of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The most important of those adjustments is getting the price of carbon right.
