  "description": "<p>A listener writes “Hello Wes! I listen your show all the time I’m a big a fan of your show and Bigfoot. About 2 years ago I became fascinated with Sasquatch. I don’t have a Sasquatch encounter but I do have a paranormal encounter. One night in October of 2015. Me and a buddy of mine came across the creepiest thing I’ve ever seen in my life. 3 am we encountered a woman in a sparkling prom like dress who seem to have been waiting for my buddy. She was lifeless no emotion and stared at my buddy. I’d love to go into more detail and be able to tell you over the phone. Thank you Wes”</p> <p>Spoke to the eyewitness this afternoon. He has agreed to come on the show. Its the first time in a long time I have had chills listening to someone recount what they saw and what happen to them. This is an incident with multiple witnesses. The encounter takes a strange twist and it goes to show you that you can run into more then just Sasquatch during the witching hour.</p> <p> </p> <p>We will also discuss Sasquatch encounters.</p>",
