  "description": "The sitcom <em>The Golden Girls </em>followed the adventures of four women who were living together in Miami. The women were Dorothy (Bea Arthur), Sophia (Estelle Getty), Rose (Betty White), and Blanche (Rue McClanahan). Betty White's death in December marked the passing of the last of the four actresses who made up this cast, each of whom won an Emmy for her work on the show. It's a fine time to take a look at what is, for a lot of us, an old favorite. ",
