  "description": "Dr. David Chao is back with some QB injury outlooks. How likely to suit up are Matt Ryan and Drew Brees this week? We also ask Dr. Chao about Kerryon Johnson, Davante Adams and more injured players. Dr. Chao also talks a bit about his background and his time with the Chargers. Then we're joined by Will Brinson and Chris Towers to talk about five big topics. The first three are about TEs as we tell you why Zach Ertz's production shouldn't be that surprising to Fantasy owners (15:00), what's up with Evan Engram (23:00), how we feel about the TE position in general (27:10), plus what Kareem Hunt's return means for Nick Chubb (35:00) and who could be traded ahead of the trade deadline (40:00).\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
