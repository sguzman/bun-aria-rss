An unexpected internet outage means there aren’t any listener calls in this episode, but David more than makes up for it with his hilarious insights into the male mind. He recounts how he began to date his now-wife on the heels of a tough breakup when he was just 25 years old and purposefully NOT looking for love. Anna and David also share their views on older men dating much younger women. Plus, the gang plays a hysterical—and raunchy—round of \"Would You Rather.\"<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
