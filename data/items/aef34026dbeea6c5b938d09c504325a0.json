  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today we’re going to talk about something that most people would deny- the fact that we all get jealous. But what if instead of shoving it down in a well of shame, we instead took a moment to process it?</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chances are when you feel jealousy rear its ugly head, it’s not even really about whatever you’re envious of. You probably grew up in a household where you were constantly compared to others: a sibling, a classmate, whoever it might have been. This taught you never to truly see yourself or focus on your own needs, but only to view yourself as you related to others. Your path was defined by theirs, or at least, you thought it should have been.  In this episode we’ll talk more about:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How comparison culture causes jealousy</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What our jealousy might be trying to tell us</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How to embrace our own personal journey</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jealousy isn’t even really about what the other person has or is doing; I’d argue it’s actually a signal that you’re searching for love and acceptance. It’s a warning sign flagging you down that maybe just maybe you’re not on a path that will lead you to the happy life you deserve. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you liked this episode of the podcast, take a screenshot, head on over to my Instagram and share it on your IG stories, and tag me, @theselflovefix.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you love what you learned, be sure to hit that follow button so you never miss a future episode, and make sure to leave a review to help me reach more listeners just like you looking to follow their inner truth and live a life of abundance & authentic self-love.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CONNECT WITH BEATRICE:</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram:</span> <a href= \"http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">http://www.instagram.com/theselflovefix</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Website:</span> <a href= \"http://www.beatricekamau.com\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">http://www.beatricekamau.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>",
