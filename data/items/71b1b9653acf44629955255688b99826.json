  "description": "Our audiobook this week is Tempting You by S.A. Clayton\n\nSometimes you need to be tempted…\n\nI knew getting involved with someone right after a breakup was a bad idea. Yet Ian did something to me the second our eyes met across the bar. When those piercing eyes met mine, when his hands gripped my body in a way I’d never experienced before, I fell for him. Hard. He knew my body better than anyone ever has, showed me things I never experienced before, and made me crave more. So much more.\n\nBut what happens when reality comes crashing down and we both have to face the fact that real life isn’t a fantasy. Will we be able to leave behind our pasts or will the temptation of the future be enough?\n\nGet the ebook of now: https://amzn.to/3v2SWqO\nTempting Fate: https://amzn.to/3LPr9AS\nHarbour Cove Series: https://amzn.to/3v0cX1j\nMore S.A.
