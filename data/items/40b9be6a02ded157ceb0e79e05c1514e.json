  "description": "<p>Death by suicide is the seventh leading death cause worldwide. The recent\nadvancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically AI applications in\nimage and voice processing, has created a promising opportunity to\nrevolutionize suicide risk assessment. Subsequently, we have witnessed\nfast-growing literature of research that applies AI to extract audiovisual\nnon-verbal cues for mental illness assessment. However, the majority of the\nrecent works focus on depression, despite the evident difference between\ndepression symptoms and suicidal behavior and non-verbal cues. This paper\nreviews recent works that study suicide ideation and suicide behavior detection\nthrough audiovisual feature analysis, mainly suicidal voice/speech acoustic\nfeatures analysis and suicidal visual cues. Automatic suicide assessment is a\npromising research direction that is still in the early stages. Accordingly,\nthere is a lack of large datasets that can be used to train machine learning\nand deep learning models proven to be effective in other, similar tasks.\n</p>",
