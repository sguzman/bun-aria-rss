  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, the Democratic National Committee’s multimillion dollar lawsuit against President Trump, Russia, and Wikileaks is a stupid publicity stunt and it’s going to backfire. The DNC has opened themselves up for discovery and deposition. Trump and everyone named in the case should use this as an opportunity to defend themselves by going on offense. Also, James Comey has condemned himself by leaking memos to his lawschool friend because some of them contained classified info. His memos were written using government equipment and on government time; they are not personal under any stretch of federal law so for Comey to claim they are personal is absurd. We should be investigating Comey for stealing government property on top of leaking classified information. In addition, Trump has been set up since day 1 by Barack Obama, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, James Clapper, and everyone involved in the Steele dossier. If they all got away with it, where would we be today? The Democrat party has surrendered to the temptations of tyranny, trying to destroy American principles in order to advance Progressivism. Finally, Mark has been nominated for induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame and it’s because of the listeners launching Mark into the national radio spotlight that this is possible.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
