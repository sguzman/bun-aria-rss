Looks like Jen's friendship plans have just been foiled.</p><p class=\"\">Having sex in a porche sounds excruciating, and so does having <a href=\"https://flatsixes.com/porsche-culture/humor/man-caught-having-sex-with-a-porsche/\">sex with a porche</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanophilia\">WTF!</a>), but Men's Health Magazine to the rescue with this handy (lol) <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/trending-news/a19544515/best-cars-for-sex/\">list of best cars to have sex in</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/erotic-asphyxiation\">If you're interested in breath play, please do it safely</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/rip-tumblr-porn-we-hardly-knew-ye\">RIP Tumblr.</a> <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/life-love/sex-relationships/a25411577/tumblr-porn-ban/\">We miss you.</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/08/07/why-sex-work-should-be-decriminalized\">Decriminalize sex work.</a></p><p class=\"\">Maybe when we can go places again, <a href=\"https://trip101.com/article/airbnb-yurts-in-hawaii\">you might want to ren</a>t or <a href=\"https://www.yurtsofhawaii.com/\">buy a yurt in Hawaii.</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/dental-health/which-drinks-can-harm-your-teeth/\">Avoid those sugary drinks</a> for yourself and your kids. If you are in Chicago and looking for a dentist, Jen LOVES her dentist Dr. Deaver and Dr. Casimir at <a href=\"https://www.yourclassicsmiles.com/\">Classic Smiles on South Wabash</a>. And she really buried the lede and forgot to mention that Dr. Deaver is not only an amazing dentist, but <a href=\"https://www.yourclassicsmiles.com/staff.html\">he was President Obama's dentist</a>!</p><p class=\"\">Next time: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZGT5Cm\">A Kingdom of Dreams.</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.wordbookstores.com/SarahMacLean\">Preorder Daring and the Duke from WORD in Brooklyn</a> and you'll get a sweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FatedMates/status/1260588658312335361\">limited edition yellow Fated Mates sticker</a>.</p>",
