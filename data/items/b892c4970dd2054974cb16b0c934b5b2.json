    "media:description": "Denmark is planning to construct a $2.4 billion island off the coast of Copenhagen, called Lynetteholm, which will protect the city from rising sea levels while also providing new land for developments. Copenhagen, the largest city and capital of Denmark, has a very low elevation. Because of this, it is at risk from rising sea levels. In the future, it is feared that storm surges could flood the capital’s city streets. To solve this problem, Denmark is building Lynetteholm, a reclaimed island that will have housing for 35,000 people and new infrastructure developments. Despite its benefits, the island has gained opposition from protesters who fear its environmental repercussions and its impact on the residents of Copenhagen. Nevertheless, the project is advancing. On June 4th 2021, the Danish parliament approved the project. In the coming years, it is expected to rise from the harbor, serving as a grand new expansion of Copenhagen.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider subscribing for more great content in the future!\n\nThank you to the following sources!\n\nInformation\nhttps://www.e-architect.com/copenhagen/lynetteholm-new-copenhagen-harbour-island\nhttp://danishdesignreview.com/townscape/tag/Lynetteholm\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/copenhagen-s-island-building-plan-faces-new-test\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57348415\nhttps://www.dezeen.com/2021/06/07/artifical-island-lynetteholm-copenhagen-harbour/’\nhttps://www.kk.dk/lynetteholm\nhttps://www.ft.dk/samling/20201/almdel/tru/bilag/122/2320379.pdf\nhttps://arkitema.com/en/project/lynetteholm\n\nAudio\nStoryblocks\n\nGraphics\nStoryblocks\nGoogle Earth",
