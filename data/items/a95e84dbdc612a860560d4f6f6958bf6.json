  "description": "Most Americans don't give much thought to German politics--and that's a good thing given that when we once did it was because those politics were a disaster. But with the departure of Germany's chancellor of the past 16 years, Angela Merkel, it is time we did. Germany is not only a vital ally but thanks in large part to Merkel's leadership, it is a global leader of significance. What comes next in our relationship--especially as the US continues to prioritize its pivot to Asia. We discuss with Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Kori Schake of AEI and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center.
