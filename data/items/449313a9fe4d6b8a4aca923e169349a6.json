  "description": "<p>NFL Week 2 is in the books. Fastest 2 minutes. We recap every game from Sunday. Is Matt Patricia eating his losses? Mitch Trubisky has perfected the art of the duck. The Vikings suck and Josh Allen is incredible. Adam Gase somehow still has a job and we're now a Bud Dupree podcast. Matt Rhule is on dumb face watch and Justin Herbert makes his debut. Football guy of the week. Who's back of the week including NBA talk and Bronny James Jr smoking weed. Thats the whole show, no other sports were played this weekend.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
