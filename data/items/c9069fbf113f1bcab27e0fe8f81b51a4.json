  "description": "<p>In this paper we study a multiplier operator which is induced by the\nSchwarzian derivative of a univalent function with a qc extension to the\nextended complex plane. We obtain a norm estimate for this operator. As an\napplication, we prove that the Brennan's conjecture is true for a large class\nof quasi-disks. We also present a new characterization of the asymptotically\nconformal curves and the WP curves in terms of the multiplier operator.\n</p>",
