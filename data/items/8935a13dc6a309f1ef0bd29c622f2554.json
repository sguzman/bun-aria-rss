In this episode, Greg Olafson and Nishi Somaiya of Goldman Sachs' Securities Division discuss how alternative asset managers have filled that gap in Europe through direct lending to middle-market companies. \"This form of lending in Europe has evolved and has become an asset class in its own right, to the point where companies now have an option where they go [to raise capital],\" Somaiya says.\n\n\nThis podcast was recorded on March 6, 2019.\n\n\nThis podcast should not be copied, distributed, published or reproduced, in whole or in part.
