There, they observed the comet Mara and discovered an unknown but powerful energy called \"Omnium\". Tower of Fantasy was  built to capture Mara and harness “Omnium”, but an uncontrolled energy from “Omnium” led to a catastrophic disaster on their new homeworld.\n\nLearn More About Tower of Fantasy: https://www.toweroffantasy-global.com/\nHong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions: https://www.hotta.com.tw/ \nKorea: https://tof.pwrd.co.kr \n\nSubscribe to GeForce! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-g3eGJi1omSDSz48AML-g\n\nGeForce Twitter: https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce \nGeForce Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/NVIDIAGeForce/ \nGeForce Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/nvidiageforce/ \nGeForce Community Portal: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/community-portal/\n\n#TowerOfFantasy\n#RTXOn\n#DLSS2",
