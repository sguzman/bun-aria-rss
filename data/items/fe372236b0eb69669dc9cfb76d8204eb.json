  "description": "<p>While it’s now America’s favorite pastime, football was on the verge of extinction as soon as the game was forming around the 20th century. Severe injuries and even death were common in the early days of football as players used little or no protection and the rules of the game encouraged ruthless play.

Our guest today has written a book on how TR helped save football. His name is John Miller and his book is called The Big Scrum: How Teddy Roosevelt Saved Football.</p>\n",
