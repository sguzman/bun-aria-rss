  "description": "<p>r/Prorevenge OP owns a vacation home out in a tropical jungle, so he's often turns off power while he's not using the home. Copper thieves keep sneaking onto OP's property to steal his copper cables. OP eventually gets sick of it, so he installed a backup power system that will turn on in case the main power is cut. The thieves come back, turn off the main power, and then go to cut the copper cables thinking that the power is off... but the power is very much ON! The thieves electrocute themselves on the live wires!</p>\n",
