  "description": "The busiest portion of free agency is over and we have plenty of new faces in new places. With that comes an altered draft outlook for several teams and for our draft expert Ryan Wilson. This is the 6th Mock Draft Monday for us and looks different from any other. How did free agency impact the top? Well for one, the Giants probably won't be targeting a WR at #11 after inking Kenny Golladay to a 4-year deal over the weekend. We break down that signing (3:30), before diving into Ryan's latest Mock (12:15). He has the Panthers and 49ers each trading up 6 spots to select a quarterback.
