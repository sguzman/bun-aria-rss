  "description": "<p>In part two of this series on the six temptations of successful organizations, John Maxwell talks about four challenges common to leaders in successful organizations. He explains each pitfall and offers sound practices to counteract these temptations that have the power to derail our success. He reminds us that successful organizations today struggle to remain successful organizations tomorrow, and they require discipline to continue positive momentum.</p> <p>Mark Cole and Richard Chancy dive into the mix and highlight specific ways we can maintain excellence. They remind us that values and habits must stay the same even in our success, and we must become brilliant in the basics. The greatest threat to tomorrow’s success is today’s success, so we must be intentional and embrace change as growth. Mark ends the podcast with a reminder that a leader has a stewardship responsibility to lead well and not fall asleep at the wheel.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is The Six Temptations of Successful Organizations Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
