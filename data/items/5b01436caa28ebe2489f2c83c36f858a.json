  "description": "The US could be back in the Iran nuclear accord by the end of the month. There are plenty of hurdles to that, of course, but it is not impossible. And if not by then, then perhaps it will happen by Fall. We discuss why that is likely to be a good thing with the Quincy Institute's Joe Cirincione, the American Enterprise Institute's Kori Schake, and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School. We also discuss violence in Israel, the challenges the situation there poses for the Biden team and...the future of the Italian monarchy. Which is how we got to the Instagram discussion in the first place. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
