  "description": "When Hurricane Maria hit in 2017, it destroyed Puerto Rico’s power grid, leaving vast swathes of the island in the dark and claiming almost 3,000 lives. $9.5 billion was set aside to rejuvenate the island’s power grid and the government-run utility company was taken over by a private one. But five years later, before Hurricane Fiona even hit, the island lost electricity. How could this happen—again? \n\nGuest: Gloria Gonzalez is the Deputy Energy Editor at POLITICO\n\n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
