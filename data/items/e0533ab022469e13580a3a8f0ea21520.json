  "description": "<p>In the parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus teaches that love is what God built us to do, that love is the essence of what it means to be human. In this story, we see that real love doesn't begin until you see that you can't really love—it doesn't begin until you see you're a sinner saved by grace alone. We also see that real love begins when you're stunned into silence by the love of Christ for paying your debt. Once you've experienced and been humbled by that kind of love, then you're capable of concrete and costly love toward others.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on August 2, 2008. Series: The Parables of Jesus (1992). Scripture: Luke 10:25-37.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
