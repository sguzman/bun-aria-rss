  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Putin is now deciding what can and cannot be used on the battlefield. Specifically, regarding the MIG-29's the Pentagon says Ukraine doesn't need them because they won't be beneficial. Isn't it Ukraine that knows exactly what it needs and decides what's beneficial for their survival? Interestingly, when Trump was president, he was undermined by the Pentagon, by the FBI, and these same characters are covering for Biden's interference in the transfer of older U.S fighter jets to Poland so that Poland could donate MIG-29 jets to Ukraine. This program suspected that it was Biden that sabotaged this and today we know that he did. Then, World War III has begun, and the question is whether or not we can contain it and truncate it quickly. Will we use the deterrence of 'peace through strength' or continue to display weakness? Putin has created an axis of global states in alignment against the United States and with nuclear weapons pointed at our country. All who claim to be 'America First' and want to leave Ukraine alone are doing a grave disservice to the future of our nation's national security. Later, Israeli Prime Minister Neftali Bennett says that Ukrainian President Zelensky should resign and surrender. Bennett should look at his own cemeteries filled with patriots who stood up to Israel's enemies. Bennett is an embarrassment! Afterward, Seth Lipsky Editor of the New York Sun newspaper calls in to discuss developments of one of the few constitutionally focused publications in the country. Finally, Pennsylvania Attorney Dave McCormick joins the program with an update on his campaign for the US Senate. McCormick added that if Pennsylvania were a country, it would be the 4th largest producer of natural gas in the world. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
