  "description": "It's a bronzed day here on Off The Podium as we get excited for another medal for Australia and a day we can officially say we beat Canada in! So disappointed are Canada with their lack of medals that they apparently didn't want to be represented on this episode which means more love for Australia! It also means more hate for Channel 7 and how bad their coverage is, more love for doubles luge, more love for Nordic combined and more love for what could quite possibly be 'Chumpy day' when we next do this episode. So get listening and get on top of your best friend and sled your way through a bronzed episode!",
