  "description": "We are all witnesses this week as the Core Horseman tap into greatness always in all ways. Naturally, we’re celebrating both Chuck and his close personal professional athlete friend LeBron James’ championships—which are obviously equally impressive—and finally putting a bow on the 24 in 24 saga once and for all. Then, we’re onto some of Throwing Fits’ patented unusable recon, covering what to wear, listen to and watch in the triumphant return of a boyz only edition of “Fuck With/Not Fuck With (Working Title)”.\n \nFor more Throwing Fits, check us out on Patreon: www.patreon.com/throwingfits\n",
