But they have a few things in common: inspiring teachers, engaged students and a safe space to learn.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"8sj06\">Over the last few years, spurred by COVID-19, millions of new users have come online to collaborate, create and learn. Because we support millions of education users every day, we think a lot about creating safe, digital-learning environments. It's only when users are safe online that learning can begin. It’s why our products are safe and secure by design, and why we continue to invest in this area.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"8sj06\">We commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct a Total Economic Impact study around Google Workspace for Education Plus, our most comprehensive edition of Google Workspace for Education. The study took a look at the security, administrative benefits and cost savings associated with it, and this is what it found: Education Plus helps reduce cyber threats, and the time to remediate them, for educational institutions worldwide.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"8sj06\">Additionally, Forrester found organizations using Education Plus were more efficient in administration, and eliminated the need to invest in other education technology providers.
