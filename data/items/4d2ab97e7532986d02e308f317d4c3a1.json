  "description": "<p>C&B honor the founding father of conservative talk radio on the one-year anniversary of Rush's passing. Buck says he's in talk radio due to Rush and his values, and Clay reiterates that no one can fill Rush's shoes, but they will try to fill one each and continue Rush's battles. Sociopath Fauci says unmasking kids is too risky. Rush on liberals: Leftists take away freedom in big gulps. Kathryn Limbaugh joins Clay and Buck to tell us how she's doing after a very difficult year, Rush's legacy and how we can all continue to carry out Rush's mission. Clay wonders how the loving couple met (we hear Rush's touching tribute to Kathryn in his own words) and Kathryn tells the delightful and deep story.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
