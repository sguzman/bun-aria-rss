  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane emerged victorious from the first ever Kirk Minihane Show Tennis Championship, and it wasn't even close. Kirk and the fellas recap the absolutely demoralizing defeat of Steve Robinson. Plus, a little bad play-by-play thanks to the meth addict Dave Cullinane found to call the match. Midshow activity on the KMS twitter account provokes suspicions of professional sandwich eater and one-time Minifan MHB. Has he gone over to the dark side? The KMS auction to benefit the Baldera family went live last night, and Minihane has a sneaking suspicion that the show is headed to Colorado. Several big announcements in today's show, including and announcement about an announcement that will be announced next week.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
