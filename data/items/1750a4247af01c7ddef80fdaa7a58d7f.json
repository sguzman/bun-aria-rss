  "description": "<p><p>Snooki (2:15:30) and her co-host Joey Camasta stop by to talk about Jersey Shore, getting punched in the head, Vinny & Pauly on Double Shot at Love, her appearance at Wrestlemania, and why it's hard to learn Spanish even if you were born in Chile. Rude Jude (1:30:45) comes by to talk GHB, weed, Action Bronson, and who he'd fight at Rough N Rowdy. Feits and KFC breakdown the Tampa Bay Lighting loss and other epic collapses, then play The Office with suggestions from Nate (beer vendors), Kmarko (Maslowe's Hierarchy), Hubbs (Chris Sale) and Super Producer BC (Flat Earth). Voicemails include: metabolism vs tolerance, school girl fetish, and cry boners.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
