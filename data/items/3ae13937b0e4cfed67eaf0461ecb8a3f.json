I am so pleased to bring you this discussion with a gem of a human being and a formative figure to mine (and many others) upbringing within punk/hardcore, Milo Auckerman from <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1FGH4Bh7g9W6V4fUcKZWp5?si=w27ONduiSz6aZoovYAwEjg\">Descendents</a>. We discuss science, ego and of course the optimal amount of coffee to drink in a day. We also peel back the story of how they ended up in the cult classic film, \"Pump Up The Volume\" with Christian Slater. Thanks to all listening and supporting! This podcast has changed my life and I am so appreciative of it. Viva DIY music!&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
