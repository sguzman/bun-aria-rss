  "description": "For this Cyberwire-X episode, we are talking about the failure of perimeter defense as an architecture where, since the 1990s when it was invented, the plan was to keep everything out. That model never really worked that well since we had to poke holes in the perimeter to allow employees, contractors, and partners to do legitimate business with us. Those same holes could be exploited by the bad guys, too. The question is, what are we doing instead? What is the security architecture, the strategy, and the tactics that we are all using today that is more secure than perimeter defense? In the first part of the show, Rick Howard, the CyberWire’s CSO, Chief Analyst, and Senior Fellow, talks with Jerry Archer, the Sallie Mae CSO and CyberWire Hash Table member, and, in the second half of the show, the CyberWire's podcast host Dave Bittner talks with Mike Ernst, episode sponsor ExtraHop’s Vice President of Sales Engineering, to discuss Software Defined Perimeter and intrusion kill chain prevention strategy.",
