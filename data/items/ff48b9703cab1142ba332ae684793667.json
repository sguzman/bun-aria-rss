  "description": "<p>You can&rsquo;t escape summer! Whether you&rsquo;re baking under the sun at your local pool on the weekends, or setting off on adventures with your kids during their summer break, the changing season and warmer temperatures signal that it&rsquo;s summer break. Just like summer impacts basically everyone, so does the price of a gallon of gas increasing at a previously unseen rate. Even electric vehicle owners aren&rsquo;t immune to the rising prices- though there&rsquo;s gotta be a palpable sense of relief every time you plug your car in! The US crossed the $5 a gallon threshold a couple weeks ago and who knows where the prices are headed from here?! But we&rsquo;ll talk about why gas prices are unrelenting right now, we&rsquo;ll share some of our thoughts on fossil fuels in general, and then we&rsquo;ll the majority of this episode talking through the many steps you can take to lessen the pain you&rsquo;re experiencing at the pump.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Really Big Bird by Trillium- a huge thanks to Sean for sending this one our way!
