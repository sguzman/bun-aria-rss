  "description": "<p>EPISODE 88 - SEAMUS MCGARVEY - Cinematographer</p> <p>Team Deakins has a fun conversation with cinematographer Seamus McGarvey (ATONEMENT, ANNA KARENINA, NOCTURNAL ANIMALS, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN). He shares what he loves about filmmaking - the collaboration, the democracy of ideas that grow stronger as you define, and how the medium of film is a great medium for social exchange and political change. He talks about the differences of working with varying directors - such as Les Blair, Michael Winterbottom, Sam Taylor Johnson, Tom Ford, Oliver Stone, and Joe Wright. He likes the terror of not working with a locked-in storyboard or shot list! We even get into the experience of shooting television and learn what he likes and what he doesn’t like. We cover a lot of ground in this episode and, since it’s Seamus, we shared a lot of laughs along the way!</p>",
