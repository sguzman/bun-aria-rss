  "title": "Michael J. Turner” Radicalism and Reputation: The Career of Bronterre O’Brien” (Michigan State UP, 2017)",
  "description": "From humble beginnings James Bronterre O’Brien became one of the leading figures in British radical politics in the first half of the 19th century, thanks in no small measure to his skills as a journalist and writer. In Radicalism and Reputation: The Career of Bronterre O’Brien (Michigan State University Press, 2017), Michael J. Turner examines O’Brien’s ideas and his place in the milieu of the politics of his day. Born in Ireland, the young James O’Brien was a fortunate beneficiary of a progressive education and studied for a career in the law. Yet O’Brien was soon drawn into a career as a journalist, where, adopting the pen name Bronterre, he advocated for the radical causes of his day. This culminated in O’Brien’s involvement in the pioneering Chartist movement, which failed to pressure Parliament to undertake reforms but paved the way for the modern democratic system that exists in Britain today.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
