  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys overreact to everything that happened during week 15 of the NFL season including the Jets getting their first win, and potentially setting their franchise back 10+ years with losing out on the first pick (potentially), who looks good going into the playoffs, why the Chiefs are so good, Drew Brees being a little rusty, and much more. Joining the show is friend of the program, 13 year NFL veteran at QB, co-host of NFL Live on ESPN, Dan Orlovsky to chat about what the Eagles are going to do with Carson Wentz, if anyone can beat the Chiefs, if the Saints are better off with Taysom Hill or Jameis Winston, what the Jets are going to do if they don't get the first pick, Josh Allen and the Bills being a legit contender, and who he likes in the NFC (23:29-46:20). Next, 3x Super Bowl Champion, former GM of the Cleveland Browns and special assistant to the coaching staff for the New England Patriots, author, co-host of HammerDAHN, host of the GM Shuffle Pod and The Daily Coach, Mike Lombardi joins the program to give all his takeaways from week 15 in the NFL and his thoughts on some of the open jobs around the league (47:53-1:14:42). Later, ESPN NFL Insider Field Yates joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about everything happening around the NFL, the Carson Wentz/Jalen Hurts situation, potential coaching changes, and anything else he's hearing around the league (1:14:44-1:31:27). Plus Pat and AJ chat about the weekend that was in the NFL, and look ahead to tonight's Monday Night Football game between the Steelers and Bengals.
