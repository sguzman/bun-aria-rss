  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, joins the show. Trump said he never imagined that America would retreat from Afghanistan the way they did. Trump reiterated how the conditions-based deal had fail-safes in place to ensure peace was maintained and when there were violations the U.S would use strategic bombings to respond. Trump was clear that he would never leave any Americans behind in Afghanistan and expressed regret for the loss of 13 members of the U.S military and 170 Afghans. Trump said that parents of slain soldiers know that their child would be alive if we didn't have rigged elections. On the border, Trump said the wall was a great idea and was nearly complete after winning 11 court challenges. Trump added that this is Biden's sheer incompetence because Democrats cheat in elections, so they don't need to flood the country with immigrants. On running in 2024 Trump said, he wasn't sure because Wokeism is for losers and the Democrats are unbelievably good at cheating in elections and that his administration exposed that as he underscored the need for election reform. Then, the media will create straw men to twist people's words just like they will attack Trump for saying that Robert E. Lee was an effective military officer, despite not supporting the confederacy. Yet, the left never calls for the toppling of statues of Karl Marx, I wonder why? The disdain for history is always one-sided, as it often is when Marxists are rewriting it. The left calls for counting every vote, even those that are not legally eligible to vote. That's illegal! Later, the Democrat Party doesn't fit into the system that the founders created. Biden's push for electric cars only hurts the country. The country is run by dolts and now Psaki is saying that the US must rely on the Taliban to rescue our citizens that are being held on the airplanes. Afterward, Larry Elder was accosted in Venice Beach and when his campaign staff tried to intervene they were physically assaulted by the hecklers. Another Californian, Nancy Pelosi is embracing AOC's desire to gut the capitalist system with paid family leave. Finally, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich calls in to discuss his Senate run in Arizona. Brnovich also added that Arizona has argued for their state senate's election integrity measures in front of the US Supreme Court.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
