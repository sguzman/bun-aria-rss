  "description": "You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to understand the struggles of growing up in South Central, Los Angeles. Olympia Lepoint was stabbed in the face by a young gang member and at times ate only ice because her family could not afford food. Though she failed every level of high school math, her insane work ethic landed her in the top five of her college class --with a degree in mathematics. Her struggle continued as a woman of color in a male-dominated world. Despite facing hazing and discrimination on every hand, she found a way to leverage her talent and drive to become an award-winning rocket scientist who helped NASA launch 28 space missions. Meet the woman that People Magazine named the modern day Hidden Figure in this thought-provoking episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu.
