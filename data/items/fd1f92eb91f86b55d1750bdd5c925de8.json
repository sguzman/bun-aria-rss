We experience external stressors from our jobs, family responsibilities, financial worries, and many other places, then compound them with unhealthy lifestyle choices. The result is an epidemic of stress and increased risk for chronic diseases. Most of us know that things such as eating well, getting quality sleep, exercise, and mediation are all effective ways to reduce and manage stress, but the value of pursuing the things that make us happy and fulfilled is a less commonly cited way to reduce stress.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Late last year, Dr. Hyman sat down with Dr. Rangan Chatterjee to discuss how making time for the things that bring us joy gives us more resilience against stress and fatigue and an improved psychological outlook. They also share practical solutions and simple interventions to help you destress and reset your life, and how implementing small changes to your routine can reduce or completely eradicate stress.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Rangan Chatterjee is regarded as one of the most influential doctors in the UK and wants to change how medicine will be practiced for years to come. He hosts the biggest health podcast in Europe, Feel Better, Live More, which Apple has announced as one of the most downloaded new podcasts of the past year. His first book, How to Make Disease Disappear, is an international bestseller all over the world and has sold over 250,000 copies worldwide in just 18 months. His most recent book, the #1 bestseller, The Stress Solution, tackles what the WHO calls the health epidemic of our time—stress. Dr. Chatterjee is known for finding the root cause of people's health problems, and he has highlighted his methods in the ground-breaking BBC television show, Doctor in the House, which has been shown in over 70 countries around the world.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Find My Formula, the world’s first personalized nootropics company.
