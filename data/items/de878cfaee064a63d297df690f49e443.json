  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin show, The media in America claim that the 1st amendment is under attack and it is, by the very people who earn their living as journalists and reporters. They are destroying freedom of the press and they decided that the only way they can survive in competition is to take sides with the Democrat party. When President Trump calls out reporters they say it’s an attack on free speech. But it’s OK for the media to go on and on about a mental illness they say Trump has? What’s the purpose of freedom of the press? To give liberals platforms to spew their hate? Also, you don’t need to abandon conservatism in order to defend Trump. You can disagree strongly with him on things like immigration or tariffs. There’s no reason to abandon liberty or capitalism; you’re not disloyal to Trump if you are loyal to your principles. Later, the house intelligence committee found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Yet, the media is still on the prowl, trying to connect Trump and his administration to anything they possibly can to bring up wrongdoing. The America people have been subjected to the biggest hoax in history with this investigation. We still must have a special counsel to investigate the FBI, DOJ and the intelligence agencies so the country is never put through this again. Finally, the real problem isn’t that China is dumping steel, the real problem is that they are stealing our technology, which is a true national security issue. This is what we should be focusing on - not driving up costs for consumers with tariffs.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
