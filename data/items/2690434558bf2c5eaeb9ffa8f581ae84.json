On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, while Katie takes a short break, special guest host Alison Roman (chef, cookbook author, “Dining In,” “Nothing Fancy”) steps in to talk with Gillian about the awkward intimacy of photographing her family and how the lessons of Gillian’s personal story transcend the specifics of her “live out loud” relatives.
