  "description": "<p>The term “superfood” has been used more and more loosely as the years have gone by. It’s sort of like when a really skinny guys who doesn’t workout has abs… and you’re like, “Nah, that doesn’t really count. Put your shirt back on and stop flexing.” Well, at least that’s what I would have told my 12-year old self...</p> <p>Superfoods are not the run-of-the-mill foods that you see everyday. These are foods that have rare nutrients, or concentrations of nutrients, or a completeness of nutrients that are rarely seen in nature. Broccoli is like abs on Justin Bieber. Real superfoods (like you’re about to learn about today) are like abs on Arnold Schwarzenegger. They are totally in a different league (and no disrespect to broccoli!).</p> <p>You’re about so get the inside scoop on foods that are clinically proven to destroy cancer cells, foods that can regenerate and heal your ligaments, tendons, and bones, and even foods that can upgrade your entire immune system.
