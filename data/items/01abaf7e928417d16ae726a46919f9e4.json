  "description": "Glenn plays the latest hit Christmas song, “It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Venezuela.” Glenn and Stu discuss the forcing of the vaccine as Americans are rightfully concerned about their individual freedoms. Pat Gray joins to discuss the pandemic, vaccine propaganda, and the TV show \"Yellowstone.\" Glenn and Stu discuss Facebook’s fact-checking system being nothing more than opinions, as Twitter doubles down on censoring its users. Glenn’s COVID special was “fact-checked,” so Glenn goes through the government’s co-ownership of the vaccine. Lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, representing John Stossel, joins to discuss John’s lawsuit against Facebook for using its fact-checking opinion service to harm his credibility.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
