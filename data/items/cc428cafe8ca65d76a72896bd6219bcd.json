  "description": "<p>***We are pumped to start releasing an additional episode every week that we’re calling our money pro episode, or $Pro for short! Every Monday we’ll hear from a $Pro as they discuss a topic that they’re passionate and knowledgeable about, and then we unpack it even further and discuss the impact that topic has on our financial lives.***</p><p>Too often in life it’s like we’re sleepwalking- as if we’re drifting through life without any clear guiding principles. Due to that, our day-to-day is filled with different people, companies/advertising, and events having more sway over our lives and money than we do. Scott Rieckens is here to change that with his approach to creating a personal mission statement and to remind us to proactively take control and start directing our own future! This is a topic that is near and dear to his heart. After realizing that his growing family was in a state of overconsumption, he and his wife re-assessed their family’s priorities which then led them to cancel their boat club membership, sell their BMW, and move away from pricey Coronado, CA. They didn’t <strong><em>have</em></strong> to do any of this, but they <strong><em>chose</em></strong> to do all of this after creating a personal mission statement! Listen as we break it down and go through how you can create your own mission statement- plus we share our personal mission statements as well.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Cold Mountain by Highland Brewing which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. A big thanks to our friends Clark and Nanci in Asheville for donating this delicious beer! And if you enjoyed this episode, be sure to subscribe and give us a quick review in Apple Podcasts, Castbox, or wherever you get your podcasts- we’d love to hear from you.</p><p>Best friends out!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
