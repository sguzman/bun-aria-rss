  "description": "<p>David Goggins is a retired Navy Seal and an ultra marathon runner.  He is a super inspiring person that has an amazing story of success over adversity. David was hugely over weight and lost it all to join the Air Force and eventually became one of the baddest Navy Seals ever. His story is always amazing to listen to and his new book “You Can’t Hurt Me” has become a massive success.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>                                                                       </p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
