  "description": "This week Johnny welcomes his two-time co-winner Derrick Kosinski to the show to talk about the conflicts and blunders in Episode 9. First, they dig into the implosion of the veteran alliance with Cory taking the heat from other vets for rallying the rookies together, as well as the many, many strategic mistakes Cory made in protecting his new alliance (0:35). They get into the best daily challenge so far this season, in which the contestants had to retrieve balls from a mud pit and, shockingly, there were no bombs to diffuse (32:30). Then they discuss all the conversations that happened in the house after the daily challenge (38:35), the ugly fight between Ashley and Cory in nominations and the history behind that conflict (46:04), the tricky elimination challenge (54:30), and the surprise twist at the end (1:00:40). \nHost: Johnny Bananas\nGuest: Derrick Kosinski\nAssociate Producer: Sasha Ashall\nAdditional Production: Juliet Litman\nLearn more about your ad choices.
