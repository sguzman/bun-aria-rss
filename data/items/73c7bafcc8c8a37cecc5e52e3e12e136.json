  "description": "Donald Trump has wrapped himself so tightly in the flag he could be America’s first July 4th mummy but while his true colors may be red white and blue it increasingly appears they may look more like the Russian flag than Old Glory.  First, he showed this when at a school appearance he was unable to color in a flag properly.  Next, despite all his attack on NFL-ers for disrespecting the flag, he broke the law to keep the flag over the White House flying at full-staff despite the death of beloved hero Senator John McCain.  Our experts David Sanger of the New York Times, Evelyn Farkas of the Atlantic Council and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University discuss McCain, Trump, patriotism, hypocrisy and coloring inside the lines.
