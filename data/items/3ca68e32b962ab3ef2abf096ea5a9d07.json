  "description": "Throughout the winter of 2013/14 protesters built barricades and camped out in the centre of Kyiv demanding change.  The focus was the Maidan, Kyiv's central Square of Independence. The demonstrators wanted the government of Viktor Yanukovych to move politically towards the EU and away from Russia, but when he refused to sign an agreement with the EU tensions spilled over.  In February government forces, and snipers, shot dead 103 protesters and injured many others.  Shortly afterwards President Yanukovych fled Ukraine and went to Russia.  Elvira Bulat was a businesswoman from Crimea when the protests began.  She tells Rebecca Kesby why she packed up her business, to spend that snowy winter in the barricades of the Maidan, and why she still believes Ukraine belongs in Europe.\n\nPhoto: Kyiv, Ukraine - December 9th 2013.
