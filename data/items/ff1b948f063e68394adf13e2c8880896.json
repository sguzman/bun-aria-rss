  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up in the Bible Belt of West Virginia, Kris Whitehead developed a mindset that he had to be a certain way. It wasn’t until, at the age of 20, he read the book The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck that he began to look at his spiritual growth in a new light. The book goes through the 4 levels of faith, agnosticism, atheism, institutionalism, and mysticism. Kris believes it’s important for people to go through some sort of institutionalism for their faith, but if they stay in that place, they’ll never have a deeper relationship with their higher power. Kris admits that he was stuck in his own head, worried about his looks and how people perceived him.  He wanted to be free of that so badly and was led to a corporate job. But as he looked down the road, he saw his successors working 6-7 days a week with a plastic smile. Kris knew that wasn’t for him, and so he opened up the Yellow Pages and started cold calling people, looking for lawns to mow.  He figured he’d rather make $3/hour working for himself than $30/hour working for someone else.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For anyone looking to get deeper in touch with themselves, Kris recommends the book Stealing Fire by Steven Kotler and Jamie Wheal. The book discusses ways to enter what is known as a flow state. While our conscious mind can translate 120 bits of information per minute, the unconscious mind can translate billions. Tapping into this unconscious flow state can help you do what you need to do faster and with more ease. Some of the methods for achieving this may be unconventional, but Kris says if you want to be elite, you have to be willing to ask the questions without preconceived notions.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How to grow in your faith.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How to achieve harmony in your life.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What the key to happiness is.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">And much more!!</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not about how much success you have, it’s are you fully who you are.” -Kris Whitehead</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to Connect With Kris:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.kriswhitehead.com\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Personal Website</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.iconicalliance.com\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Iconic Alliance</span></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/kris_whitehead_official/?hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Instagram</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thekriswhitehead\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook</span></a></p> <p><br /> <br /> <br /></p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get podcasting help</span> <a href=\"https://podcastpowertrain.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to grow your business</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><br /> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!
