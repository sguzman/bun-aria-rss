  "description": "<p>Week 7 is here and we watch the end of the Giants/Eagles game live. Daniel Jones with an all time hilarious run and face plant (2:27 - 14:19). Week 7 picks and games we're looking forward to including the Contender Bowl between the Titans and Steelers, and a Seahawks game that will undoubtedly get weird (14:19 - 35:10) . Cant Lose Parlay and Fantasy Fuccbois (35:10 - 44:52). Tom Fornelli joins the show to preview the B1G coming back, what teams can win the conference, and best bet of the weekend (44:52 - 75:57). Our lawyer Mike Portnoy joins the show to talk Jeffrey Toobin, being addicted to chasing the local news, the IRS not letting him hassle other people and more (75:57 - 102:56). We finish the show with Fyre Fest of the Week.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
