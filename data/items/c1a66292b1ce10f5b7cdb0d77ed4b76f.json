  "title": "Ep 264 | When Phil Met Steven Tyler, Willie's Diet Competition, and Churches and Gender Pronouns",
  "description": "Phil rocks out to Alice Cooper, and he and Al remember the time Aerosmith's Steven Tyler approached them in a hotel lobby. Jase has another close encounter of the convenience store kind when someone yells at him to put a mask on. He also has a run-in with a couple of guys who don't take kindly to his kind at the golf course. Al and Jase tell the story of how competitive (and MEAN) Willie got when he made a weight-loss bet. Phil reveals what helped his faith more than anything, and it never would have happened without \"Duck Dynasty.\" Al talks about engaging on gender pronouns and other cultural issues when even churches try to muzzle us. And the guys discuss spiritual decapitation, whether or not it's biblical for women to be ambassadors of the church, and stuffy church rules that burn bridges instead of bringing people closer to Jesus.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
