  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin show, the way that Roger Stone was treated as he was arrested today was unusually aggressive and wrong! We see some aspects of our history repeating itself, just as critical pamphleteers strongly opposed the president during the conflict between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson prior to the Jay Treaty in 1795 \"In the ideology of the new republic no danger was greater than the corruption of foreign influence.\" At the time it was believed that British interests were involved in treaty negotiations. Despite all of Robert Mueller’s interviews and arrests, for unrelated process crimes, he still has no proof of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.  The goal of Trump's opposition has always been to destroy him, his policies, and his presidency.  Also, CNN's \"nose for news\" smells more like a leak than muckraking. The DOJ needs to initiate a leak investigation into why CNN was at Stone's house before the FBI even arrived because their explanation is weak and nonsensical. Then, Fox News Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge  calls in to discuss how the Stone arrest was handled and how rarely congressional testimony has been used as the basis for a grand jury indictment and other irregularities. Later, President Trump's problem with the border wall is that Republicans in the Senate are falling off the Trump Train. If his own team won’t stand with him in this fight it’s going to be tough. We need to stand with the President and give him three more weeks and see what they come up with - we’re not done yet. But we must stand against amnesty, otherwise we’re out!\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
