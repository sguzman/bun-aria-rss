  "title": "Debbie Felton, \"Monsters and Monarchs: Serial Killers in Classical Myth and History\" (U Texas Press, 2021)",
  "description": "Even if the term \"Serial Killer\" wasn’t coined until the end of the 20th century, the practice of multiple murder has followed humanity through the ages. In Monsters and Monarchs: Serial Killers in Classical Myth and History (U Texas Press, 2021), professor Debbie Felton digs deep into the sources to demonstrate instances of what we might recognize as serial killers in antiquity, from myth to Imperial Rome to rhetorical exercises and maybe even on our small screens at home. Tracing these gruesome lineages, she exposes examples of these “types” of criminals through history, including more recognizable names like Jack the Ripper and Jeffrey Dahmer. What is mirrored are the characteristics we recognize as multiple homicidal psychopathy within ancient history and myth. This book is a complex and fascinating interweave of classical myth, ancient history, and true crime as manifesting in both our modern imaginations and those of generations past.\nLiz Barrett is a History PhD student Lehigh University, a CSA Farmer, mother of 3, and veteran of the USMC. She lives in suburban Philadelphia where she reads and writes a lot, and really, really likes old stuff. On Twitter: @lizcantlose.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
