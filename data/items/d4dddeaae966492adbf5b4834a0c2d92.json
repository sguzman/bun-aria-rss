  "description": "*In 1984 in Fort Myers, Florida, my mom's sister went missing after she planned to break up with her boyfriend. She wrote a letter to her parents while they were on vacation regarding her fears towards him, so they knew something was wrong when they returned home and she was nowhere to be found. Years later, he went on to murder more women- but her body has never been discovered. He’s known to have told people that the police would never find her. And upon his last questioning regarding her, he laughed and spit in the detectives face without saying a word. This is the disappearance of Carol Woolsoncroft.* *BONUS EPISODES:* patreon.com/goingwestpodcast Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy & Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
