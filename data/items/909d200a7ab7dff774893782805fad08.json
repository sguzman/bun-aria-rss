  "description": "<p>Seans of the world, unite! Shawns and Shauns, go get your own club! This episode is for those of us who spell it the Irish (correct) way. Friends are important, now more than ever, and this week&rsquo;s guest is a good one (both a friend and an episode). It&rsquo;s Sean Donnelly! He&rsquo;s got his own show on SiriusXM and is a stalwart of the NYC comedy scene. We&rsquo;ve known each other since 2007, so there is a lot to discuss here. We bounce around from BBQ to bar fights. Here are five words to describe this episode: when in doubt, act crazy.</p>",
