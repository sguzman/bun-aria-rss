  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, President Trump has been hitting it out of the park on the coronavirus and explaining the duty of federal law enforcement in the field to protect citizens and federal property. The mainstream press is working to create a \"surge\" when it's really a media-created myth. Their main goal is to make it appear that Trump is a disaster and that he must be defeated, but the \"surge\" numbers are compounded and no records are being broken. Later, Dr. Simone Gold calls in to explain how Democrat Governor's in coronavirus hot spots have limited the use of Hydroxychloroquine in the China virus era. Gold added that there is no reason to limit such a safe and effective treatment other than potential financial considerations from pharmaceutical companies. Meanwhile, filmmaker Ami Horowitz calls in to give a live update from Portland, OR. Horowitz described the violence and skirmishes with ANTIFA as worse than is being reported. Afterward, Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, Ken Cuccinelli joins the show to explain that the Federal Protective Service Officers will continue protecting federal property and preventing the building from being burned.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
