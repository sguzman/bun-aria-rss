  "description": "The media sells fear to get clicks... And that makes it difficult to sift through the noise and find the truth. I run through a few recent headlines designed to scare the hell out of you… a potential U.S. debt default, China fears, and inflation. [0:30] But amid the fearmongering and government recklessness… bitcoin is poised to benefit. We’re still in the early stages of this incredible industry… I expect other countries to follow in El Salvador’s footsteps and recognize bitcoin as a legal tender. And 3 new trends within the digital asset space are particularly disrupting Wall Street... [7:30] I have a fun exercise for you: Next time you’re at Starbucks, pay with bitcoin. You’ll see how easy and cheap it is and why mass adoption is a matter of “when,” not “if.” [16:45] Cryptocurrencies are the best risk/reward opportunity for individual investors… I explain why you need exposure to this asset class right away.
