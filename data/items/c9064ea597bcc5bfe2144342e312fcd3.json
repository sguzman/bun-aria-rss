  "description": "<p>In this 100th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>In this episode we discuss consensus, forced consensus, and the manufacture of consensus. We discuss medical misinformation, censorship, and freedom of speech (and freedom to listen). We also discuss how Australia is approaching vaccines and exposure to Covid. We talk a bit about one hundred years of the culture war, and the use of the props of science to drive change. We pick up a couple items from This Week in The Absurd and Appalling: Teen Vogue jumps another shark, and a pumpkin parade is cancelled. Also: how to find the sea lion on your car, and what to do about it once you’ve found it.<br/><br/>Get your Goliath shirts right here: store.darkhorsepodcast.org<br/><br/>Heather’s newsletter, Natural Selections (subscribe to get free weekly essays in your inbox): https://naturalselections.substack.com<br/><br/>Support the sponsors of this show:<br/><br/>Vivo Barefoot: Shoes for healthy feet—comfortable and regenerative, enhances stability and tactile feedback.
