  "description": "<p>There are so many angles we need to look at with gut health and they can tell us an amazing amount of information about the rest of the body. Our gut bacteria regulate many of our bodily functions, from creating vitamins to controlling our immune system, our brain function and of course, our metabolism and weight. They are critical to our long-term health. In this mini-episode Dr. Hyman explores the role of the gut microbiome and how best to feed it with his colleagues at The UltraWellness Center. Dr. Todd LePine, Dr. George Papanicolaou, and Dr. Elizabeth Boham.</p><br><p>Dr. Todd LePine graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, specializing in Integrative Functional Medicine.

Dr. LePine’s goal is to help patients achieve vitality through focusing on optimal aging, bio-detoxification, functional gastrointestinal health, systemic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and the neurobiology of mood and cognitive disorders.</p><br><p>Dr. George Papanicolaou is a graduate of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and is Board Certified in Family Medicine from Abington Memorial Hospital. Over time as the healthcare system made it harder for patients to receive personal care, Dr. Papanicolaou decided a change was needed.
