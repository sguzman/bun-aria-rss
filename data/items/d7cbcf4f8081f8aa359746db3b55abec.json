  "description": "Author Ladee Hubbard's new collection of short stories, The <em>Last Suspicious Holdout</em>, all take place in a nameless, majority Black suburb in the 90s and early 2000s. The stories all connect and intertwine with each other over time; telling the story of this community. Hubbard told NPR's Juana Summers that she was \"interested in people that keep going, that survive hardships and find a way to keep believing and working towards things getting better\" and those transformations were emblematic of the community as a whole.",
