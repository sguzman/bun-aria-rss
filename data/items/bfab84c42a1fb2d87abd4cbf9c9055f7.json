I&#8217;m even more excited now I&#8217;ve had a chance to play with it, the accuracy is extremely impressive, especially as it&#8217;s multi-language. OpenAI have done a great job packaging it, you can install it straight from pip if you&#8217;re a Linux shell user, but I wanted to find a way to let anybody try it for themselves from a web browser, even if they&#8217;re not developers. <a href=\"https://petewarden.com/2022/09/20/how-to-build-raspberry-pi-pico-programs-with-no-software-installation/\">I love Google&#8217;s Colab service</a>, and luckily somebody had already created <a href=\"https://github.com/amrrs/openai-whisper-webapp\">a notebook</a> showing the basics of using the Whisper model. I added some documentation and test files, and now you can give it a try for yourself by opening <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/petewarden/openai-whisper-webapp/blob/main/OpenAI_Whisper_ASR_Demo.ipynb\">this Colab link</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/petewarden/openai-whisper-webapp/blob/main/OpenAI_Whisper_ASR_Demo.ipynb\">https://colab.research.google.com/github/petewarden/openai-whisper-webapp/blob/main/OpenAI_Whisper_ASR_Demo.ipynb</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow the directions, and after a minute or so you&#8217;ll see a button at the bottom of the page where you can record your own audio, and see a transcript. Give it a try, I think you&#8217;ll be impressed too!</p>\n",
