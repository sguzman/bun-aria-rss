  "description": "“When I see these perfect pantries, I’m like… ‘This isn’t how real people live,’” laughs Deb Perelman. “This is a real-life overstuffed kitchen.” Deb is the cook, writer, and photographer behind the much-loved Smitten Kitchen blog and the two companion cookbooks. Tune in to hear what this down-to-earth personality is up to and why she’s loving things cooked low and slow right now, from sweet potatoes to broccoli, why she’s not baking sourdough bread, and why you can never go wrong with Rice Krispie Treats (especially when they’re made with browned butter). \n\nPlus, Chicago-based vegan chef Sam Spoll tells us why she thinks Tanya Lozano, founder of Healthy Hood Chicago, is the Bombe!\n\nThank you to our sponsors for supporting today’s episode: The wines of Rioja and, our newest sponsor, Red Clay Hot Sauce. You folks are the Bombe!",
