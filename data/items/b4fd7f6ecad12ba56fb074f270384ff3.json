First, Anna and Allison reminisce on the time they photo-bombed a group portrait celebrating TV writer Chuck Lorre (4:38). Then, Allison reveals the most stressful part of awards season (6:45) and Cherry, from BWT, makes a cameo to interview Allison on the red carpet (9:00). Next, Anna and Sim do a few rounds of dealbreakers - first, with the cast of Paramount Network’s “Heathers” (19:50) and then with Allison (36:04). After that, Sim and Allison battle it out in a game called “Who Knows Anna Faris Best?” (46:00) before calling Sophie, whose boyfriend’s mom dislikes her because she doesn’t come from money (1:02:35). The episode ends with a sweet moment between Anna and Allison and a duet of “Take Me Back to Manhattan” that you won’t want to miss (1:22:00).
