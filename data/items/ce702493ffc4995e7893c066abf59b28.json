Listen very carefully to Rush talk about the nature of Christmas, this disease and the Georgia election. Never listen to those who say you can’t when they couldn’t and didn’t. Thank you, Rush. Politicos blame Trump for their three-month game for government shutdown. You will carry the ball to end voter fraud. If the Deep State can do this to Trump, who can stop them? Let's be our own assurance. Republicans don’t rally their base at the grassroots level. Huge things begin with three or four people. Carry the flame for Rush.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>Ben Sasse calls Trump pardons “rotten to the core.” What is “rotten to the core,” Ben? Comparing elites and non-elites. Apply pressure to the Red States. Make a plan to challenge for tomorrow. It’s not Christmas Eve in D.C., it’s Anthony Fauci Day. Why Trump vetoed the defense bill. Use righteous anger to drive action. Son of prison camp survivors: Don’t give up! Dad moments during Christmas. Restaurateurs band together to ban Cuomo.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p>Listen carefully to Rush’s words. How much pressure can you put on Republican officials? Our awareness has changed and so have we. Caller thankful that Rush helped him understand his conservatism. What can we politically threaten the establishment with? It’s up to us to discover what we have to offer and give that to our country. It’s easy to take over your local Republican party. Follow ideals, not people. Let’s be tired of being sick. We got a country to save and God on our side. Merry Christmas and thank you from Rush.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
