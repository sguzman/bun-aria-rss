  "description": "<p>This week on Zero Blog Thirty, Chaps loses his damn mind and becomes Mad Online. He's upset. They talk about Director Comey getting fired, certain Marines not having to go through boot camp, and then Nate Boyer comes on and things calm down. Nate talks about his life in the Army and his journey from a walk-on at the University of Texas and then again to the NFL. An incredible story by an incredible man. Again... Chaps was mad!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
