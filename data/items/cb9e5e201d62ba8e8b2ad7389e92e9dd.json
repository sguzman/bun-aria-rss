  "description": "<p>Previewing the first episode of Against the Rules Season 2 by Michael Lewis (<em>Moneyball, The Big Short, The Blind Side</em>):</p><p>It wasn’t that long ago that coaches were confined to sports. Now they’re everywhere. You can hire a life coach or a death coach, an executive coach, a dating coach, even a charisma coach. Journalist and bestselling author Michael Lewis asks who’s getting all this coaching, and who isn’t? Lewis brings his wry wit and mastery of storytelling to topics as diverse as sports, consumer finance, college, and firefighting —  to understand what the rise of coaching means for all of us.In a seven-episode season, Against the Rules takes listeners from the home of a single mom in the mountains of Colorado, the classrooms of the Harvard Business School, to a data-driven “Bionic Man” facility for baseball pitchers. He speaks with a celebrity voice coach, an analyst who grades sales calls, and a startup founder who's coaching consumers out of credit-card debt. Along the way, he also revisits the controversial methods of his own high-school baseball coach. Through conversations both amusing and horrifying, Lewis explores the rise of coaching in America and what it says about unfairness. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
