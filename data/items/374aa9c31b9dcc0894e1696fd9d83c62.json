  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, The media are excited about the Michael Cohen guilty plea deal and yet, they don’t know what they’re talking about. This is a guilty plea, not an adjudication. It’s a plea bargain, not a precedent. They obviously had more on Michael Cohen, or he wouldn’t have cut a deal. If a candidate chooses to make a settlement with someone or have them sign a nondisclosure agreement, that is not illegal. For example, let’s say a candidate says, ‘Get a nondisclosure agreement, pay the funds out of my pocket, because I don’t want this person to attack me during the campaign for something that occurred before the campaign.’ That’s perfectly legal. That’s not a campaign expenditure. Then, Bradley Smith, former Chairman of the Federal Election Commission, explains the facts of the Cohen plea agreement. Things not related to running a campaign are not campaign expenditures, they are personal expenditures. Even if paying someone to go away might potentially help your campaign, such an expense made with non-campaign funds is not a campaign contribution. Later, certain people that enter the country illegally do not respect the rule of law, and Mollie Tibbetts would be alive today but for this one illegal alien who killed her.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
