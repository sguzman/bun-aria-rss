  "description": "<p>This week, we're talking support systems - what are they? How do we find them? And why do we need them? We have supported one another over the last few years and we have both found the relationship valuable for different reasons. But what are the other ways we have found to support ourselves? In this episode, we talk about the value of online communities and real life relationships, but also the importance of asking for help and support in other parts of our life, so that we can make room for art. We also talk about learning to say no, and asking for support from the wrong people, which can be so destructive. We hope this episode inspires you to look at how you might be able to shore up your art practice by leaning a little bit on other people - even if only now and then.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Alice's Connected Artist Group <a href=\"https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/connected-interest\">www.soulrocketstudio.com/connected-interest</a></p>\n<p>Louise's Art Tribe https://www.louisefletcherart.com/art-tribe</p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
