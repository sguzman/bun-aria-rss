  "description": "<p>With Summer slipping away, Matt & Bowen get tactile to embrace and discuss culture. The girls make some much needed apologies (and accusations) before swearing to never apologize again, clarify their love of Beyoncé's Renaissance for all you Kayteighs out there with doubts, and get into it about therapy. Also, Matt & Bowen reveal some of their Emmy votes, stan Brandy, discuss RHOBH and the recent weaponization of Lisa Rinna's grief, and examine Kathy Hilton's recent and (rumored) upcoming transgressions. All that, the recent Hollywood Reporter cover story on Wendy Williams, a strong case against homeopathy, how Fantine was actually Homeless AND Toothless, what happens when gorgeous nieces emerge from their terrible twos, and an absolute Stephen Sondheim lovefest as our hosts gush over Broadway's Into The Woods and examine what happens when Sondheim's work is adapted to film. Where do you stand in the war of bidets vs. flushable wipes? What would you order between the sizzling chicken shrimp and the watermelon feta salad? Are *you* Sorry? Check this episode out, Kayteighs! Or, readers! Or, publicists! We'll figure it out...</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
