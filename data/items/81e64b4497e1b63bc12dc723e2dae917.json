  "description": "<p>A comedian Blind Mike interviewed dumped all over him on another show, but Mike is in denial. Former Vice President Joe Biden sharted during a news interview -- the evidence is incontrovertible (0:20:00). The Jeffrey Katzenberg / Meg Whitman content project -- Quibi -- is a billion dollar experiment in offering shitty content (0:39:30). MA Gov. Charlie Baker is squirming as more questions are asked about his failures to protect veterans in care facilities susceptible to coronavirus (1:01:00). Exclusive Minifan footage from a so-called \"Comfort Center\" in downtown Boston shows vividly that Boston Mayor Marty Walsh's anti-pandemic policies are failing those experiencing homelessness. Minihane addresses last night's Minifan drama.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
