  "description": "The question of how to write the history of the modern Middle East is a much contested one. Do we write national histories, focused on modern-nation states? Do we treat the Middle East as an integrated unit? What even constitutes the Middle East? At that, how do we deal with the great changes that swept the region during the late 19th and early 20th centuries?

She tweets @NAMansour26  and produces another Middle-East and North Africa-related podcast: Reintroducing.\n\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
