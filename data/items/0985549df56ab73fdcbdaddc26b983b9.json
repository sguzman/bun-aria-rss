  "description": "<p>Today's show includes a couple of incredible interviews. First, former 6th overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, a first-team All-Pro and Pro Bowler, Adam Pacman Jones joins Pat live in Cincinnati. They chat about the airport situation, his time in the NFL, how he's trying to set a good example for his kids, his past, what song he would want to play at his funeral, and what NFL player from his tenure he'd like to fight the most. (2:27-32:00). Next, 15th pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, 2x Pro Bowler, one of the most inspirational guys on this planet and Linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ryan Shazier, joins Pat and the guys live in Pittsburgh. They chat about his road back to recovery, what the best parts about being a dad are, who he would want to play him in a movie about his life, and he gives his outlook on the Steelers 2019-2020 season (35:32-1:05:01). Later, the guys chat about the different vehicles in Pat's collection, and a conversation about the Amish leads to Pat calling one of his agents to ask a few questions in search of some answers about what it means to be &nbsp;Modern Orthodox Jew. It is perhaps, one of the most enlightening religious conversations you'll ever hear, and answers a lot of questions you may have about the different practices of being Jewish. Today's show is a great one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.&nbsp;</p>\n",
