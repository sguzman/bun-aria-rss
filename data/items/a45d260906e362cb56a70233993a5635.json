  "itunes:summary": "The response to COVID-19 across the world has been unlike anything experienced in the contemporary era. Changing the nature of human experience from interaction to isolation, the virus has had a previously unimaginable impact on states, societies and economies around the world.\n\nThe political impact of Coronavirus has been immense, but perhaps more significant has been the philosophical impact on the human condition itself. \n\nWhat are the impacts on the psyche as death and disease take on a global scale? How does humanity continue to progress when - to take a page from Yeats - in the widening gyre things fall apart and the centre cannot hold? And what are some of the lessons we can learn from theorists throughout history who wrote in times of pestilence and plague?\n\nIn the second episode in our series on the politics of COVID-19, we take a look at the contributions made by political theorists in our understanding of Coronavirus and its social, economic and political impacts, and look to history to find philosophical inferences that can be drawn from plagues and disease in the past.\n\nTo discuss these issues I am joined by Taylor Green. Taylor is a PhD student with Carleton University's Department of Political Science specializing in political theory, the philosophy of technology and Canadian political thought.\n\nFor more information on Taylor and his work, check out his Department profile:\nhttps://carleton.ca/polisci/people/taylor-green/\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nFollow us on social media:\ninstagram.com/cu_poli.sci\nfacebook.com/carletonu.polisci\ntwitter.com/CarletonPoliSci\ncarleton.ca/polisci\n\nThanks so much for listening, and an extra thanks to Sappheiros for use of his music for our theme.\n\nLights by Sappheiros @sappheirosmusic\nCreative Commons â€” Attribution 3.0 Unported â€” CC BY 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: bit.ly/LightsSappheiros\nMusic promoted by Audio Library youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nðŸŽµ Track Info:\nTitle: Lights by Sappheiros\nGenre and Mood: Dance & Electronic + Inspirational\nâ€”â€”â€”\nðŸŽ§ Available on:\nSpotify: open.spotify.com/album/4KnoJn...\niTunes: music.apple.com/us/album/ligh...\nDeezer: deezer.com/us/album/88114572\nYouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=xq3_uCEtiJI\nSoundCloud: @sappheirosmusi...\nâ€”â€”â€”\nðŸ˜Š Contact the Artist:\nzachremick1@gmail.com\nsappheiros.bandcamp.com\ndeezer.com/us/artist/13811001\n@sappheirosmusic\nmusic.apple.com/us/artist/sap...\nyoutube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC...\nopen.spotify.com/artist/5ZVHX...\npaypal.com/paypalme2/sappheiros\ninstagram.com/sappheirosmusic\nfacebook.com/SappheirosMusic\ndiscordapp.com/invite/Pk87yN9\ntwitter.com/SappheirosMusic\npatreon.com/sappheiros",
