  "title": "Ep 247 | An Update on Mia Robertson's Extensive Surgery and the Difficult Recovery Ahead",
  "description": "Jase is back with an update on how his daughter, Mia, is doing after her longest, most extensive craniofacial surgery yet. He describes many of the challenges ahead, including swelling that will last 12 months. Phil marvels that he's never heard a word of complaint from Mia. Jase is nearly defeated by NASCAR-like driving conditions in Dallas and has to play the \"I have a gun\" card at his hotel, but an encounter with a young couple at the hospital fills him with encouragement. And Phil opens it up with a story about netting a big (and nasty) surprise. Thanks for your prayers and support!\nMia Moo: http://miamoo.org/\nLearn more about your ad choices.
