  "description": "<div>At CrimeCon London last weekend, I had the pleasure of interviewing author Jason Wilson about his excellent new book, 'The Old Man And Me'. In front of a live audience, we chatted about why he wrote his book about growing up and living with his gangster father. <br>\n<br>\nThe book is no nonsense and talks about the reality of crime, not the glamourised versions you hear about elsewhere, and in this interview Jason was very open about his life. I hope you enjoy and there is link to the book below.<br>\n<br>\nBuy your copy here:Â  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Old-Man-thrilling-biography-understand/dp/1913406881\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Old-Man-thrilling-biography-understand/dp/1913406881</a>\n</div>\n",
