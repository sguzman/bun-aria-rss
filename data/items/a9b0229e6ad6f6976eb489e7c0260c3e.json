Added to this we find out how he was able to use the disappointment of winning silver in Rio to help him towards gold in Tokyo, just why sailing is an incredibly exciting sport and should be treated more like one and why he is so obsessed with a certain movie from the 1980s. Come sail away with one entertaining interview you won't want to miss!</p>",
