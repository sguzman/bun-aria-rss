  "description": "<p>Guys - this might be the most important clip from any of my content TO-DATE. You're going to see it all over my channels today but the podcast listeners are first to get it !! This clip was taken from #AGV 244 where Taylor, a 22 year-old girl called in to the show. This conversation really struck a chord with me and I'm sure it comes through in this audio. Her actions just weren't mapping her desire and I know that her thought process is the same that so many youngins have and it's just not right. I hold ZERO punches in this one and I'd love for you to have a listen. Patience is the game, my friends. There's just no way around it. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5516551.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
