  "description": "There are always risks when it comes to investing… I touch on the major ones we’re dealing with today. [0:30] But with risk comes opportunity… and we’re seeing big winners across our publications as a result—especially in these three sectors. [4:00] I highlight a few recent picks from our  and  newsletters you should be paying attention to. [5:47] There’s one asset class on my radar that’s in a league of its own. I break down why it’s creating some of the best opportunities I’ve ever seen for retail investors. Plus, our Crypto Intelligence advisory has been killing it lately… And I want to give all of my listeners a chance to get in on it. So, I’m putting together a special limited-time discount. [10:45] One listener is having problems buying ethereum (ETH) on a popular exchange… and wants advice on where to purchase cryptocurrency. I share a few of my favorite crypto exchanges… and explain how it keeps getting easier for investors to get exposure to this amazing asset class. [24:00] And lastly, what would I tell an investor who can’t afford to lose money? While I can’t provide personal advice, I’ll tell you what I would do if I was in a position where failure is not an option. [26:55]  Enjoyed this episode?
