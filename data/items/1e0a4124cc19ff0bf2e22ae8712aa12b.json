  "title": "A Murderer’s Confession and Hollywood Scams with Chris Franjola",
  "description": "Chris Franjola is here! We discuss Ben Affleck allowing his ten years to drive and crash a Lamborghini. Gabby Petito’s Murderer, her boyfriend Brian Laundrie, had a journal. In it, he writes about their relationship van life and how he killed her. RHOBH Kyle Richard’s family gets their own Netflix show, and I predicted it. Another roommate from hell is in New York, and he is not who you would expect based on his appearance. Airdrop your penis on a flight, and you might get thrown off. We need to rethink eyelash extensions. The Ezra Miller accusations make us wonder if his movie will ever come out. \n\nSubscribe on Apple Podcasts to get exclusive Extra Juicy episodes every Friday and get all episodes of Juicy Scoop, ad-free\n\nOr get access to Extra Juicy on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/juicyscoop\n\nTo bring your brand to life in this podcast, email podcastadsales@sonymusic.com\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
