  "description": "The Oscars are Sunday and once again this year's nominees reflect an Academy that's still older, whiter, and more male.  All five directing nominees are men, and 19 of 20 nominees for acting are white. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adambvary\"> <br/><br/>Adam B. Vary</a>, Senior Entertainment Writer for <a href=\"https://variety.com/\">Variety</a>, tells Sam the best-reviewed film of the year is \"Parasite,\" from South Korea, which is up for Best Picture.  But none of its cast were singled out for awards.  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/audreycleo\">Audrey Cleo Yap</a>, host of <a href=\"https://variety.com/vcategory/daily-variety/\">Daily Variety</a> on <a href=\"https://variety.com/\">Variety.com</a>, says that lack of notice for Asian actors is consistent with past Academy behavior.  She also notes the few film industry insiders who are pushing Hollywood to open up — but says most are too fearful to speak out. <br/><br/>Sam also talks with two Virginia Commonwealth University political science students who traveled with their class to New Hampshire to observe and participate in the state's presidential primary activities.  They're featured the New Hampshire Public Radio podcast <a href=\"https://www.strangleholdpodcast.com/\">Stranglehold</a>.  They asked why such an overwhelmingly white state should remain the first to hold a primary — when it doesn't reflect the rest of the nation. ",
