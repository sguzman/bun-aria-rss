  "title": "Heisman Trophy Winner Joe Burrow, Week 15 Fastest 2 Minutes And Recap",
  "description": "<p><p>Week 15 fastest 2 minutes (2:37 - 9:38). We recap every game from Sunday. The Bills are back in the playoffs, the Patriots made it for the 11th season in a row. Jameis Winston is a Hall of Famer and we feel bad for the Lions. The Texans take control of the AFC South, and the Bears killed Big Cat again. Everyone forgot about the Chiefs, Eli farewell, Urban Meyer to the Redskins? Seahawks Panthers happened. The Blackhole had a horrible ending. Freddie Kitchens did it again but at least he knows how weeks work. Vikings basically let the Chargers lose for themselves and the Cowboys played their perfect game (9:38 - 90:11). Who's back of the week (90:11 - 99:54) and then we welcome on Heisman Trophy Winner Joe Burrow. We talk to Joe about his recruitment to LSU, the whirlwind of this past year, Coach O stories and more.Â  (99:54 - 117:13)</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
