  "title": "KFCRadio: We Got Heckled (6 Year Anniversary Special Live from LA)",
  "description": "<p><p>Live from a bar outside of E3 in LA, we celebrate the 6 year anniversary of KFC Radio. While we were recording a random person on the street heckled us because Feits called himself a FDB. Voicemails include if you could go back in time who would you heckle, would you rather your daughter be the face of a strip club or the featured performer and a debate over what motivates you:Â fear or friendship. Special thanks to all the LA Stoolies who came out for the event and to everyone who has supported us over the last 6 years.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
