  "description": "Textile designer Lisa Fine joins the show this week to talk about how she got into textile design, the path that unfolded after a trip to India, and the top things we should know when working with textiles. Lisa also shares the inspiration behind her new book, Near & Far, and wisdom she has inherited from starting and running her own business. This episode will also support that there is beauty in imperfection, and if you love something you can find a place for it in your home.  \nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nHow Lisa got into textile design, and why she feels it is such a crucial piece to having a home that is both stylish and comfortable.\n\nThe travels to India that got Lisa even more passionate about textiles, and also what she loves so much about Persian textiles.\n\nA few twists and turns that occurred while Lisa was growing her own business, and how she took them as learning lessons to get even better.\n\nWhy Lisa loves a hand-printed linen so much, and how it creates a natural yet custom made look.\n\nBeauty is in imperfection, so embrace the flaws and know it’s okay to not have things perfectly perfect!\n\nLisa works in homes that range from grand and opulent to refined and simple. Hear how she makes things work for each particular space.\n\nLisa believes if you love something, you can find a place for it in your home.\n\nWhy we are here for the trend of using one particular pattern to the point where it becomes a neutral.\n\nSlipcovers can be a great way to give your couch shape and a streamlined look, but there are certain things you need to know when using them.\n\nMentioned In This Episode: \nLisa Fine Textiles\nNear & Far \n@lisafinetextiles\nRichard Keith Langham \nWine Away \nThe Frame TV \n\nDecorating Dilemma \nFirst, Lisa loves that you want a lot of seating areas, and this space is great for entertaining already! It also seems like putting the dining room near the kitchen would work well, and we either vote for a round table to welcome a break from the square, or put the dining room table in front of the fireplace where the sofa is. Maybe the length of the sofa goes perpendicular to the fireplace, and put the two chairs across from it. A slip to cover the chairs would be a great way to match the sofa and have a theme carry across the room. We would love to sit in front of the fireplace too, so feel free to get creative with your seating in front of it!\n_________________________________________\nWe think it’s brilliant the way you have used tape to outline where everything will go, so good use of understanding proportion already! We are okay with the TV in front of the fireplace, and just suggest bringing in more round shapes in your bookshelf accessories to add some softness to the room.",
