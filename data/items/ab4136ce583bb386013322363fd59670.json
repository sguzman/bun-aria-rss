We are going to cover the aftermath of the beginning of the First Fitna (Civil War) in the Rashidun Caliphate (https://youtu.be/5a6PyMTLL1E) and the battle of Siffin of 657, which led to the rise of the Umayyad Caliphate (https://youtu.be/FVkTzYmoIoI), external expansion continued with the siege of Constantinople in 674-678, but this didn't stop the Second Fitna from happening, leading to the battles of Karbala (680) and Marj Rahit (684) (https://youtu.be/BZa_HjChaS0). We also previously talked about the conclusion of the Second Fitna and the rise and fall of the Zubayrid Caliphate (https://youtu.be/gteP2lmh42U). In another episode the armies of the Caliphate return to the frontiers, clashing with the crumbling Byzantine Empire in Armenia and North Africa. In the latter, they would not find opposition not just in the Roman remnant, as the rise of a new warrior queen among the Berbers posed a serious challenge to Hassan ibn al-Nu’man’s conquering army in the Maghreb. And even as the Umayyads won victories on the battlefield and expanded ever further, the cohesion and unity of their empire continued to deteriorate on their Eastern frontiers, planting the seeds of their eventual collapse. And we will also discuss how Carthage was razed once again (https://youtu.be/NoF8XCseFio). This new episode will focus on the first Muslim incursion into India, as we discuss the Sindh campaign that allowed the Arabs to gain a foothold in the subcontinent.\n\nEarly Muslim Expansion Season 1: https://youtu.be/r2cEIDZwG5M\nEarly Muslim Expansion Season 2: https://youtu.be/baHT2nR5Wr4\nSlavery in the Caliphate: https://youtu.be/5kDPPmZvSKY\nMuslim Schism: https://youtu.be/-85dXjgMiSU\nChristian Schism: https://youtu.be/a6rWf0k8d78\nFirst Crusade: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkyYjpYLORI&list=PLaBYW76inbX6RqjG027zLO_svn3Fdv7Qa\nThird Crusade: https://youtu.be/jCyCSgsFXKQ\nFourth Crusade: https://youtu.be/IpHbbq0O7Wo\n\nSupport us on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/KingsandGenerals or Paypal: http://paypal.me/kingsandgenerals or by joining the youtube membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMmaBzfCCwZ2KqaBJjkj0fw/join We are grateful to our patrons and sponsors, who made this video possible: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ooKPbpq0z8ciEjz5Zmrga4-gWRmripm0u4BHMkkXHVc/edit?usp=sharing\n\nNarration: Officially Devin (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU0-VII-V376zFxiRGMeZGg & https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC79s7EdN9uXX77-Ly2HmEjQ)\nAnimation: Arif Azaman (https://www.youtube.com/user/MathemedicUpdates)\nScript: Ethan Symons-Ferraro\nIllustrations: Nargiz Isayeva\nMachinimas by Arif Azaman using on Total War: Attilla engine, using Anno Domini 768 mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2695905425\n\n✔ Merch store ► https://teespring.com/stores/kingsandgenerals\n✔ Patreon ► https://www.patreon.com/KingsandGenerals\n✔ Podcast ► Google Play: http://bit.ly/2QDF7y0 iTunes: https://apple.co/2QTuMNG\n✔ PayPal ► http://paypal.me/kingsandgenerals\n✔ Twitter ► https://twitter.com/KingsGenerals\n✔ Discord ►https://discord.gg/DpuRAMa75V\n✔ Facebook ► https://www.facebook.com/KingsGenerals\n✔ Instagram ►http://www.instagram.com/Kings_Generals\n\nProduction Music courtesy of Epidemic Sound: http://www.epidemicsound.com\n\n#Documentary #Muslims #India",
