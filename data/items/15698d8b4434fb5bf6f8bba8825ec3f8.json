A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. \n\nWith the Political Race for the Whitehouse drawing to a rapid close, have you given it a good thought as to where foreign relations have gone in the past 8 years, how we are seen by the world and if we are in a position to defend or advance our holdings, allies and interests? With the rise of the Chinese and Russian Empires again on the world stage, are we an advancing society or declining. History tells us that all things are circular, just ask the English and the Spanish. Join me as we discuss the current political climate as it pertains to the thing we hold most dear, our very own skin. \n\n Podcast: Galtspeaks.com Contact: Radio@galtspeaks.com Follow us on twitter.com/radiomarkowitz & Facebook.com/radiomarkowitz Spreaker-www.spreaker.com/show/the-warren-markowitz-show & our new home on Redstatetalkradio.com Support the podcast, use the next level of autonomy, cryptocurrency: BTC: Azen7A8rsEwQ84SCB3ZsbuYALpNCGgqNc",
