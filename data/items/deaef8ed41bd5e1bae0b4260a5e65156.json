  "description": "Politics has been a part of many films, since the beginning of the industry over 100 years ago. These include movies with political subjects, such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, to films with political underpinnings, such as The Hurt Locker. In Projecting Politics: Political Messages in American Films (Routledge, 2015) and our interview, Elizabeth Haas discusses the history of politics in film and points out how current events have shaped their development. In addition to how movies during the Production Code era tended to downplay politics, she reviews the changes that led movies to take a greater political tone. She also discusses documentaries and films released after September 11, 2001, as well as disaster and post-apocalyptic films and their importance as political statements.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
