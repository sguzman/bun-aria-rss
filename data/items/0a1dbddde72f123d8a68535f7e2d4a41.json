  "description": "We had a listener reach out asking how to integrate the crystal and silver she has had around for years, so we decided to  take that on today. In the grand millennial movement, styles have moved to a more casual look but we think you should show off your antiques and we talk about to tastefully pull that off. We talk about the quality of crystal and why it makes a difference and great places to showcase it.  We suggest having a bowl of yummy candies out for family and guests who visit to create a nostalgic feeling every time they have that same candy elsewhere.<br /><br />Join our mailing list to see space plans and get exclusive offers:  <br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=HnpGxW\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=HnpGxW</a><br /><br />How to use crystal and silver 2:11<br />Crystal quality 10:25<br />Crystal in the powder bath 16:37<br /><br />“Kind of a pro tip is if you’re using something like an obelisk, which Sue is saying is non-directional so it looks good from every single side, like if you’re sticking them on a center hall table or even on a console, most people’s tendency would be to stack them so that they’re straight and their edges are parallel with the front of that table. The pro tip would be to maybe slightly throw those off a little bit. Maybe two are straight and the third one is thrown off on a diagonal.” 13:33<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
