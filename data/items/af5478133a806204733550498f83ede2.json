In the previous part, James Lindsay presented the ideas of the fifth chapter, wherein the seeds of Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) are laid as Freire describes how education and social work are closely related. The previous parts of this series, covering the earlier chapters of the book can be found here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freires-politics-of-education/), here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freire-educating-to-proclaim-the-world/), and here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/social-work-education/).\n\nIn this episode, James dives into the first half of the sixth chapter, which goes deeply into Freire's model for education. In fact, what we see in this episode makes sense of the ones before it while setting the stage for all the ones that follow. Paulo Freire Marxified education itself. That is, Freire redefined literacy, education, and even knowledge according to the usual bourgeois/proletarian dichotomy and thus was able to redefine literacy to mean gaining critical consciousness. Join James to hear about the Marxification of education itself, bearing in mind yet again that almost all of our kids now go to Paulo Freire's schools.\n\nSupport New Discourses:\npaypal.me/newdiscourses\nnewdiscourses.locals.com/support\npatreon.com/newdiscourses\nsubscribestar.com/newdiscourses\nyoutube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://newdiscourses.com\n\nFollow:\nfacebook.com/newdiscourses\ntwitter.com/NewDiscourses\ninstagram.com/newdiscourses\nhttps://newdiscourses.locals.com\npinterest.com/newdiscourses\nlinkedin.com/company/newdiscourses\nminds.com/newdiscourses\nreddit.com/r/NewDiscourses\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
