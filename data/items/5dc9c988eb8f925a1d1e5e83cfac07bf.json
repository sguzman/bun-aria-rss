  "description": "<p>Jennifer Haigh’s new novel, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/01/books/review/mercy-street-jennifer-haigh.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Mercy Street”</a> — which Richard Russo calls “extraordinary” in his review — is about a woman named Claudia who works at a women’s clinic in Boston. It’s also about the protesters outside. On this week’s podcast, Haigh says the novel was inspired in part by her own time working on a clinic’s hotline.</p><p>“Obviously I am strongly pro-choice or I wouldn’t have been volunteering at this clinic,” Haigh says. “But until this experience, I knew very little about what abortion actually means in a person’s life. And I think that’s true for many people who have strong convictions about abortions. Most people don’t know very much about it. It’s ironic when you consider, this is such a common experience, right? We know that about one in four American women will at some point have an abortion. And yet there’s such a climate of secrecy around this procedure that most of them don’t feel free to talk about it honestly. And many never tell anyone that they’ve done this. The result being that the average person knows very, very little about this experience.”</p><p>Megan Walsh visits the podcast to talk about her new book, <a href=\"https://globalreports.columbia.edu/books/the-subplot/\" target=\"_blank\">“The Subplot: What China Is Reading and Why It Matters.”</a></p><p>And why does it matter? “We tend to think about China in quite binary terms these days, as friend or foe,” Walsh says. “If we do properly pay attention to what people are genuinely trying to process and think about in China — which is peculiar, diverse, strange, innovative, some of it’s terrible, some of it’s amazing — I feel like we get an alternative way of understanding the complexities at the heart of a country which we are defining ourselves against, and we have an opportunity to also understand without seeing it as a sort of monolith.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Elizabeth Harris has news from the publishing world, and Jennifer Szalai and Molly Young talk about books they’ve recently reviewed. Pamela Paul is the host.</p><p>Here are the books discussed by The Times’s critics this week:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/books/review-power-law-venture-capital-sebastian-mallaby.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The Power Law”</a> by Sebastian Mallaby</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/books/review-eating-to-extinction-rare-foods-dan-saladino.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Eating to Extinction”</a> by Dan Saladino</p><p><i>We would love to hear your thoughts about this episode, and about the Book Review’s podcast in general.
