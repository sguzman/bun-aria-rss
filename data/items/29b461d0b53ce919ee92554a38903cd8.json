Can Devonta Freeman find the end zone? Are Michael Gallup and Randall Cobb good starts? Actually, is anyone in that game other than Ezekiel Elliott a good start? And who do we like in the CHI-DET game? Allen Robinson? Anyone else? Finally we finish by discussing whether or not we trust some key players down the stretch (59:00) ...
