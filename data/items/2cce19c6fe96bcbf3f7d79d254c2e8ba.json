  "description": "Today we are talking about a highly visual topic, so you’re going to need to tap into your visual mind to really understand this one. If you share your life with somebody, you most likely have different tastes, so we want to talk about how you can style with clashing tastes. We suggest creating a North Star, or a spot where you can both compile visuals of what you want in your home so that you can have a good idea of what the other person wants, and then come to an agreement in the areas where your tastes can work together. Based on our experience, men tend to have a more contemporary style while women lean toward a more cozy style, but this can also vary depending on a person’s age and what they think portrays success. <br /><br />Creating a North Star 3:09<br />Color 8:13<br />Never hate anything in your home 10:39<br />Whoever will be using the room most should have say 13:21<br />Masculine and feminine elements in style 18:50<br />Learn the reason behind why they hate something 22:25<br /><br />“Always start with what we call as the North Star, and that is pages and pages of visuals. We do this for our clients in Pinterest boards, and then we put together packets. You could have a large bulletin board at your house, you can take an entire wall and just continue to tape things up. You can do it all virtually if you’re a paperless household, do it on your computers and save back and forth. You can both be on a Pinterest board.” 6:59<br /> <br />grove.co/dearalice<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
