  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. Today I introduce first-time guest, Chief Investment Officer, and Co-Founder of Tematica Research - Chris Versace. Chris is a weekly contributor for Business Insider, Forbes, and The Street.com. He's also the host of his own financial podcast, Cocktail Investing. Simply put, and like myself, the guy’s a stock market junkie. But his “thematic” approach is something totally different. He call’s it “the death of sector investing…” And it might even be ahead of it’s time. Theme by theme, Chris breaks down the market as a whole… discussing recently released economic data, what he calls the \"Trump Slump,\" and how investors should prepare for the upcoming Q2 earnings season. Chris also unveils two “dividend dynamos”... and two small-cap companies listeners MUST add to their watchlist… Good Investing, Frank Curzio P.S. After Chris leaves us, keep listening for this week’s Educational Segment [], where I explain how to avoid “value traps\" that even the best investors fall into -- when companies look cheap, but in reality, they’re far from it.",
