  "description": "<p>It's time we get involved. We've drank our green juice, done our yoga, oiled our body.. Now let's cultivate that positive energy and go out there where it's needed. In this podcast episode, I explain what is going on in the world in a Vedic perspective and why we as spiritual people need to be the ones who help bring it back into balance. It's more than just sitting at home with your crystals and doing your meditation. It's fulfilling your dharma to help this planet. We cannot be afraid of politics because that's how the people who are ruled by hatred and ego take over.</p> <p>This is a call to action to all my spiritual light warriors fueled by the power of love. Let's go out there and serve our Dharmas to truly become our highest selves.. which is far beyond the self.</p> <p>Be part of a community that supports you discovering your dharma in Rose Gold Goddesses, the sacred sisterhood collective with community, content, creativity and so much more — learn more about rosegoldgoddesses.com.<br /> <br /> Intro + Outro Music: Silent Ganges by Maneesh de Moor</p> <p>Discover your Dharma with my free quiz at https://iamsahararose.com/</p> <p>Connect with me for daily Ayurvedic and modern spiritual wisdom at: Instagram.com/iamsahararose<br /> Facebook.com/iamsahararose Twitter.com/iamsahararose</p> <p>Order My Books Eat Feel Fresh + Idiot's Guide to Ayurveda: https://www.iamsahararose.com/books</p> <p>By accessing this Podcast, I acknowledge that the entire contents are the property of Sahara Rose, or used by Sahara Rose with permission, and are protected under U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws.
