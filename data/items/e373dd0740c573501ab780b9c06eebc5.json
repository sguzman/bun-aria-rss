  "description": "<p>We show open games cover extensive form games with both perfect and imperfect\ninformation. Doing so forces us to address two current weaknesses in open\ngames: the lack of a notion of player and their agency within open games, and\nthe lack of choice operators. Using the former we construct the latter, and\nthese choice operators subsume previous proposed operators for open games,\nthereby making progress towards a core, canonical and ergonomic calculus of\ngame operators. Collectively these innovations increase the level of\ncompositionality of open games, and demonstrate their expressiveness.\n</p>",
