  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. This week I sit down with a mining rockstar… Hugh Argo, CEO of Revival Gold. Hugh has an incredible track record. And a unique combination of skills… He had a successful career in investment banking before he became a mining engineer. Before joining Revival Gold, Hugh helped transform a $1.7 billion gold company to a $17 billion company. Today, Hugh and I discuss a key catalyst for higher gold prices: Gold producers are running out of deposits to mine. And we'll tell you how to profit from the shortage... Hugh also shares his unique vision for a mine that returns cash to shareholders... explains his company’s flagship project... and why his management team is everything an investor could want. You'll also hear about my favorite indicator for rising gold prices...  And what it's telling us today. Good investing, Frank Curzio",
