  "description": "Sinbad (no, not that Sinbad) is probably the 3rd most famous story from a collection titled \"One Thousand and One Nights\". It's a story of loss, hardship, and redemption...and then partying so hard that you forget all that loss, hardship, and redemption and need to do it all over again. Six more times. On the plus side, it's not just about an out-of-touch rich guy being out-of-touch and rich, but being so while experiencing some pretty weird stuff. The creature this time is an awkwardly hot squirrel thing who wants to cram a metaphor about pride down your throat. ---------- Sponsors: Think you know a place? Well, how about you try the Detour app and see if you really know a place. It's a guided audio tour through cities where Radiolab, Ken Burns, and others take your through their favorite neighborhoods and you learn all the fun, interesting details you had no idea were all around you. Better yet, go with friends and everyone can listen to the same one at the same time. Check out http://www.detour.com/myths for more info. Dollar. Shave. Club. It's high quality razors and shave butter right to your door for only a few bucks a month. The executive razor is well worth it, but you can put their name to the test and get a razor for a dollar a month (plus shipping). Check out http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/legends for more info on that. ---------- Music:  “Hickory Interlude” by Blue Dot Sessions “Plaque” by Blue Dot Sessions    “Colocate” by Podington Bear    “Oui” by Podington Bear    “Pure Swell” by Podington Bear    “Streetbeat Heat” by Podington Bear    “Transmogrify” by Podington Bear<p><a href=\"https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
