  "description": "Crows have gotten a bad rap throughout history. Think about it. A group of them is called a \"murder.\" To get some insight into crows and perhaps set the record straight, we talked to Kaeli Swift. She's a lecturer at the University of Washington and wrote her doctoral thesis on crow \"funerals.\" <br/><br/>In an earlier version of this episode, we used the word \"spooky\" to describe crows. Because that word has a history of being used as a racial slur, we chose to replace it with the words \"scary\" and \"creepy.\" Thanks to our listeners who helpfully pointed this out to us, and we apologize.
