  "description": "<p>This week, we take a gander at a champion, movie star, hero to millions in his country... And violent lunatic. He went from utter poverty, to reaching god-like status, with his violence going unchecked. No one was safe from his wrath, including photographers at Christmas parties, people who want nothing more than to eat pizza, fellow bus passengers, construction workers who try to negotiate the price of a car, and most of all his wives. His constant abuse eventually got him shot, and one of his wives dead. He's a real peach of guy, and we have a blast taking apart his twisted, tragic mess of a life. This man epitomizes what Crime In Sports is all about. Jump into your trunks, smoke 5 packs of cigarettes, and punch the nearest human being with Carlos Monzon!! Check us out, every Tuesday.
