However, these lessons take an incredible amount of time to create. (For example, my pandas video series required over 200 hours of work, and even a single blog post can take over 25 hours!)</p>\n<p>I've managed to sustain Data School financially by teaching one paid course, and I'll be selling more courses in the future. But I want to find a sustainable way to keep making free content, and your support will allow me to do this!</p>\n<p><strong>Where will the money go?</strong></p>\n<p>First, it will help to cover my existing costs, such as blog hosting, webcasting, newsletter software, editing tools, and more.</p>\n<p>Second, it will allow me to hire people to help with certain tasks (video editing, transcription, graphic design, etc.), which will free up my time to create more content!</p>\n<p>Third, it will allow me to upgrade my existing recording setup, which will enhance the video quality and make it easier to record videos.</p>\n<p><strong>Do I have to pledge in US Dollars?</strong></p>\n<p>No, you can use any currency and your pledge will be converted into dollars.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any extra fees?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no extra fees, unless your bank charges a fee to convert to US Dollars.</p>\n<p><strong>What if I need to change or cancel my pledge?</strong></p>\n<p>You can change or cancel your pledge at any time - there's no long term commitment.</p>\n<p><strong>I want to help, but I can't afford it... can I still receive your tutorials?</strong></p>\n<p>YES! The pledges from this campaign will enable me to continue creating tutorials for EVERYONE. You'll still receive lots of free content through the Data School blog and YouTube channel!</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/dataschool\"> >>> Join Data School Insiders <<< </a>\n</h2>\n</div>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4V5jrPaNrjY?rel=0&showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>Regardless of whether you join, I want to THANK YOU for your support over the years.
