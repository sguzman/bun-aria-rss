  "description": "Bernie wants us to know how AMAZING communist China is at raising people out of poverty – but as the massive lines at Shanghai’s first Costco show us, it’s actually capitalism that he should be praising. Instead, the 2020 candidates’ socialist agendas are sounding eerily similar to the Soviet constitution. Speaking of “eerily similar,” Modern Monetary Theory has also been tried before, and EVERY TIME it ended in hyperinflation and collapse! Also, Ilhan Omar’s new boyfriend, Tim Mynett, is getting A LOT of money from her PACs. Oh, and his WIFE is also filing for divorce. Democratic polling qualifications aren’t looking so good for Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
