  "description": "<p>Timber Hawkeye (best-selling author of <i>Buddhist Boot Camp</i> and <i>Faithfully Religionless</i>) details his life’s journey after having an enlightened experience. He explains why he left his solid corporate job and comfortable life to strip himself of all possessions, moved to Hawaii where he survived on just $7k per year, studied psychology and world religion, and built a world of being of service to others. Timber discusses how he was able to achieve freedom through simplifying his life and valuing time rather than following society’s recipe for happiness. Mayim and Timber examine the cognitive dissonance that stems from the vicious loop of internal conflict, the importance of aligning our actions with our values, using nonviolent communication to identify unmet needs, and ways we may identify as victims.  </p><p>Mayim breaks down how the brain physically changes after having an enlightened moment and the isolation that comes with setting high standards for others. </p><p>Timber's Website: <a href=\"http://buddhistbootcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddhistBootCamp.com</a></p><p>Timber's Buddhist Boot podcast: <a href=\"https://www.buddhistbootcamp.com/podcast\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.buddhistbootcamp.com/podcast</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
