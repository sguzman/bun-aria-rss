  "description": "I'm answering Sex With Emily listener's relationship questions, with a few sex questions sprinkled in for good measure. In this show, Menace and I debate the male and female perspective on people's most common relationship issues. We tell you when to move on from an unhealthy relationship and when to stop licking your wounds in a bad breakup. We also teach how to have courage to change, and have better relationships. Sex with Emily listener's Relationship Questions: When should you let down your guard and commit to someone? How many times do you try to make a relationship work before calling it quits? How do I get over the girl I'm still in love with? What do you do when you and lover can't agree on places to meet? Is is worth it to wait to have sex? When is the right time to lose your virginity? How many dates should you go on before having sex with someone? Why do women like giving double blow jobs so much? (someone has been watching a lot of porn.) Why does eating certain things make semen taste differently? Girls like the chase, right? But when is it an exciting pursuit and when is it stalking? When should the guy give up ? When is his pursuit cute and when is it creepy ? When should he fear a restraining order? (FYI. Throwing rocks at her window in the middle of the night isn't cute, unless you're a character in a teenage Romantic Comedy.) What do I do if I queef? (Hint: Do not run away screaming or hide under a rock) Sex isn't neat and tidy. It's messy, just like relationships. You can't run away the second you start feeling vulnerable or exposed. On the other hand, you shouldn't stay in a relationship because you think you'll be lost without it. Great change requires some personal struggle. The key to relationships is finding the right person to let yourself be vulnerable with, and having the courage to leave when things no longer fit. Oh, and try not to stalk anyone. As much as women like the idea of \"the chase,\" we usually make time for people we are interested in.
