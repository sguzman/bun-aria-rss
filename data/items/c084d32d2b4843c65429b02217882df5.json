It’s always trying to make us aware of issues that are damaging our resilience and causing neurophysiological disruptions in our brain and body. However, the conscious mind and brain<em>do</em> get tired because they work on energy, like our phones. This is kind of like when we have a whole lot of apps open, the brightness is on full and we are constantly using our phone—very soon the battery will die. And, like you need to recharge your phone, you also need to recharge your brain and conscious mind.</p>\n<p>Read the show blog here:&nbsp;https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/3-ways-to-boost-mental-energy-when-you-tired-overwhelmed</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>OFFERS FROM OUR SPONSORS:</p>\n<p>-NED: <strong>If you’d like to give Ned a try, Cleaning Up&nbsp;The&nbsp;Mental Mess listeners get 15% off Ned products with code: DRLEAF.
