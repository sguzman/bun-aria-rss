  "description": "**This episode of 'The Sound of Economics' features Bruegel visiting fellow Elina Ribakova in conversation with Marc-Olivier Padis and Jean-Paul Tran Thiet about the reform of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS).**&#13;\n&#13;\nAsylum is a fundamental human right and an international obligation, first recognised in the 1951 Geneva Convention on the protection of refugees. Between 2013 and 2017, 4 million asylum applications were filed in the EU. This high number resulted in growing tensions between Member States, with some of them displaying non-cooperative behaviour.&#13;\n&#13;\nThe migration crisis of 2015 revealed the inadequacies of European legal tools and, by extension, management of migration flows. In this context, Institut Montaigne jointly with Terra Nova have written a [report](https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/publications/saving-right-asylum) which calls for a reform of the European asylum policy and for a rapid, unified response to the humanitarian emergency in the Mediterranean.&#13;\n&#13;\nIn the context of recent rise of populism and nationalist tendencies in Europe, creating a binding mechanism for solidarity is a daunting task. Currently, the EU is in the process of reshaping the Common European Asylum System, but the negotiations have shown close to no progress.&#13;\n&#13;\nIn this episode of Backstage, Elina Ribakova, a visiting fellow at Bruegel welcomes Marc-Olivier Padis, head of studies department at Terra Nova, and Jean-Paul Tran Thiet, senior fellow at Institut Montaigne, to make a case for this reform. Together, they discuss the key elements of the revised system, which include improved monitoring of the asylum process, as well as efforts for equitable burden sharing.&#13;\n&#13;\nFor further reading, we recommend our blueprint “[People on the move: migration and mobility in the European Union](http://bruegel.org/2018/01/people-on-the-move-migration-and-mobility-in-the-european-union/?utm_content=bufferf0023&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer+(bruegel))“, written by Uuriintuya Batsaikhan, Zsolt Darvas and Inês Gonçalves Raposo.&#13;\n&#13;\nZolt Darvas also contributed to the debate on migration and refugees in Europe with two blogs on similar topics: “[Beyond border control, migrant integration policies must be revived](http://bruegel.org/2018/02/beyond-border-control-migrant-integration-policies-must-be-revived/)“ and “[The challenge of fostering financial inclusion of refugees](http://bruegel.org/2017/12/the-challenge-of-fostering-financial-inclusion-of-refugees/)“.&#13;\n&#13;\nThis podcast episode was recorded during an event [Saving the right to asylum](http://bruegel.org/events/saving-the-right-to-asylum/) on March 5th, 2019.",
