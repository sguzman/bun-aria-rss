  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about Hideki Matsuyama being the first Japanese born player to win a Green Jacket, and how cool it was to see. They also chat about the Aaron Rodgers situation, and the Bob Demovsky report that the Packers haven't been in free agent negotiations because of Rodgers' current contract situation, Jonathan Kraft's comments about full stadiums, and everything else going on around the NFL as we approach the draft. Joining the program is friend of the show and NFL Network Insider, Ian Rapoport, to chat about the reports that the 49ers might not be sold on Mac Jones, how he thinks the first few picks will shake out, how certain GM's are interested about being involved in every trade conversation, and much more (27:15-53:02). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk chat about everything going on in the NFL, who they would want to see on Hard Knocks next year, and AJ recounts being in Augusta yesterday for the final round of The Masters, and how he got separated from his group 20 minutes into being there and spent the day by himself on the course (55:18-1:44:02).
