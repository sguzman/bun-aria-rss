  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, is our society experiencing an epidemic of mass psychosis? The regime fact checkers say no, but we’ll look at the evidence. Also, police officers in California pull a man from a crashed plane minutes before it’s hit by a train. It sounds like something out of an action movie but it happened in real life. And for months we were told that it’s dangerous misinformation to claim that the vaccine interferes with a woman’s menstrual cycle. But yet again, what was once misinformation has been vindicated by the evidence. Plus, Navy bootcamp will now include anti-racism training. And in our daily cancellation, we’ll cancel the LA Times columnist who argued that it is our humanitarian duty to mock unvaccinated people when they die of COVID. \nSign the petition to stop Biden’s vaccine mandate.
