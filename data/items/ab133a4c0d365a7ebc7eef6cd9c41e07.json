  "description": "<p>It’s time to bring you our first ever European athlete on the show today as we sit down with Swiss Rower Barnabe Delarze to talk about his amazing career and his amazing Olympic experiences! We find out from Barnabe the unique journey he had from playing rugby into discovering rowing and why it wasn’t exactly a sport that he took to straight away. We also find out just what the rowing scene is like in Switzerland and why so many people travel there to setup a training base in the country. Added to this we find out just why Swiss rowers are maybe some of the best partiers in the world, why finishing third in a race was up there as one of the best moments in his life and learning more about the unique event that is the Indoor Rowing World Championship. It’s an entertaining chat that you should already be listening to, so get to it!</p>",
