  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, whatever happened to the Mueller report? Sealed indictments? Here are the facts: under Barack Obama Russia annexed Crimea. Under President Trump, the most severe sanctions on Russia ever were imposed. Under Obama, no pressure on Russia, under Trump lots of pressure on Russia. Who would Putin prefer, Obama or Trump? Who would Ukraine prefer, Obama or Trump? Moreover, we witnessed a disgusting abuse of power by Rep. Adam Schiff reading selected portions of a tweet from Trump and labeling it 'witness intimidation.' Schiff omitted portions of the tweet to misrepresent what the President was saying and it was in effect impossible to intimidate her, since ex Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch didn't know the President was even tweeting because she was in fact there testifying (precisely what Schiff said Trump was intimidating from her doing). Then, Rep Elise Stefanik asked Yovanovitch of her knowledge regarding the Obama-era State Dept. concerns over Hunter Biden serving on the board of Ukrainian energy company, Burisma. Yovanovitch, while lauded as a superheroine, was largely ineffective in achieving the positive results for Ukraine that have occurred during Trump's tenure. Later, the unfree press is of concern to our nation. So many in the media try to falsely smear this program. Some outlets can't wait to get young never-Trumpers on their payroll and juxtapose them with other critics of the president. The reality here is that this program has been transparent and on the record since day one and inexperienced opportunists can't spin that.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
