  "description": "<p>When either of us are talking with someone and the conversation shifts to the fact that we own rental properties, there’s always the assumption: “It must be a huge pain to deal with maintenance issues!” or “I bet you’ve had some nightmare tenants!”. But in reality that hasn’t at all been our experience even though there are horror stories and personal anecdotes out there. We want potential investors to know that there are steps you can take to ensure that you’ll have a positive experience investing in real estate and managing properties, while simultaneously making money every month and building wealth. We even discuss property managers and when hiring one could make sense. If you’ve thought that you’ll never own rental properties because they sound like too much work, then this episode is for you!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a POG Basement IPA by Scofflaw Brewing!
