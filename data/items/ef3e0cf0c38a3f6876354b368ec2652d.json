  "title": "Vulnerability: The Key to Courage | Brené Brown",
  "description": "Vulnerability is not something I ever personally considered to be a valuable skill to cultivate. That is, until I met today’s guest, Brené Brown-- who helped me understand that being vulnerable is not about weakness, nor is it about sloppy oversharing. Instead, she argues, vulnerability is about honesty, realness, risk, and courage. All qualities that are very relevant for these turbulent times in which we are living. \nBrené is a speaker, author, podcaster, professor, and researcher who has spent 2 decades studying vulnerability and courage, along with shame and empathy. She’s written 5 number 1 New York Times best sellers. She’s had a special on Netflix. And she’s spoken to a lot of high-achieving people about the importance of vulnerability, from executive suites to the CIA to the Seattle Seahawks. \nWe recorded this conversation in 2019, during a simpler time… but her insights are evergreen.\nWhere to find Brené Brown online: \nWebsite: https://brenebrown.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BreneBrown\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brenebrown\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/brenebrown\nExcited about our upcoming New Year's Challenge?
