  "description": "Resource financier (and fan-favorite guest) Marin Katusa is back to help break down a wide range of topics—from what he calls “crossflation”... to his latest book, The Rise of America: Remaking the World Order… to why he sees a bright future for the country. Marin explains why the price of gold doesn’t need to go higher for gold miners to generate tons of cash at current prices… and how he’s positioning himself for more gains in the uranium sector. Plus, as green energy gains traction in financial media headlines, Marin shares the biggest opportunity he sees in the space over the next few years... and why he expects it to outperform stocks, gold, and even bitcoin. [38:22] Then, Daniel and I discuss the travel ban to Japan before the Olympics… We break down the cause of the excessive volatility in cryptos right now... And, turning to inflation, we debate the difference between real-world prices vs. stock market performance. [01:15:08] Today's episode of Wall Street Unplugged is sponsored by Blockchain.com.
