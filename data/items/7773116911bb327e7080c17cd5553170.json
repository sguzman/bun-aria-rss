  "description": "Our audiobook this week is The A-List by Evie Mitchell\n\n“I think my husband wants to explore kink.”\n\nRune owns a bookstore, which means he supplies me with all my reading needs.\n\nOnly, lately, those books aren’t your momma’s reading list. They aren’t even your best friend’s reading list. They’re the kind of reads that you finish in bed with one hand under the covers, then talk about with other reading-obsessed people in closed book groups on the internet.\n\nBut here’s the catch, I’m kind of into it.\n\nSatan better help me, ’cause God’s ready to forsake this little deviant.\n\nMORE EVIE MITCHELL\nDownload The A-List Link- Free Until 11 October 2021\nURL: https://www.subscribepage.com/eviemitchell\nPaperback Giveaway – Open Internationally Until 11 October 2021\nhttps://forms.gle/NDi9nVFbvp87chqN6\n\nFreebies For Listeners\n\nFree First in Series - Thunder Thighs – 4–7 October\nURL: https://books2read.com/ThunderThighs\nFree First in Series – Clean Sweep – 4-8 October\nURL: https://books2read.com/Clean-Sweep\nFree in Series – The X-List – 4-8 October\nURL: https://books2read.com/TheX-List\n\nNEW RELEASE ADVERTISING – KNOT MY TYPE\nKnot My Type\n\nURL: https://books2read.com/KnotMyType\n\nAuthor Links\nNewsletter: https://www.subscribepage.com/eviemitchell\nAmazon: www.amazon.com/author/eviemitchell\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/eviemitchellauthor\nFacebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/500800953935063\nGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/eviemitchellauthor\nBookbub: www.bookbub.com/authors/evie-mitchell\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/eviemitchellauthor\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@eviemitchellauthor\nWebsite: http://eviemitchell.com\nBingebooks: https://bingebooks.com/author/evie-mitchell \n\nOTHER BOOKS DISCUSSED\nTeach Me By Alexa Riley - https://bit.ly/39FFPSg\nJust Like Heaven by Trilina Pucci\nThe Dollmaker by Mary Burton\nSir Richard’s Portrait by Jisa Dean\nBody Search by Rochelle Paige\n727 Cummings Ave by Dani Wyatt\n\nOTHER MENTIONS\nSex Life Season 2\nBridgerton Season 2\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxp\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
