  "description": "Jase the Land Looter heads to Virginia for some metal detecting and finds something he's never seen before. He follows that up with a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day, including hours on a runway, tempers flaring, an unhinged coronavirus rant, awful manners, multiple companies refusing to rent him a car, and a guy who thinks Jase is down on his luck after \"Duck Dynasty.\" Phil looks for the pulse of America and isn't thrilled with what he finds. And the guys tackle audience questions about what it really means that there are no rules and how to break free from legalism.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
