  "description": "<p>r/AmITheA**hole OP is a student who uses a wheelchair. She's had the same wheelchair for about four years, so it's starting to look a little rough. OP has a teacher who absolutely hates OP's wheelchair, and one day in class the teacher criticizes OP for having an ugly wheelchair and demands that she upgrade to a nicer one. Somehow, the teacher managed to be both ableist and classist in a single sentence. OP stood up to the teacher and pointed out that it's none of her business, but another student pointed out that OP is the butthole for that. What do you think?</p>\n",
