  "description": "<div>We’ve been to Trader Joe’s, Costco, and Aldi, but this time we’re going BIG and hauling from major supermarket chains! In this episode, Lisa and the gang CHEW & TELL healthy food finds like the newest products from Boca,  Kodiak Cakes, and even Hello Kitty! Plus, a new cheese wedge that’s as good as Laughing Cow! But wait... There’s more!  A tasty shelf-stable breakfast find that will change the way you eat breakfast forever, and one that you should probably avoid at all costs! So hop on the grocery cart and listen now. Then head over to our <a href=\"https://hungry-girl.com/foodcast\">Foodcast</a> page to find all the products mentioned in the episode!</div>\n",
