  "description": "Hey HBs! It's time for our annual Patreon fundraiser! This year, because the need is so immediate, we're going to front a donation in anticipation of at least matching the amount we've raised in the past! This week, we're donating $1,000 to https://razomforukraine.org/razom-emergency-response/ (Razom Emergency Response), an organization with a proven track record in Ukraine who are providing medical supplies and training to civilians on the ground. \nUkraine is the most pressing emergency right now, but it's by no means the only refugee crisis. So, at the end of the month, we'll donate the balance of monies raised to https://wck.org/ (World Central Kitchen), who provide meals on the sites of refugee, humanitarian, and climate crises worldwide.\nHere are the details:\nFrom March 1st - 31st, 2022 we are doubling and donating all new and increased Patreon pledges.\nNew Pledges get doubled. So if you sign up as a $5 patron, we donate $10. If you sign up as a $50 patron, we donate $100! If you sign up as an annual patron to get the 10% discount, we double the amount for the first month, without applying the discount.\nIncreased Pledges get doubled as if you're a new patron. So, if you increase from $15 to $20, we don't double the $5 increase, we double it as if you're a brand new patron. So an increase to $20 nets a $40 donation! Once again, if you increase that on an annual basis to get our 10% discount, we donate the first month's amount without applying the discount.\nHere are https://www.greylockglass.com/2022/02/25/pair-generosity-with-caution-when-considering-aid-efforts-for-ukraine/ (more organizations to support Ukraine), compiled by Valarie Kaur.\nAnd if you want to support gender-affirming treatment for trans kids in Texas, check out https://mashable.com/article/texas-transgender-discrimination-resources (these non-profits), starting with the https://www.transtexas.org/ (Transgender Education Network of Texas).\nMentioned in this episode:\nPreorder Naima Simone X Friends Book Boyfriend Box!!\nThis box has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a book boyfriend from Tessa Bailey, Avery Flynn, Farrah Rochon, Jayci Lee, Kennedy Ryan, Adriana Herrera, and Naima Simone.\nYou can look forward to paperbacks, signed book plates, limited edition book boyfriend mugs, the book boyfriend pajamas/loungewear, bookmarks and more!\nTiers include:\n- Cinnamon Roll - $114.99\n- The Alpha - - $169.99 \nEnter the promo code BONKERS10 at checkout to receive $10 off!!! \nONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT 10, 2022!\nIf you have any questions, email orders@honeymagnolia.co.\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/nsbookboyfriends (Naima's Book Boyfriends)",
