  "description": "<div>True Crime Tuesday presents The Tuskegee Strangler w/ Author Linda Lou Long!<br>\n<br>\nJerry Marcus fooled them all. He was “a nice guy,” always helped at home, did well in school, an athlete, and always employed. When things went wrong, he was the first to help clean up the mess. He was the last person anyone suspected of being a serial killer.<br>\n<br>\nAfter Marcus was caught and sentenced to life in prison in the late ’70s, author Linda Lou Long spent years corresponding with him. TCT invites Linda onto the show to talk about Jerry, his M.O., his case file, and why, to this day, he is still one of the most dngerous men drawing breath.  <br>\n<br>\nGet your copy of \"The Tuskegee Strangler: The 'Nicest' Serial Killer They Ever Met\" here:<br>\n <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3zpp7TM\">https://bit.ly/3zpp7TM</a><br>\n<br>\nTo learn more about Microdose Gummies go to <a href=\"https://www.microdose.com/\">Microdose.com</a> and use code: darkness to get free shipping & 30% off your first order</div>\n",
