But other staff and people in the prison say she is known for abuse. In 2019, she was investigated by the Department of Corrections and State Police. Investigators had obtained 427 of the guard’s emails, revealing the conversations she’d had with other staff when it seemed like no one was looking.\nThis episode is in collaboration with the podcast Motive, from WBEZ Chicago, hosted by Shannon Heffernan.
