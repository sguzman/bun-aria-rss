  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing Adam's distaste for Hannah Barbara and Sid & Marty Kroft TV programming for children as they fleeced America for many years. The conversation then turns to some of the entertainment they've been consuming, eventually landing on a mutual love of Netflix's 'Formula 1: Drive to Survive' docuseries. Drew then brings up the current lockdowns in Shanghai and marvels at the similarities between that and what was done in Wuhan in 2020 despite the wealth of data we have now that we didn't have then. \nThanks For Supporting Today's Sponsors: \nTommyJohn.com/ADS\nTrueBill.com/ADS\nLifelock.com Promo Code Adam\nGeico.com\nPluto.TV",
