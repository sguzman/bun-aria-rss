  "description": "DeSantis busses illegals to wealthy, liberal enclave of Martha's Vineyard, Abbott sends them to Kamala Harris' VP residence. Dems freak out, but shouldn't sanctuary cities and states welcome these gifts of love? DeSantis: Democrats' virtue signaling is a fraud and indefensible. By opening the border, Biden is exacerbating the fentanyl crisis, which is killing American kids by the thousands. Buck gives the urgent plea he would give to his future teenagers about any pill that they don't know where it came from. Clay points out: \"Mexican drug cartels have more control over our southern border than our United States government. Think about that for a minute.\" On CNN, filmmaker Ken Burns unbelievably compares shipping illegals to Martha’s Vineyard to the Holocaust. America's birthright citizenship laws must be changed.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
