Already, we've mined themes of religion, addiction, and authority&nbsp;in the Nevada&nbsp;desert and powered through cathartic writing, television, and violence in the suburbs of Ohio. What a long, strange trip it's been, and it's about to get even stranger, if you can believe that.</p><br><p>Join Losers Randall Colburn, Jenn Adams, Dan Pfleegor, and Ana Marie Cox as they conclude their series on King's great twinning experiment. They'll discuss the benefits to writing as Bachman and the emotional core of this darker style. Is King funny? Would we read his published laundry list? Why is Richard Bachman so mad? All these questions and more will be answered as we discuss the author and his pseudonym.</p><br><p><strong>Follow us on </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/losersclubpod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LosersClubPod\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thelosersclubpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> </strong>| <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thebarrens\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
