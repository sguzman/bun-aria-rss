There are so many circumstantial and emotional ups and downs, and if you ride every twist and turn, it can be exhausting and discouraging. Sometimes, I almost feel like this road is somehow cursed even!!!\n\nWhen you’re hitting obstacles and setbacks, you just might be onto something!\n\nMy hope in revisiting the themes in this episode is that you’re able to find a renewed sense of creative fortitude to help you dig in when times get tough.",
