  "description": "<p>https://www.larchitect.org/</p> <p>Today’s conversation is centered around a post-industrial site on the north-eastern edge of Paris, known as Chapelle Charbon, that is soon to become a new public park for the city of Paris. As a former rail depot, the 6.5 hectare (or 16 acre) site will be developed in several phases over the next decade. As part of this process, the design firm Taktyk was commissioned to design a temporary park called La Parc de 12 Saisons or The 12 Seasons Park, that evolved over a three-year period between 2017 and 2020. Around the same time that Taktyk began their work, two other curious site explorers stepped into the scene, driven by an artistic interest in the sonic qualities of the terrain, giving voice to a historic space that had been essentially forgotten about for decades. The story begins with a serendipitous encounter between three people: Sébastien Perfornis of the landscape design firm Taktyk, John Bingham-Hall from the artistic organization Theatrum Mundi and Alexandra LaCroix, director of the opera company MPDA. We met in person in the office of Theatrum Mundi in the 8th arrondissment of Paris at the beginning of March 2020. Taktyk was represented by landscape architect Yara Falaka.</p> <p>Voi[e,x,s] Chapelle Charbon #1 (performance 22 and 23 June 2018)</p> <p><a href= \"https://vimeo.com/292686286\">https://vimeo.com/292686286</a></p> <p>Voi[e,x,s] Chapelle Charbon #2 (performance 5 October 2019)</p> <p>https://vimeo.com/384798801Theatrum-Mundi </p> <p>https://theatrum-mundi.org/project/voiexs/</p> <p>https://theatrum-mundi.org/library/voiexs_interview/Taktyk</p> <p>https://taktyk.cargo.site/12-Seasons-ParkCie MPDA</p> <p>https://www.ciempda.com/voiexschapellecharbonLe Parc des 12 saisons</p> <p> https://www.facebook.com/CollectifChapelleCharbon.Parcdes12saisons/</p>",
