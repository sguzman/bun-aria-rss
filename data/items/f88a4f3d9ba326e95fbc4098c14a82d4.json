    "media:description": "New Duke Engineering faculty member Boyuan Chen has taught AI to watch videos of physics phenomenon and successfully predict how many variables are at play in the equations defining their movement. That's the critical first step in deriving any fundamental understanding of a system's behavior. \n\nLearn more about Chen at: https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/boyuan-chen-making-general-purpose-robots-are-smarter-and-self-aware\n\nLearn more about Chen's PhD work at Columbia University at: https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/news/lipson-chen-ai-alternative-physics",
