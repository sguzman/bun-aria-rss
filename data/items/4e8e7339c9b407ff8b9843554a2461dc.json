Most of us have experienced it at least once. You are on a much anticipated road trip and your vehicle breaks down. As you’re waiting by the side of the road a mechanic who specializes in just that type of car drives up and lends a hand. <br /> <br /> Is this just chance? Can two events be related in a meaningful way without one causing the other? If so, what does this tell us about the cosmos? Can we live in such a way and make choices that encourage synchronicity? Is that something we should strive for? <br /> <br /> In LIVING IN FLOW: THE SCIENCE OF SYNCHRONICITY AND HOW YOUR CHOICES SHAPE YOUR WORLD (North Atlantic Books, March 2019, paperback) physicist Sky Nelson-Isaacs turns to quantum mechanics to seek answers. Adhering to what we know from science, while offering a provocative new hypothesis, Nelson-Isaacs proposes that the cosmos may be designed to bring us meaningful, synchronistic experiences in response to the choices we make.<br /> <br /> When we live in “flow,” a state of activity in which we align with our purpose and values, balancing our personal good with the greater good, we make choices that invite synchronicity. In addition to a layperson’s explanation of the possible physics behind synchronicity, Nelson-Isaacs shows how cultivating flow can empower us individually and help make our world a better place.<br /> <br /> ###</div> </div>",
