  "description": "<p><em>On Virtue (</em>ΠΕΡΙ ΑΡΕΤΗΣ) may not have been written by Plato. Socrates asks his friend the following questions: If virtue can be taught why were eminent Greeks of the past unable to teach their own children to be good? If virtue is a natural characteristic why aren't there specialists who can identify which children will grow up to become good? Socrates and his friend conclude that virtue must be a divine gift to the individual for the benefit of the state. Painting: <em>The Fall of the Rebel Angels</em> by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.</p>",
