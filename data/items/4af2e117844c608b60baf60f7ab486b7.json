When they click a search term, they're taken to a search results page on the publisher’s site where they can explore other relevant topics, including search ads. As a result, Related search for content can help publishers increase site engagement — including site traffic, pageviews and ad impressions — and drive incremental revenue.</p><p>As a contextual unit, Related search for content is a privacy-preserving solution. It uses page content, instead of user data, to deliver relevant search terms. Meanwhile, ads on the search page target the search term the user clicked on, rather than actual user data.</p><p>If you’re interested in using Related search for content, please contact your account manager to activate AdSense for search for your AdSense account.</p><p>For more information and future updates, check out our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/10233819?hl=en\">help page</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>",
