  "description": "<p>LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with actor, comedian, writer and all round sincere talent TONY WAY!</p><br><p>Pure goodies for you this week as Brett has a good old fashioned longform chat with Tony, and we all get to know each other that little bit more and it’s all lovely and cosy. I think I find it cosy because Brett recorded this with Tony back in them old pre-lockdown days so there’s that sense of TWO PEOPLE IN A ROOM TALKING! Anyway - it’s a really good one in any sense, as they get along great and Tony’s been in some ace stuff, so yo can expect to hear some jewels dropped on that very subject, including his bootcamp experience (I’ll leave that to him), SALACIOUS Tom Cruise stories (beat that, Buxton and Cornish!), the fine line between happy and emotionally repressed, Star Trek annoyances (I mean we all carry some, right?) and sequel controversies. I’m breaking all kinds of walls here by speaking in the first person throughout but may I say that I’m very impressed by his drum & bass knowledge when he talks about tracks that sampled Predator 2. That is WELL in my wheelhouse right there. Anyway - fourth wall all fixed and back to normal - please enjoy the brilliant TONY WAY!</p><br><p><strong><em>LINKS FOR THIS EPISODE:</em></strong></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonypaulway\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TONY on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915453/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TONY on IMDB!</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1u5uN7PlD8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>AFTERLIFE!</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFe4NUdhelU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>GIRL/HAJI!</strong></a></p><br><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brettgoldstein\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mrbrettgoldstein\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on INSTAGRAM!</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/brettgoldstein\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on PATREON!</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyHN3_ZUyuA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SUPERBOB - Brett's 2015 feature film!</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/75576061\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CORNERBOYS with BRETT & SCROOBIUS PIP!</strong></a></p><br><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/distractionpiecespodcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on FACEBOOK</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/distractionpiecesnetwork\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on INSTAGRAM</strong></a></p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith\">http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
