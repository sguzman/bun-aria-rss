  "description": "<p>In this episode of <em>Life and Books and Everything</em>, Kevin, Collin, and Justin discuss the writing process, how things have exponentially changed in the online Christian writing space, what books have most recently <em>moved </em>them, which pastor biographies are their favorite, and what message the church needs to hear most in 2020. And if nuanced discussions on culture, books, and theology don't quite do it for you, be sure to tune in to hear the guys give their best Chris Farley impressions.</p>\n<p>This episode of <em>Life and Books and Everything</em> is brought to you by <a href=\"https://www.crossway.org/\">Crossway</a>, a publisher whose goal is to publish gospel-centered, Bible-centered content that will honor our Savior and serve his Church.
