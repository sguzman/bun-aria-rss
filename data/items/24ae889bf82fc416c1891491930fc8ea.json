  "description": "Dems close the election blaming GOP for Pelosi attack, not on issues. Ron DeSantis fires up NY crowd for Lee Zeldin. No, we won't let bygones be bygones on covid. In fact, Buck says, \"No freakin' way!\" Democrats: The OG of election deniers. Senator Mike Lee of Utah joins Clay and Buck to talk about his battle for reelection. C&B wish a Happy Halloween, but Buck notes regarding inflation, including the price of candy: \"In Biden's America, what's next? One Reese's piece instead of pieces?\" Clay quips about his three sons' treats, \"I take part of their fries, some of their candy, they yell, 'Dad Tax!' I say, 'Hey, get used to it if you want to live in America!'\"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
