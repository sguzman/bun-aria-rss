  "description": "<p>On today's show, Los Angeles Chargers GM, the man who was instrumental in drafting Pat to the Colts, Tom Telesco joins the show. Pat and Tom chat about how he thinks the draft went given all the potential for failure, how&nbsp;the Chargers liked both Justin Herbert and Tua and were more than happy to take whoever was available, whether or not Cam Newton was ever potentially apart of the plan for the Chargers, and Tom breaks down the rest of the Chargers draft class (3:42-18:01). Also included is the newest installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ still try to make sense of the Packers draft class (it still makes no sense), they dive into the government declassifying the UFO videos even though we've already all seen them, and AJ starts to come around to Pat's side as he declares that Roger Goodell is in fact, his commissioner (19:01-1:36:10). To close out the show, Senior NBA writer and analyst for The Athletic and Stadium, Scoops McGee himself, Shams Charania joins the show. Pat and Shams discuss the new developments in the NCAA allowing student athletes to make money off their names and likenesses and what that means for the future and whether or not it is a direct response to the top 3 players in the nation decommitting from college and deciding to go to the G League, how Shams ended up getting into breaking NFL draft picks on draft night, and what he is hearing about the NBA season starting to open up facilities for players and how it seems like we still might be a ways away from the season starting (1:36:12-1:50:07). Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're watching the show for a chance to win some free merch. As always, hang in there and stay safe, we're all in this together. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
