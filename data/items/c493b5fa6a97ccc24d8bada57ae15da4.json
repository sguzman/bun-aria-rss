    "media:description": "John Bauters, the very popular and Twitter-famous biking mayor of Emeryville, California was in New York City on a business trip - but he found a few hours on his final day to take a bike loop with eager advocates and fans who wanted to meet him in person due to his commitment to make his city a more equitable and safe transportation.\n\nStreetfilms has been talking to Mayor Bauters for months about a meet up profile and exclusively rode with him to the meet up organized by Transportation Alternatives. For a relatively last minute arranged gathering 15 folks rode with the mayor to chat and talk about what they're doing to make the city more people-friendly and offer up the great and not-so-great parts about bicycling here.\n\nThe charming Mayor Bauters and his city council are trying to change his city dramatically. What might shock you to hear is that Bauters does not receive a salary (he does get a small monthly stipend) and no one the Emeryville government has a staff!!  He holds a full-time as the nonprofit policy director on behalf of victims of violent crime and as an advocate for investments in community-based behavioral health programs that promote wellness and community safety.\n\nHe loves bicycling. Walking. Hiking. Just being out in his community and interacting.",
