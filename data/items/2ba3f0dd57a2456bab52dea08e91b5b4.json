  "description": "Ruth and Pip haven’t seen much of Ben and Beth recently. When they do see Ben he’s always in a rush and doesn’t answer his phone.  They photograph the bed and breakfast room for the website. It’s looking good, apart from a dreadful watercolour by Leonard.  Later, when Jill drops a hint to say Leonard should have the first night there, they realise  they’ve been had. Leonard has arrived with his overnight bag. And it’s the room next to Jill’s…\nRex has taken the boat to a quiet spot.  He’s fishing, and remembering Bert, who died a year ago.  Ben comes by, having just come off his bike.  He’s not hurt, but he’s having to push the bike. Rex says he’s got a spare rod if Ben would like to join him.  They reminisce about Bert, who valued and liked Ben. Ben finds that hard to hear.  He’s bitterly self-deprecating; Bert was wrong about him. Rex is concerned, and asks if Ben’s ok.  Ben says he’s fine, there’s nothing to tell. \nChelsea’s trying to do some coursework, but Jazzer can see that her mind is elsewhere.  He’s concerned about her, so he stays with her.  He helps her to think it through. She tells Jazzer that it’s been so hard, but she knows she’s doing the right thing by ending the pregnancy.  She’s scared though.  Jazzer tells her to let the doctors and nurses know how she’s feeling when the time comes.  He’s kind and comforting, and encourages her to sleep.",
