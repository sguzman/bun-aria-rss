  "description": "Somali British poet Warsan Shire has had many projects, including running a popular Tumblr page and collaborating with Beyoncé. Now, she is out with a new collection of poems called Bless <em>The Daughter Raised By A Voice In Her Head</em>. That title is an ode to how she was raised, having to take on a lot of responsibility from a young age.
