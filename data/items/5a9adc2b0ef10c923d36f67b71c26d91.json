  "description": "<p>One thing I’ve learned is that people are almost always wrong about why they aren’t succeeding in business (and life). They think they’re not a “born leader.” They think they aren’t selling because their product or service isn’t priced low enough. They’re worried that if they really put themselves into their brand, it won’t fly with people. The truth is, problems can be traced to flaws in how you operate as a person.  In this episode, I talk about what those are and how you can get them straight.</p>",
