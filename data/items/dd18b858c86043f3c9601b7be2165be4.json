  "title": "PMS 2.0 279 - OVERREACTION MONDAY, Week 7 NFL Recap, Travis Kelce, Matt Hasselbeck, Ian Rapoport, Darius Butler, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys dive into Overreaction Monday for week 7 of the NFL and recap all the games, and discuss whether or not the Patriots are potentially dead, if the Steelers are the class of the AFC, Aaron Rodgers' bounce back game against the Texans, the Lions improbable win, and everything else from week 7 of the NFL. Also joining the show is Super Bowl Champion, 5x Pro Bowler, 4x All-Pro, member of the 2010's NFL All-Decade Team, and current starting TE for the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce. Pat and Travis chat about his time in Kansas City, what it's like being on a team with that many weapons, how good Patrick Mahomes is, his pregame outfits, and what Patrick Mahomes got him for National TE's Day (23:03-44:26). Next, 18 year NFL veteran at QB, current cohost of ESPN Sunday NFL Countdown, friend of the program, Matt Hasselbeck joins the show. Pat, AJ Hawk, and Matt chat about week 7 of the NFL season, what's impressed him the most so far, his thoughts on Russell Wilson and the Seahawks and Kyler Murray and the Cardinals, what he thinks is going on in Dallas and how it can be changed, if the Packers loss was an anomaly after how well they played Sunday, and his thoughts on tonight's MNF game (48:12-1:06:34). Next, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport joins the program to chat about his recent suspension, how tough it was not breaking news, what he's hearing about potential trades, and whether or not Mike McCarthy is going to get another year in Dallas (1:06:36-1:19:42). Later, 9 Year NFL vet at DB, cohost of the Man-To-Man Pod, Everything DB, Darius Butler joins the show to chat about week 7 of the NFL, and he gives a few gambling locks for tonight's Monday Night game between the Bears and Rams (1:19:44-1:41:58). Closing out the show is another edition of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ chat about week 7 in the NFL, and look ahead to tonight's Monday Night Football game (1:42:00-2:04:02).
