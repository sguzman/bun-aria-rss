  "description": "In today’s world, we can sometimes struggle to find the time to build healthy, long-lasting habits that we can execute on a daily basis. Many times, habits feel like difficult chores that are constantly being pushed out of the way by the hustle of life. Whether it’s work, raising kids, chores around the house or marriage, there are always things taking up time in our busy schedules, preventing us from building habits. On this episode of Health Theory, medical doctor and author of “Feel Better in 5,” Rangan Chatterjee, joins Tom Bilyeu to discuss the power of five-minute habits and how you can change your identity, as well as your health, through small and easy steps to take every day. They discuss the importance of your heart and spirit, how to build five-minute habits into your everyday routine, how to actually change behaviors, easy mental health hacks you can use everyday, how identity is connected to and shaped by action, and how beginning with just one small habit everyday can change your health for good.   Buy “Feel Better in 5”:  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Feel-Better-Your-Daily-Great/dp/1950665682/ref\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Feel-Better-Your-Daily-Great/dp/1950665682/ref</a>=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr= This episode is brought to you by: Butcher Box: New members can get 2 lobster tails and 2 filet mignons for FREE when you sign up at butcherbox.com/IMPACT ISSUU: ISSUU.com/podcast and use promo code IMPACTTHEORY at checkout for your FREE account or 50% off your premium account.
