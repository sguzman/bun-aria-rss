Anderson, Quinta Jurecic, Alan Rozenshtein and a special guest sit down on the podcast <em>Rational Security</em> to have a more casual and freewheeling conversation about national security stories in the news. Today, we thought we'd share one of our favorite <em>Rational Security</em> episodes from the past year, originally released on October 13. This episode features Washington Post reporter Shane Harris, himself a former co-host of the earlier iteration of <em>Rational Security</em> and current cohost of <em>Lawfare</em>’s newest podcast offering: the long-form interview show <em>Chatter</em>. They talked about spies, peanut butter, what spies do with peanut butter, and how the Queen feels about nicking bent coppers.</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
