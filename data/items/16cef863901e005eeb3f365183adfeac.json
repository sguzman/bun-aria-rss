  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week, we’re thrilled to have Rebecca Romney with us! Rebecca is a rare books dealer and the woman behind The Romance Novel in English, a 100-lot collection of rare romance novels and other romance-adjacent paraphernalia. We had a great time talking to her about the collection, her motivation to develop it, her hopes for its future at the Lilly Library at the University of Indiana, and about how romance lovers can start thinking about collecting books! We hope you love this one as much as we did!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our next read along is Uzma Jalaluddin’s <em>Hana Khan Carries On</em>.

She is the cofounder of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.typepunchmatrix.com\">Type Punch Matrix</a>, a rare books firm based in Washington DC. She started out working at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.baumanrarebooks.com\">Bauman Rare Books in Las Vegas.</a>&nbsp;You can also watch her in action from old appearances on Pawn Stars where&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/0RA_B5p2JYg\">she routinely broke people’s hearts about the values of their rare books.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Rebecca recently put together a collection that was purchased by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://libraries.indiana.edu/lilly-library\">Lilly Library at the University of Indiana</a>&nbsp;called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.typepunchmatrix.com/images/upload/the-romance-novel-in-english-online.pdf\">The Romance Novel in English: A Survey in English 1769-1999.</a>&nbsp;You can follow Lilly Librarian&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/arkhamlibrarian\">Rebecca</a>&nbsp;on twitter; they sound like a great resource for romance, and for planning a visit!&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">On the episode, we extensively discuss some of the general themes and specific items in the catalogue. Two authors that didn’t make it into the catalogue because Rebecca couldn’t find copies:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://virginia-anthology.org/eliza-haywood/\">Eliza Haywood</a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/6053/6053-h/6053-h.htm\">Evelina by Frances Burney.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Elizabeth Lowell book&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3CksLhJ\">about a gold dealer in Las Vegas is called Running Scared</a>&nbsp;and is part of the Rarities Unlimited series.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/collections/sc/silver-gold/1FV4Adw2HiXzWbi3779CSV\">Gold books aren't really a thing</a>, but&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.ceu.hu/medstud/manual/MMM/gilding.html\">gold leaf and illumiated manuscripts are</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Here’s an explainer on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/gutenberg-bible\">The Gutenberg Bible</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/67n3PH9wawE\">a clip from Pawn Stars where an individual leaf is available</a>, and here is a page from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/news/gutenberg-bible-leaf-be-auctioned\">a 2021 auction site selling a leaf</a>. But remember that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.printmuseum.org/blog/2021-aapi-historymonth-pt1\">bookmaking in China</a>&nbsp;was far more advanced at that time.

On our Trailblazers episode with Radclyffe, she&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2021/10/10/s0405-trailblazer-radclyffe\">talked about the importance of queer bookstores.&nbsp;</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">What is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/books/rarebooks/collecting-guide/what_books_collect/advanced-copies.shtml\">difference between ARCs and first editions</a>?
