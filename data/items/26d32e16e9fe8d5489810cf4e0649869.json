  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/pay-off-mortgage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Paying off your mortgage early</strong></a>—to some people, this sounds like a dream scenario. But to others, it could be a cash-tastrophe. We can already hear real estate investors yelling out “always use leverage”, “what about the low interest rates!?”, and “you can scale so much quicker!” Like many real estate investors, David Greene knows<strong> the power of leverage and loans to buy rental properties</strong> faster. But, it’s safe to say that for some people, paying off a property or <strong>buying a home in cash may be a much smarter move</strong>.</p><p>Welcome back to another episode of <strong>Seeing Greene</strong> where David answers questions directly from BiggerPockets listeners and viewers on YouTube. This time around, we have some seriously useful questions being answered for the new investor. These questions range from <strong>when to take out a loan </strong>and <strong>when to pay off a property</strong>, how to get started in real estate in your early twenties, <strong>how to build more cash flow</strong> as your expenses increase, <strong>how to get a HELOC on your rental property</strong>, and <strong>how to raise money for a down payment</strong>.
