  "description": "<p>This episode is chock full of personal finance gold. Sure, we spend a good amount of time talking about negotiating, but we also cover intentional spending, the psychology behind being smart with your money, and rethinking the money ‘truths’ we’ve grown up with. We are stoked to have Ramit Sethi join us as we cover all those topics and more, which can also be found in his book ‘I Will Teach You to be Rich’ (and stick around to the end as we’re giving away a few copies as well)! Ramit has written about personal finance for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and is a veteran in the personal finance community. Living a rich life is different for everyone and we’re glad to have Ramit Sethi on this episode to remind us to dream big.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed a cold brewed coffee since we recorded this episode in the morning (back with craft beer next week)!
