  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we have a tendency to hold on to the past? Why do we continue to let the most painful experiences in our lives not only influence, but control our future? And what would life look like if we were able to let go of the past, shed the stories that we carry with us and move forward in a way that is untethered to the pain?</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Welcome to the Tony Robbins Podcast. In this episode of the real breakthrough series, we’re diving into a particularly sensitive subject - letting go of past trauma.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of you may have endured unspeakable trauma in your lives. But as horrific as these experiences were, you may continue to hold on to them, fervently at times. Because letting go can be terrifying.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But holding on has profound consequences of its own. We continue to give the pain power. We keep cords of energy tied to the people that hurt us. We even let these terrible experiences become part of our identity.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode, you’re going to hear from JoLynn - a woman who endured tremendous trauma in her past. And for years, decades even, she allowed that pain to dictate her life. She lived in a story of hurt, and she suffered massively because of it. But by working with Tony, she was able to step outside of that pain and gain a new level of understanding and perspective. And in a moment, she broke through to the other side - where she was able to let go, find forgiveness and choose a life of love and appreciation.</span></p>",
