Andrea explains how she was inspired to write this book looking back on her fondness for grocery shopping—and how her family would improvise with ingredients they found in the US rather than what they were used to cooking with in Vietnam, and making delicious adaptations with them. Andrea welcomes everyone to learn a few Vietnamese techniques and dishes and have fun with them. Cathy and Andrea also talk about the strides food media has made in recent years in celebrating writers of color and cooking from diverse perspectives.</p>\n<p><em>Eat Your Words</em> is powered by <a href=\"https://simplecast.com\">Simplecast</a>.</p>\n",
