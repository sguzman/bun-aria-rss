  "description": "<p>Emmy-winning writer and actress&nbsp;Sonia&nbsp;Manzano,&nbsp;who played &ldquo;Maria&rdquo; on <em>Sesame Street</em> for more than 40 years, talks to host&nbsp;Kevin Burke&nbsp;about growing up in the South Bronx and how she draws on the &ldquo;love and chaos&rdquo; of her childhood to teach children&mdash;something she&rsquo;s still doing through her new animated series for PBS Kids, <em>Alma&rsquo;s Way.</em>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Filmed in Manhattan and Queens, <em>Sesame Street</em> wasn&rsquo;t that far from Sonia&rsquo;s own hometown in New York City. <em>Sesame Street</em> is a fictional place that evokes city life from the stoop to the subway and apartments above stores. But Sonia grew up in the very real place of the South Bronx&mdash;most vividly on Third Avenue near Crotona Park. How different was Sonia&rsquo;s New York from the one she helped to create as Maria? On our TVs, Sonia gave us something we needed: a feeling of love and safety, empathy and imagination. Where did she find these things when she was a kid?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is a two-part episode. In the first part, Sonia takes us from the world of <em>Sesame Street</em>&mdash;actually, her audition&mdash;back to her beginnings in the South Bronx. And in part two, she explains how she got from the Bronx to <em>Sesame Street</em> and lived a second childhood as an adult with experiences to share.
