  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 12/13/21",
  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, a tornado-ravaged Kentucky over the weekend is a reminder that life can be fleeting. Despite that, the blame game is disgusting, whether it's President Biden or FEMA they're both spinning this horrific event as a human-caused disaster rather than a natural disaster. Sadly, the media just allows these lies to go unchecked and promulgates this propaganda. Then, NBC's Chuck Todd asks whether it's better to get the virus or get the vaccine, this program will tell you that you can get the virus even though you have already gotten the vaccine and boosters. Therapeutics such, as monoclonal antibodies championed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are available and are life-saving for the public. This is not an either/or scenario and people should be free to choose what is best for their own health. Later, New York schools used $9 million from coronavirus relief funds to introduce Critical Race Theory disguised as Social and Emotional Learning (SEL). The U.S Secretary of Education supported the idea of using these funds to create agents of social change targeting cultural and linguistic inequity. Afterward, Barak Ravid, an Israeli journalist playing both sides of the fence, continues to cause a stir over an interview he's done with former President Trump. So the question becomes who gave Trump such bad advice with respect to even meeting with Ravid.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
