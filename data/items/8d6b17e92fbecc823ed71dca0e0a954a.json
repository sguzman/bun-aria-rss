  "description": "<p>On this week's round up of all things Olympic & Paralympic, we ask is Tiger Woods' US Masters victory the greatest sporting comeback ever? Or, do the historical issues in his personal life detract from his achievement on the fairways and greens at Augusta National? And, can Tiger end his career with Olympic Gold in Tokyo to add to all his major titles?</p><br><p>It was a comeback of sorts for BBC Sport this weekend too. They were able to show the final two rounds of The Masters live - the final round on free to air television on a Sunday afternoon too. Is there a lesson for other sports and events that terrestrial television coverage is essential for their future prospects? Also, on BBC Sport this weekend were the European Gymnastics Championships with Max Whitlock winning gold and the British Skateboarding Championships in Salford with ten year old Sky Brown triumphing.</p><br><p>Meanwhile, will BBC Athletics broadcaster Steve Cram be able to combine his role as a commentator if he is appointed the new chair of British Athletics? We debate the issues around being a sports commentator whilst also having close links with the competitors you are required to broadcast about. </p><br><p>And, we round up another 7 days of sport at all levels with Michael talking about his experiences of being at the Duathlon event in Stockton on Tees this weekend. Is this London 2012 legacy in action? Can your home town attract major sporting events? Plus, Barry Middleton retires from international hockey, London's Olympic Park has a busy few months and Great Britain wins a windsurfing medal at the European Championship.</p><br><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
