  "title": "Ep 81 | White House’s Female Fighter Reveals the TRUTH of Working for Trump | Sarah Huckabee Sanders | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "For the first two-and-a-half years of Donald Trump’s presidency, Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced an unprecedented media assault on the administration, herself, and her family. She was infamously kicked out of a restaurant just for daring to show up and was the first press secretary to require Secret Service protection. Now, as attacks against Trump only grow more intense, she joins Glenn to give a firsthand account of the hatred and hypocrisy the media shows toward the president and those who side with him. And she provides what the media refuses to do: an honest, truthful look at Trump. From his successes in the Middle East to REAL stories of how highly he speaks of our troops, she knows, “This is someone who loves America.”\n\nThis Week’s Sponsors:\n\nLosing your hair is no fun.
