Hot Seat/Cool Throne including trips to the dentist and why no one should ever do that (00:29:13 - 00:50:06). Our good friend Max Homa joins the show fresh off this win at a very real tournament to talk about winning the very real tournament and what that means now that hes won a very real tournament that is not fake whatsoever (00:50:06 - 01:18:36).
