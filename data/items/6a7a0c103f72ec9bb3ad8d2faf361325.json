  "description": "<p>Mack Flavelle is the Co-Founder of CryptoKitties, Dapper Labs, and Big Head Club. CryptoKitties was instrumental in establishing the ERC-721 standard, which is the base for the vast majority of NFTs. Mack helped launch NBA Top Shot and StonerCats, and that just begins to cover his impact in the space.</p> <p>Needless to say, Mack has had a prolific career and pioneered many innovations for NFTs. His creativity and boundless energy powers this conversation about the history of culture on the blockchain, and a discussion of his more recent and upcoming projects leads to bold predictions about the future.</p> <p>Mack is a fascinating character, and we wouldn't expect anything less from one of the founding fathers of the NFT movement.</p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://jpegs.banklesshq.com/\">https://jpegs.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST<br /> APPLE: <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/overpriced-jpegs/id1591954323\"> https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/overpriced-jpegs/id1591954323</a> <br />  SPOTIFY: <a href= \"https://open.spotify.com/show/5G2HSDneVg8mZUQ3zUIoLX?si=6d57ee1f89184974\"> https://open.spotify.com/show/5G2HSDneVg8mZUQ3zUIoLX?si=6d57ee1f89184974</a> <br />  ------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>👀 ZERION | YOUR NFT PORTFOLIO<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Zerion\">https://bankless.cc/Zerion</a> </p> <p>💸 ONJUNO | YOUR CRYPTO PAYCHECK<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/OnJuno\">https://bankless.cc/OnJuno</a> </p> <p>🌊 INDEX COOP | METAVERSE INDEX<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/MVI\">https://bankless.cc/MVI</a> </p> <p>🦄 BLOCK::BLOCK | METAVERSE IP<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/blockblock\">https://bankless.cc/blockblock</a> </p> <p>------</p> <p>Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 3:30 Mack Flavelle and Cats<br /> 10:12 CryptoKitties and ERC 721<br /> 13:56 Inflection Points<br /> 19:14 Pink Cat Villain<br /> 22:59 Innovations & Explosions<br /> 28:01 The Price of Kitties<br /> 36:10 New Major IP<br /> 42:30 Ronin & Death Poems<br /> 50:59 Big Head Club<br /> 56:32 Lessons from StonerCats<br /> 1:01:54 Ghostbusters Etc<br /> 1:04:05 The Big Questions<br /> 1:11:27 Closing</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Big Head Club<br /> <a href= \"https://www.bighead.club/\">https://www.bighead.club/</a> </p> <p>Japanese Death Poems<br /> <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Death-Poems-Written-Monks/dp/0804831793\"> https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Death-Poems-Written-Monks/dp/0804831793</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
