  "title": "PMS 2.0 149 - The Next Coach Of The Cleveland Browns. Cowboys Delaying The Dump Jason Garrett Party? Plus Other Above Average Stuff",
  "description": "On today’s show, Pat and the boys look ahead to this weekend’s Wild Card games and chat about how tough it will be to actually bet against the Patriots despite the Titans looking like a team that could give them some trouble, and revisit the Rose Bowl game and why it has lost some of it’s luster being after the CFB Playoff games. The guys also talk Oregon QB Justin Herbert and whether or not he is going to be a successful Quarterback in the NFL, discuss Tua Tagovailoa’s upcoming decision on whether he will stay in college or make the jump for the NFL and if he has anything left to prove in college or if declaring for the draft would be the wise move. Also joining the show is 10x Pro Bowler, 9x All-Pro, future Hall of Famer, cohost of the ThomaHawk Show podcast and friend of the show, former Cleveland Browns Tackle, Joe Thomas. Joe and Pat discuss the Browns coaching search and what he thinks about the report that Urban Meyer is who Cleveland is eyeing to be the next coach of the Browns, what the issues with the Browns are and if hiring a new coach will solve some of those, what it takes to be a successful coach in the NFL, he throws a surprise name into the coaching search, and gives out his Super Bowl pick (22:49-33:53). Also joining the show is Cowboys beat writer for The Athletic, Jon Machota. He dives into all the Jason Garrett drama in Dallas and why it has been so difficult for Jerry to part ways with Jason Garrett, who he thinks the next coach could potentially be, and whether or not most of the staff will be let go or retained (46:19-51:31). Pat also dives into what he thinks will happen next NFL season in terms of the CBA which involves a 19 week season with 2 byes, and gives a pretty easy solution for dealing with potentially adding international teams. The guys also go through some notable news with Nick to see what’s making waves around the world. It’s the first weekend of the new decade, come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
