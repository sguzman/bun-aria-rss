  "description": "<p>This is the soundtrack to the first Video ROMA I recorded for the good folks who <a href=\"https://chrisryanphd.com/support/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">support the podcast</a> via my new web site. I found the experience to be surprisingly intimate. For as little as $2/month, you get a monthly video ROMA, access to all the podcast-related ebooks (so far, Tangentially Reading, and Tangentially Talking Drugs -- Tangentially Talking Sex coming soon). I decided to make this one available to everyone. I'll keep doing occasional ROMAs on this open platform, but not as often.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.chrisryanphd.com/support\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please consider supporting this podcast.</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music: “Brightside of the Sun,” by</span> <a href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Basin and Range</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; “Life Upside Down” by <a href=\"https://brettnewski.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brett Newski</a>; “Smoke Alarm,” by</span> <a href=\"https://www.carsieblanton.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carsie Blanton</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p> </p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
