  "title": "A Very Square Peg: A Podcast Series about Polymath Robert Eisler. Episode 6: Negative Interest",
  "description": "Warning: Economics. In this episode, we begin with Eisler’s testimony before the skeptical Senators of the Committee on Banking and Currency in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1934, in which he proposed that the nation adopt a dual currency system to control inflation and end the Great Depression. I (a non-economist) talk about what this means with noted economist Miles Kimball, who has recently brought renewed attention to Eisler’s plan in his own work. We also learn about Eisler’s theory of who actually wrote what we call the Gospel of John, talk with Steven Wasserstrom about Eisler’s brief involvement with Carl Jung and the Eranos Conference, and interpret a “dream poem” that Eisler recorded at his mother’s house in 1936.\nGuests: Guests: Miles Kimball (The University of Colorado-Boulder), Steven Wasserstrom (Reed College).\nVoice of Robert Eisler: Caleb Crawford\nAdditional voices: Brian Evans\nMusic: “Shibbolet Baseda,” recorded by Elyakum Shapirra and His Israeli Orchestra.\nFunding provided by the Ohio University Humanities Research Fund and the Ohio University Honors Tutorial College Internship Program.\nSpecial thanks to the Warburg Institute.\n\nBibliography and Further Reading\nBuiter, Willem H. “Is Numérairology the Future of Monetary Economics?
