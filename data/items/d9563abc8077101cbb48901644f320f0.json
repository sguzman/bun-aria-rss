  "description": "In August of 1983, a 20-year-old woman working as a cocktail waitress and a DJ was found strangled to death in a vacant field in Texas. When police began investigating her murder, they released the sketch of a mystery man they called “the cowboy”, hoping someone could identify him. Then, her mother began receiving threatening calls from an unknown man, but police had no idea if they were coming from her killer, or who her killer even was.
