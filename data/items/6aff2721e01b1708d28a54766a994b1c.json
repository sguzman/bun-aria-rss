  "description": "Talking about secure networks is like talking about safe pools. A pool is just a body of water, and if it has enough water to swim in, then it has more than enough water to drown in. A pool is inherently unsafe. We, therefore, take care in how we use a pool: We don?t swim alone; we don?t run around the pool; we don?t dive in the shallow end; and we don?t swim less than 15 minutes after eating. (Is that 15-minute rule still a thing?) These pool-safety policies ensure that our use of the pool is as safe as possible, but they do not make the pool safe in and of itself.",
