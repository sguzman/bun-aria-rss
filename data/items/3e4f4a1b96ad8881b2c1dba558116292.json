  "title": "262: Why We're All Suffering from Racial Trauma (Even White People) -- and How to Handle It | Resmaa Menakem",
  "description": "It’s easy to think of racism as a virus that lives in your head. But my guest today makes a compelling case that it also lives, in very profound and often unseen ways, in your body. Resmaa Menakem is a therapist and trauma specialist based in Minneapolis. He’s also the author of an excellent book called My Grandmother’s Hands, which people in my life have been recommending to me for years. Resmaa’s work is all about healing our bodies -- and, by extension, our nation -- from racialized trauma. And in Resmaa’s philosophy, racial trauma lives on in bodies of all colors, including white bodies such as mine. Resmaa gives voice to a new lexicon -- terms like “white body supremacy” and “somatic abolitionism” -- and don’t worry, he’ll explain it all as the interview progresses. He will also share practices that bring you into your body. And he has very provocative thoughts about how white people can do their part way beyond the current news cycle.\nWhere to find Resmaa Menakem online: \nWebsite: https://www.resmaa.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ResmaaMenakem\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/resmaa \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/resmaamenakem/ \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/rmenakem\nBook Mentioned:\nMy Grandmother’s Hands: https://www.resmaa.com/store/my-grandmothers-hands-hardcover\nCheck our our new, free collection of meditations called Relating to Race in the Ten Percent Happier app: https://10percenthappier.app.link/RelatingToRace \nOther Resources Mentioned:\nMalcolm X: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X\nStamped from the Beginning By Ibram X Kendi: https://www.ibramxkendi.com/stamped-from-the-beginning \nCherry Blossom Experiment: https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190326-what-is-epigenetics\nResmaa’s courses: https://www.resmaa.com/courses\nAdditional Resources:\nTen Percent Happier Live: https://tenpercent.com/live\nCoronavirus Sanity Guide: https://www.tenpercent.com/coronavirussanityguide\nFree App access for Frontline Workers: https://tenpercent.com/care\nFull Shownotes: https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/resmaa-menakem-262\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
