  "description": "We're wrapping up Tiny Critter Week with a reprise of one of our favorite episodes — nudibranchs. In this episode, Maddie and Emily got super nerdy, diving into the incredible world of nudibranchs. These sea slugs eye-catching for their colors, and some of them have evolved to \"steal\" abilities from other organisms — from the power of photosynthesis to the stinging cells of their venomous predators.<br/><br/>We'd love to hear which tiny critters you love — and which leave you puzzled. Reach us by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:shortwave@npr.org\">shortwave@npr.org</a>.",
