  "description": "Almost all of us can make our own hair, but there's something about the way the Thirst Objects of this episode grow the stuff on their faces that required close and thirsty examination. This bumper episode starts with John Krasinski, who has been steadily building his thirst-worthiness (and those pecs) since he was (Slim) Jim in The Office. What is it about that beard that flicked a switch? Then we moved onto Will Smith, who transitioned from the Fresh Prince into an internet uncle, but also sometimes has the facial hair of... a zaddy? Finally, we visited Kensington Palace to ponder the allure of Prince Harry's ginger beard, and how it thoroughly seduced us into overlooking some past fuckery. THE POWER OF BEARDS, MAN. Things get *very* thirsty this ep, and that's before we even get to Fanfic Wars. Fasten your wig extra securely: the drabbles are A Lot this week. Grab a col' drank and settle in, thirst-buckets!\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line!
