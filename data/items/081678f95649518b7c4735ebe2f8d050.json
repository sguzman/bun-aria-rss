  "description": "<p>Tom Sewid will be my guest tonight. Tom is a Native Watchman from coastal British Columbia. For the next couple of nights, I will be having Tom on to share with us encounters and stories from the First Nation people. I think you will really enjoy these episodes. It is a great chance to learn about Sasquatch.</p> <p>Tom will be sharing with us his own personal encounters with Sasquatch, as well as his views on the Sasquatch from a First Nations perspective. Tom has spent many years in the bush alone, living off of the land. He also works as a commercial fisherman and shares his encounter when he was anchored off of the coast line. Tom says, “we were really close to shore when two of the creatures approached, I turned my spot light on and got a clear view of the creatures. There was several people on board and I raised my rifle to shoot one but I was unable to pull the trigger.”</p> <p>Tom will be sharing not only his own personal encounters on Sasquatch but also historical accounts. We might even get into Dogman and the little people.</p>",
