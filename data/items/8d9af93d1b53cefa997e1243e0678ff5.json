  "description": "<p>How do you balance both the weight and the sense of possibility of pursuing a massive dream? Especially when you feel you’re representing generations and building a life and living in a very public way, from your earliest years?</p><br><p>We all know the story of the American Dream goes: move to America in pursuit of a better life. One with more resources, access, and opportunities, not just for yourself, but your kids, who so often hold in their hands the dreams and expectations and sacrifices of those who came before them and made it possible for them to be where they are today. It can be quite the burden. On the other hand, there’s the dream side of the equation. The example of making hard choices and taking action in the belief that amazing things are possible. My guest today, acclaimed actor, JoAnna Garcia Swisher, learned this from her dad.</p><br><p>In our eye-opening conversation today about the complexities of navigating Hollywood as a young child and woman, how the values instilled by her father molded her and the boundaries that sustain her career, and more, JoAnna and I explore the shifting nature of how stories are told in media and their ability to help us relate to one another, feel joy or even grieve. So join us, as she and I dive deeper into her background and then bring it back to the big picture, which is the powerful nature of dreams, joy, and storytelling.&nbsp;</p><br><p>You can find JoAnna at: <a href=\"https://www.thehappyplacepresents.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thehappyplace/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Happy Place Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jogarciaswisher/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JoAnna's Instagram</a></p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode </strong>you’ll also love the conversations we had with <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/good-life-project/id647826736?i=1000459160630\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Marin Hinkle</a> about navigating life in the public eye.</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My New Book </strong><a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a></li><li><strong>My New Podcast </strong><a href=\"https://pod.link/1610198312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SPARKED</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sponsors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Our Sponsor Page For a Complete List of Vanity URLs & Discount Codes.</a></li><li><a href=\"http://airdoctorpro.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Air Doctor</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Code GOODLIFE. 35% discount</li><li><a href=\"http://sleepnumber.com/goodlife\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Sleep Number</strong></a><strong>:</strong> $500 on the Sleep Number 360® c4 smart bed queen</li><li><a href=\"http://zapier.com/GLP\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Zapier</strong></a></li></ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
