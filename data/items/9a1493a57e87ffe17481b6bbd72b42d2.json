  "description": "<p>Apolgies! Life caught up with us in a big way lately, and rather than skip this week entirely we put together a little surprise instead. This supplemental episode is a collection of bloopers, digressions, and other outtakes from almost the entire run of our show so far. Enjoy this collection of things we consider good enough to keep, even if they didn't quite fit in the episodes they were recorded for. Next week, the 7th of August, a regular episode will go up, and we'll resume our biweekly schedule from there.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n",
