I can sense what medical conditions and illnesses a person has, I can facilitate energetic healings, I can see energy fields—and I can communicate with spirits both alive and dead. I can work from anywhere; it’s rare I’m with someone while scanning them.\nIn addition, I can scan animals, access people’s past lives, and remove ghosts from homes and other buildings, and I can tell how close to death someone is.\nI’m not one of those psychics who’s had dead people stalking her since childhood. Well, at least if I did, I didn’t know it. I learned the basics of how to do energy work more than 25 years ago, added and refined my own techniques over the years, and have been doing it ever since.\nI turn my abilities on and off at will. I don’t go around scanning everyone. It’s an ethical thing with me. Someone’s private information is theirs to share only if they wish, so I scan only when I have permission and then keep all information about someone completely confidential.\nAlthough the psychic and medical intuitive aspects of my life have been amazing side interests, I’m basically a businesswoman, an inventor, an author, and a serial entrepreneur. During my 35-year career, I’ve invented surgical devices that are sold throughout the world and founded several companies in the medical, natural gas, advertising, long-term care, compliance, and data breach prevention industries.\nMost importantly, however, I’m a wife, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
