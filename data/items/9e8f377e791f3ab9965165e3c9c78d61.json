  "description": "<p>Tonight we will be talking to three guests. My first guest Brian describes a terrifying night in the Uwharrie National Forest and having to pull his weapon.</p> <p>Next, we will be talking to Josh who comes to us from the state of Minnesota. Josh has two encounters he will be sharing with us. Josh originally did not want to come forward because in his second encounter the creature looked very human in the face. Josh says \"This has really bothered me Wes, the thing I saw looked very human like in the face but it acted like an animal. <a href= \"https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep431-encounters-with-the-unknown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here</a> is a picture that is very close to what I saw..\"</p> <p>Then we will wrap up with Boni who comes to us from East Texas. She describes breaking down on the highway about 6 miles from her home and being stalked as she walked along the highway. Boni says \"I was so scared, I had no idea what was going on. I could hear talking in the woods but could not make out what they were saying and whatever this thing was, it was big and was pacing me as I walked along the highway.</p> <p>Every time I stopped I could smell this terrible smell like rotting meat.</p> <p>I have had some strange things happen at my house I would like to discuss as well.\"</p>",
