  "description": "Art can move us in deep, meaningful ways. A beautiful song, a good book or a great film can change our perspectives and attitudes toward ideas, and sometimes people. Where does that magic come from -- and how can we channel it when we're creating? JR is an artist famed for his enormous black-and-white portraits that tell stories and adorn surfaces from the Louvre to the favelas of Brazil. His ambitious projects, like a recent massive mural inside a maximum security prison in California or the boy who peers curiously over the wall at the Mexico-United States border, put a deeply human face to things we might have only read in the news while also highlighting and celebrating the connections between us humans. In this episode, JR talks about the importance of joy in his art-making process, speaks to the value of community and curiosity and shares how his unique working style developed over the years. This is an episode from the TED Audio Collective podcast How to Be a Better Human. For more episodes on how to be a little less terrible, follow How to Be a Better Human wherever you're listening to this.",
