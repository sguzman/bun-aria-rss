  "title": "Stella M. Rouse and Ashley D. Ross, “The Politics of Millennials: Political Beliefs and Policy Preferences of America’s Most Diverse Generation” (U Michigan Press, 2018)",
  "description": "The Millenial generation, those born between the early 1980s and late 1990s, are the most racially and ethnically diverse generation in US history. They also grew up during the birth of the digital revolution and two cataclysmic events: September 11th and the Great Recession. What they believe has remained largely speculation, until the publication of The Politics of Millennials: Political Beliefs and Policy Preferences of America’s Most Diverse Generation (U Michigan Press, 2018) by Stella M. Rouse and Ashley D. Ross.\n\nIn the book, Rouse and Ross discover the political and policy beliefs of Millenials through extensive survey and focus group research. They discover a generation deeply concerned about social issues, such as LGBTQ rights and drug legalization. On other issues, the findings suggest a moderate view on economic issues and a preference for a middle-ground approach by government on spending and taxation.\n\nRouse is associate professor of government and politics and director of the Center for American Politics and Citizenship at the University of Maryland; Ross is assistant professor in the Department of Marine Sciences and a fellow with the Center for Texas Beaches & Shores at Texas A&M University at Galveston.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
