But one thing remains consistent: When they’re looking for something personally relevant to them, they turn to YouTube. <br /><br />Whether it’s celebrating this year’s graduating class with the likes of President and Mrs. Obama, Beyoncé and BTS in YouTube Originals’ “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxpTjcouaeQ\" target=\"_blank\">Dear Class of 2020</a>,” reminiscing over Game 6 of the 1993 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/NBA\" target=\"_blank\">NBA</a> finals or attempting quarantine glow-ups from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCucot-Zp428OwkyRm2I7v2Q\" target=\"_blank\">James Charles</a>,&nbsp;YouTube’s extensive video library creates a truly meaningful and personal experience for viewers. <br /><br />And, this year more than ever, we’re seeing people make time for what matters. On June 13, viewers tuned in to watch “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CV4DOdeFxU\" target=\"_blank\">Bear Witness, Take Action</a>,” a YouTube Originals live stream that assembled artists and activists to learn, heal and raise awareness for the Equal Justice Initiative. This was part of a new multi-year, $100 million-dollar fund to help amplify the voices and stories of Black Creators.  <br /><br />Today, at our ninth annual NewFront event, we celebrated moments like these through a more personal experience for brands and advertisers with “<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://youtube.com/forbrands&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1593035236381000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGPCDwDhU1AVpYXl0YhKdiqCTMldw\" target=\"_blank\">Brandcast Delivered</a>.” <br /><br />Throughout the completely reimagined virtual event, we celebrated the diversity of YouTube’s voices and content. Featuring appearances from creators like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfm4y4rHF5HGrSr-qbvOwOg\" target=\"_blank\">Lilly Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbZwpdul2Oa5Fl6hxllcSzA\" target=\"_blank\">Questlove</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg\" target=\"_blank\">Emma Chamberlain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/gordonramsay\" target=\"_blank\">Gordon Ramsay</a>, we constructed a “personal primetime” for each attendee based on their passions and shared how YouTube’s deep connection to people’s lives means better results no matter a marketer’s goal – from reach and awareness to action. <br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OXC8cnFvVy0/XvO74DXhd8I/AAAAAAAAA0A/vBPbUvbBWcgstKHawod_7kL9hg7D0W-ZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/CREATOR_CUE_GORDON.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"360\" data-original-width=\"640\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OXC8cnFvVy0/XvO74DXhd8I/AAAAAAAAA0A/vBPbUvbBWcgstKHawod_7kL9hg7D0W-ZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/CREATOR_CUE_GORDON.gif\" /></a></div><br /><br /><h3>Drive better results throughout the consumer journey </h3><br />The first and last litmus test for any video platform — be it TV, OLV, OTT, mobile or some new acronym that doesn’t exist yet, is simple: Does it work? On every metric — from incremental audience, to new customers, to sales — YouTube delivers. <br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OtO6amwtNGg/XvO8Qi5UQMI/AAAAAAAAA0M/KHhEcrhA8Zox-567dOhzPKIPUv7E-k7mwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/31974_YT%2BMeasurements%2Band%2BResults_Blog_v02%2Bcopy.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"427\" data-original-width=\"1600\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OtO6amwtNGg/XvO8Qi5UQMI/AAAAAAAAA0M/KHhEcrhA8Zox-567dOhzPKIPUv7E-k7mwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/31974_YT%2BMeasurements%2Band%2BResults_Blog_v02%2Bcopy.png\" /></a></div><br /><br />Today, we showcased how effective YouTube strategies can produce results through the announcement of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/ads/youtube-works/\" target=\"_blank\">2020 YouTube Works</a> award recipients.

Learn more about the smart ways these brands and others used YouTube to drive incredible business results on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/ads/youtube-works/\" target=\"_blank\">yt.be/works</a>. <br /><br /><h3>Reach your audience across screens, and within new content </h3><br />To drive meaningful results, the first step is reaching customers where they are watching. While YouTube overall reaches more people age 18-49 than all linear TV networks combined,<sup><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">4</span></sup> we’ve seen a <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/ads/youtube-streaming-trends-features/\" target=\"_blank\">dramatic shift </a>in viewing patterns, as people increasingly watch on connected TVs. In the U.S. alone, over 100 million people watch YouTube and YouTube TV on their TV screens each month.<sup><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">5</span></sup> And, according to Comscore, YouTube makes up 41% of ad-supported video streaming watch time.<sup><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">6</span></sup>    <br /><br />Last month, we <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/ads/introducing-youtube-select/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> YouTube Select — a reimagination of Google Preferred — to make it easier to reach your audiences where they are watching, and find the right <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/ads/introducing-youtube-select/\" target=\"_blank\">content </a>for your brand. YouTube Select includes the same popular creator content, plus a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQwGUPDdOOc&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">streaming TV lineup</a> that combines the best of YouTube TV and core lineups content, both on TV screens.  <br /><br />YouTube Select also includes YouTube Originals programming, including the breakout hit, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaqxtzLg4Cw&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Instant Influencer with James Charles</a>,” which hit over 50 million views in its first month alone;<sup><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">7</span></sup> “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAXahAh0ChY&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Retro Tech</a>,” featuring tech guru Marques Brownlee; and “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb3k0x_Qrg0&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Liza on Demand</a>.” And they’re all returning for new seasons. <br /><br />Additionally, today we announced that Demi Lovato will be returning for a new YouTube Originals project. Demi’s new docuseries will be a follow-up to her 2017 documentary, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWTlL_w8cRA\" target=\"_blank\">Simply Complicated</a>,”which will bring you on her personal and musical journey over the last three years. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/davidblaine\" target=\"_blank\">David Blaine</a> will also be joining the YouTube Originals slate with a first-of-its-kind special event. We are excited to share more on these shows, among many others, throughout the year. <br /><br /><h3>Uncover new audience insights and convert demand into action </h3><br />YouTube has become an important part of the modern purchase journey with 70 percent of YouTube viewers saying they bought a brand as a result of seeing it on our platform.<sup><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">8</span></sup> We’re introducing tools to help marketers understand their audience, as well as complement their awareness initiatives with campaigns that drive conversions. <br /><br />As people turn to YouTube to discover their next purchase, we’re also seeing an increase in conversions from ads on the platform. In the last twelve months, we’ve been able to help our customers achieve over 950 million conversions<sup><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">9</span></sup> – generating quality leads, boosting web traffic, and achieving new sales on YouTube.  <br /><br /><a href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads/new-ways-to-drive-action\" target=\"_blank\">Last week</a>, we announced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee63ZSUGGSU&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Video action campaigns</a>, a simpler and more cost-effective way to drive action on YouTube. It automatically brings video ads that drive action to the YouTube home feed, watch pages, and Google video partner — all within one campaign.
