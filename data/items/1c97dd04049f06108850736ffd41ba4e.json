  "description": "<p>On today's ep, the crew is joined by Emily Gonzalez from <a href=\"https://tooscarydidntwatch.com/\">Too Scary; Didn't Watch</a> and we are so sorry that we made her do riddles. Apologies, Emily! You didn't deserve this. But you all deserve to listen to this because it's a great episode. So you get no apologies. But you do get a couple of kids begging their dad for a treat, best friends with an insurmountable issue, some fan fic for the ages, a confectioners competition, and a guy with a bone to pick with his college. All that and we even do some riddles!<br><br>Starring:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/adalrifai\">Adal Rifai</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPsoFLY\">John Patrick Coan</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/erinkeif10/\">Erin Keif</a></p>\n<p>Special Guest:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/emilyagzz\">Emily Gonzalez</a></p>\n<p>Editing by: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaseyPoney\">Casey Toney</a></p>\n<p>Theme by: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArneParrott\">Arne Parrott</a></p>\n<p>Logo by: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corruptedgem\">Emily Kardamis</a> & <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ofhauntings\">Emmaline Morris</a></p>\n<p>Want more? <a href=\"http://patreon.com/heyriddleriddle\">Get Weekly Bonus Eps on Patreon!</a></p>\n<p>Want merch? <a href=\"https://www.teepublic.com/stores/hey-riddle-riddle?utm_campaign=9168&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=Hey%2BRiddle%2BRiddle\">Visit our TeePublic Store!</a> or <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/shopyounggirl/\">pins, buttons & prints</a></p>\n<p>Want to mail us something? <br><strong>Hey Riddle Riddle </strong></p>\n<p><strong>6351 W Montrose Ave #267</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Chicago, IL, 60634</strong></p>\n<p>Want to leave us a voicemail?
