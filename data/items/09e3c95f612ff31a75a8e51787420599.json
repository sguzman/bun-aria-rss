I’m here to tell you that this is not true. Cow’s milk from conventionally raised cattle contains dozens of reproductive hormones, allergenic proteins, antibiotics, chemicals, inflammatory compounds, and growth factors, some of which are known to promote cancer. While humans are the only species that continue to drink milk after weaning, we have no biological requirement for this food. Moreover, the milk we drink today is not what our grandparents drank.</p><br><p>In this episode of my new Masterclass series, I am interviewed by my good friend and podcast host, Dhru Purohit, about why we should avoid almost all dairy. We also discuss some of the popular myths about dairy, the types of dairy that are okay to eat, and much more.</p><br><p>Dhru Purohit is a podcast host, serial entrepreneur, and investor in the health and wellness industry.
