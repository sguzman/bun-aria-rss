  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down Business School. We reached out to writer Brent Forrester, to get his memories about this episode and what it was like working with director Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Avengers). Then we dig into everything you want to know about filming those hilarious scenes with Michael at Ryan's business school, and we get some amazing insights from Brent about what went into picking Pam's watercolor paintings for her art show. Finally, we hear from Kate Flannery herself, who gives us the scoop on everything we want to know about that scene with Meredith, Dwight and that bat, and Jenna recounts her memories of shooting that really touching Pam and Michael scene. </p>\n",
