  "description": "<p>Butte, Montana has its roots in mining. The town came to be known as the \"Richest Hill on Earth\" and gold, silver and copper were all mined here. As was the case with so many mining towns, a successful red light district grew within the town. One of the most successful and high-class brothels in town was the Dumas Brothel. Rich clientele could have their fantasies met here, but there was also pleasure for the working class in the basement, which ran like a sex mill. The brothel passed through many hands and has the reputation of being the longest running brothel in the country. And it seems that clients and the girls are still hanging out here in the afterlife. Several entities are thought to haunt this building. Join us as we explore the history and ahuntings of the Dumas Brothel! The Moment in Oddity is by Bob Sherfield and features Pykrete and Ice Aircraft Carriers and This Day in History is by Jessica Bell and features Joshua Slocum Traveling Round the World Solo. Our location was suggested by listener Julie David and our Research Assistant was April Rogers-Krick.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/04/hgb-ep-120-dumas-brothel.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/04/hgb-ep-120-dumas-brothel.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Please consider nominating us in the 2016 Podcast Awards: <a href=\"http://podcastawards.com\">http://podcastawards.com</a> You can do so until April 30th 2016</p> <p> </p>",
