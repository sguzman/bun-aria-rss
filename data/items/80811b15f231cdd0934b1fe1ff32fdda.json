  "description": "<p>What the Hell is Pizzagate? It’s a detailed conspiracy theory claiming that a pedophile ring - a Satanic pedophile ring was being run out of a Hillary Clinton-linked Washington D.C. pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong. Seriously. Edgar Maddison Welch believed it to be true enough to fire a rifle into Comet Ping Pong on Dec. 4th, 2016, in attempt to rescue kids he believed were being held captive, molested, and raped in the pizza place’s basement (even though Comet Ping Pong has no basement). Edgar is now serving four years in prison now. How did millions come to believe this insanity? Russian Twitter bots, disinformation specialists, the utter madness of Alex Jones and InfoWars and more broken down and deconstructed in this giant Idiots of the Internet edition of Timesuck!</p>\n<p>Timesuck is also brought to you today by the Dollar Shave Club.
