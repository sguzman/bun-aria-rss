Forgoing the city's often conventional pop sound, Gauthier's songs are unafraid to probe into what she calls \"the extremely personal.\" Gauthier talks to Bruce Headlam in this episode of Broken Record about getting her start as a songwriter in her 30's and co-writing her last album, \"Rifles and Rosary Beads\", with U.S. Military Veterans and their families. It's one of Malcolm Gladwell's favorite records of 2018 and here she performs three numbers from the album plus one from an older release, \"Mercy Now.\"</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
