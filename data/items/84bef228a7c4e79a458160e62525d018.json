  "description": "<p>On the outskirts of Kamloop, British Columbia lies what remains of a once thriving self-sufficient city for the sick. Tranquille Sanatorium is a complex made up of over forty buildings that once housed the sick and later the handicapped. The grounds were beautiful and tranquil and today attempts are being made to revitalize the location. But not all is tranquil at the Sanatorium. Spirits continue to knock about the place. The years of loneliness and sadness seem to have been absorbed into the environment and on occasion, those emotions can be felt by the living and haunting encounters can occur. It would seem that Tranquille Sanatorium just might be haunted. The Moment in Oddity features fireproof Bibles and This Day in History features the Oklahoma City Bombing.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/04/hgb-podcast-ep-41-tranquille-sanatorium.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/04/hgb-podcast-ep-41-tranquille-sanatorium.html</a></p>",
