  "description": "<p>Physical law learning is the ambiguous attempt at automating the derivation\nof governing equations with the use of machine learning techniques. The current\nliterature focuses however solely on the development of methods to achieve this\ngoal, and a theoretical foundation is at present missing. This paper shall thus\nserve as a first step to build a comprehensive theoretical framework for\nlearning physical laws, aiming to provide reliability to according algorithms.\nOne key problem consists in the fact that the governing equations might not be\nuniquely determined by the given data. We will study this problem in the common\nsituation that a physical law is described by an ordinary or partial\ndifferential equation. For various different classes of differential equations,\nwe provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to uniquely\ndetermine the differential equation which is governing the phenomenon. We then\nuse our results to devise numerical algorithms to determine whether a function\nsolves a differential equation uniquely. Finally, we provide extensive\nnumerical experiments showing that our algorithms in combination with common\napproaches for learning physical laws indeed allow to guarantee that a unique\ngoverning differential equation is learnt, without assuming any knowledge about\nthe function, thereby ensuring reliability.\n</p>",
