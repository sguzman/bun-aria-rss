  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.langmeilwinery.com.au/\">In this show, we finally define OLD VINES with James Lindner and Leigh Woodrow of Langmeil Vineyards!</a> The background, the history, the viticulture, and the first major definition in form of the Barossa Old Vine Charter are all covered. If you ever wondered what \"old vines\" really means, we have answers!  <p><a href=\"https://www.langmeilwinery.com.au/\">Langmeil Vineyards</a> has a long and storied history. In 1843, Christian Auricht planted a mixed farm in the heart of the Barossa Valley in Australia. In 1932 Theodor Hanisch, Christian’s grandson established the first winery on the property and after a period of disrepair, in 1996, three men, who had strong roots in the Barossa - Richard Lindner, Carl Lindner and Chris Bitter - rejuvenated the vineyard and winery.</p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/ndf0htalmmcgcwik4dlz_1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"228\" height=\"343\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Photo: <a href= \"https://www.langmeilwinery.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Langmeil The Freedom 1843 Vineyard, Shiraz</a></em></span></p> <p> </p> <p>Today that same vineyard from 1843, The Freedom Vineyard, is still producing grapes for wine and <a href= \"https://www.langmeilwinery.com.au/\">Langmeil,</a> although it makes other lovely wines from normal aged vines, has developed a specialty for caring for and making wine from old vine vineyards.
