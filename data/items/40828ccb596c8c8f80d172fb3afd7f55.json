  "content": "<p>Since 2020, we've asked the Google Publisher Tag (GPT) developer community to provide their valuable feedback through an annual survey. This feedback influences what we work on each year, and has directly inspired improvements to our sample offerings, release notes, and much more. </p><p>As we look forward to next year, it's time once again to check in with our developer community to see what's working well and what can be improved. Starting today, we're kicking off the 2022 GPT developer survey. </p><p >  <center><h1><a href=\"https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5t2JVTbkKTuBrGS?source=blog\">Take the survey</a>  </h1></center></p><p>The survey should take no more than 10 minutes to complete, and it will be open through the end of October 2022. Most questions are optional and your answers are completely anonymous. </p><p>Remember that the feedback you provide influences what we work on over the course of the next year, so please let us know what matters most to you. Thanks in advance for taking the time to help improve the GPT developer experience! </p> <span class=\"byline-author\"><img height=\"40\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zCUdYgGHAMc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACY/i0JOhbIQ8EM/photo.jpg?sz=40\" style=\"vertical-align:middle; border:none;\" width=\"40\">&nbsp;-&nbsp;Jonathon Imperiosi, Google Publisher Tags Team</span>",
