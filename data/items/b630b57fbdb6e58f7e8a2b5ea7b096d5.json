In this episode, we hear how these researchers discovered this threat and tried to identify who was responsible for the malware behind it. We also consider how this kind of attack may pose a threat to human life wherever there are manufacturing or public infrastructure facilities around the world.\nA big thanks to Julian Gutmanis, Naser Aldossary, Marina Krotofil, and Robert M.
