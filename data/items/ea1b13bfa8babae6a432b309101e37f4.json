  "description": "<p>Major life changes can be a mixed bag. On one hand, you're over the moon for landing your dream job. On the other hand, being diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer and told by your doctor that you've got two years to live (at best) puts a bit of a damper on the celebration. You're determined to remain positive -- after all, you wouldn't be the first to beat fatalistic odds if this thing were somehow turned around, so there's no harm in being hopeful. You wouldn't say you're lost, but you do want to ensure that you make the most of whatever time you have left -- however long that may be. We can only imagine what you're going through, but on this Feedback Friday we'll do our best to offer how we might spend our time if confronted with the worst news possible -- but armed with your incredibly deep well of positivity.</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Jason DeFillippo</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpdef\" target=\"_blank\">@jpdef</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
