Many of us are spending more time than ever before with our partner, while COVID-19 has made it harder to connect with others if we are single and looking for a relationship. Thankfully, whether we are single, in a relationship or somewhere in between, there are things we can do now to attract the kind of love we want in our lives, as I discuss in this podcast interview with bestselling author, speaker and couple’s counselor <a href=\"https://rethinklife.today/\">Monica Berg</a>. We talk about everything you need to know about healthy relationships, including why we need to rethink love, how to attract the kind of love you want, rekindling love in your life, building frameworks for lasting and fulfilling relationships, tips for single people, how to become more comfortable with change, why we need to argue more and how to argue better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more info on Monica and to get her books visit: <a href=\"https://rethinklife.today/\">https://rethinklife.today/</a></p>\n<p>Read the show blog here:&nbsp;https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/monica-berg</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>**Special offers from this episode's sponsors**</p>\n<p>-<strong>Function of Beauty (the world’s first fully customizable, natural hair care brand that allows you to create hair products based on your individual hair type & goals):&nbsp;</strong>Go to <a href=\"https://www.functionofbeauty.com/?vanityauto=&promo=drleaf&utm_medium=podcasts&_ke=\">functionofbeauty.com/drleaf</a> for 20% off your first order!</p>\n<p>-<strong>BetterHelp (My favorite counseling app, making therapy affordable and accessible no matter where you are!): </strong>To get 10% off<br>\nBetterHelp counseling during your first month see <a href=\"//trybetterhelp.com/drleaf\">trybetterhelp.com/drleaf</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Podcast highlights:</p>\n<p><strong>3:00</strong> How to overcome the fear of change</p>\n<p><strong>7:10</strong> How to stop letting emotions rule your life</p>\n<p><strong>11:40</strong> Why we need to rethink love, and why the most important relationship you have is with yourself</p>\n<p><strong>15:55</strong> How to love yourself and overcome shame, fear and guilt</p>\n<p><strong>19:10</strong> Tips for single people looking for a great relationship</p>\n<p><strong>20:49</strong> Why you need to be your own personal “baggage claim”, and the danger of going into a relationship waiting for the other person to make you happy</p>\n<p><strong>23:00</strong> The difference between unconditional and ego-based love, and how to have a successful relationship</p>\n<p><strong>29:00</strong> How to argue better</p>\n<p><strong>36:14</strong> The one thing you can do now for a better relationship</p>\n<p><strong>40:45</strong> Are dating apps good for us?</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>**Pre-order my new mental self-care tips book here for less 20%: https://drleaf.com/collections/all/products/101-ways-to-be-less-stressed</p>\n<p>-Get my new brain detox app SWITCH on sale now!
