  "description": "<p>We've all seen the shows where someone sits in the shadows and the voice is changed as they blow the cover off of things. Well this week we have an unknown cigar representative coming in to do just that. Here he secrets about retailers, cigar brands and life on the road. This is bound to be our most controversial show to date.</p>\n<p>In the first hour we will fire up the first cigar from the April Care Package. It's a cigar from Jochy Blanco down in the Dominican Republic as we fire up La Galera Maduro.</p>\n<p>In the second hour of the show we will take a look at the new Avo Improvisation Series 2019 Limited Edition. It's our first show in our 10th year of our weekly broadcast.</p>\n<p>Join us on The Cigar Authority, the most listened to cigar podcast in the world. We will have all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at http://www.2GuysCigars.com/.</p>\n",
