  "description": "While the intelligence and law enforcement communities reel from the president's attacks, Donald Trump has sent further signals that he expects personal loyalty above loyalty to the nation from all of his team across the whole of government.  He has even go so far as to trash the once hallowed concept of independence of the Fed. But it may be that the biggest problem affecting the government is not the president's impulse to suppress dissenting views but rather is his lack of intellectual curiosity and his professed skepticism of expertise.  It's not that he wants political loyal intelligence analysts, for example, it is that he wouldn't read what they wrote no matter what their political views were.  On this episode, veteran CIA analyst Nada Bakos, Georgetown's Rosa Brooks and the Financial Times Ed Luce, discuss--and Rosa follow's in the footsteps of a giant pre-historic chicken!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
