  "description": "The bogus Disinformation Governance Board comes under further scrutiny from Rand Paul and John Kennedy. We gear up for Mother's Day by reading a poem written by Speedy's dad. Pro-abortion protestors can't define what a woman is. And even though we are slightly overly large, we can't jump on board with the \"fat-phobia\" movement.\nSponsor: RealEstateAgentsITrust.com Buying or selling a home is already one of the most stressful things you can do – and it can be ten times worse if you’re not working with the right agent.  Generally speaking, our homes are our biggest investment – that’s a lot of responsibility, and you need an agent who can take that seriously. That’s why we recommend Real Estate Agents I Trust. We work with only the best agents in every market.  We do our homework, talking to every agent before inviting them to join our network – and here’s a big one: we only work with full-time professionals…no part-time or inexperienced agents.  Our team makes the introduction, and then follows you through the buying or selling process to make sure that you’re satisfied. The agents we work with have long track records, and are the best sellers in their field.  They’re a part of this audience; they share your values, and they’re almost anywhere you want to go! The process is simple: just go to https://RealEstateAgentsITrust.com today and provide us with some basic info. Our team will contact you to make an introduction to our preferred agent in your town.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
