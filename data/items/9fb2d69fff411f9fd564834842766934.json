While some South Asian voters were upset that this part of her identity has long been downplayed, others were excited about the historic nature of her nomination and what it represents for South Asian American women and women of color. Meanwhile, some Black voters debated whether she is truly “Black enough,” and far-right critics pushed birther-style arguments, questioning whether Harris is a US citizen and her eligibility for vice president.\nVox’s Nisha Chittal walks us through Kamala Harris’s background and explains why Americans still struggle to talk about multiracial people.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
