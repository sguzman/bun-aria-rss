  "description": "Identity is all around you. Whether you’re consuming social media, reading a book, streaming a new series online, or having a conversation with a friend or family member, you are receiving signals from the world that shape your self-identity. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to bed, your self-identity is switched on and telling you the parameters of which you need to live in. What if we can escape this box we’ve built around us? What does true freedom from excuses look like? On this episode of Impact Theory, world-renowned speaker, author, and venture capitalist Vusi Thembakwayo joins Tom Bilyeu to discuss such matters and more as they explore the controversial ideas of self-identity, freedom of the mind, and why you have no excuse to begin taking action today. They discuss how self-identity can limit our potential, why being free doesn’t mean living in freedom, why you have to have a willingness to fail, how to be your own savior, and the inspiration of Nelson Mandela.
