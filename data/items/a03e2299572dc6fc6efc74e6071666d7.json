  "description": "There are the celebrated authors: Checkov, Joyce, Mansfield, Munro. There are the big questions: “What makes a truly great short story?” “Where does the form originate?” “What can short stories do that other forms of literature can’t?”\n\n\n\nBut before any of this, there’s a question that’s not that easy to answer at all:\n\n\n\nWhat is a short story?\n\n\n\nThis week I’m joined by Dr Paul March-Russell, Lecturer in Comparative Literature at the University of Kent, and author of The Short Story: An Introduction and Colin Walsh, an award-winning short story writer from Galway, Ireland. \n\n\n\nWe discuss whether you can really define what a short story is, some great examples of the form, and what short stories can do that other forms of literature simply can’t.\n\n\n\nFor more details, links, and transcripts head to wttepodcast.com\n\n\n\nJoin the WTTE community and support the show on Patreon!",
