I can’t tell you how many questions I get about this position, mostly from people who are confused…wondering if they’re doing it wrong. You’re not! You may just need to tweak it a bit, to make it work for your body. So on today’s show, I give you my favorite doggy style hacks, because let’s be honest — no one wants a broken penis. Let’s avoid the ER, and give you the hot doggy style sex you deserve.</p><br><p>Plus, I take your questions! Is polyamory more natural than monogamy? What should you do if you catch feelings for your friend-with-benefits? Is it really cheating if you have a no-sex kink session with an old flame? And finally — body dysmorphia of the vulva. Do you have it? Friends: let me help you love it! Don’t buy the hype, by which I mean false standards. I tell you exactly how to make your vulva a MUCH-deserved object of your affection.</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://skyn.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Skyn Condoms</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
