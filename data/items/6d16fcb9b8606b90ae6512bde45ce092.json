Judge Jeremy Fogel explores how being present in the moment helps him keep a clear mind and stay connected to his true values.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>What do you think it takes to become wiser, more compassionate, and more open-minded? This week on The Science of Happiness, we bring you one of our most popular episodes. Former district judge Jeremy Fogel shares his insights on how being present can help us make more mindful decisions. He recounts how, after experiencing stress as a judge, his wife suggested he try an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course. After taking the course, Jeremy felt more connected to himself and his surroundings, and decided to make mindfulness a part of his everyday life. The changes Jeremy made had profound impacts on his work as a judge. We also hear from Dr. Shauna Shapiro, a clinical psychologist and professor at Santa Clara University, about how mindfulness affects our moral reasoning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practice:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mindful Breathing</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Find a comfortable, seated position and invite your body to relax.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tune in to the sensations it experiences — the touch, the connection with the floor or the chair. Do your best to relax any areas of tightness or tension.</p></li>\n<li><p>Listen to the natural rhythm of your breath, in and out, without trying to control it. Notice where you feel your breath in your body. It might be in your abdomen, chest, throat, or nostrils. See if you can feel the sensations of breath, one breath at a time.</p></li>\n<li><p>As you do this, you may start thinking about other things. Try to notice that your mind has wandered, and say “thinking” or “wandering” in your head softly. Then gently redirect your attention right back to the breathing. Stay here for 5-7 minutes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, notice your whole body seated here once more.
