We experience external stressors from our jobs, family responsibilities, financial worries, and many other places, then compound them with unhealthy lifestyle choices. The result is an epidemic of stress and increased risk for chronic diseases.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this episode, I talk to Wim Hof, Dr. Rangan Chatterjee, and Dr. Elizabeth Boham about how to take control of our minds and bodies through cold therapy, breathwork, and mindset and meditation techniques that can help us tap into our innate inner power.</p><br><p>Wim Hof, also known as “The Iceman,” holds multiple world records for his feats of endurance and exposure to cold, include climbing Mount Everest in nothing but a pair of shorts, running across the Namibian desert at 104°F without drinking any water, and sitting in an ice bath for 1 hour and 52 minutes. He has proven in eight university research studies that he can consciously influence his autonomic nervous system, measurably reduce inflammation, regulate his internal pH levels and body temperature, and activate his immune system to resist the effects of poisonous endotoxins. These studies also show that Wim is able to teach others to achieve similar accomplishments in as little as four days through the Wim Hof Method.</p><br><p>Dr. Rangan Chatterjee is regarded as one of the most influential doctors in the UK and wants to change how medicine will be practiced for years to come. He hosts the biggest health podcast in Europe, <em>Feel Better, Live More</em>. His first book, <em>How to Make Disease Disappear</em>, is an international bestseller all over the world and has sold over 250,000 copies worldwide in just 18 months. Dr. Chatterjee is known for finding the root cause of people’s health problems, and he has highlighted his methods in the ground-breaking BBC television show, <em>Doctor in the House</em>, which has been shown in over 70 countries around the world.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Elizabeth Boham is Board Certified in Family Medicine from Albany Medical School, and she is an Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner and the Medical Director of The UltraWellness Center. Dr. Boham lectures on a variety of topics, including Women’s Health and Breast Cancer Prevention, insulin resistance, heart health, weight control and allergies. She is on the faculty for the Institute for Functional Medicine.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health and ButcherBox.</p><br><p>Rupa Health is a place for Functional Medicine practitioners to access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, Great Plains, and more.
