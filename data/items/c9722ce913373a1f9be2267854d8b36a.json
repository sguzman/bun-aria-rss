  "description": "This Present Darkness. No, this is not a review of everyone’s favorite Christian fantasy book from the 80’s (though it is referenced here). Today we continue the series on Old Creation vs. new Creation by dipping our toes into the spiritual realm of the conversation. Mike begins an exploration of Genesis 1, and how we are to interpret the lights, Eden and the showdown in the garden. What are the areas where Heaven and Earth overlap? What are Cherubim and how do they play into all of this? How about the Seraphim? The serpent?? The Elohim??? Holy moly. The scene is broadening…\n\nTim continues to have oatmeal brain processing all of this.\n\nWe also answer a few questions dealing with masks and the loneliness epidemic, tools to analyze Old Creation response vs. New Creation responses and where to even begin with reconstruction. It’s a lot! So many good questions and comments to partner with us on this journey.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram.  \n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nVoxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
