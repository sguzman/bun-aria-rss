  "description": "I hope you have a pen and notepad ready for today’s show...   My good friend Marin Katusa returns to tell us why gold could go a lot lower over the next few months. He suggests buying a popular commodity instead… which he largely avoided for the past decade.   Marin is one of the best resource investors I know. And although he’s bearish on gold in the short-term, we discuss why that’s a positive for us as investors.   Marin also explains what to look for when evaluating a resource investment (it takes more than just a great discovery...) and how to scale into the best names over time.   This is an incredible interview with a lot of great information. Trust me, you’ll want to listen more than once...  ",
