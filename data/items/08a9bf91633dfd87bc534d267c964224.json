  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear how an international police operation took down Andromeda, and possibly the criminal mastermind known as Ar3s. Mirai is back, and so are warnings about Reaper. There's a PayPal phishing expedition in progress (don't let yourself be a wild-caught sucker). A new variant of the familiar tech support scam features a bogus blue screen of death. Germany's Interior Minister considers backdooring the IoT. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is going after dodgy ICOs. Justin Harvey from Accenture on cyber ranges. Adam Meyers from CrowdStrike on supply chain attacks. And we're not going to talk about the Internet of Those Kinds of Things. (Don't act so innocent—you know who you are.)",
