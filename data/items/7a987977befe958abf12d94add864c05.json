  "description": "We all know fiber is good for us, but did you also know that it can help with your mental health? In this week’s blog and podcast, I speak with GI specialist and epidemiologist Dr. Will Bulsiewicz about how a high-fiber diet can help boost mental and brain health, heal food sensitivities and reduce inflammation in the brain and body!\n \nIn his amazing new book, Fiber Fueled: The Plant-Based Gut Health Program for Losing Weight, Restoring Your Health, and Optimizing Your Microbiome, Dr. B notes how even though he was very successful as a medical doctor, his processed food diet was making him miserable, tired and anxious. When he met his wife, he began to understand how real, healthy whole foods could transform his life, which led him on the path he is on today: meeting people where they are in their journey and helping them live their best and healthiest lives. As Dr. B points out, although the current healthcare system is really good at treating acute illnesses, it falls short when it comes to preventative medicine and chronic health issues.\n \nIndeed, as a medical doctor with multiple qualifications, he was taught little about the impact lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise could impact our mental and physical health! Thankfully, times are changing, especially as more and more research is being published on the importance of our lifestyle choices. We now know that pills and procedures are not everything; around 20% of diseases are genetic, which means 80% are related to our diet and lifestyle. This is great news! It means that our health is largely in our hands, which very empowering.\n \n \nPodcast Time Stamps:\n6:25 What transformed Dr. B’s life, and why he loves helping people regain their health and live their best life\n18:02 What is the difference between disease prevention and disease management?\n24:29 The gut-brain connection, and why your gut should be your brain’s best friend\n30:22 The gut is an endocrine organ, as much as the ovaries and testes are\n30:50 The gut produces post-biotics, which happens when you combine prebiotics and probiotics\n37:00 What is the one golden rule when it comes to eating?\n43:50 Is meat okay to eat?\n48:22 Food sensitivities and what you can do about them\n55:00 How fiber-rich diets can prevent heart disease\n57:20 Why diet is not everything\n1:00:00 Current health trends to be excited about and health trends to avoid\n1:02:02 What if you live in a food desert?\n \n \nFor more info on Dr. Will and to get his new book visit: https://theplantfedgut.com \n \n \nAnd follow him on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theguthealthmd/ \n \nRead the full episode blog and transcript here:https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/how-fiber-can-improve-your-mental-and-brain-health-tips-on-boosting-gut-health-and-overcoming-food-sensitivities-with-gi-specialist-dr-will-bulsiewicz\n \n \n \n \nThis episode was made possible by the following sponsors:\n \n-Blinkist (my favorite reading app): To get your free week on Blinkist AND 25% off your subscription see: https://www.blinkist.com/nc/partners/cleaning-up-the-mental-mess \n \n \n-NOOM (the best healthy habit company): For your NOOM special offer see: https://noom.com/drleaf \n \n \nAdditional Resources:\n \n-Join my text group for more tips, notifications of sales, and more!
