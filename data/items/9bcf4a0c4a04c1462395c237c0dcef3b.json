  "title": "Spittin' Chiclets Episode 45: Featuring Matt Murley",
  "description": "<p>Episode 45 kicks off with the boys talking about the leukemia diagnosis for New Jersey Devil Brian Boyle, who is also a Hingham, MA native and good friend of Whits. They discuss how it was detected, the positive outlook for Boyler, and how Spittin' Chiclets knows he'll be rarin' to go on Opening Night. The fellas also discuss Joffrey Lupul's LTIR situation in Toronto, Andreas Athanasiou's stalemate in Detroit, and the dopey new face-off penalty before welcoming Whit's former teammate Matt Murley to the show. Currently playing in South Korea, Murley talked about his hockey adventures that have taken him all over the planet, whether NHL exhibition games are having any impact in East Asia, trying to \"beat BlackJack\" in Atlantic City while in the minzies with Whits, and what it's like living on a peninsula that has been threatened with nuclear obliteration. The guys then finish up answering #AllRightHamilton questions from listeners.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
