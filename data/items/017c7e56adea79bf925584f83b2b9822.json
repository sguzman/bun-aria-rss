  "description": "<p>With only days until the Beijing Olympics, we continue our chats with some great winter athletes as we chat with Australian Alpine Skier Harry Laidlaw about his incredible sport and his incredible career & Olympic achievements! We find out from Harry just how he got into the sport and what other sports we could've seen him make a name for himself in had things taken a different route. We also find out just how difficult it is for an Australian to make it in the sport of Alpine Skiing and just how he is able to relate to his fellow competitors from other non-skiing nations. Added to this we try and work out what an Australian equivalent of the cow bell could be during competitions down under and just what other sports Harry could try his hand in to try and compete with a certain cross-sport skier from the Czech Republic. It's an incredible chat that we know you won't want to miss, so get to listening!</p>",
