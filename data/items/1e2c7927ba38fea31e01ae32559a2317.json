  "title": "Ep. 927 - 'We Aren't Grooming Children,' They Cry As They Groom Children",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left insists that teachers absolutely aren’t sexually indoctrinating elementary schoolers. Yet there is video footage of teachers doing precisely that. Also, Pete Buttigieg says that children will die if he and his fellow groomers are not allowed to say whatever they want to our kids. The truth is that gender ideology, as professed by Buttigieg and others, is what will kill kids. Also, Donald Trump endorses pro-abortion, anti-gun, pro-trans Dr. Oz. And a jury refuses to convict three men entrapped by the FBI in a plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan. Plus, Sam Elliott issues the inevitable groveling apology for committing the sin of not liking a gay cowboy movie. In our Daily Cancellation, some libertarians on YouTube tried to debunk me. We’ll see how they did. \n\nJoin Ben’s Third Thursday Book Club now to get his notes for The Once and Future King by T.H. White and be a part of this month’s Q&A: https://utm.io/uejl1 \n\nWhat is a Woman? Matt Walsh tracks down the answer in his new book.
