  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">In our culture, where more than two-thirds of our citizens are overweight or obese, we tend to think of body fat as an inherently negative thing. But your body fat is a critically important component of your body and your overall health. Certainty, there is such a thing as bad fat or an excess of fat, but fat is not the enemy. In fact, our body fat is a vital part of our evolution and it’s what makes us the resilient humans that we are today.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">Today you’re going to learn about the five categories of fat and how they operate in the body. You’re also going to hear about why calories alone cannot dictate your body weight, and what the key epicaloric controllers are that determine how your fat is stored. This episode is my interview on my good friend Lewis Howes’ podcast, The School of Greatness, as part of the promotion for my newest book, <em>Eat Smarter</em>.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">I’m sharing some of the key insights I learned in my research for <em>Eat Smarter</em>, including how your diet influences your hormones and metabolism, how calories are processed and stored in the body, the link between your microbiome and your metabolism, and a whole lot more.
