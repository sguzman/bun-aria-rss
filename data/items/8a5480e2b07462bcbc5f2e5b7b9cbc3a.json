  "title": "#70 - Three Murders & A Strangling in Canyon Lake, California",
  "description": "<p>This week, we look at Canyon Lake, California, where a series of brutal murders leave police clueless, until one victim survives, and this ball of yarn begins to unravel. Everybody is shocked when they find out who is responsible for the deaths of 3 women, and the attempted strangling of another. The only things more shocking are the reason for the killings, and the fact that they might not have been the only ones... It's a crazy one! Along the way, we find out whether or not you can make a boat out of cardboard, if a boogie board could be a motive for murder, and if finding the bank cards of 3 dead women can be considered just good luck!! </p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p><p><br></p><p>New episodes every Thursday!!</p><p>Please subscribe, rate, and review!</p><p>Listen on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you listen to podcasts!</p><p>Head to<a href=\"http://shutupandgivememurder.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> shutupandgivememurder.com</a> for all things Small Town Murder!</p><p>For merchandise:<a href=\"http://crimeinsports.threadless.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> crimeinsports.threadless.com</a></p><p>Check out James and Jimmie's other show: Crime in Sports</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on social media!</p><p>Facebook:<a href=\"http://facebook.com/smalltownpod\" target=\"_blank\"> facebook.com/smalltownpod</a></p><p>Instagram:<a href=\"http://instagram.com/smalltownmurder\" target=\"_blank\"> instagram.com/smalltownmurder</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/MurderSmall\" target=\"_blank\"> twitter.com/MurderSmall</a></p><p> </p><p>Contact the show: crimeinsports@gmail.com</p><p><br></p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
