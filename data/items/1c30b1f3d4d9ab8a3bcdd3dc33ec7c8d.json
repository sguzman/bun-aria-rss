  "description": "Picking it up where they left off last week, the guys discuss the necessity of developing patience, the value of helping people in practical ways, and putting forth the type of effort that allows you to obtain things in life for yourself. \n\n“One man’s obedience, disobedience, and health are connected to others people's destinies.”\n\n10:15 - Are you healthy enough emotionally, spiritually, and financially to handle what’s coming your way? Don’t skip the steps of preparation.\n\n17:05 - Follow what God wants you to do more than following the trends of what people want you to do. Stay true to yourself throughout the process without fearing other people's opinions. \n\n20:51 - “Don’t second guess yourself. Trust the decisions you’ve made to get here.” Have confidence in your ability to get the job done. Don’t be afraid of mistakes because they’re a healthy part of every journey.\n\n40:50 - “Don’t bypass the process for people.” We don’t have the authority to help others as God helps us. Direct people to the ultimate source in God!\n\nTakeaways\nKeeping Moving Forward! Don’t let anything keep you from moving forward.\n\nHelp people help themselves instead of enabling them. Help them realize their persistence and drive in the face of their challenges is the key to their success.\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat areas of your life do you need to obtain oil in?\n\nHave you found yourself attempting to play the role of God in other people's lives?\n\n\nListener Perks\n\n\nOrganifi Is giving our listeners up to 20% off of their order!
