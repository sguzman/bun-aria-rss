That course is now in its fourth year and we discuss the philosophy behind the life-changing concept that simply following what you love is all you ever need to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Louise's free Find Your Joy taster course: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e11egv1/metadata/edit\">https://www.louisefletchercourses.com/wait-list-FYJ-2021</a></p>\n<p>Alice's Connected Artist Club is open now &nbsp;<a href=\"https://soulrocketstudio.com/connected-open\">https://soulrocketstudio.com/connected-open</a></p>\n<p>Find out more about Georgina Noel <a href=\"//\">https://www.georginanoel.com/</a><br>\n<br>\nBBC: The Life and Times of Hans Holbein by Franny Moyle <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/series/m000vp4y\">HERE</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e110n98/metadata/edit\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e110n98/metadata/edit\">www.louisefletcherart.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
