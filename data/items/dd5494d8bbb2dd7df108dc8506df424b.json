  "description": "Sermon on The Mount: Chapter 16 - “The Judgment of Judgment.” Matthew 7:1-6. “Do not judge, or you too will be judged.” Here we go with another passage that has been taught a lot, but is often missing the point or full context Jesus was bringing. What is judgment, really? What is ‘Krino,’ and how is it both good and bad? Is it a matter of how we judge or what we judge? How does discernment aide us in this? How is discernment made more palpable and effective? How can the ‘plank in our own eye’ teaching still be helpful and applicable for us if we have heard it so many times? Is there room for calling things or actions out in today’s world? There is so much to work through here. Jesus understands the complexities of the issue, as well as the depth and uniqueness of each person listening.\n \nWe at VOX are committed to not only confronting all of this, first in ourselves, but also to wrestle with what Jesus would have for us in this time. We are committed to repentance and a pursuit of discernment.\n\nThis is the second section of the Sermon on the Mount. We’re excited to walk this road with you all.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
