  "title": "The Most Stylish Food Stylist, Mariana Velásquez",
  "description": "Mariana Velásquez’s keen eye for detail has made her one of the most in-demand food stylists around, and her personal style—from her signature red lipstick to her favorite flowy aprons—has earned her a reputation as the most stylish. Her professional accomplishments are impressive. Mariana has worked on cookbook projects with the likes of First Lady Michelle Obama, was the food stylist on Lin-Manuel Miranda’s highly anticipated new film \"In The Heights,\" and has brought her talents to magazines from Vogue to Saveur. After working on more than 20 cookbooks, Mariana finally has her own. \"Colombiana\" is a love letter to Mariana’s native Colombia and celebrates her country’s cuisines, women, traditions, and ingredients. There’s more! She also has her own apron line, Limonarium. Mariana joins host Kerry Diamond to talk all about her line, her book, and the conversation that changed her life.\nThis episode was recorded at Newstand Studios at Rockefeller Center.
