  "description": "Are you ok? <br />We all would love to have a quick answer when someone asks us this, but life is not that simple. When we realize that our identity and who we are is made up of a combination of many parts that are feeling and experiencing different things at a given time, we are able to work on the different parts without sabotaging the whole. Join us for 12 weeks, 24 episodes where we take an honest look at the parts of you and the God who makes us whole. I want to walk beside you in this tension and remind you what Scripture tells us that God wants for us. Forward this to your friends, gather your people, and process this in community.<br /><br />Find out more about this Identity Season | jennieallen.com/blog/identity<br /><br />Join the Newsletter | jennieallen.com/newsletter<br /><br />Want to get texts from Jennie and our team? | Send PODCAST to 214-225-6267<br /><br />Connect on Socials<br />Instagram: instagram.com/jennieallen/<br />Facebook: facebook.com/jenniesallen<br />TikTok: tiktok.com/@jenniesallen<br />Pinterest: pinterest.com/jenniesallen/",
