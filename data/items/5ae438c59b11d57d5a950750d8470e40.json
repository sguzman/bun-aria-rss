  "description": "Episode 19 of the Plant Proof Podcast with Frank Cusimano is all about using science to make objective & informed food choices.\n\nWith a host of science degrees under his belt, a PHD in Nutrition and Medical Degree underway, and an absolute passion for reading scientific literature, Frank is perfectly suited to help us navigate through many commonly asked questions about healthy eating and where the science sits. Whats cool, which Frank goes into, is that he doesn't specifically label himself as 'Vegan', rather he just eats a certain way because it is supported by science as the healthiest way, and it just so happens to mean it does not include animal products and is therefore labelled by society as 'vegan'.\n\nIn this episode we cover:\n\nFrank's story and transition to a plant-based diet\n\nOptimal times to eat meals and should we fast?\n\nBCAA's\n\nHow much Protein do we need?\n\nEating for longevity\n\nLosing weight with Longevity in mind\n\nKeto & Paleo Diets\n\nIs Soy healthy?\n\nOmega 3's - are they important and where can we get them from? Do we need to supplement Omega 3?\n\nAn overview of the gut microbiome and the enteric nervous system\n\nIs Coconut Oil beneficial?\n\nShould we cook with oil?\n\nand much much more\n\n\nRegarding Soy you can see post's that both Frank and I have previously done on this topic below:\n\nCan Soy prevent Prostate Cancer?\n\nIs Soy Healthy?\n\nIs Soy Testosterone Lowering?\n\n\n\nREVIEW/SHARE:\nIf you enjoyed the episode and have a spare 1-2 minutes please leave a review on iTunes so the Plant Proof podcast ranks higher and becomes more discoverable for other listeners.
