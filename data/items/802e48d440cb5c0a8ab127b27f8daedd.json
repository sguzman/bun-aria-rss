  "description": "<p>“One of the comments that I've often gotten from parents who say, my son read <em>Scythe</em>, or my daughter read, <em>Unwind</em>, and made me read it, because they wanted to talk to me about it. And then we discussed it. And then the parent would say, I never knew my kid thought that deeply. You know, I think when we write things that ask the reader to rise to the level of the writing, and the level of the ideas behind the writing, they will do it, and they will appreciate not being talked down to.” Acclaimed, prize-winning author Neal Shusterman continues to thrill readers of all ages with his series books like Scythe and Unwind, and standalones. He’s co-written his latest novel, Roxy, with his son, Jarrod Shusterman, and they join us on the show to talk about collaborating with family, connecting with their readers through story, creating unforgettable characters and more. Featured book: Roxy by Neal Shusterman and Jarrod Shusterman. Produced/hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>",
