  "title": "182 - Nation of Yahweh Cult: Murder, Manipulation, and Black Supremacy",
  "description": "<p>At the height of its power in the late 1980s, the Miami-based Nation of Yahweh cult had satellite temples around the country and a lucrative business empire of apartment complexes, hotels, stores and fleets of Greyhound buses and Rolls Royce cars, all painted stark white. Its leader, Hulon Mitchell, jr., aka Yahweh ben Yahweh, estimated the sect's holdings at $100 million. And what did this cult believe? That white people are \"devils\" and that black Americans and Africans are the true Jews who should own Israel and that white Jews are the spawn of Satan. And what did this cult do? They killed a bunch of people and their leader molested and manipulated an untold number of followers in the craziest of ways. One of the wildest tales we've told so far! </p>\n<p>Check out Lynze and I's new horror podcast <strong>Scared to Death.</strong> Listen on Spotify, Stitcher, iTunes, Youtube, and more! Here's the iTunes link: <a href=\"https://apple.co/2MRMgai\"><strong>https://apple.co/2MRMgai</strong></a></p>\n<p>We've donated $4800 this month to The Martin Richard Foundation.
