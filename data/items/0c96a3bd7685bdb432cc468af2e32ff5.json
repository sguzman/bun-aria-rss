  "title": "84* Cixin Liu Talk About Science Fiction (JP, Pu Wang)",
  "description": "John and Pu Wang, a Brandeis professor of Chinese literature, spoke with science-fiction genius Cixin Liu back in 2019. His most celebrated works include The Three Body Problem, The Dark Forest, and Death’s End.\nWhen he visited Brandeis to receive an honorary degree, Liu paid a visit to the RTB lair to record this interview. Liu spoke in Chinese and Pu translated his remarks in this English version of the interview (the original Chinese conversation is at 刘慈欣访谈中文版 Episode 14c).\nMr. Liu, flanked by John and Pu (photo: Claire Ogden)\nThey discuss the evolution of Mr. Liu’s science fiction fandom, and the powerful influence of Leo Tolstoy on Mr. Liu’s work, which leads to a consideration of realism and its relationship to science fiction. Science fiction is also compared and contrasted with myth, mathematics, and technology.\nLastly, they consider translation, and the special capacity that science fiction has to emerge through the translation process relatively unscathed. This is a testament to science fiction’s taking as its subject the affairs of the whole human community–compared to the valuable but distinctly Chinese concerns of Mo Yan, or the distinctly Russian concerns of Tolstoy.\nDiscussed in This Episode:\n\nCixin Liu, The Three Body Problem, The Dark Forest, and Death’s End\n\n\nLeo Tolstoy, War and Peace\n\n\nStanley Kubrick (dir.), 2001: A Space Odyssey\n\n\nE.M. Forster, “The Machine Stops“\n\nMo Yan, Red Sorghum\n\n\nRead the transcript here\n﻿Elizabeth Ferry is Professor of Anthropology at Brandeis University.
