  "title": "E-40, Rod Breslau (@Slasher), and Thumb Wrestling for Hostages",
  "description": "<p><p>KFC and Feits debate how they could save hostages, whether the Bachelorette is worth watching, whether the Democratic National debates are worth watching, who is the King of Late Night, and if Taco Tuesday is racist. King of the Bay Area, E-40 comes through to drink wine and tequila, inventing the phrases All Good, You Feel Me and Captain Save-A-Hoe, the Warriors, the Knicks, A$AP Rocky, the art of storytelling and Guy Fieri. Rod Breslau (the Adam Shefter of e-sports) joins the show to explain where all the money comes from, how leagues are organized, how kids get screwed out of the prize money, and what else Barstool should be doing in the e-sports space.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
