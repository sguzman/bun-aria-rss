  "description": "It's so exciting to own an antique quilt (whether you've inherited one or bought one in a store), but you need to treat them a little differently than you would a new quilt! On this episode, we're sharing how to repair, care for, wash, store, and display your antique quilts! We also share tips for working with a longarm quilter, a quilting book series we're loving, and tips for applique. Then we chat with Renee Nanneman -- it's a conversation you don't want to miss.\nFor more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
