This week on The Science of Happiness, our guest tries a practice to intentionally create good experiences and reflect on them. Deandrea Farlow is a member of the Bay Area Freedom Collective, a re-entry home where formerly incarcerated people can find community and connections. Deandrea  brings us into his experience with this practice, and shares what it’s like to find strength through the hardest times as well as  positive events, like the ones he created for our show. Psychologist Meg Speer explains how ruminating on good times can actually change the way we respond to stress. .</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practice:</strong> Creating and Recalling Positive Events</p>\n\n<p>1. Do an activity that you enjoy doing alone.</p>\n\n<p>2. With a friend, do something that you enjoy doing with others.</p>\n\n<p>3. Do something that you consider personally important and meaningful.</p>\n\n<p>4. Then take a step back and really think about these three events. Write about how they make you feel.
