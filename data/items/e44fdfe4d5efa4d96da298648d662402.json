  "description": "<p>DBLP is the largest open-access repository of scientific articles on computer\nscience and provides metadata associated with publications, authors, and\nvenues. We retrieved more than 6 million publications from DBLP and extracted\npertinent metadata (e.g., abstracts, author affiliations, citations) from the\npublication texts to create the DBLP Discovery Dataset (D3). D3 can be used to\nidentify trends in research activity, productivity, focus, bias, accessibility,\nand impact of computer science research. We present an initial analysis focused\non the volume of computer science research (e.g., number of papers, authors,\nresearch activity), trends in topics of interest, and citation patterns. Our\nfindings show that computer science is a growing research field (approx. 15%\nannually), with an active and collaborative researcher community. While papers\nin recent years present more bibliographical entries in comparison to previous\ndecades, the average number of citations has been declining. Investigating\npapers' abstracts reveals that recent topic trends are clearly reflected in D3.\nFinally, we list further applications of D3 and pose supplemental research\nquestions. The D3 dataset, our findings, and source code are publicly available\nfor research purposes.\n</p>",
