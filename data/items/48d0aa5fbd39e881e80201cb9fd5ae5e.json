  "description": "<p>In this paper, we develop two anisotropic solutions for static\nself-gravitating spherical structure in the presence of electromagnetic field\nthrough gravitational decoupling approach in $f(G,T)$ theory, where $G$ and $T$\ndenote the Gauss-Bonnet term and trace of the energy-momentum tensor,\nrespectively. The extra source with isotropic seed sector is responsible for\ngenerating anisotropy in the spacetime. The system of field equations is\ndecoupled into two arrays by using minimal geometric deformation in the radial\ncomponent. The first set portrays the isotropic regime whereas the second set\nrepresents the anisotropic system. The metric coefficients of the Krori-Barua\nspacetime are employed to extract solution of the first set while two\nconstraints on the radial and temporal components of the extra source yield the\ncorresponding two solutions. Finally, we investigate the influence of charge\nand decoupling parameter on the physical viability and stability of the\nobtained solutions. We conclude that the resulting solutions in this modified\ntheory indicate more feasible and stable structures.\n</p>",
