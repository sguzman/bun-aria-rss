  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, 'Big Baby Formula' has joined forces with 'Big Oil' to gauge prices on what little formula is available due to the supply chain shortages. The left's only suggestion is to labor more babies, so we'll need less formula. The options for meat and electricity are also limited, so the Biden Administration has announced a new agency to oversee 'Environmental Justice' that, in effect, these enviro-Marxists will make America poor and destroy our economic system while blaming climate change in the process. The Democrats and the media are up to no good and are creating a combustible situation like we've never seen. Encouraging protests at the homes of Supreme Court Justices homes. Sonny Hostin from The View suggests that the SCOTUS should do what the consensus of Americans wants, not what the Constitution says. Then, Nancy Pelosi has been the most irresponsible of all and is encouraging violence on Supreme Court Justices, meanwhile, she leads the charge against the January 6th protesters. Washington Republicans need to return the favor with an all-Republican commission to investigate Pelosi when and if they gain a majority. Later, Epoch Times reporter Hans Mahncke joins the show to discuss how this program deduced that there was spying on President Trump after analyzing public reporting on the matter in 2017 and it sent panic among the Obama administration. Mahncke added that the FBI and DOJ officials doubled down on Christopher Steele anyway.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
