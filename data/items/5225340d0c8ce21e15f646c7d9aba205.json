  "description": "<div>How many times have you romanticized your life and where you THOUGHT you’d be by a certain age. For many of us, by 30 we imagine ourselves to be wifed up and thriving in a career. <br>\n<br>\nIn this episode, I sit down with Kamie Crawford, the host of MTV’s Catfish and former Miss Teen USA. Kamie is also the host of her very own Podcast called Relationshit. Kamie is the epitome of 30, flirty and thriving! <br>\n<br>\nLast time Kamie was on the podcast, we broke down the lows and hell nos that led to her breakup and now, we are breaking down what she is leaving behind in her 20s and what she is welcoming in her 30s, including... a new love. </div>\n<br>\n<div>Thanks to the sponsors of this episode Better Help!
