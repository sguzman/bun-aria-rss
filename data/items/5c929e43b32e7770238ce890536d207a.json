  "description": "<p>If you find yourself questioning some of your deepest held beliefs and wondering if you can hold on to your Christian faith, you are in the right place. This is a safe place where we examine the questions that people on the same journey ask, and we are looking for the truth. \n\nIf you feel lonely and ask many bigger-than-life questions, please consider subscribing. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/c/DealingWithDeconstruction'>https://www.youtube.com/c/DealingWithDeconstruction </a>\n\nTake the OMA Mental Health Crash Course <a href='https://oneminuteapologist.com/mhcc'>https://oneminuteapologist.com/mhcc </a>\n\nTake the OMA Apologetics Crash Course <a href='https://oneminuteapologist.com/acc'>https://oneminuteapologist.com/acc</a>\n\n<a href='https://www.patreon.com/oneminuteapologist'> https://www.patreon.com/oneminuteapologist </a>\n\nDo you ever doubt your ability to answer bigger than life questions like, “Why do I exist? What is the purpose of life? Can I know God? If so, how? Are miracles possible?” And if God exists what’s with all the evil in the world? Do questions like these ever nag at you? If so, you’ve come to the right channel. I too am a fellow wonderer who thinks about stuff like this. I (Bobby Conway) am the founder and host of the rapidly-growing ministry, The One Minute Apologist, which is found on YouTube and at oneminuteapologist.com. Here I provide quick, credible answers to apologetic questions that resource people with a hunger to defend their Christian faith. These videos will often include interviews. I’ve had the privilege of interviewing some of the world's leading Christian apologists. Among them are: William Lane Craig, Josh McDowell, Hank Hanegraaff, JP Moreland, Norman Geisler, Frank Turek, and many more. #deconstructing #apologetics #christianapologetics #oneminapologist #Christianity #God #bobbyconway #doubtingGod #doubtingJesus #doubtingtowardfaith</p>\n",
