  "description": "<p>Union Terminal in Cincinnati, Ohio was one of the last great American train stations built and has the largest half-dome in the western hemisphere. The terminal has helped tourists get around, welcomed World War II soldiers home and now features several museums. The unique Art Deco building also served as inspiration for the Justice League's Hall of Justice. The Cincinnati Art Museum has stood for over 136 years. Both of these locations have several ghost stories. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Cincinnati's Union Terminal and Art Museum. Moment in Oddity as suggested by Jill Phenix Martinez and features Dead Man's Hole and This Month in History features the creation of United Artists. Our locations were suggested by Angela Wallingford.</p> <p>This episode sponsored by Surfshark.
