  "description": "<p>&ldquo;Inconceivable!&rdquo;. There are certain tasks in life that feel virtually impossible. One that comes to mind is painting your house- &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that, I&rsquo;m not a professional painter!&rdquo;. When in reality, that&rsquo;s a project you actually <em>could</em> perform well. Or another one might be something like baking some biscuits- &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not some culinary magician who can whip together some homemade biscuits from scratch!&rdquo;. When fact, that&rsquo;s something 6th graders learn how to do in middle school. And the same thing is true for starting your own business- there seems to be this special aura surrounding small businesses that lead many to think that they don&rsquo;t have what it takes. That it takes some special wizardry to run your own business. But we think that you do, in fact, have what it takes, that the pros outweigh the cons, and that the financial upside is worth leaving the &ldquo;safety&rdquo; of a W2 job. Listen as we cover the many reasons we believe starting a business is actually easier than you think.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Let's Get Some F****** Fraanch Toast by Bhramari Brewing!
