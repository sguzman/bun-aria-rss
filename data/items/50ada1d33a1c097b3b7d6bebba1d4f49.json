  "description": "Rob Huebel and Marc start a new podcast within this podcast. It's a show called Contact List and they're pretty sure it makes them sound like jerks. But before that, Rob tells Marc about getting started in comedy during the early days of the UCB Theater, which led to his sketch comedy show Human Giant as well as rolls in movies like The Descendants and TV shows like The League. Plus, they talk about Rob's other new show, Do You Want to See a Dead Body?, which is better than Contact List. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
