  "description": "Without movies or TV shows to shoot or music to record, celebrities were restless in 2020 and eager to connect with a public that, at least for a while, couldn't care less about them. Sam wraps up the year in celebrity culture with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lindseyweber?lang=en\">Lindsey Weber</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bobbyfinger?lang=en\">Bobby Finger</a>, co-hosts of the podcast <a href=\"https://www.whoweekly.us/\"><em>Who? Weekly</em></a>, and breaks down how a pandemic changed our relationship with the rich and the famous. Stuck in quarantine, it turns out that stars really are just like us... and often a little worse. <br/><br/><em>Wanna show your love for 'It's Been a Minute'?
