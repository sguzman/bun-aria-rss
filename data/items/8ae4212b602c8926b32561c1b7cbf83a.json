  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we are told that we must trust the medical and scientific experts, but what if the medical and scientific experts have gone completely insane and abandoned the most basic medical and scientific truths for ideological reasons? What then? We’ll talk about that today. Also Five Headlines including some good news from the Olympics as the women’s USA soccer team continues to lose and the trans weightlifter Laurel Hubbard completely flops in embarrassing fashion. Plus, Democrats panic as the eviction moratorium comes to an end. But should there have ever been an eviction moratorium? And we’re told that Florida is in the middle of a COVID crisis. Is that true? We’ll talk about the data that the panic pushers don’t want us to focus on. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, Fauci, Don Lemon, and Ted Lieu and others all say that you have the right to be free from sickness. They’re horrible wrong, of course, and I’ll explain why.\nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
