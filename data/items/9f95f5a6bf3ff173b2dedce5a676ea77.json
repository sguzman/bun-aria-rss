Lewis, Relationships, Behavior Change and Self-Awareness, Why We Are All (Mostly) Making It Up as We Go, and Much More | Brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://manscaped.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MANSCAPED</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;premium grooming products, </strong><a href=\"http://80000hours.org/tim\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>80,000 Hours</strong></a>&nbsp;<strong>free career advice for high impact and doing good in the world, and </strong><a href=\"http://helixsleep.com/tim\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Helix Sleep</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;premium mattresses.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Welcome to another episode of <a href=\"http://tim.blog/podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Tim Ferriss Show</em></a>, where it is usually my job to sit down with world-class performers of all different types to tease out the habits, routines, favorite books, and so on that you can apply and test in your own life. This time, we have a slightly different format, and I’m the guest.&nbsp;</p><p>As some of you know, to celebrate the 15th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em></a>, which was first published on April 24th, 2007 (4/24/07), I signed 424 copies of the book. As thousands of you threw your hat in the ring to win a signed copy, I wanted to do something special for all the entrants. So, I invited those folks to a private YouTube Q&A. This episode is the recording of that session.&nbsp;</p><p>I answered many questions on a variety of topics, including startup investments, IFS therapy, my views on wealth and money, C.S. Lewis, lower-back pain, solitary time and its challenges, lessons from Kevin Kelly, books I’m currently reading, maintaining relationships, Japan travel tips, from whom to take advice (and how to evaluate advice), self-awareness, behavior change, my current alcohol consumption (or lack thereof), and much, much more.</p><p>I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</p><p>*</p><p><strong>This episode is brought to you by&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://manscaped.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MANSCAPED</strong></a><strong>!</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://manscaped.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MANSCAPED</a>&nbsp;is bringing you the total package to ensure your package is the perfect package.

Lewis, Relationships, Behavior Change and Self-Awareness, Why We Are All (Mostly) Making It Up as We Go, and Much More | Brought to you by MANSCAPED premium grooming products, 80,000 Hours free career advice for high impact and doing good in the world, and Helix Sleep premium mattresses. \n\nWelcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where it is usually my job to sit down with world-class performers of all different types to tease out the habits, routines, favorite books, and so on that you can apply and test in your own life. This time, we have a slightly different format, and I’m the guest. \n\nAs some of you know, to celebrate the 15th anniversary of The 4-Hour Workweek, which was first published on April 24th, 2007 (4/24/07), I signed 424 copies of the book. As thousands of you threw your hat in the ring to win a signed copy, I wanted to do something special for all the entrants. So, I invited those folks to a private YouTube Q&amp;A. This episode is the recording of that session. \n\nI answered many questions on a variety of topics, including startup investments, IFS therapy, my views on wealth and money, C.S. Lewis, lower-back pain, solitary time and its challenges, lessons from Kevin Kelly, books I’m currently reading, maintaining relationships, Japan travel tips, from whom to take advice (and how to evaluate advice), self-awareness, behavior change, my current alcohol consumption (or lack thereof), and much, much more.\n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I did.\n\n*\n\nThis episode is brought to you by MANSCAPED! MANSCAPED is bringing you the total package to ensure your package is the perfect package. No, I didn’t come up with that line… but I tested and loved their products, so I can vouch that I’m still intact and ready for my centerfold shoot. Was it scary? Yes. Was it worth it? Also yes. My girlfriend makes the effort, so I figured it was only fair. MANSCAPED is the most effective way to keep clean, pristine, and looking like a dream through the sweatiest summer months.\n\nThe Perfect Package 4.0 is the ultimate grooming kit that includes everything you need for optimal below-the waist hygiene. Use their precision-engineered Lawn Mower 4.0—yes, “Lawn Mower”—electric trimmer to remove excess and avoid the dreaded swamp crotch. Feel confident in trimming hard-to-reach areas with MANSCAPED’s SkinSafe technology, which helps reduce the risk of nicks and snags. It’s time to take care of yourself; time for some basic landscaping. Get 20% off and free shipping with the code TIMTIM at Manscaped.com.\n\n*\n\nThis episode is also brought to you by 80,000 Hours! You have roughly 80,000 hours in your career. That’s 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year for 40 years. They add up and are one of your biggest opportunities, if not the biggest opportunity, to make a positive impact on the world.

This time, we have a slightly different format, and I’m the guest.&nbsp;</p><p>As some of you know, to celebrate the 15th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em></a>, which was first published on April 24th, 2007 (4/24/07), I signed 424 copies of the book. As thousands of you threw your hat in the ring to win a signed copy, I wanted to do something special for all the entrants. So, I invited those folks to a private YouTube Q&A. This episode is the recording of that session.&nbsp;</p><p>I answered many questions on a variety of topics, including startup investments, IFS therapy, my views on wealth and money, C.S. Lewis, lower-back pain, solitary time and its challenges, lessons from Kevin Kelly, books I’m currently reading, maintaining relationships, Japan travel tips, from whom to take advice (and how to evaluate advice), self-awareness, behavior change, my current alcohol consumption (or lack thereof), and much, much more.</p><p>I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</p><p>*</p><p><strong>This episode is brought to you by&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://manscaped.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MANSCAPED</strong></a><strong>!</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://manscaped.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MANSCAPED</a>&nbsp;is bringing you the total package to ensure your package is the perfect package.
