  "title": "Ep. 772 - Famous Olympic Quitter Comes Out In Favor Of Baby Murder",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, for her next act, Simone Biles has come out as stridently pro-abortion. The Left is celebrating the news, but the argument she makes in favor of baby murder is quite demented, especially considering her own background. Also, CNN helps to raise 200 grand for a single mother who was facing eviction. But it turns out the story was a scam. President Biden is now inviting Tik Tok influencers to the White House to perform weird pro-vaccine skits. And we have an unfortunate but important update on the James Younger story. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with an NPR story about an alleged 1000 year old non-binary medieval warrior who was recently unearthed by archeologists. The story only gets weirder and dumber from there.\nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
