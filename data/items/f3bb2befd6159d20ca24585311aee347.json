  "description": "<p>You know comedian Joe Mande from his work as a writer and actor on beloved shows like Parks And Recreation and Hacks, but did you know a childhood obsession with the Sega Genesis game \"Earthworm Jim\" almost led to his downfall? Today on HOW DID WE GET WEIRD? we not only explore the weird and wonderful world of Sega Genesis, but Vanessa talks about why she is constantly trolling Jonah on social media and Joe recounts the time that he was so convinced that he would win a shopping spree at Toys R Us that he painstakingly planned out his entire route using a map of the store's layout. We also play a round of our favorite complaining game \"Valid Moan or Unnecessary Groan\" where we debate vital local issues from 2011, which range from pet cleanup etiquette to whose face should or should not be on Cleveland's gas pumps. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
