  "description": "<p>I present a formal connection between algebraic effects and game semantics,\ntwo important lines of work in programming languages semantics with\napplications in compositional software verification.\n</p>\n<p>Specifically, the algebraic signature enumerating the possible side-effects\nof a computation can be read as a game, and strategies for this game constitute\nthe free algebra for the signature in a category of complete partial orders\n(cpos). Hence, strategies provide a convenient model of computations with\nuninterpreted side-effects. In particular, the operational flavor of game\nsemantics carries over to the algebraic context, in the form of the coincidence\nbetween the initial algebras and the terminal coalgebras of cpo endofunctors.\n</p>\n<p>Conversely, the algebraic point of view sheds new light on the strategy\nconstructions underlying game semantics. Strategy models can be reformulated as\nideal completions of partial strategy trees (free dcpos on the term algebra).\nExtending the framework to multi-sorted signatures would make this construction\navailable for a large class of games.\n</p>",
