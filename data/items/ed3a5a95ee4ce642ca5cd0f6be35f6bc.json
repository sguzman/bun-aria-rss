  "description": "<p>Since the unexpected discovery of fast radio bursts (FRBs), researchers have\nproposed varied theories and models to explain their phenomena. One such model\nthat has recently been developed incorporates the so-called\nGertsenshtein-Zel'dovich (GZ) effect, which states that when gravitational\nwaves traverse the pulsar magnetosphere, a portion of their gravitational\nradiation is transformed into electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The observed\nproperties of FRBs are consistent with the properties of this EM radiation,\nimplying, remarkably, that the GZ effect can account for both repeating and\nnon-repeating FRBs. If this model is correct, the pulsar's properties should\nnot change over time, and it would continue to emit both EM dipole and\ngravitational quadrupole radiation for a long period of time. This article\ntargets the gravitational radiation produced by the pulsar mechanism and shows\nthat several proposed gravitational wave detectors can detect these\ngravitational waves. If such detections are performed in the future from the\npositions of FRBs, it will validate the GZ process for FRB production and can\nrule out several other FRB theories.\n</p>",
