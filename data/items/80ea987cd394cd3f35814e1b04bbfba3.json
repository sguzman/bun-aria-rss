  "description": "Getting an abortion in Mississippi has never been easy, but it hasn't been impossible. Now, a case before the Supreme Court that centers on a clinic in Mississippi could upend abortion rights for pregnant people across the country.  <br/><br/>Today, the conservative-leaning court heard arguments in the case of <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization</em>. The clinic, which is the only abortion provider remaining in Mississippi, is challenging a 2018 state law that bans termination after 15 weeks of pregnancy. If the court upholds the law, it would reverse its own precedent by allowing states to interfere with the right to abortion at that stage of pregnancy. <br/><br/>NPR Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Nina Totenberg, SCOTUS Blog's Tom Goldstein, and Florida State University Law Professor Mary Ziegler parse the arguments and weigh in on the possibilities on how the justices could rule.<br/><br/>In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.<br/><br/>Email us at considerthis@npr.org.",
