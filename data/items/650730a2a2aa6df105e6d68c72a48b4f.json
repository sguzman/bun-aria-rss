Man, woman, or child—all are fair game. </p>\n\n<p>Today we journey into the realm of these horrific creatures with a real demon hunter, Joseph Stewart, to see the intense carnage unleashed on an unsuspecting public.</p>\n\n<p>Get the book here: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3uAqDzo\">https://amzn.to/3uAqDzo</a></p>\n",
