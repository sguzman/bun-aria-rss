  "description": "Contributor(s): Professor Didier Fassin, Dr Richard Martin, Christina Varvia | The book engages in a 'counter-investigation' into a fatal encounter between armed French police and a member of the travelling community.  In doing so, it raises deep and troubling questions about the quality of interactions between marginalized communities and official police and judicial processes; and about power, prejudice, and differing constructions of truth.  It will be of interest to lawyers, criminologists, anthropologists and sociologists, and indeed to a general audience.",
