  "description": "Marc Ambinder is the author, with D.B. Grady, of Deep State: Inside the Government Secrecy Industry (Wiley, 2013). He is a contributing editor at GQ and The Atlantic magazine, and has served as White House Correspondent for National Journal. His new book investigates executive power and the role secrets play in US policy making. He weaves together eye-opening stories with a larger meditation on transparency and open government. His story toward the end of the book about a Secret Service accidentally shooting at and missing the President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, while he entered a vehicle in New York, has already drawn considerable interest for what it may say about the relationship between the Bush Administration and Iran.
