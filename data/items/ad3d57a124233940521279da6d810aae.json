  "description": "<a href=\"https://twitter.com/zakiya_harris\">Zakiya Dalila Harris</a> was working as an editorial assistant at a New York publisher when she ran into another Black woman for the first time on her office floor. That's when she got the idea for her book, <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Other-Black-Girl/Zakiya-Dalila-Harris/9781982160135\"><em>The Other Black Girl</em></a>. What's it like when you're used to being the <em>only</em> one, but now there's <em>another</em> one like you? And what if things get <em>weird</em>? Like, <em>really weird.</em> Sam and Zakiya talk about how her book subverts the office drama and what lessons it has for a still very white publishing industry.<br/><br/>We've love your feedback!
