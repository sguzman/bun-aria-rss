  "title": "162: Amos Lee, Reaching Out Through Music",
  "description": "Musician Amos Lee started meditating in college as a way to cope with his mother's breast cancer diagnosis and his own Generalized Anxiety Disorder. For two years, he was going on retreats and meditating two hours a day. Lee knows what it's like to face personal hardships, so he views his music \"as a service,\" a way to reach out and comfort people who may also be suffering. He talks about how working on his new album, \"My New Moon,\" was therapeutic for him, writing about some very personal experiences. Finally, Lee performs a song he wrote after witnessing his grandmothers passing, in this touching episode. Have a question for Dan?
