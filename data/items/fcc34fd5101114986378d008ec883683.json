  "description": "<p>My brain is back! Today we take a sober look at the Columbine massacre, when on April 20th, 1999, two Columbine High School seniors, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, shot and killed twelve students, one teacher, and injured over twenty other students before shooting and killing themselves. Why? What possessed these two young men who were weeks away from leaving high school to do this? We answer that question as best we can today and also challenge the popular narrative that these two were bullied social outcasts who did what they did to strike back against the \"jocks\" who supposedly terrorized them. A deep dive into a tragedy that inspired so many future school shootings, today, on Timesuck. </p>\n<p><strong>We've donated $6,100 this month to the Innocence Project.</strong> The innocence project exonerates the wrongly convicted through DNA testing and reforms the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice.
