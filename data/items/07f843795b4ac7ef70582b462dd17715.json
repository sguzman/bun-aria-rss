  "description": "<p>As I touched on in a previous episode, much of my evolution as a homesteader and as a person in general has revolved around saying 'NO' to traditional systems. However, a recent trip to Virginia forced me to confront another system that I'm not so fond of but have reluctantly accepted in the past: public transportation. Listen to today's episode to find out why I had so much anxiety over flying, how a cancelled flight led to a cross country road trip, and why (and how) Christian and I are opting out of public transportation. If you've ever felt the desire to ditch mass transportation, I'm certain this episode will resonate with you.</p><p>Ready to join the newsletter for mavericks who value free thinking, ditching the status quo, and taking charge of every part of our lives?
