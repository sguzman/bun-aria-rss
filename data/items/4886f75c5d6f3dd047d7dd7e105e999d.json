  "description": "Big announcement! I added a second show to Dallas! Get tickets at heathermcdonald.net \n\nJlo and Ben had their 2nd wedding, and I got the details. Bethenny Frankel maybe can’t take a joke. And Just Like That, Aiden returns, and I predict what will happen between him and Carrie. USC Frats are defecting, and I’m glad to be a boy mom. RHOBH Lisa Rinna says she’s been worse, and that was when her mom was alive. Then return guest Kimberlee Archie is here to explain how the victims of Tom Girardi could recoup their money. What does it mean that Tom’s former judge/mistress returns his gifts to the trustee? Could more people and politicians be forced to do the same? Why did a lawyer contact Sutton? What is truth and not alleged, and why is this the most significant legal scandal in California history? This is So juicy, informative, and still funny. \n\nSubscribe on Apple Podcasts to get exclusive Extra Juicy episodes every Friday and get all episodes of Juicy Scoop, ad-free\n\nOr get access to Extra Juicy on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/juicyscoop\n\nTo bring your brand to life in this podcast, email podcastadsales@sonymusic.com\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
