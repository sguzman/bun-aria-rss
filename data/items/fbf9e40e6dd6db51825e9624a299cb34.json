  "description": "Back from a quick trip to Ohio, Daniel shares his latest experience with the airports and traveling. [0:15] We discuss the Virginia governor race… what it says about the current mood in the U.S… and how the results will impact spending bills being negotiated right now. [3:10] We’ve seen some wild price action in Avis Budget and Bed Bath & Beyond this earnings season. I lay out the reasons behind these parabolic moves... and a critical lesson about shorting stocks. [8:05] Zillow Group’s weak Q3 earnings were shortly followed by news that the company would be canceling its artificial intelligence (AI) house-flipping program. Daniel highlights some crazy stats around its real estate… and why you shouldn’t get caught up in the euphoria around the housing boom. [16:45] Nike is set to report earnings next month. Daniel and I debate the pros and cons of buying the stock going into the report. [24:25] And finally, we share our thoughts on JPMorgan limiting its clients’ ability to buy certain marijuana stocks... and explain why you should be paying attention to Meta—the company previously known as Facebook—now more than ever.
