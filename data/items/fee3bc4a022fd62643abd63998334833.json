  "description": "<p>MarketWatch’s Mark Hulbert and Seeking Alpha contributor Jeff Miller discuss whether America’s drowning in debt will sink the stock market.

I also point out that the indebtedness process is precisely the opposite of the process financial advisors employ to build their clients’ wealth.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
