  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys finally chat about their fall plans which include a nationally syndicated radio show on Westwood One and the video version on DAZN. Pat also explains what his fall will be like including the radio show/livestream, the podcast, Thursday Night College Football, and Get Up! in New York. It's going to be a busy fall, but it's going to be a lot of fun. Next, radio host, ESPN College Football Analyst, former Heisman Trophy finalist and #2 overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft, Ryan Leaf joins the show for an incredible conversation. They cover his days through college at Washington State, and his eventual experience in the NFL. He also candidly talks about his time in prison, and what the exact moment was that changed his life, and when he realized he needed to start becoming the person he wanted to be. He also discusses who some of his favorite current athletes are, whether or not he ever got into any Longest Yard type situations while in prison, what some of his fondest memories from his NFL days are, and what other sports he excelled at growing up. It's an inspiring and honest interview you don't want to miss (36:34-1:25:38). It's a great episode, and it's going to be an even better fall. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
