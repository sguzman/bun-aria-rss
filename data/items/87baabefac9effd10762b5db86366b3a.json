It's this rare combination that makes Dr. Kahn unique in his field.</p><p>But let there be no mistake – Dr. Kahn is no new age hippie.&nbsp;In additional to several post-doctorate certifications, he graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Michigan's prestigious Inteflex program (a 6-year undergraduate / graduate program that developed doctors fresh out of high school) and has served as&nbsp;a Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at Wayne State University School of Medicine since 1993.</p><p>In addition, Dr. Kahn has authored over 130 articles on heart disease, over 10 book chapters (as well as a new book due out in February 2014), and several monographs and video national presentations.

He has performed thousands of cardiac catheterizations and stent procedures and has been advising patients on heart healthy programs for over 20 years.</p><p>In other words, Dr. Kahn knows what he is talking about.&nbsp;And his&nbsp;message is powerful — if you want to experience true long-term wellness, then you must focus on implementing sustainable long-term preventive protocols into your lifestyle.&nbsp;And this starts and ends with diet and active lifestyle.</p><p>It was an honor to spend 90 minutes with Dr. Kahn, and his message is invaluable.&nbsp;Simply put, the world would be a better place if we had more doctors like him.&nbsp;So listen up people.</p><p>Take his message to heart.
