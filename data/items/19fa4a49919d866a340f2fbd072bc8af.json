  "description": "<p>This paper is concerned with the existence of insensitizing controls for a\nfourth order semilinear parabolic equation. Here, the initial data is partially\nunknown, we would like to find controls such that a specific functional is\ninsensitive for small perturbations of the initial data. In general, this kind\nof problems can be recast as a null controllability problem for a nonlinear\ncascade system. We will first prove a null controllability result for a linear\nproblem by global Carleman estimates and dual arguments. Then, by virtue of\nLeray-Schauder's fixed points theorem, we conclude the null controllability for\nthe cascade system in the semi-linear case.\n</p>",
