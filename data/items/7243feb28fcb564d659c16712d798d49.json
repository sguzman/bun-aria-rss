Early voters want to change their vote after the Hunter Biden story and it's possible in some states. James Woods tweet on ACB and leftists who supposedly want diversity. Barrett clarified the role of a judge, her speech should be shown to every student in America. Winning montage: Trump puts three conservative justices on the Supreme Court in four years. Caller asks Rush if his \"sources\" think the GOP can flip the House, hold the Senate. Lindsey Graham sounds scared to death. Nothing makes any sense, the candidate who draws thousands is behind the candidate who's barely running? After all of Trump's accomplishments, people are going to vote for Biden? It doesn't make any sense. Trump speech introducing Barrett focuses on defending our history, founding, and Constitution. The Democrats want to erase our founding, destroy the Constitution. Trump urges people to change their vote.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>Why would Google allow people to know they can change their vote? The behavior of Democrats and the media should not be rewarded with a Trump loss. What the pollsters might be missing. Media trying to suppress your vote with polls showing Biden ahead. Dems will raise hell after the election. There's no way Biden has a chance in Texas. Democrats will not allow a \"return to normal\" after the election. Charlamagne Tha God wonders why Trump did a two-hour rally with Rush, but Biden never went back to his show. Trump explains why he's going to Nebraska.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p>Biden can't unify the country because he represents the people who want to destroy the country. Biden talks about shuttered storefronts, results of lockdowns Democrats have forced on us. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's fabulous acceptance speech on the role of the judiciary. Democrats, Blumenthal, Coons, Schumer threaten judges, vow \"consequences\". Nina Totenberg, Victor Davis Hanson on the diminished role of Justice Roberts. Great jurists are chosen for their minds, not race or gender. CNN reporter goes to Pennsylvania, finds Trump voters. CNN anchors warn us we won't know who won on election night. Obama says Joe will fix the pandemic. What's he going to do? It's a virus. There is no fix. Trump tweets swing state polls, predicts \"great red wave.\" Obama's car rallies should be called fossil fuel rallies. Democrats threaten post-election unrest as a way to discourage voting for Trump. Declare Trump the winner and move on, because that's what's going to happen anyway.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
