  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing Alex Berenson recently being reinstated to Twitter which quickly leads to his work from years past on marijuana and how his predictions are proving true today. They also discuss Gavin Newsom's proclamations that're now being viewed as wildly hypocritical as he himself publicly ignores them. They also speak to a caller who wants their opinions on Newsom's ads that he ran in Florida. As the show wraps up they cicle back to Alex Berenson's tweet that got him kicked off twitter and discuss the idea of what most people think when they hear 'vaccine' versus what it technically means from a medical standpoint. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nMoinkBox.com/ADS\nCon-Cret.com/Podcast ",
