  "description": "We miss football. That's typically the case in April, but especially true now. Join us for a special episode of the Pick Six podcast featuring former NFL QB Trent Green, as we revisit and re-live some memorable match-ups in NFL history and the players that defined those games. First, some games more recent in our mind including Baltimore-Cleveland from Week 4 of 2019, which marked Baltimore's last regular season loss (6:45). Next, a trip all the way back...to January...for the Chiefs' epic comebacks against both the Texans and Titans, on their way to Super Bowl 54 (11:45). How about those epic Brady vs. Manning battles as the Patriots faced off against the Colts in the 2004 and 2007 AFC Championship Games (20:00)? Trent was a contemporary of those two, but claims even as a competitor, those two dueling was must-watch TV.\nIf those games bring up a sense of sports nostalgia, then you're in luck. Over the next week, CBS Sports Network will be re-airing all of the above games and more. Tune in for Classic NFL Games on the CBS Sports App or CBSSports.com by logging in with your provider.\nAnd before we let Trent go, we had to ask about 'The Greatest Show on Turf' St. Louis Rams that he was a part of (29:00). Why didn't the dynasty work out? What were his emotions being on the sideline during a Super Bowl victory? Many memories are shared during this trip down memory lane.\n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod @WillBrinson, @trentgreen10\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
