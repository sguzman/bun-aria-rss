  "description": "On this episode of The Fred Minnick Show, Scott Ian of the seminal thrash-metal band Anthrax takes time to chat with Fred. The band's co-founder and rhythm guitar player, Ian also is an author and spoken-word story teller. He also was a host on the VH1 show Rock Show for 48 episodes, interviewing rock greats such as Ozzy Osbourne, Ted Nugent and Tenacious D. When he and Fred get together, topics range from his first taste of whiskey (it didn't go well) to warning labels on music in the 1980s and '90s to a strange, private jet journey with Tommy Lee of Motley Crue. Naturally, whiskey is shared and discussed along the way.\n\nWhiskeys tasted:\nMaker's Mark 101 (7:14)\nSpirits of French Lick Unpretentious High Rye Bourbon Finished in Port Casks (17:54)\nAngel's Envy Finished in Tawny Port Casks (24:15)\nBarrell Bourbon Finished in Pear Brandy Barrels (42:14)\nBarrell Bourbon Armida finished in Pear Brandy, Jamaican Rum, and Sicilian Amaro Casks (52:18)\nMichter's Small Batch (1:00:39)\nDistillery 291 Whiskey (1:04:16)\n\nEPISODE SUMMARY\n\nFred and Scott cover a number of topics, such as:\nScott's first whiskey ever was a Jack and Coke with Lemmy Kilmister from Motorhead. He saw Lemmy in a pub in London, offered to buy him a drink and Lemmy steered him toward the whiskey mixer. The story didn't necessarily end well. He later began to drink whiskey more regularly with Dimebag Darrell of Pantera.\nFred shares the story of how Brown-Forman came to create the Woodford Reserve brand of bourbon.\nScott loves the Spirits of French Lick Unpretentious and is surprised to learn that it sells for up to $1,000 on the secondary whiskey market. In fact, the whiskey got popular with bourbon lovers even before Fred knew about it.\nWhile tasting the Angel's Envy Port Barrel finished whiskey, Fred talks about it being a \"creative\" whiskey, noting the distillery started aging in port barrels around 2013 that, at the time, was pushing the boundaries of whiskey-making. He notes that as recently as 2010, the finished whiskey market didn't really exist. \"I think Angel's Envy deserves a lot of credit for everything that they have done to kind of propel the category,\" he says.\nThat said, Fred doesn't believe such finished whiskeys should be called \"bourbon.\"\nFred also talks with Scott about Mexican whiskey and how the products continue to evolve. Of course, we all know Fred is a big tequila and mezcal fan, and Mexico is where those spirits truly begins.\nScott's wife Pearl Aday makes a surprise appearance and they discuss the duo's acoustic performance at Fred's virtual Repeal Day Expo back in December.\nScott likens Fred's preference for straight bourbon to his own liking of black coffee. \"I want to taste the bean ... Same with whiskey. I wanted to taste IT.\"\nFred again shares his disdain for vodka, a fact Scott already knew from following Fred's work. \"The reason why, it's not because that the spirit truly genuinely in my heart sucks, it's because of the business behind vodka, and the history behind vodka and what it did to bourbon in the 1960s, taking it off the shelf.\" He also hates that vodka distillers are paying for placement in liquor stores and that distributors often require retail outlets to buy vodka products in order to procure allocated bourbons. \"There's not a vodka magazine. You don't see vodka groups. It's an intoxicant and that's it. ... I would probably drink vodka over prisoner toilet wine, but that's about it.\"\nThe conversation leads to Scott's experiences as a teen-ager getting ripped on vodka and telling his mom he had \"the flu.\" He was hung over for four days with fevers, chills, no appetite ... now THAT'S a hangover. As a result, he stayed sober through the early years of Anthrax.\nWhen tasting the Barrell Bourbon Armida, both agree it's unique but not necessarily one they want to drink often - or more than one. Both felt the pear brandy casks were too...",
