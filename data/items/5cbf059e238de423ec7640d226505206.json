  "description": "<p><span class=\"il\">Beth</span> Ryan, my younger sister, has lived in a multitude of places and now resides in Los Angeles. She attended college in Boston and worked for two start-up computer companies. Wanting to get a better work-life balance, she took a year off and traveled around the world. This trip allowed her to find her passion and her voice.  She now runs a non-profit called Stepping Forward LA (<a href=\"http://www.steppingforwardla.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.steppingforwardla.org&source=gmail&ust=1600023163177000&usg=AFQjCNHCR7yJ9hR3_j-4JcqP4-KS4ZhjyA\">www.steppingforwardla.org</a>) supporting foster youth who age out of the foster care system. She was my first \"listener\" and probably has more embarrassing stories of me than anyone else.</p> <p>Stepping Forward LA <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/steppingforwardla/\">Instagram</a> feed.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"http://chrisryanphd.com/support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please consider supporting this podcast.</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intro music: “Brightside of the Sun,” by <a href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\">Basin and Range</a>; \"I Wish,\" by Stevie Wonder; \"Smoke Alarm,\" by <a href=\"https://www.carsieblanton.com/\">Carsie Blanton</a>.</span></p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
