She gets candid about the confessionals, her extended family, her sex life with Joe, their fighting style, how they’re still going strong 17-years later, and why she’s more worried now about her teenage kids listening to her podcast than being on reality TV. Melissa also talks fashion, starting her own clothing boutique, Envy, and how she balances career, motherhood, and marriage. Plus, Lala has stories from her recent girls night, and shares how she’s feeling about her post-baby bod, and the thought of having sober sex with someone new.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
