  "description": "1. What is your Enneagram number–and how does this ancient wisdom explain WHY you do what you do? \n2. Why Glennon *really* didn’t want to accept her Enneagram number, and how she finally saw herself clearly in it. \n3. How the Enneagram helps Amanda have much more compassion for herself–and how she uses it to understand common patterns in her marriage. \n4. Glennon and Amanda use the Enneagram to dissect what is *actually* going on in their conflicts, and how to make each other feel seen and understood.\n\nAbout Ashton:\nAshton Whitmoyer-Ober is an author, public speaker, Community Psychologist, and certified Enneagram educator. With a desire to see relationships strengthened and people empowered, she created Enneagram Ashton in early 2019. She is the author of Enneagram for Relationships, The Two of Us: A Three Year Couples Journal, and The Enneagram Made Simple.\n\nIG: @enneagramashton\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
