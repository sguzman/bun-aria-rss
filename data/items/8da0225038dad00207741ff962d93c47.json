  "description": "In Cultural Responses to Occupation in Japan: The Performing Body During and After the Cold War (Bloomsbury 2016), Adam Broinowski analyzes the emergence of Ankoku Butoh (dance of darkness) in the context of America’s de jure and then de facto occupation of Japan following the Second World War. Broinowski traces the evolution of Butoh from the work of early practitioners like Hijikata Tatsumi to later groups like Gekidan Kaitaisha (Theatre of Deconstruction), demonstrating the intimate links between 20th century Japanese history and Butoh. His work analyzes themes of trauma, memory, and war in a work that combines scholarly rigor with an artist’s passion for his chosen form.\nAndy Boyd is a playwright based in Brooklyn, New York. He is a graduate of the playwriting MFA program at Columbia University, Harvard University, and the Arizona School for the Arts. His plays have been produced, developed, or presented at IRT, Pipeline Theatre Company, The Gingold Group, Dixon Place, Roundabout Theatre, Epic Theatre Company, Out Loud Theatre, Naked Theatre Company, Contemporary Theatre of Rhode Island, and The Trunk Space.
