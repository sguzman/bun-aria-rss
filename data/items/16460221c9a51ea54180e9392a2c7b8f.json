  "title": "Ep. 45 - Guilt Is Good",
  "description": "The Church today treats guilt as a bad thing. Many Christians think that they ought never feel guilty, and that feelings of guilt should be rejected and overcome through positive-thinking. But this is a serious error. Guilt is our soul's response to sin. It is good that we have that response if we are in fact guilty of something. But what do we do with guilt? What can we learn from it and where should it lead us? That's what I want to talk about today.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
