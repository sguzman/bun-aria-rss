  "description": "<p>Sicily has a long history, and all of it is tied up with the evolution of wine and food in the Sicilian culture. In this show, we look at how this huge Mediterranean island played a major role in every major civilization from indigenous tribes to the current generation of young winemakers who seek to carve out a niche for <a href=\"http://www.winesofsicily.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Sicily</a> and its unique wine culture.</p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Trinacria-flag-1-1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" height=\"193\" /></p> <p>Here’s a brief timeline of what we talk about:<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Sicilian Wine Timeline...</strong></p> <ul> <li>10,000 years ago: Natural grapevines on Etna<br /> <br /></li> <li>Indigenous groups – Siculi, Socani, Elymi (Greeks who brought wine to Sicily)</li> </ul> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/DP114840.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"326\" height=\"326\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Photo: Metropolitan Museum of Art<br /></span></p> <ul> <li>8th – 3rd century BCE: Greeks arrived, introduced grapes and planted a lot of vineyards. They introduced pruning, varietal selection, bush training, and techniques to make great wine. Wine became an economic essential, as Sicily’s strategic position allows Greeks to export wine all over the Mediterranean. Inzolia, Zibibbo, Lucido/Catarratto were brought from Greece.<br /> <br /> <br /></li> <li>3rd century BCE: Roman Republic wins control of Sicily over the Greeks. The Roman Empire reigns afterwards. During both eras, the Romans planted more grapes, refined viticulture and winemaking techniques and traded Sicilian wine throughout the Roman empire, enriching wine merchants on Sicily. Mamertino, Julius Caesar’s favorite wine was made in Sicily. Wine vessels from Sicily have been found in France and other parts of Europe.</li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/symbols_of_bacchus_as_god_of_wine_and_the_theater_1961.13.1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"332\" height=\"230\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Photo: National Gallery Open Access</em></span></p> <ul> <li>535 AD –826 AD: After the chaos that ensued after the fall of the Roman Empire, Byzantines conquered Sicily and used it as their base in the Mediterranean to take over other parts of Italy. The church revived viticulture and make wine for religious purposes and for trade around the Mediterranean.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>826 AD –1061 AD: Muslim rule -- not great for wine, as it is against the law to consume alcohol. Viticulture did not prosper, but it didn’t die. A few people still drank, and Z'bīb, Muscat of Alexandria, thrived as a table grape. The food and spices introduced during this time had a lasting impact on the cuisine of Sicily.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>1061 AD –1189 AD: The Normans, Christian descendants from Vikings conquered Sicily and brought wine back to the table in full force. The rulers expanded vineyards and wine became an economic mainstay for the Normans – they traded it and it was part of life for the aristocracy so Sicilian wine had status. Rather than throw out the influence, the Normans incorporated Arab spices and cooking in their food. Vermicelli (pasta) likely was made here in 1154 AD, 100 years before Marco Polo was born.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>1189 AD – 1266 AD: Norman rule ends and Henry VI of Swabia claims the throne.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>1266 AD: Pope Clement IV puts Charles, Count of Anjou and Provence, on the throne in Sicily but in 1282 a French soldier insults a Sicilian girl on her way into a church for Vesper services. This sparks the uprising called the Sicilian Vespers, ending French rule.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>1282: Peter II of Aragón (Spain) took control of Sicily. Wine was an important economic commondity as it was traded to northern winemaking areas to beef up their wines with color, flavor, and alcohol.</li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Pedro_II_da_Siclia.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"335\" /><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Photo: Wikipedia</em></span></p> <ul> <li>1400s-1500s: Guilds of wine merchants and growers flourished under the Aragón rule.
