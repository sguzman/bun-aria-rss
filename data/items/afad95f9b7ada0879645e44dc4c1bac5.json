Our latest changes bring helpful updates to every Gmail user, including the best of <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/workspace/google-workspace-everyone/\">Google Workspace</a>, combined with a fresh new look based on <a href=\"https://material.io/blog/start-building-with-material-you\">Google’s Material Design 3</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"xnphc\">Evolving right along with you</h3><p data-block-key=\"fvfg1\">Over the years, we’ve introduced new ways to stay productive, like the tabbed inbox, AI-based innovations like <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/subject-write-emails-faster-smart-compose-gmail/\">Smart Compose</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gmail/save-time-with-smart-reply-in-gmail/?_ga=2.203019025.1031504087.1654550537-1839078869.1652905834\">Smart Reply</a> and the ability to get your Gmail on the go with native apps for <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">Android</a>. (Fun fact: Gmail was the first app on the Google Play Store to hit one billion installs!) Often these changes are highly visual, like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/eYEtiWUHCRM\">custom inbox themes</a>, but some really important ones are less visible, like AI-based <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/ridding-gmail-of-100-million-more-spam-messages-with-tensorflow\">spam</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/how-gmail-helps-users-avoid-email-scams\">phishing</a> and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/how-gmail-helps-users-avoid-email-scams\">malware</a> protections.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"xnphc\">Modern communication, modern design</h3><p data-block-key=\"ecvmf\">During the pandemic, we’ve seen a further evolution as tens of millions of people around the world started to move between email, messaging, group chat and video calls as a part of managing their daily lives. To help people stay connected, we’re bringing together Gmail, Chat, Spaces and Meet in a single, unified view.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--8\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><video alt=\"Gmail animation 1\" autoplay=\"\" class=\"article-image__media\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/Gmail_Left_Nav_no_Audio.mp4\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"animation of new Gmail navigation featuring  Chat, Spaces and Meet, with notification bubble &amp; snippets\" type=\"video/mp4\">Video format not supported</video></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"7fdiw\">The new integrated Gmail view with Chat, Spaces and Meet</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"vqycb\">We first announced the new integrated Gmail view as a <a href=\"https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/01/new-integrated-view-for-gmail.html\">sneak-peek preview</a> back in January, and we got tons of feedback from users who are excited about the new look and feel, along with improvement suggestions.</p><p data-block-key=\"dagfs\">Starting today, the integrated view will begin to roll out for all Gmail users who have turned on Chat. You’ll see a clean, streamlined way to move between apps that you can customize based on what works best for you.</p><p data-block-key=\"3c92s\">Using <a href=\"https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/05/new-gmail-quick-settings-optimize-inbox.html\">Quick Settings</a>, you can select apps you’d like to toggle between on the left side of your window, whether it’s Gmail by itself or a combination of Gmail, Chat, Spaces and Meet. Label lovers will see separate sections for system labels (like Starred, Snoozed and Important) and custom labels you make yourself. And people who love to chat will see conversation bubbles with snippets of incoming messages, along with options to quick reply instead of opening the full message.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--8\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><video alt=\"Gmail animation 2\" autoplay=\"\" class=\"article-image__media\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/Gmail_Enabling_Chat_Meet_no_Audio.mp4\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Animation showing how to select Chat and/or Meet  to appear in your Gmail inbox\" type=\"video/mp4\">Video format not supported</video></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"dg2me\">Easily select the applications you want to use in Gmail</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"vqycb\">Over the next few weeks, users can enable the integrated view, using the new visual configuration option in Settings — and anyone who wants to keep their existing Gmail layout will be able to do so. You get the Gmail that best fits your personal style, along with a clean, new look, thanks to our <a href=\"https://material.io/blog/start-building-with-material-you\">Material 3</a> design.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--8\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"The new design of the Gmail inbox.\" class=\"article-image--full\" data-loading='{\n                \"mobile\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Gmail_GM3.max-500x500.png\",\n                \"desktop\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Gmail_GM3.max-1000x1000.png\"\n              }' loading=\"lazy\" src=\" https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Gmail_GM3.max-100x100.png \" tabindex=\"0\"/></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"o2zp6\">The new Gmail interface updated with Material 3 look and feel.</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"vqycb\">More than a pretty (inter)face</h3><p data-block-key=\"e7rhl\">Beyond the user interface, we’re continuing to make Gmail more powerful and customizable. For example, we’re making it easier than ever to find the message you’re looking for by bringing <a href=\"https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/02/gmail-search-chips-ga.html\">search chips</a> to your inbox and improved search results that suggest the best match for your query.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--8\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><video alt=\"Gmail animation 4\" autoplay=\"\" class=\"article-image__media\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/Gmail_Inbox_Filters_no_Audio.mp4\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Animation showing showing inbox filters and search\" type=\"video/mp4\">Video format not supported</video></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"8ufei\">New inbox filters and improved search results</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"vqycb\">And later this year, we’re delivering an improved experience for tablet users, better emojis, new accessibility features and a whole lot more.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"vqycb\">Looking ahead</h3><p data-block-key=\"b0v5m\">Now you can optimize Gmail for how you like to stay connected, whether it’s as a standalone email application or a hub for easily moving between Chat, Spaces and video calls in Google Meet. After 18 years of helping people collaborate and get things done, Gmail is more helpful, customizable, and integrated than ever before.</p></div></div></body></html>",
