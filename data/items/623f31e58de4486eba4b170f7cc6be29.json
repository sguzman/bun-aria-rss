    "media:description": "\"A Long Way Past The Past\" (Solstice Version) by @Fleet Foxes from the album 'A Very Lonely Solstice', available now\nStream & download: https://fleetfoxes.ffm.to/averylonelysolstice\n\nAvailable for the first time since 2020's Winter Solstice Recording at Brooklyn's St. Ann & The Holy Trinity Church. Watch The Full Performance: https://youtu.be/3VB24LYsE60\n\nLyrics\n\nMore than I had in mind\nMore than I wish I knew\nAnd now it’s near on me\nSome rush of red fear\nAnd my worst old times look fine from here\n\nI know you walked this route\nAnd you might help me out\nYou said what's done is done\nI can't turn the hand 'round\nBut still it looks a long way down\n\nOh man, was it that much better then?\nWe were left alone, we were proud of our pain\nAnd so I want to walk out in the night\nSee the wide young river flood rain\n\nWe're not on one straight line\nI made my own way through\nAnd when the track goes cold\nI'll know that it's true\nThat rebirth won't work like it used to\n\nOh man, was it that much better then?\nWe were left alone, we were proud of our pain\nAnd so I want to walk out in the night\nSee the wide young river flood rain\n\nAnd I can't let go\nOf a lot I've left\nI'm holding nothing\nBut what I kept\nAnd it all got dimmer\nEach passing step\nAnd I need you with me\nAnd you read the writ\nAre you now insisting\nIs it not worth it?\nBut I've got no option\nI inherited this and I'm overcome\n\nThat's that, we're a long way from the past\nI'll be better off in a year or in two\n\n▶ Official Site: https://fleetfoxes.co\n▶ Facebook: https://facebook.com/FleetFoxes\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/fleetfoxes\n▶ Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3IEvCpy\n▶ Apple: https://apple.co/3dAI4s0\n▶ Store: https://fleetfoxes.ffm.to/officialstore\n\n#fleetfoxes #averylonelysolstice #antirecords",
