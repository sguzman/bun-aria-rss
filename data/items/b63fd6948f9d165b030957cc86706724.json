  "description": "<p>This week, in Webster Township, Michigan, a drifter is committing a series of robberies in a rural area, but when a reclusive woman disappears, it's not clear if he's actually the murderer... or if she was even murdered. Once the police get involved, it only gets worse, as this tale spins into craziness. It's a wild one!! Along the way, we find out how exciting it can be to stare at a barn, how much cocaine could possibly be on a farm, and that police dogs have a hard time finding bodies when other awful smells are around!! </p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p><p><br></p><p>New episodes every Thursday!!</p><p>Please subscribe, rate, and review!</p><p>Listen on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you listen to podcasts!</p><p>Head to<a href=\"http://shutupandgivememurder.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> shutupandgivememurder.com</a> for all things Small Town Murder!</p><p>For merchandise:<a href=\"http://crimeinsports.threadless.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> crimeinsports.threadless.com</a></p><p>Check out James and Jimmie's other show: Crime in Sports</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on social media!</p><p>Facebook:<a href=\"http://facebook.com/smalltownpod\" target=\"_blank\"> facebook.com/smalltownpod</a></p><p>Instagram:<a href=\"http://instagram.com/smalltownmurder\" target=\"_blank\"> instagram.com/smalltownmurder</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/MurderSmall\" target=\"_blank\"> twitter.com/MurderSmall</a></p><p> </p><p>Contact the show: crimeinsports@gmail.com</p><p><br></p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
