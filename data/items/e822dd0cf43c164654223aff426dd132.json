  "description": "Raise your hand if you don’t like losing. Full transparency: Dr. Becky’s hand is up! Guessing yours is, too. It never feels good to lose… at any age, right? Of course, it also doesn’t feel good to watch your kid have a meltdown after losing, cheat in a game, or obsess over winning. We want to raise kids who are “good sports,” but most strategies for teaching sportsmanship just turn out to be lectures. Dr. Becky has a totally different approach. In this week’s episode, she tells parents that it’s totally okay if your kid hates losing or loves winning: The goal isn’t to change how they feel about losing or winning, the goal is to help them tolerate discomfort. Her game-changing strategies on sportsmanship will help you activate curiosity, deshame competition, and understand your child in an entirely new way. Remember: Your child is good inside, even when they’re having a hard time on the outside. <p/>\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A  <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
