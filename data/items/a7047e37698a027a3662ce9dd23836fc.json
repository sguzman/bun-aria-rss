  "description": "<p>Over half of Americans don’t have a will- and this is a huge problem. You might think you don’t really need a will, but if you have any assets, a spouse, or kids you most definitely do. Wills aren’t just for old people! Most often people feel that they can always put it off until a little bit later, but the best time to go ahead and create a will is right now. It can be an unsettling topic as most folks don’t enjoy talking about their mortality, but having the peace of mind in knowing that your children and assets are in the right hands after your untimely death is worth any short term discomfort. In this episode we cover the big reasons why you need to have a will, why you likely don’t need a lawyer involved, and how to create a will for free.</p><p>And during this episode we enjoyed a Sweet Leilani by Cherry Street Brewing which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
