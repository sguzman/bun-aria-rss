  "description": "<p>Part 1 of a very special duo: Do trees have feelings? How do they talk? How old can they get? Are there any tree stories that will make me cry? Spoiler: YES. This episode aired in May 2018 and is worth a revisit, especially since Part 2 is a brand new 2020 interview with possibly the world's most enthusiastic tree expert, J. Casey Clapp. Learn about his many tree tattoos, new additions to those tattoos, how roots communicate to each other, \"crown shyness,” social media shyness and the mental health benefits of tree proximity. Also: banana facts and Casey f*cking hates apples. </p>\n<p>Be sure to hear the fresh catch-up interview in Part 2 to learn what Casey’s been up to since this originally aired.
