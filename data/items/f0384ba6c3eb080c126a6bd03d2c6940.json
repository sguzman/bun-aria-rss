  "description": "Unprecedented begins with the story of a man who, nearly a half-century ago, committed a minor act of civil disobedience when he covered up the state motto on his license plate. Meet George Maynard, who battled New Hampshire over a slogan—Live Free or Die—that he found personally repugnant. His deeply held convictions would land him in jail, cost him his job, and carry him all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nIf you love Unprecedented, you can support the show and more great podcasts from WAMU by heading to <a href=\"http://bit.ly/3408r3V\">wamu.org/donate</a>",
