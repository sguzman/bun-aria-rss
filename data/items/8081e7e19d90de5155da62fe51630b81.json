  "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.barraofmendocino.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Barra Family</a> has been farming grapes since Charlie Barra began in 1945 when he was 19. He bought his own vineyards in 1955 and married Martha Barra in the 1980s. The couple made the business run in earnest, with Martha concentrating on business and Charlie focused on farming.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.barraofmendocino.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/CharlieVintage.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"375\" height=\"148\" /></a></p> <p>In 1988, <a href=\"https://www.barraofmendocino.com/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Barras</a> began farming their land organically and haven’t stopped since. They started their own brand, Barra of Mendocino in 1995, which today includes Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Muscat Canelli. After creating <a href= \"https://www.barraofmendocino.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Barra of Mendocino</a>, they created Girasole (sunflower in Italian) Vineyards, a lighter style with no oak.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.barraofmendocino.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/bottleshots.png\" alt= \"\" width=\"336\" height=\"334\" /></a></p> <p>Charlie passed away in 2019 but Martha and the family carry on with Randy Meyer, <a href=\"https://www.barraofmendocino.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Barra's</a> Director of Winemaking and Operations playing a major role in the business. As you’ll hear, Randy is a live wire and as we talk about organics about halfway through the show,  he unabashedly shares the secrets of conventional winemaking and how it is in sharp contrast to organics (and he knows, he spent 20+ years at Korbel and other large wineries). And it’s awesome.</p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/randymartha.png\" alt= \"\" width=\"375\" height=\"217\" /></p> <p>Here are the show notes.</p> <ul> <li>Martha shares the fascinating history of <a href= \"https://www.barraofmendocino.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Barra</a> and how Charlie Barra’s dedication to Redwood Valley, to Mendocino and to farming the right way brought about these excellent wines.
