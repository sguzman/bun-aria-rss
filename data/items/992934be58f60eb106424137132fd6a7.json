Vox policy and politics intern Gabby Birenbaum discusses how a meme about trains took off among young people, and how their aspirations go beyond the internet. They want a better, more equitable transit system, and they hope Biden can deliver.\nRead Gabby's story here.\nTell Me More is a Vox Quick Hits exclusive series hosted by politics and business reporter Emily Stewart and produced by Sofi LaLonde.
