  "description": "Assumptions block our view of seeing the whole perspective and equip us with a bias that can make our relationships difficult to navigate. Not asking people personal questions or receiving feedback might be underlined unexamined bias. Whether your \"moral compass\" may get in the way, your assumptions form from cultural influence, or you even feel avoidant of those tougher conversations and just assume the other person is on the same page - this episode is for you.  This is a follow up to the defense series as Ann and Sue help us continue to get real and question what we think we just know.",
  "content:encoded": "<h1>Do you have intimacy hiccups? Let&#8217;s find out.</h1>\n<h5>Ann and Sue were on a role w disarming defenses so while this one isn&#8217;t technically in that 5 part series, let&#8217;s call it a hanger-on.</h5>\n<h5>OK, an important question: how you make a tuna sandwich. We are sure your way is awesome but&#8230;</h5>\n<h5>Unless we think about it contextually, we believe our tuna technique is simply the &#8220;right&#8221; way.  This is true relationally, so how do we recognize interpersonal assumptions that we&#8217;ve never examined when they just seem like they are true and right?  When we make assumptions we literally don&#8217;t know we are doing it because it just seems true. While having assumptions can sometimes be considered a way to keep us safe, they also can be a strong influence on our &#8220;intimacy hiccups&#8221;.</h5>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-13908 alignright\" src=\"https://therapistuncensored.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-alex-green-5699866-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"140\" height=\"211\" />Assumptions block our view of seeing the whole perspective and equip us with a bias that can make our relationships difficult to navigate. Receiving feedback could become an assumption that you&#8217;re under attack or not worthy, and can heighten our defenses. Whether your &#8220;moral compass&#8221; may get in the way, your assumptions form from cultural influence, or you even feel avoidant of those tougher conversations and just <em>assume</em> the other person is on the same page &#8211; no matter which defense resonates with you, this episode will probably hit on something relevant for you. Ann and Sue challenge you to just reconsider so you can relate in the most mindful way possible and not accidentally project your way as the &#8220;right&#8221; way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>&#8220;When you apologize&#8230; you&#8217;re not actually above or below the other person &#8211; you&#8217;re equal to the person. That&#8217;s what being truly empowered is, and that&#8217;s the assumption that we&#8217;re busting.&#8221; &#8211; Ann Kelley</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><em><strong>Time Stamps for Busting Assumptions &#8211; Episode 188</strong></em></h3>\n<p>3:30 &#8211; Navigating &#8220;intimacy hiccups&#8221;</p>\n<p>9:03 &#8211; The importance of dropping ego during feedback</p>\n<p>10:10 &#8211; Healthy relating example in parenting</p>\n<p>16:36 &#8211; Softening your front to allow uncertainty</p>\n<p>19:34 &#8211; Roles of cultural differences in assumptions</p>\n<p>25:42 &#8211; The power in knowing how & when to apologize</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong><a href=\"https://therapistuncensored.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/TUS7BustingAssumptionsFINALPREMIUMPQ.pdf\">CLICK HERE FOR BUSTING ASSUMPTIONS TRANSCRIPTS</a> <a href=\"https://therapistuncensored.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/FRANK-ANDERSON-TRANSCRIPT.docx.pdf\">&#8211;</a></strong></span> Episode 188  &#8211; <em>Lightly edited for readability</em></h3>\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a href=\"http://THERAPISTUNCENSORED.COM/JOIN\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-13816 size-medium\" src=\"https://therapistuncensored.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SHOWNOTES-BANNERS-1-300x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" /></a></span></strong></h4>\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We have pledged 50% of all corporate profits & <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.teepublic.com/stores/therapist-uncensored/crewneck-sweatshirt?utm_campaign=26430&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=Therapist%2BUncensored%2B\">merch sales</a> </span>to organizations that support mental health access to those traditionally left </span></strong><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">out of mainstream healthcare.  We can only do that with the help of our Patrons.
