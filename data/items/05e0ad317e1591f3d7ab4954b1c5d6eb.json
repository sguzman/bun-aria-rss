A coach/athlete mentorship turned friendship that profoundly and forever altered the trajectory of my life. Brilliantly guiding me&nbsp;through three <a href=\"http://ultramanlive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ultraman World Championships</a> ('08, '09 & '11) as well as <a href=\"http://www.epic5.com/\" target=\"_blank\">EPIC5</a> in 2010, my debt of gratitude for Chris' tutelage cannot be overstated. Simply put, I could have never achieved the level of athletic success I have enjoyed without his deft counsel, which has been instrumental in maximizing my potential as an athlete and bettering me as a human being.</p><p>Today I am pleased to share his wisdom with you.</p><p>This is a general conversation about Chris' evolving philosophy on training, racing and life. It's also a granular and technical masterclass on optimal training protocols, the common mistakes most athletes make, the approach and mindset required to break the glass ceiling on potential, and how to effectively balance performance goals against general health and well-being.</p><p>But at it's core, this is a conversation about multi-sport as a crucible for self-awareness and growth.</p><p>Endurance sports as metaphor for life.&nbsp;</p><br><p>We cover a lot of ground in this conversation, including:</p><br><p>* Chris’ training & racing philosophy</p><p>* aerobic vs. anaerobic training</p><p>* the benefits of calculated progression</p><p>* pros & cons of external monitors/trackers</p><p>* race plan execution</p><p>* prioritizing core strength</p><p>* strategies for optimizing recovery&nbsp;</p><p>* the facts on fad dieting and fitness nutrition</p><p>* striking the proper balance between performance & general health</p><p>* overcoming adversity through mental & physical fitness, and</p><p>* the imperative of fitness for life</p><br><p>I have an inkling this episode will leave you wanting to hear more&nbsp;about Chris' story and philosophy.
