  "description": "<p>I’ve been traveling non-stop for the past few months. From South Africa; to Savannah, Georgia; Orlando, Florida; to the United Kingdom - and now here I am, writing you from The Netherlands.</p> <p>I’ve been traveling a lot, and have had a lot of inspiration from my environment. But one of the things I’m most proud of having transformed over the last few months is my work ethic.</p> <p>I’ve always been a procrastinator. Ever since I was in school. I used to do the majority of my big projects at the last minute. I spoke to a teacher about it once and they hinted that maybe that’s just how I work best: when I have the pressure of a deadline looming.</p> <p>And I believed that for a long time.</p> <p>But over the past few months I’ve been training myself to overcome my procrastinating ways. And although I still have a long way to go, I’m proud of how far I’ve come so far. It’s something I’ve been deeply appreciating about myself these days, and so I wanted to share the shifts in mindset for me that have made all the difference, so that hopefully they can make all the difference for you too.</p>",
