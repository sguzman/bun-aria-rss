  "title": "Uncovering Abuse In The Southern Baptist Convention",
  "description": "A new report commissioned by the Southern Baptist Convention found that \"survivors and others who reported abuse were ignored, disbelieved, or discredited.\" Even some convicted molesters continued as ministers, without the SBC informing their congregations. The report's bombshell is that the SBC had compiled its own secret list of alleged abusers – and still took no action. This report was commissioned in response to a series of newspaper articles investigating sexual abuse in the Southern Baptist Church. Published in 2019, the series was a team effort by reporters from the <em>Houston Chronicle</em> and the<em> San Antonio Express-News</em>. We'll talk with one of the lead reporters, Robert Downen.<br/><br/>John Powers will review the new British medical series <em>This is Going to Hurt</em>. ",
