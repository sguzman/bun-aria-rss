  "description": "<p>Human lives are improving with the widespread use of cutting-edge digital\ntechnology like the Internet of Things (IoT). Recently, the pandemic has shown\nthe demand for more digitally advanced IoT-based devices. International Data\nCorporation (IDC) forecasts that by 2025, there will be approximately 42\nbillion of these devices in use, capable of producing around 80 ZB (zettabytes)\nof data. So data acquisition, processing, communication, and visualization are\nnecessary from a functional standpoint. Indicating sensors &amp; data converters\nare the key components for IoT-based applications. The efficiency of such\napplications is truly measured in terms of latency, power, and resolution of\ndata converters motivating designers to perform efficiently. Sensors capture\nand covert physical features from their chosen environment into detectable\nquantities. Data converter gives meaningful information and connects the real\nanalog world to the digital component of the devices. The received data is\ninterpreted and analyzed with the digital processing circuitry. Ultimately, it\nis used as information by a network of internet-connected smart devices.\nBecause IoT technologies are adaptable to nearly any technology that may\nprovide its operational activity and environmental conditions. But the\nchallenges occur with power consumption as the complete IoT framework is\nbattery operated and replacing a battery is a daunting task. So the goal of\nthis chapter is to unveil the requirements to design energy-efficient data\nconverters for IoT applications.\n</p>",
