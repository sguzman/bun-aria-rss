We talk about how people will change their positions, how to do it honorably, and how to engage in forgiveness. We talk about the March on DC, to happen on January 23rd. We discuss the masking of children, the impatience of the vaccinated, and the dropping of vaccine mandates in the private sector and in governments. We recommend three movies (see below). We discuss how to move forward without sadness, despair, or anger. And we discuss Thich Nhat Hanh, who died at the age of 95.</p><p> </p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p> </p><p>Vivo Barefoot: Shoes for healthy feet—comfortable and regenerative, enhances stability and tactile feedback.
