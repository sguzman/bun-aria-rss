  "description": "Father's Day is this Sunday, giving us a good opportunity to reflect not only the art of fatherhood but also on the struggles that come after dads leave us. First, Helen McDonald talks to Robin Young on Here and Now about grieving her father's death by training a hawk – and finding her path again after grief. Then, Keggie Carew discusses her memoir <em>Dadland</em>, which talks about her relationship with her father, his fascinating stories from his time as a spy, and his struggle with dementia. In a way, these two nostalgic interviews are an invitation to give fathers their due, especially when they're still around.  ",
