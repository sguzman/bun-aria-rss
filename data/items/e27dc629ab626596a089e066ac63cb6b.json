But it can be hard to decide what we really should be eating for optimal health, considering the diet wars (Paleo or vegan?), the non-stop exposure to sugary foods in every market isle, and clever marketing by Big Food to make us think things are good for us when they really aren’t. Instead of getting overwhelmed and defeated, I like to take a lighter look at food and focus on solutions. That’s what this week’s episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy is all about, where I’m actually the guest. My talented and funny wife Mia Lux interviews me on her show, The Conscious-ish Show, and we focus on taking the many confusing ideas about food with a grain of salt and approaching wellness with humor and action.</p><br><p>Mia merges the playful and the profound, drawing on her experience as a stand-up comedian, personal growth junkie, and recovering lawyer. For over 5 years, Mia has been an international host, comedian, and facilitator, specializing in top wellness/personal development events around the world. Last year, I was thrilled to have her help host my Feel Good Summit. It is her mission to make the world's most powerful ideas more accessible by making them truly enjoyable.
