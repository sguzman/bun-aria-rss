  "description": "<p>For decades we were taught there was no stopping cognitive and physical decline, now we know it’s possible to maintain a youthful brain and body into old age using accessible means. Given the right conditions, you can continue to thrive well into old age. In fact, the personality trait of “openness to experience” was a major predictor of good physical activity at age 75, because of a willingness to participate in athletics and try new things. That means, no matter what age you are now, keeping an open and adventurous mind and trying new types of movement in your own routine can help you stay active and healthy as you get older. In this minisode, Dr. Hyman speaks with brain health experts Dr. Marwan Sabbagh and Dr. Daniel Amen, and age management medicine expert Dr. George Shapiro about the tools available to each of us to promote optimal health at any age.</p><br><p>Dr. Sabbagh is a board-certified neurologist and considered one of the leading experts in Alzheimer’s and dementia. He is on the editorial board for the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease and BMC Neurology and is now editor in chief of Neurology and Therapy and is the author of The Alzheimer’s Answer: Reduce Your Risk and Keep Your Brain Healthy, and The Alzheimer’s Prevention Cookbook: 100 Recipes to Boost Brain Health. Dr. Sabbagh’s latest book, Fighting for My Life: How to Thrive in the Shadow of Alzheimer’s, was released last year.</p><br><p>The Washington Post called Dr. Daniel Amen the most popular psychiatrist in America and Discover Magazine listed his brain imaging research as the top neuroscience story for 2015. He is a double board-certified psychiatrist and ten-time New York Times bestselling author, with such blockbuster books as Change Your Brain, Change Your Life, Healing ADD, Memory Rescue, Change Your Brain, Change Your Grades, and The Daniel Plan, co-authored by Pastor Rick Warren and Dr. Mark Hyman. In March 2020, his book The End of Mental Illness will be published.</p><br><p>Dr. George Shapiro has been a practicing physician for 30 years, specializing in internal medicine, cardiovascular disease, and age management medicine. Dr. Shapiro was the recipient of the 10th Annual Alan P.
