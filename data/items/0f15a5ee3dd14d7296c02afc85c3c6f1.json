  "description": "<div>Today on a chilling episode of Real Ghost Stories Online that some believe could conjure up the spirit of Bea Arthur. Yes, Bea herself may suddenly appear in your home at inappropriate times, saying nothing, but giving you a disapproving stare. Such as when you are all alone, using those toys in your nightstand. When showering, when talking to your pets, when making love, when eating a ham sandwich, when making love to your pets, when showering and making love to your pets and filming it for tick tock, and other strange and unexpected moments you never thought you would share with the demonic spirit of Bea Arthur.¬†<br>\n<br>\nDon‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you.¬†<br>\n<br>\nIs a small child communicating with her now-deceased cousin through dreams?¬†<br>\n<br>\nOr is it something else trying to gain the trust of an unsuspecting little girl.¬†<br>\n<br>\nThat story and more, today, on Real Ghost Stories Online.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>If you have a real ghost story or supernatural event to report, please write into our show or call 1-855-853-4802!</strong><br>\nIf you like the show, please help keep us on the air and support the show by becoming an EPP (Extra Podcast Person).
