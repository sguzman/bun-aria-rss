  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show broadcasting from Israel, Ambassador Ron Dermer joins the program at the CBN studios in Jerusalem. Iran is producing nuclear fuel which now puts them at risk of increased sanctions from the United States and potentially from Europe and a decrease in oil sales which equates to 50 Billion a year. The idea that Iran is now advancing its nuclear ambition because of the Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Obama-era Iran Deal (JCPOA) is fallacious because they have remained aggressive in the region and continue to sponsor such conflicts. Also, the NY Times bashes the opening of an archaeological dig in East Jerusalem as a right wing effort. Then, Ze'ev Orenstein, Director of International Affairs for the City of David, explains the history of Biblical Jerusalem, the Temple Mount, and why other religions build on the holy landmarks of other faiths. In fact, over a million Jews were murdered by crucifixion upon the building of the second temple on Mount Moriah, so much so, that there was a shortage of trees. For survival, Jews hid in drain channels to avoid capture by Roman centurions. Afterward, British intelligence and military officer, Colonel Richard Kemp, discusses the war in Afghanistan, his collaboration with the CIA and Israeli intelligence and defense agencies.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
