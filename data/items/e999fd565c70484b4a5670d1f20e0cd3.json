Why doesn&#x2019;t it ever seem to appear in the bottom line?&#x2019; Their A/B test reports an uplift of 20% and yet this increase never seems to translate into increased profits. So what&#x2019;s going on?</p>\n<p>In this article I&#x2019;ll show that badly performed A/B tests can produce winning results which are more likely to be false than true. At best, this leads to the needless modification of websites; at worst, to modification which damages profits.</p>\n<p>Statisticians have known for almost a hundred years how to ensure that experimenters don&#x2019;t get misled by their experiments [1]. Using this methodology has resulted in pharmaceutical drugs that work, in bridges that stay up and in the knowledge that smoking causes cancer. I&#x2019;ll show how these methods ensure equally robust results when applied to A/B testing.</p>\n<p>To do this, I&#x2019;ll introduce three simple concepts which come as second nature to statisticians but have been forgotten by many web A/B testing specialists. The names of these concepts are &#x2018;statistical power&#x2019;, &#x2018;multiple testing&#x2019; and &#x2018;regression to the mean&#x2019;. Armed with them, you will be able to cut through the misinformation and confusion that plague this industry.</p>\n<p><strong>Read the rest here:</strong></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->\n        <div class=\"kg-card kg-file-card kg-file-card-medium\">\n            <a class=\"kg-file-card-container\" href=\"https://www.martingoodson.com/content/files/2022/02/Most-Winning-A-B-Test-Results-are-Illusory.pdf\" title=\"Download\" download>\n                <div class=\"kg-file-card-contents\">\n                    <div class=\"kg-file-card-title\">Most Winning A B Test Results are Illusory</div>\n                    \n                    <div class=\"kg-file-card-metadata\">\n                        <div class=\"kg-file-card-filename\">Most Winning A-B Test Results are Illusory.pdf</div>\n                        <div class=\"kg-file-card-filesize\">304 KB</div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"kg-file-card-icon\">\n                    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\"><defs><style>.a{fill:none;stroke:currentColor;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-width:1.5px;}</style></defs><title>download-circle</title><polyline class=\"a\" points=\"8.25 14.25 12 18 15.75 14.25\"/><line class=\"a\" x1=\"12\" y1=\"6.75\" x2=\"12\" y2=\"18\"/><circle class=\"a\" cx=\"12\" cy=\"12\" r=\"11.25\"/></svg>\n                </div>\n            </a>\n        </div>\n        "
