  "description": "We all go through times that we don’t understand. But Matthew 5:45 tells us, “Rain falls on the just and the unjust.” This means we are all going to go through night seasons and face difficult times. Joel wants to show you how to face these night seasons with hope and the right attitude. Our night seasons always lead us to the amazing things God has in store for our future. The Psalmist said in Psalm 112:4, “When darkness overtakes the righteous, light will come bursting in.” You can have hope during your darkest hours. Don’t let the night seasons convince you that you’ve seen your best days. You wouldn’t be alive if God didn’t have something amazing in front of you. Without the night seasons, we wouldn’t become everything we were created to be.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
