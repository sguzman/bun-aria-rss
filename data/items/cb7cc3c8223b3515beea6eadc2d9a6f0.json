  "description": "<p>Hormones are everywhere. They are in and around us. They give us life. They generate communication between every cell in our body. They are essential in creating order... and they can also create some pretty epic chaos if we're not careful.</p> <p>Much like a misinterpreted communication between people, abnormal hormone function can cause your body to \"fight\" within itself. Now, I don't know about you, but I subscribe to a low drama diet, and I'd much rather have a civil environment within my body.</p> <p>I don't want hormonal back-slaps happening. I want to feel good. I want to feel empowered and healthy, and understanding the role of hormones is the ultimate key to having this manifest in my life.</p> <p>So the question is: How do hormones get out of balance, and what are the things we need to know to get them back on track?</p> <p>There is no better person on the planet to answer these questions than <a href=\"http://www.saragottfriedmd.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Sara Gottfried</a>.</p> <p>This brilliant Harvard/MIT-trained physician is a superstar when it comes to helping you identify your hormonal issues and helping you create a strategy to fix them.</p> <p>What really impresses me about Dr. Gottfried is the wide range of options that she brings to the table. No cookie-cutter hormone tricks here. She knows well that we all have cookies of many different shapes and sizes :)</p> <p>As a matter of fact, the shape and size of our own cookie can change from time-to-time. One day we can be a nice gluten-free angel shaped cookie, and the next day we can be a full-on monster cookie with green frosting and extra gluten sprinkled on top.</p> <p>Helping you to navigate this hormonal terrain is what her work is all about. You're about to uncover just how powerful hormones are, and how to stack the conditions in your favor to have the health you really deserve.</p> <p>In this episode she says some absolutely profound things that will likely stay with you for the rest of your life. The amazing part about it is that she makes it simple. She doesn't over complicate things to sound like a genius (although she is), instead she breaks things down to the real world level that we all live in, and provides solutions that we can all apply to live a healthier, happier life.</p> <p>This show is loaded with powerful gems, so I recommend you take good notes, or after listening you can grab the free transcript right <a href= \"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ep72-Model-Health-Show-The-Hormone-Cure-Dr.-Sara-Gottfried.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> and highlight your favorite parts.
