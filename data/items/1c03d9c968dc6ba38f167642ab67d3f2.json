  "description": "Today's interviews are about transporting you to different places. The first is with cousins Tricia Elam Walker and Ekua Holmes who wrote a children's book, <em>Dream Street</em>, about the neighborhood where they grew up in Roxbury, Mass. They told NPR's Scott Simon  and producer Samantha Balaban that the characters in the book were inspired by people in their lives. Our next interview is with writer Clint Smith, who traveled to different locations across the country for his book on slavery, <em>How the Word is Passed</em>. He told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly he wanted to talk about places that still exist because slavery wasn't that long ago.",
