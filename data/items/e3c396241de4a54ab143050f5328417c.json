  "description": "<p>Iconic designer and <em>New York Magazine</em> cofounder, <a href=\"http://www.miltonglaser.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Milton Glaser's</a> work has been seen everywhere from the halls of global industry to, social movements to local pubs, the Museum of Modern Art and the Georges Pompidou Center. That famous I ♥ NY logo, that was him. The generation-defining, rainbow-haired Bob Dylan poster? Glaser, too. In 2004 he received the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum lifetime achievement award, he's taught for more than 40 years and, amazingly, discovered his vocation when he was 5 years old. Milton Glaser didn't know the \"how\" or the precise path. But he did know he had to create, which he keeps doing to this day. This “Best Of” conversation from our 2013 archives is a powerful prompt to nurture the creative impulse that exists in all of us.</p><p>You can find Milton Glaser at: <a href=\"https://www.miltonglaser.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/miltonglaserinc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/geneenrothttps://www.facebook.com/MiltonGlaserInc/h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
