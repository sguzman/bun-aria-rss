  "description": "Richard Johnson joins Holly, Spencer, and Jason to preview the Purple Division and the Assorted Division, because no, we weren't organized enough to avoid having a grab bag division where the teams don't wear the same colors. That one has BYU, Hawaii, Miami, Michigan State, Ohio State, and Oregon, while the Purple Division has Clemson, Kansas State, LSU, Northwestern, TCU, and Washington. If our arbitrary conference setup did not include your school, it means they're either:\na) terrible and going to be trash this year or\nb) secretly amazing but we're betting lots of money on them and don't want the secret to get out\nLearn more about your ad choices.
