  "description": "<p>Suns in 4 is back on, we pause to give the Bucks some credit because they got overshadowed by July 4th (00:02:24-00:12:55). The Match happened and it was extremely awkward (00:12:55-00:21:31). Talking Soccer (00:21:31-00:29:34). Who's back of the week with guest producers Jake and Youngstown Bob (00:29:34-00:45:29). Ja Morant joins the show to talk about his new documentary, mastering the floater, and his dad being his number 1 hater (00:45:29-01:04:44). Stu Feiner joins the show live from his basement and we get the full Stu Feiner experience as well as an explanation on the backstory of Steve Michalik (01:04:44-01:46:13). We finish the show with Hot Seat/Cool Throne and some love for Shohei Ohtani (01:46:13-02:12:12).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
