  "description": "<p>In this paper, the author solves the long term open problem of Kerzman on\nsup-norm estimate for Cauchy-Riemann equation on polydisc in $n$-dimensional\ncomplex space. The problem has been open since 1971. He also extends and solves\nthe problem on a bounded product domain $\\Omega^n$, where $\\Omega$ either is\nsimply connected with $C^{1,\\alpha}$ boundary or satisfies a uniform exterior\nball condition with piecewise $C^1$ boundary.\n</p>",
