We had a question from one of our listeners about how to keep traditional design fresh, so we brought in the designers to get their opinions, some of the work they’re doing, and some of the risks they take to just update, freshen, or even what our fresh approach is to keep things looking amazing. <br /><br />Kristina’s and Jessica’s expertise 2:18<br />Where they get their inspiration from 4:44<br />Paint colors and finishes 9:52<br />How to keep traditional design fresh 12:40<br />Some more projects we’re doing to keep it fresh 19:01<br />Wallpapers 20:43<br />Tricks for pattern on pattern 22:04<br />Tile 26:09<br />Window treatments 29:40<br />Final advice 33:40<br /><br />“You’re gonna pair something really geometric with something very flowy. So if you get this really cool Gracie paper, you probably want something more structured on the floor and maybe less opinionated because you want this Gracie paper to shine, but it’s still OK to put a pattern on the floor. It’s still OK to layer a piece of art on top of your Gracie paper, and it’s still great to start layering in mirrors and these sparkly elements that all just add to the story.” 22:11<br /><br />@kristinakellett <br />@jesstalbotdesign<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
