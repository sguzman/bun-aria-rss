These stories follow those who’ve encountered horrifying apparitions or paranormal experiences on the battlefield. Some while on duty, and others long after the fight has ended. First, I’ll recount a shocking encounter on a naval ship. Next, we’ll work at a Hawaiian motel and learn about a group of deadly ancient warriors. And finally we’ll camp out on a battlefield in Russia, and encounter some violent memories.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
