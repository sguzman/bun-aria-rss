  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, despite the CAFE standards on automobiles causing unnecessary deaths in the United States, nothing has ever been done to drop them. Despite the initial purpose for these standards which requires less steel in order to make cars lighter so they consume less fuel, they still cost more Americans their lives. CAFE standards kill Americans and the government never shut down the economy for those lives. In fact the Country has become energy independent since the formation of OPEC. Then, the Index Mundi website shows just how often people die in the U.S by State, City, by minute and even down to the second, plus it excludes deaths from the coronavirus. Later, Dr. Knut Wittkowski the former head of epidemiology bio-statistics calls in to discuss his argument that coronavirus could be killed if lockdowns were lifted and goes on to challenge the models used by doctors Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx. Afterward, Dr. Peter Pry, Executive Director of the Congressional Task Force on National and Homeland Security, joins the show to discuss our need to protect America’s electrical grid.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
