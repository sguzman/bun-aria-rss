Symantec's research says \"The malware being used, tracked as Trojan.Clipminer, has a number of similarities to another crypto-mining Trojan called KryptoCibule, suggesting it may be a copycat or evolution of that threat.\"\nSymantec determined that the malware has the ability to mine for cryptocurrency using compromised computers’ resources. They also share a way to protect against the cyber-criminal operation, as well as sharing some indicators you could be compromised.\nThe research can be found here:\nClipminer Botnet Makes Operators at Least $1.7 Million",
