Over the past 20 years, Tim has moved up from delivery driver to delivery operations support manager.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My job responsibilities have changed in many ways,” Tim said. “Three  times a year, we complete a data sampling of our delivery volume. I am now responsible for collecting the data and putting it together in analysis spreadsheets. Working on these projects made me seriously think about how data science is something I would be good at.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim’s untraditional entrance into the data science world continues to push him out of his comfort zone. On </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-drexler/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he describes himself as an “</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evolving Data Scientist</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2015, Tim began looking for a degree that would prepare him for a more technology-focused career, and he knew an online program would work best for his busy schedule. He considered Madison Area Technical College, but it offered programs with in-person class requirements that didn’t fit into his life. However, </span><strong><a href=\"https://flex.wisconsin.edu/degrees-programs/information-science-technology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">University of Wisconsin Flexible Option</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> caught his eye, especially its 100% online IST degree. It felt like an attainable next step that worked with Tim’s goals and around his work/life schedule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took Tim only 13 months to graduate from the <strong>UW Flexible Option IST program</strong> with a UW-Milwaukee bachelor’s degree—a milestone that motivated him to consider pursuing a master’s degree in data science.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UW Flexible Option was really good preparation for online learning in general,” Tim said. “I had experience within the learning system, and I knew how to motivate myself and manage my time, which are skills I continue to use in UW MSDS.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>RELATED</strong>: </span></i><a href=\"https://flex.wisconsin.edu/stories-news/uw-flexible-options-first-applicant-graduates-with-information-science-and-technology-degree/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UW Flexible Option’s First Applicant Graduates with Information Science and Technology Degree</span></i></a></p>\n<h2><b>A Program Where Passion and Learning Converge</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every course in the UW MSDS program has been a huge learning opportunity for Tim. So much so, that he finds it difficult to choose just one as his favorite. From data mining and machine learning, to data warehousing and statistical methods, the </span><strong><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/data-science-program/data-science-courses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UW MSDS curriculum</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> touches on all aspects of a data science career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The courses are definitely a lot of work,” Tim said. “But I feel like I’m getting so much out of them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim’s favorite project in the program so far has been part of the </span><strong><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/ds-740-data-mining/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MSDS 740: Data Mining & Machine Learning</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> course. Students use a dataset of their choice from </span><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaggle</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—an online source for datasets and programming/data analysis challenges—and analyze it by using methods covered in the course. The project allows students the freedom to find a dataset that piques their personal interests. Tim found a dataset from the </span><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kepler Space Telescope</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that connected to his astronomy and physics curiosities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;I put that dataset through a machine learning analysis process and then built algorithms that identified stars with potential planetary bodies orbiting them,” Tim said. “It was really interesting to be able to use real-world, scientific data to sharpen my skills.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fall 2019, Tim completed the </span><strong><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/ds-745-visualization-unstructured-data-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MSDS 745: Visualization and Unstructured Data Analysis</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> course, which directly related to his data collecting responsibilities at work. He said formatting the data is a continuous challenge, especially when it comes to communicating what the data represents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The data visualization course focused on summarizing and presenting data for non-technical people,” Tim said. “Now, I can go to my boss with a data plot or chart that illustrates how our delivery volume varies by weeks, months, and years. Then, I can work on an informative analysis that leads to meaningful action.”</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>RELATED: </i></strong><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/blog/uw-data-science-professor-motivates-students-to-look-at-data-through-personal-lens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UW Data Science Professor Motivates Students to Look at Data Through Personal Lens</span></i></a></p>\n<h2><b>Supported for Success</b></h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6656\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6656\" style=\"width: 271px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Danielle_Stertz.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-6656\" src=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Danielle_Stertz-236x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"271\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Danielle_Stertz-236x300.png 236w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Danielle_Stertz.png 353w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6656\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UW Flexible Option Academic Success Coach, Danielle Stertz</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim’s transition from earning his IST degree through UW Flexible Option to enrolling into the online UW Master of Science in Data Science program, demonstrates the high-quality and continuity of service that UW Flexible Option and UW Extended Campus coaches and advisers offer. Tim is the first to vouch for the support he has received through both programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can definitely say that I wouldn&#8217;t have made it through the UW Flexible Option without (Academic Success Coach) </span><a href=\"https://flex.wisconsin.edu/academic-success-coaches/danielle-stertz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Danielle</strong> <strong>Stertz’s</strong></span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> help,” Tim said. “She was a great advocate and was always there to answer questions. I had some tough moments in that program, and I wouldn&#8217;t have pulled through without her support.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I’ve contacted (Student Success Coach) </span><strong><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/student-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michael Paul</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the UW MSDS program, it&#8217;s the </span>same kind of situation. He&#8217;s always answering questions and getting back to students right away. It&#8217;s pretty amazing—the work that they do, especially to support people from a distance.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4603\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4603\" style=\"width: 265px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Michael-2015-color-headshot.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-4603\" src=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Michael-2015-color-headshot-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"265\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Michael-2015-color-headshot-200x300.jpg 200w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Michael-2015-color-headshot-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Michael-2015-color-headshot.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4603\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UW Data Science Student Success Coach, Michael Paul</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the support he receives, Tim also provides support to peers in his courses. A handful of students have noticed that Tim steps up to the plate within online class discussion boards and helps answer questions where and when he can.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Tim, he sees this as a way of putting himself in others’ shoes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t necessarily have expertise per say, but if there&#8217;s something I can answer right away, then I don&#8217;t mind giving it a shot,” Tim said. “I try to look at it as if I had a question that I posted. I would want it answered sooner rather than later, even if it wasn&#8217;t quite right, just to spark my thinking process. It’s a way for me to help others—and myself—to get unstuck.”</span></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2><b>Ready to Take the Next Step</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With more than half of the UW MSDS program’s courses complete, Tim is optimistic that he is becoming well prepared to move into an entry-level role as a data analyst or similar position. He views earning his master’s degree as a major step in his career and one that he is eager to see through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I&#8217;m coming from a field where I have no real technical background, and I’ve been fortunate to have completed a lot of classes with other students with database administration and other data science experience,” Tim said. “I&#8217;m learning a lot just from interacting with them and understanding all the ways I can specialize in different industries.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Tim, the flexibility, affordability, curricula, and support within the <strong>UW Flexible Option IST</strong> and <strong>UW Data Science</strong> programs made his choice to go back to school while working full time possible. Furthermore, <strong>Tim embodies the Wisconsin Idea</strong>—investing in himself to advance his skills in order to impact his future, improve processes at his work, and to connect with the greater community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked for his parting advice to prospective students, Tim is honest about his pacing throughout both programs:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It&#8217;s important to try to plan your class schedule so you don’t overload yourself too much in any one semester,” Tim said. “One thing I was worried about right away was having too much to do. So, I started the program with a smaller course load to get my feet wet. Do what makes the most sense for your strengths and life. And know that you have support along the way to keep you going.”</span></p>\n<h2><b>What’s Next?</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/data-science-program/data-science-masters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start exploring</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how the </span><b>UW Master of Science in Data Science</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> online degree program can push you to new career heights.
