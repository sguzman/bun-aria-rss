  "description": "Grahame. Angelina, Thomas and Cindy set out to introduce this book in its historical and literary context, as well as address a few of the challenges people may have on their first reading of <em>The Wind in the Willows.</em> They also discuss some other pertinent topics such as Edwardian cultural concerns, the form of this novel, the rebirth images in the opening chapters, and the echoes of this book in other literature. <p>Cindy’s 2022 Morning Time for Moms Summer Discipleship group is now open for registration. The theme this year is “Laughter and Lament.” Head over to <a href= \"https://morningtimeformoms.com/events/1758-2/\">morningtimeformoms.com</a> to find out more and sign up!</p> <p>Thomas will be teaching a webinar on Napoleon Bonaparte later this month, as well as an introductory course on Russian Literature in July 2022.

The poet can work upon us only as long as we are kept on the move.</p> <cite>C. S. Lewis, from his <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/3wfz7P3\">Preface to Paradise Lost</a></em></cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One does not argue about The Wind in the Willows. The young man gives it to the girl with whom he is in love, and, if she does not like it, asks her to return his letters. The older man tries it on his nephew, and alters his will accordingly. The book is a test of character. We can’t criticize it, because it is criticizing us. But I must give you one word of warning. When you sit down to it, don’t be so ridiculous as to suppose that you are sitting in judgement on my taste, or on the art of Kenneth Grahame. You are merely sitting in judgment on yourself. You may be worth: I don’t know, but it is you who are on trial.</p> <cite>A. A. Milne</cite></blockquote> <h3>Sonnet to the River Otter</h3> <p><em>by Samuel Taylor Coleridge</em></p> <p>Dear native brook! wild streamlet of the West!<br /> How many various-fated years have passed,<br /> What happy and what mournful hours, since last<br /> I skimmed the smooth thin stone along thy breast,<br /> Numbering its light leaps! Yet so deep impressed<br /> Sink the sweet scenes of childhood, that mine eyes<br /> I never shut amid the sunny ray,<br /> But straight with all their tints thy waters rise,<br /> Thy crossing plank, thy marge with willows grey,<br /> And bedded sand that, veined with various dyes,<br /> Gleamed through thy bright transparence! On my way,<br /> Visions of childhood! oft have ye beguiled<br /> Lone manhood’s cares, yet waking fondest sighs:<br /> Ah! that once more I were a careless child!</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/37Lu0wu\">The Golden Age</a></em> by Kenneth Grahame</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/37Lu0wu\">Dream Days</a></em> by Kenneth Grahame</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lftdXG\">The Five Children and It</a></em> by Edith Nesbit</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wftVKX\">Kim</a></em> by Rudyard Kipling</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/39qrV9y\">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a></em> by J.
