  "description": "<p>Money circulates nearly an unlimited number of times in white neighborhoods, but only once in African-American communities, according to the Selig Center for Economic Growth. On this episode, we ask: how can we keep the Black dollar circulating in Black communities for longer?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, we hear from Bernard Bronner, President and CEO of Bronner Bros., the Black, family-owned beauty company behind the annual Bronner Bros. Hair Show. After losing their best-selling hair care product because they didn’t manufacture it themselves, the Bronners recognized the importance of ownership for sustaining not only the company, but the broader Black community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then, host Carla Harris sits down with Maggie Anderson, author of “Our Black Year: One Family’s Quest to Buy Black in America’s Racially Divided Economy” to discuss her year-long journey to only buy Black. Through her lived experience and supporting data, Maggie unpacks the historical and ongoing factors&nbsp;that prevent Black dollars from circulating through the Black community. And she highlights opportunities that exist for Black entrepreneurs and consumers to reclaim the power of their dollar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Disclaimer text</em></p><p><em>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
