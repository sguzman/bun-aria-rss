  "description": "<p>You have the power to change your story. </p><p>Have you ever felt like your life story was not your own?</p><p>There's always the pressure to become someone who you aren't. Maybe you're comparing yourself to the people you see on social media. This is so easy to do. We often just post the best of ourselves on the internet, and then the illusion is that everyone is living these perfect lives.</p><p>But we know that isn't true. You can't compare your real life to a filtered version of someone else's.</p><p>Sometimes the pressure comes from within, and other times, it comes directly from the mouths of other people. It's easy to let the outside world dictate who you are supposed to be. People love to tell people what to do and who to become.</p><p>But you have your own voice in this world.

She’s also starred in movies like <em>Aquamarine</em> and <em>RV</em> (with Robin Williams) and in TV shows like <em>Hawaii 5-0</em> and <em>Lethal Weapon.</em> </p><p>In 2006, she released her second studio album, <em>The High Road,</em> which was also a great success, but her third album, <em>Mad Love,</em> was delayed due to record label disputes. She realized she didn't have power over her own voice, and this was non-negotiable. </p><p>In 2008, JoJo founded her own record label, Clover Music, and re-released her previous albums. Her fourth studio album, <em>good to know,</em> will drop in spring 2020, and in April she will kick off an international tour.</p><p>JoJo was offered her first record deal at six years old.
