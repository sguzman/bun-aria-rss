  "description": "Designer Amanda Lindroth joined us all the way from the Bahamas to chat with us about her home collection, book, her interior design work, and all of the joys (and difficulties) of decorating homes in your favorite vacation spots. We even talk about the Dunmore Hotel where she used our upholstery pieces. You'll be shocked to hear all that goes into maintaining this beautiful property!\n What You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n   Trials of towels hanging on display where they don’t need to be, soapy stoves, crazy sinks and backordered rugs.\n \n  Triumphs over a beautiful blue outdoor rug, sink and special chair finds.\n \n  Amanda would have been a designer sooner if she knew that was a viable option!\n \n  Amanda grew up living in a house with perfect mathematical scale, and that taught her about proportion right off the bat.\n \n  What it was like for Amanda to grow up in South Florida in the 1970’s, and how it influenced her design now in the Bahamas.\n \n  What people look for when decorating on an island home and resort. Warning — this will make you want to go on vacation ASAP!\n \n  Amanada was intentional with learning about color, and studied it in a serious and motivated fashion.\n \n  Why Amanda loves a pink wall, and it can be a neutral to go with everything.\n \n  Why decorating for people’s second and third homes can often be easier, but they still may get sticker shock when it comes to tax and duties of the island!\n \n  How Amanda navigates doing business in so many locations, and having a team all over the world.\n \n  Setting a tone for using timeless antiques with a modern and contemporary touch.\n \n  The places to spend money and really invest in great quality pieces, and what areas we can super glue it all together.\n \n  Amanda’s thrift shop mentality suites life in the Bahamas well, and it’s not easy to replace things so she pays attention to every single thing she brings in and how she can reuse and recycle.\n \n  Amanda’s book, Island Hopping, that takes us everywhere from Antigua to Cranberry Island.\n \n  What we can expect next from the Amanda Lindroth product line, including lighting in early 2010.",
