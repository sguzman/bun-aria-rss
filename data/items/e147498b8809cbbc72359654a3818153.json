  "description": "What a difference a couple of months make… Last time millennial investor (and my nephew) Joe Davide , he’d been making a lot of money on speculative trades. Now, he’s taking some losses as volatility swings in both directions. Joe and I discuss dealing with losses… and the most important lessons for investors of any age. [12:50] Then, Frank Holmes, CEO and chief investment officer at U.S. Global Investors, explains why young investors prefer bitcoin over gold… and why this trend could last for a very long time. Other topics we discuss include: Hive Technologies (Holmes is a chairman) and its record quarter mining cryptos… the airline industry and travel-related stocks… and why one of Holmes’ ETFs is set to benefit as the economy reopens. [35:10] Then, Daniel and I examine why analysts are raising earnings estimates, and the effect this could have on stock prices. And we debate the ethics of a new ETF that uses artificial intelligence to scan social media. [1:11:25]     Enjoyed this episode?
