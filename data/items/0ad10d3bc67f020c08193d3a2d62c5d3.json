  "description": "<div>Hi Friends!<br>\nHope you are having a wonderful day so far. Today I wanted to talk about Jose Luis Calva Zepeda and his whole… mess. There was a language barrier so, some things were a little unclear. Overall though, very sad story and I hope all of the families are at peace and have their closure. <br>\nI hope you have a wonderful day today, please be safe out there! Love and appreciate you all so so much. <br>\nxo<br>\nBailey Sarian <br>\n<br>\nP.S.
