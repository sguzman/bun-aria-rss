  "description": "This episode of Rationally Speaking features Jesse Richardson, a creative director who has been using his advertising background \"for good and not for evil,\" as he puts it -- by building skeptic sites that go viral. Jesse's most famous creation is \"Your Logical Fallacy Is,\" an illustrated poster featuring the names and descriptions of various common fallacies.
