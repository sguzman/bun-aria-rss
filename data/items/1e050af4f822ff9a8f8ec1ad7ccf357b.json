  "description": "<p><em><strong>Cruciform Church</strong></em>. Mike and Tim have a conversation on what it means for the church to be \"cruciform.\" What does and embodiment of the cross, and Jesus's life before it look like? How are we to navigate the world and our communities?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To begin that conversation, both Mike and Tim react to recent criticism they've both received via email to previous episodes. Tim apologizes for using <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxiMrvDbq3s\">Woody Guthrie</a> lyrics out of context and offers a bit of the larger conversation and Mike talks a little about 'right and wrong' theologies and whether or not one can take a firm stance on an issue or understanding of the text. How does time, reading, generational influence, intent etc. dictate or influence our reading? How should it? Can there be good readings or scholarship on differing sides of an issue?</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
