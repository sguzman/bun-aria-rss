  "description": "<p>Americans, as individuals, carry a lot of debt. But don’t panic! Not all debt is created equal, and not all debt is necessarily a bad thing. Some debt—like mortgages, vehicles, even some college degrees—can be good debt. There are also bad kinds of debt, too. But the thing about individual debt is that it’s the individual's responsibility and really only the business of the borrower and the lender. Once the government gets involved, though, things can get messy. Just how messy and in what ways? Join Antony Davies and James Harrigan as they sort through the bills in this week’s episode of Words & Numbers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.feecon.org\"><strong>Come to FEEcon 2019!</strong></a><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /> Show Notes:</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-automation-exclusive-idUSKCN1SJ0X1\"> Amazon hiring robots</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.newsweek.com/us-spent-six-trillion-wars-killed-half-million-1215588\"> $6 trillion war</a></p> <p><strong>Foolishness of the week:</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-bernie-sanders-aoc-want-181857789.html\"> Limiting credit card interest rates</a></p> <p><strong>Topic of the week: Good debt and bad debt:</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html\">Household debt</a></p> <p><strong>Join the conversation:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/130029457649243/\">Words & Numbers Backstage</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/antonydavies\">Antony Davies on Twitter</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesRHarrigan\">James R.
