  "description": "<p>For years, Congress and the Defense Department have debated how best to handle the pernicious problem of sexual assault in the military.

Anderson sat down on <em>Lawfare Live</em> with legal expert Michel Paradis, who teaches a course on the military and the law at Columbia Law School. They talked about the impetus behind these latest reforms, what the consequences might be for the military justice system and whether they promise to finally provide the protection against sexual assault that those serving in the military need and deserve.</p><p>Support <em>Lawfare</em> by <a href=\"patreon.com/lawfare\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subscribing to our Patreon</a> for an ad-free podcast feed, access to future episodes of <em>Lawfare Live</em> and more exclusive content.</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
