  "description": "<p>A few things are changing in the world of Ologies and I just wanted to take a few minutes in this bare-bones minisode to lay 'em out. Transcripts and bleeped versions will be available in the next month or two, donations are going to specific Ologist-chosen charities per episode, and finally, Ologies puts on big pants and has sponsors. Will I call you and talk to you about a bra? I just might. </p><p>Thank you for listening, for being Ologites and friends and Patrons. I love making this podcast and I'm excited to bring you another whole year.  </p><p><a href=\"http://Patreon.com/ologies\">Support the show: http://Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n",
