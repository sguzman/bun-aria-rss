  "description": "<p>Architect <strong>Ellen Cassilly</strong> worked in Paris with Christian DePortzamarc, who you’ll recall was a winner of the Pritzker Prize, and Arata Isozaki in Tokyo, before coming to North Carolina.  After bringing exciting projects together for other firms, such as the NC Museum of Art Ampitheatre, she started Ellen Cassilly Architect in 1999.  She is featured in the book, Drawing From Practice, and she co-teaches the architectural design/build studio at NC State University’s College of Design.  With her husband <strong>Frank Konhaus</strong>, they gave birth to a spectacular house/museum/gallery called Cassilhaus, a combination of their names. The house now celebrates its 10th anniversary. Cassilhaus is more than just beautifully designed and built, it’s part gallery, part artist quarters, part home!</p>",
