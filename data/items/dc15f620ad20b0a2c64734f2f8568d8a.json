  "title": "Kurtis R. Schaeffer, et al. “The Tibetan History Reader/Sources of Tibetan Tradition” (Columbia UP, 2013)",
  "description": "Two new books have recently been published that will change the way we can study and teach Tibetan studies, and Gray Tuttle and Kurtis Schaeffer were kind enough to talk with me recently about them. The Tibetan History Reader (Columbia University Press, 2013), edited by Tuttle and Schaeffer, is a chronologically-organized set of essays that collectively introduce key topics and themes in Tibetan history from prehistory all the way through the twentieth century. It collects and in some cases excerpts key works in Tibetan political, social, and cultural history from the last three decades that were originally published elsewhere, making them accessible in a new way. Sources of Tibetan Tradition (Columbia University Press, 2013), edited by Tuttle, Schaeffer, and Matthew T. Kapstein, collects translations of key works in Tibetan literature, including more than 180 selections from a wide range of genres and forms from medieval Tibetan empire through modernity. Both texts will be on my bookshelf for many years to come: they are exceptionally useful not only for research, but also for teaching a wide range of courses in East Asian history, religious history, diaspora history, and literary studies, to name just a few fields that these texts contribute to. Historians of medicine and science, take note! The Sources volume especially contains some great work that’s assignable in global science/medicine courses.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
