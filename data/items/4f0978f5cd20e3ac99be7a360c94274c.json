Officials then claimed that refugees in Calais could get free Eurostar tickets to travel to the centre - despite the fact that the Eurostar does not stop in Calais. A day later the centre was moved from Lille to a town 30 miles away. \n\nWhy has the government response been so chaotic? What are the barriers for refugees travelling to the UK?
