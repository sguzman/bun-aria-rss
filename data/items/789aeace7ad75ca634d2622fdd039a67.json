  "description": "Let’s face it, no matter how many times you’ve unsuccessfully explained to your mom what bitcoin is, you probably don’t even *really* know yourself. Throw words like distributed ledger technology, initial coin offering, and blockchain in? Yeah, no.\n\nSo this week on Morning Brew’s weekly podcast, Business Casual, we’re breaking down everything crypto—from bitcoin’s $20,000 ride to Facebook’s misadventures in “reinventing money and transforming the global economy.”\n\nBecause crypto memes are big, but crypto’s lasting impacts on the future of the worldwide financial system could be bigger.\n\nIs bitcoin really the favored currency of the black market, and if so...does that matter?\n\nCan Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook deliver on their promises of a new digital currency with the Libra project, and if so...can we trust it?\n\nIs “blockchain tech” really just overhype, and if so...why do we still fall for the headline every time?\n\n\nTo answer it all, Business Casual speaks with Arianna Simpson of Autonomous Partners, an investment fund focused on crypto and digital assets.\n\nFollow @KinseyGrant and @AriannaSimpson on Twitter",
