  "description": "<p>So, what might happen if you let go of what you thought your life would or should be, and created the space to let it show you what it truly yearns to be? Then, followed that thread. That’s been the experience of today’s guest, Parker Palmer. Graduating Berkley with a Ph.D. in ‘69, he thought he’d head into the world of academia, but instead found himself heading to DC to become an activist and community organizer for 5 years. But, something else began to call him, and he took what he thought would be a short sojourn to a Quaker learning community that turned into 11 years. Over time, a new sense of calling emerged as a writer, speaker and activist who focuses on issues in education, community, leadership, spirituality and social change.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Parker is founder and Senior Partner Emeritus of the Center for Courage & Renewal, which offers long-term retreat programs for people in the serving professions, including teachers, physicians, non-profit leaders, and clergy. Along the way, he’s written a series of bestselling books, including A Hidden Wholeness, Let Your Life Speak, The Company of Strangers, and On the Brink of Everything: Grace, Gravity and Getting Old. In this deeply-moving conversation, Parker shares this journey and many of insights, as well as how three seasons of profound depression have shaped his experience of life, and lens on people, compassion, belonging and beyond.</p><br><p>You can find Parker at: <a href=\"https://couragerenewal.org/wpccr/parker/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/couragerenewal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode:</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll also love the conversations we had with <a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/reboot-jerry-colonna/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jerry Colonna</a>, who also happens to be a close friend of Parker.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>My new book is available!</strong></p><ul><li>Order&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked: Discover Your Unique Imprint for Work that Makes You Come Alive</a> today!</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Peloton:</strong> Peloton makes it easy to take care of yourself during the stresses of the holiday season and start 2022 off on the right foot, so check them out!
