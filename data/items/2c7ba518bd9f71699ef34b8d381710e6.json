  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, these impeachment hearings show that President Trump has been right all along and the legal analysts in the modern media are fast-becoming the greatest threat to the American free press because they are providing propaganda. If we had a real media in our country these hearings would be over today because the witness, Ambassador Gordon Sondland made it clear that Trump did not want or ask for any quid pro quo. Adam Schiff’s prize witnesses in today's hearing was Sondland because he was appointed by President Trump. Not one person who actually spoke with Trump has disagreed with him and have corroborated what Trump said. When Sondland was asked if he wanted a quid pro quo Trump said \"no.\" Despite Sondland saying that there was a quid pro quo regarding pre-conditions on eliminating corruption before Zelensky could get the security aid. The Democrats added that Trump also required Zelensky to announce an investigation into Burisma in order to get aid, but Zelensky got the aid and never held any press conference or announcement that might confirm these allegations. The Democrats are holding this night-time inquiry hearings because they want to try and impeach the President before Inspector General releases his findings on the abuse of the FISA Court and the subsequent criminal referrals to Attorney General Barr. Finally, Charlie Kirk from Turning Point USA calls in to discuss today's hearings and the deep state.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
