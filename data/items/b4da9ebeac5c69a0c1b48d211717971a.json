  "description": "<p>After a great trip, compliments of Wines of British Columbia (http://www.winebc.com), I give my impression on what the Okanagan Valley is & what it has to offer. You may not like all I say, but it's an honest look at the good and bad of the region!</p> <ul> <li>First, we provide a thanks to the great people who were part of the trip: Laura Kittmer of Wines of BC, Lori Pike-Raffan and Blair Baldwin of the Okanagan Wine Festivals Society, Kyle Taylor from Sun Peaks, Arnette Stricker of @RTWGirl and Stefanie Michaels, @AdventureGirl</li> <li>We review the brief history of Okanagan wine, which began in earnest in 1990.</li> <li>We talk about the grapes available here from Merlot (most widely planted grape), and Pinot Noir to Pinot Gris (second most widely planted grape), Chardonnay, and Riesling </li> <li>Climate and geography are next -- we talk about the desert conditions of South Okanagan and why dry conditions, lakes, and latitude make such a difference to the wines here</li> <li>We get into the nuts and bolts -- the sub regions and what each grows and specializes in, discussing the importance of exposure and location and what that means for wine styles.</li> <li>Osoyoos/Black Sage and Oliver are the regions I mention as being high potential, along with the Similkameen Valley, west of Osoyoos and similar to the area.</li> </ul> <p>After a bunch of facts, I give my opinion on what the region is and where it may be going (which some of you may not like, but those are the breaks!)</p> <p>Thanks again to all who made the trip possible. I'll be coming again to see the south part of the region, but I appreciate the overview and the amazing hospitality, kindness, and meticulous planning but the Wines of British Columbia and the folks at the Okanagan Winter Wine Festival.  Go to <a href= \"http://www.winebc.com\">http://www.winebc.com</a> for more information! </p>",
