  "description": "<p>July 2002. Tahiti, French Polynesia. On July 6, 2002, Bison Dele, Serena Karlan, Miles Dabord, and Bertrand Saldo left the island of Tahiti bound for Raiatea and eventually Hawaii. They were on a catamaran named the Hakuna Matata owned by Bison. He had ended a lucrative NBA career in 1999 and set out to travel the world. He was joined in early 2002 by his girlfriend, Serena, and his brother, Miles. Bertrand was the captain of the boat. However, no one heard from the boat after July 8 and none of the passengers arrived in Raiatea. Where was the Hakuna Matata? An unexpected business transaction would hold the key to this mystery.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
