  "description": "<p>On today's episode, Jason kicks things off by sharing his thoughts on the two big head coaching hires in the NFL: Robert Saleh to the New York Jets and Urban Meyer to the Jacksonville Jaguars. On one hand, it's hard not to be excited that one of the great defensive coordinators in the NFL has chosen to come to New York and bring some much-needed stability to the franchise. On the other, the fact that Saleh has a defensive background could come back to bite him in the long run. If his new offensive coordinator is a success then chances are that guy will get a head coaching gig of his own and Saleh will be stuck with a revolving door of OC's; if the new coordinator is a failure then it's likely the team will struggle and Saleh himself might get fired. The path to success for Meyer in Jacksonville is much more straight-forward. The AFC South is a wide open division and the Jags - with Trevor Lawrence at quarterback - could find themselves in the playoff hunt inside of two years. In fact, Jason argues that if Meyer succeeds the way many expect he will then we could see him being mentioned as one of the greatest coaches in football history - college or pro. Later, The Athletic senior writer and podcast host Mike Sando swings by to discuss his how his famed QB Tiers came to be and why he never includes rookies on the list, how the presumed Urban Meyer-Trevor Lawrence pairing could work with the Jacksonville Jaguars, what's gone wrong with Sam Darnold as the quarterback for the New York Jets, why the biggest difference between Aaron Rodgers last year and this year has more to do with his teammates cleaning up their mistakes around of him than any massive jump in his own play (he's always been great), why history says it's so hard to bet against Andy Reid coming out of a bye... but this COVID year makes things unbelievably tricky as they head into this weekend's matchup with the Cleveland Browns, what we can expect in the trilogy match between Drew Brees' Saints and Tom Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which NFL head coach could be the weakest link moving forward in these playoffs given how stacked the field is, if the Baltimore Ravens defense can contain the unbelievably hot Buffalo Bills offense, why he expects Josh Allen to start next season as a Tier 2 QB even after the impressive year he's had thus far, and much more! Finally, Jason closes the show with a very special NFL Divisional Playoff round edition of the Best Bet.</p><p>Click <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/straight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre/id1523353907\">here</a> to subscribe and download all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
