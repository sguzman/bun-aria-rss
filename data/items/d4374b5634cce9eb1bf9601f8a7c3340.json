  "description": "<p class=\"style1\">\"<a href=\"https://www.tracyclarkflory.com/\">Tracy Clark-Flory</a> grew up wedged between fizzy declarations of “girl power” and the sexualized mandates of pop culture. It was “broken glass ceilings” and Girls Gone Wild infomercials. With a vague aim toward sexual empowerment, she set out to become what men wanted—or, at least, understand it.\" Tracy's book, <em>Want Me: A Sex Writer's Journey Into the Heart of Desire</em>, is intimate, courageous, vulnerable, and beautifully written.
