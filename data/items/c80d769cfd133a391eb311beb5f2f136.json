  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was on fire at the recent Alpha Underdog Empowerment event, and today he’s here to fan the flames. Tommy Mello is a leader in the home service industry, but it took him a lot of trial and error to get there. Growing up in Michigan, Tommy learned what hard work looked like from his parents. They didn’t have a lot, but were never short on love. After his parents divorce, Tommy would end up moving to Phoenix to live with his dad in 1999. To make money, Tommy started bussing tables and washing dishes. He tried his hand at landscaping, but being allergic to grass, that didn’t go very well. He ended up finding himself in the garage door business, but realized if he were to take a vacation, the business would collapse. That told Tommy it wasn’t much of a business, just a job.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tommy went through everything from losing $30,000 to the IRS, being lied to, cheated, and even having arson done to his business. He learned from each mistake though, and now has over 500 employees, and is in 20 states. His next step is to get into acquisitions, and to do $200 million in business. After reading the book, Profit First: Transform Your Business From a Cash Eating Monster to a Money Making Machine, Tommy has learned to control spending, have a budget, and institute more follow up. He’s doubled down on branding and training, and is ready to reach for the stars. He says he also learned a lot from the book, The Compound Effect, in which the author discusses how he has to change who he is in order to attract what he wants. During Covid, Tommy tried this. He built a list of things he needed to be in order to attract high performers. Since then, he’s hired someone who’s whole job is to help the employees to dream again. Whether they want to own a home, go on a dream vacation, or put their kids in private school, as an employer, Tommy holds them accountable to their dreams.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tommy hosts a podcast called The Home Service Expert that he started when he realized other people have the same questions he does. He’s taken it a step further and written a book called Home Expert Millionaire that encourages people to pursue trades. Going into a trade can make you money and be a great job. If you need more convincing, Tommy invites everyone to check out his event taking place October 12th called Vertical Track. It will give you a lot of great information and a detailed road map of how to get to where you want to be. They’ll go over the importance of branding, building reviews, learning from your mistakes, and much more.  All you need to do is implement what you learn and hold yourself accountable. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How to be a talent magnet.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Why core values are so important.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What the difference between a manager, a technician, and a visionary is.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What the four quadrants of the Eisenhower Matrix are.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m the testament to say that it’s out there.” -Tommy Mello</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>Connect With Tommy:</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/tommy-mello\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Tik Tok</span></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/officialtommymello/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thomasmello/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get podcasting help</span> <a href=\"https://podcastpowertrain.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to grow your business</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!
