  "description": "<p>Copenhagen was broke. In the 1990’s families moved out of the city when they got the chance. This is not the case today, as the city has managed to flip the demographic by creating bigger and better apartments, improving public transport, and prioritizing urban spaces – suitable even for children. Tune in to this podcast, where we explore how Copenhagen grew to be a more livable city by making the city child friendly. Featuring Copenhagen city architect, Camilla Van Deurs, and hosted by Michael Booth.</p>",
