  "description": "<p>In space, will a feather stay still? Fall down? Float away? Turns out, the answer depends on where you are! But one thing affects your feather no matter what: gravity! So Galileo is joining us all the way from the 1500s to fill us in on his theory about gravity. Then, weâ€™re heading to space, and dropping a feather in a few different places to see what happens. Listen closely for a listener-submitted mystery sound, and a moment of um that answers this question: If you pick a flower, fruit or vegetable, is it still alive or is it dead?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Flip and Mozi's Guide to How to be an Earthling. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To support the show, head to Brainson.org/donate </p>\n",
