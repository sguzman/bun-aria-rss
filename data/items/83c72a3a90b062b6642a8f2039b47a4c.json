  "description": "The quality of our health isn’t defined by one singular meal, experience, or moment but rather by a collection of our habits over the long term. What we put into our bodies and the environment we build around ourselves can have a great affect on our health over a long period of time. How can we build a healthy environment for ourselves that includes healthy foods, habits, and a safe and healthy home? On this episode of Health Theory, holistic solution-oriented specialist and environmental health expert Dr. Christian Gonzalez joins Tom Bilyeu to sit down and discuss such matters and mores as they discuss the link between our environment and illness, disease, and cancer. They discuss the impact of GMOs on our health, which foods to avoid, which foods to consume more of, how our environments affect our health, the affect of BPA on the body, ways to detox our bodies and rid ourselves of pesticides and heavy metals, how cancer forms in the body and ways to prevent it, and how our diet is directly linked to cancer growth.
