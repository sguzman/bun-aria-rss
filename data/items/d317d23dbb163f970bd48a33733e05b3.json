  "description": "<p>Audiochuck’s founder and CEO, Ashley Flowers, has founded a new non-profit called Season of Justice. Season of Justice (SOJ) is dedicated to providing funding to law enforcement agencies and families to help solve cold cases. SOJ provides grants to law enforcement for advanced DNA analysis solutions, such as forensic genealogy and next-generation sequencing. The organization also awards grants to families to support awareness campaigns, search teams and other initiatives that can assist in pushing their cold cases forward.
