  "description": "<p>In episode two, Patrick and Gillian dive into 2010's Catfish, the documentary that shed a light on the world of people posing as others on the internet. We follow Nev Schulman, his brother Ariel, and their collaborator Henry Joost as they document Nev's online friendship with anÂ 8-year-old artist named Abby, which leads to Nev falling in love with her beautiful sister Megan. But of course none of it is true: it's really Abby's mother, Angela, posing as Megan and about 15 other people. But does this make her a monster? Let's discuss it together, shall we?</p>\n",
