  "description": "<p><strong>Blush at your senpei and hold on to your anime pillow because this episode of Drunken Philosophy is all about nerdy Japanese stuff. Specifically, Dan started reading the book Otaku: Japan's Database Animals, which, in addition to being about people who like anime, is also about the postmodern approach to consumption of media. It's complex and smart sounding! Connor gets the opportunity to talk about something he actually knows a thing or two about and both of them get the opportunity to mispronounce a number of Japanese words. Enjoy!</strong></p>",
