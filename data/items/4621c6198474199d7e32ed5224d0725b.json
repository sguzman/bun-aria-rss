  "description": "<p>In the late 90s, <strong>Ann Sutherland</strong> went from long-time interior designer to first-time entrepreneur. Alongside her husband, outdoor furniture magnate David Sutherland, she developed a line of solution-dyed acrylics that combined the resilience of outdoor fabrics with the high style of to-the-trade design. Her company, Perennials, grew in leaps and bounds, and the success of the company helped usher in a new era, in which performance fabrics are used both outdoors and in. In this episode of the Business of Home podcast, Sutherland speaks with host Dennis Scully about the rocky early days, Perennials’ relationship with Restoration Hardware, and what new product represents the future of her company. <i>This episode is sponsored by High Point Market and Paintzen</i>.</p>\n",
