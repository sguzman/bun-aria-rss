  "description": "<p>The U.S. Military Academy West Point started out as a Revolutionary War-era fort that was commissioned by General George Washington. This would become the country's first military academy and still is considered the elite military academy in America. Graduates from West Point joined forces in numerous wars to achieve victory, but also fought against each other during the Civil War. Unnatural sightings and unexplained occurrences have led to numerous ghost stories. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of West Point! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Mike Rogers and features Crakow Shoes and This Month in History features President Eisenhower starting presidential helicopter travel. Our location was suggested by Marco Coronigno.</p> <p>This episode sponsored by Best Fiends!
