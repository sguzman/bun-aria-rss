  "description": "First up is another visit with Lee Strobel, author of The Case For Christ, about the Pope’s seemingly socialist leanings and how that was affecting my faith, so I turned to Lee for answers about how to handle this. Next, Peter Schweizer on to talk about his new book Red Handed: How American Elites Get Rich Helping China Win. We talked about the corruption of the Biden family and how the way we’re handling China is a grave threat to the United States. Finally, we talked with Dinesh D’Souza about his incredible new movie, 2000 Mules. This is a fascinating conversation about some amazing footage he was able to get for this movie.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
