  "description": "This week’s hottie rarely takes off his shirt but when he does, boy, does he. If you didn't know, John Cho can get it any time, any place, any how he wants it. Our fantasies starring John Cho encapsulate all manner of activities: going to the post office to get stamps, say, or making a hearty soup on a wintry November night. We bet you can have stimulating conversations with John Cho, about like, what the cancellation of Selfie meant for diversity onscreen, or the political fallout from the Paradise Papers. Let's have a debate in the marketplace of ideas (or wherever else you want), John!\nIn this episode, we'll examine his career range — from guest spots on shows like How I Met Your Mother to starring as Sulu in Star Trek — and his strong, sexy hands (seen in Harold & Kumar, New Girl, Flashforward,...we could go on). We also introduce a new segment called Thirst Sommelier, and of course, write up some steamy fanfic...\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line! Leave us a message at (765) 8-THIRST (765-884-4778) with your name and what kind of crush advice you're looking for, and maybe we'll answer your question in an upcoming Thirst Sommelier.\nFind show notes, fanfic, and more on our Tumblr. \nFollow us on Twitter for thirsty GIFs. Bim is @bimadew and Nichole is @tnwhiskeywoman.\nOur music is by Tanya Morgan. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
