  "description": "<p>On today's episode, Jason is forced to host through the tears after his beloved New York Jets put on (another) embarrassing performance on national television. How can Adam Gase still have a job this morning after what he’s done to this once-proud franchise? If the front office had any sense, Gase would be fired before you finish listening to this episode. Plus, Producer Rob joins the show to help make sense of Kyrie Irving’s decision to throw subtle shade at LeBron James regarding his late-game performance over the years. Not only is it clear that Kyrie is desperate for attention, but what he said was factually inaccurate. Later, professional sports bettor Ace Karalis swings by to discuss how certain groups are manipulating the betting lines at various sportsbooks, why he doesn't concern himself with out the public bets when he makes his own wagers, which NFL week 4 gambling lines he likes (and which he doesn't), and much more! Finally, Jason closes the pod out with a bang as he reveals the NFL Sunday edition of his Best Bet.</p><p>Click <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/straight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre/id1523353907\">here</a> to subscribe and download all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
