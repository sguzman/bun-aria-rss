  "description": "<p>As we see the amount of information and technology we have access to growing, we also gain a stronger view of universal human tendencies that are overarching in time and culture. One of those that is particularly fascinating is our desire to change consciousness, to alter our brain and our mood, whether it’s with drugs, food, or even activities like meditation and breathwork.&nbsp;</p><br><p>That’s one of the many reasons the emerging research on psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is so interesting, especially considering it was completely written-off for decades after getting a bad rap in the 60s, despite having shown therapeutic promise in the 50s. Today on <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, I’m joined by world-renowned author Michael Pollan to talk about the exciting reemergence of psychedelic therapy and the possibilities it holds for the future of healthcare. Michael Pollan is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Cooked</em>, <em>Food Rules</em>, <em>In Defense of Food</em>, <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma,</em> <em>The Botany of Desire</em>, and his latest book <em>How to Change Your Mind</em>, which is all about the new science of psychedelics.&nbsp;</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
