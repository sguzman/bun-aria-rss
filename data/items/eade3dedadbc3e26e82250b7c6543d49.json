  "description": "It isn't easy to pin down the music of the folk-rock band Blitzen Trapper, whose collective wandering spirit has taken it down detours over some strange and even psychedelic roads. Drenched in Crosby, Stills & Nash-style harmonies, Blitzen Trapper's recent 'Destroyer of the Void' meanders through country, '70s-style soft rock and the occasional acid-rock freak-out, all held in one place with the help of singer-songwriter Eric Earley. Here, Blitzen Trapper performs live at the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, R.I.",
