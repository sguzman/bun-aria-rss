We learn from Ella just what sports climbing is and what disciplines there, as well as why we should be really excited about watching it during the Olympics. We also learn everything from the training required, why the Olympics will be different to the usual sports climbing meet and everything else there is to know about the sport and just how much of a chance Ella has on making it! It's a fun interview that will teach you a lot!</p>",
