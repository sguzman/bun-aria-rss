  "description": "<p>Motherhood and loss are two things that should not go together.<br> <br> Yet most of us either have experienced or know someone who has experienced infertility, a miscarriage, infant loss, or postpartum anxiety and depression.<br> <br> Walking through loss can leave a mother, or hopeful mother-to-be, feeling like she's alone in her struggles. So over the next three weeks, we will be joined by Proverbs 31’s biblical content specialist — author Wendy Blight — and Rachael Elmore, who is a licensed, professional counselor, to address the realities no one talks about related to motherhood and loss. Our deepest desire is that, through the content in these three episodes, you leave encouraged and more rooted in what Scripture says about the specific trials you, or those you love, are walking through.</p><p>Related Resources:</p><p><br> -We know this topic is difficult to process in a short podcast episode.
