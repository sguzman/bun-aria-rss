  "description": "<p>Brian Morton, an accomplished novelist, has turned to nonfiction for the first time in his new book, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/books/review/tasha-brian-morton.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Tasha: A Son’s Memoir.”</a> On this week’s podcast, he discusses his mother’s life, the difficulties in taking care of her toward the end of her life and what led him to write a memoir.</p><p>“I started writing a few pages about her, and I relished the freedom to write directly, to write without having to invent any characters,” Morton says. “I love to write about fictional characters, that’s my favorite part of writing. But it takes me a very long time to sort of give birth to them. And here was my mother, perhaps the most colorful character I’ve ever written about, who was right there to be written about.”</p><p>Rachel Careau visits the podcast to discuss her new translation of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/books/review/cheri-the-end-of-cheri-colette.html\" target=\"_blank\">Colette’s “Chéri” and its sequel, “The End of Chéri.”</a></p><p>“One of the problems with her spare style is that the sentences can lack some of the words that usually oil a sentence,” Careau says of the task of translating the books. “So they can sound a little bit bare, sometimes a little syncopated. And the sound was very important to me, and I really let the sound guide me. But it’s difficult to make that bone-on-bone style flow.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Lauren Christensen and Joumana Khatib talk about what they’ve been reading. John Williams is the host.</p><p>Here are the books discussed in this week’s “What We’re Reading”:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/books/jenny-tinghui-zhang-four-treasures-of-the-sky.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Four Treasures of the Sky”</a> by Jenny Tinghui Zhang</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ndbooks.com/book/the-last-samurai/\" target=\"_blank\">“The Last Samurai”</a> by Helen DeWitt</p><p><a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/20/bookend/bookend.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Independent People”</a> by Halldor Laxness</p><p><i>We would love to hear your thoughts about this episode, and about the Book Review’s podcast in general.
