  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Matt Hasselbeck joins Pat and the boys again from the box truck in Greenville, North Carolina. They chat about the Kirk Cousins/Stefon Diggs drama in Minnesota and why the blame should maybe he pointed at someone else along with Kirk Cousins, and whether Matt has ever been in a similar situation. They also cover whether or not Matt thinks Jared Goff is a good quarterback, and what he says to the people that criticize him. Super Bowl MVP and elite quarterback, Joe Flacco also stops by to check in with the show. Pat and Matt also shoot the breeze, and chat about some people who Pat wasn’t initially a fan of, but eventually came around on. And because it is Friday, Pat uses this opportunity to culture Matt in some ways with a couple of picks for Friday Bangerz to help send you into the weekend. Today’s a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
