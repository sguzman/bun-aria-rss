  "description": "<p>Welcome to our first episode on Shakespeare’s play <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/2R4FWOQ\">A Winter’s Tale</a></em>. Hosts Angelina Stanford and Cindy Rollins start off with some ideas of how to approach a Shakespeare play, especially if you feel new or intimidated by Shakespeare. Angelina talks about the use of poetry and prose in these plays, as well as the different types of plays within Shakespeare’s body of work. She also discusses the history and development of drama from the time of the Greeks to the Renaissance.</p> <p>James Banks joins the podcasts again to lend his perspective to our study of Shakespeare. He recommends the Oxford, Norton and Riverside editions for reading Shakespeare. He also encourages people to see screen adaptations, audio versions and, of course, watching a live play when possible. James also talks a little about the challenge of the older English language and how to deal with that as you read and listen. Our hosts also take a look at the culture and history surrounding Shakespeare and his theatre company.</p> <h3>The Winter’s Tale Show Schedule:</h3> <ul> <li>January 28: Act I</li> <li>February 4: Act II</li> <li>February 11: Act III</li> <li>February 18: Act IV</li> <li>February 25: Act V</li> <li>March: Live Q&A for Patreon Fellows</li> </ul> <h3>In Memory of Yeats</h3> <p><em>by W.
