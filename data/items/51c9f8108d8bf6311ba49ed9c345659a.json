  "description": "<p>In this 63rd episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast, Eric Thomas Weber and Anthony Cashio interview <a href=\"https://clas-pages.uncc.edu/mark-sanders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Mark Sanders</a> on “Democracy and Public Exposure.” We ask Mark about democracy and public philosophical engagement, including some of the special projects that he runs in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p> <p>Mark specializes in American Pragmatism and social and political philosophy. He is very involved on campus; he is a Faculty Associate with the <a href=\"https://ethics.uncc.edu/\">Center for Professional and Applied Ethics</a> and the Faculty Co-Advisor of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/coptuncc/\">Philosophy Club</a>. Mark has recently written and published articles in <em>Human Affairs</em> and the <em>Review Journal for Political Philosophy</em>. The focus of his recent work has been on the intersection of deliberative democracy, pragmatic pluralism, and citizenship.
