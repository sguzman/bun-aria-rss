Sean is a long time blogger — so long they were called, “weblogs,” —<br />\nand currently is a writer and editor at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Find him online<br />\n@seanhackbarth on Twitter.</p>\n<p><span><strong>Sean’s Music Pick</strong></span>: Tears For Fears<br />\nThere are some (many?) out there who might only think of Tears For Fears as a one-<br />\nalbum wonder.<em> Songs from the Big Chair</em> was rightfully a smash, with three<br />\nmassive hits. But the boys at <em>Political Beats</em> are here to tell you why it’s well worth while<br />\nto dig into the rest of their discography. Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith made great<br />\nmusic both before and after the massive chart success. And, in fact, why one album from<br />\nthe 1990s and one from the 2000s deserve space in the conversation about the band’s<br />\nbest work. You could say there will be a lot of hurting, as we’ve been laid so low and<br />\nbroken down again in our attempts to fully appreciate Tears For Fears’s work. Come<br />\nalong, shout the lyrics if you know them, and leave yourself open to the possibility that<br />\nyou’ll fall head over heels for some previously unheard music.</p>\n",
