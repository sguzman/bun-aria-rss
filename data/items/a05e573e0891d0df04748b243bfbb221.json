  "description": "<p>What makes you the same as you? Specifically the you from five minutes ago that decided it was time to listen to this podcast? Are those two people the same person? This week on Drunken Philosophy, Connor and Dan get a little sloppy while discussing John Locke's theories on personal identity. Hear Dan try to say \"consistency of consciousness\" without slurring too much, and hear Connor reminisce about the hats he owned in kindergarten. Also discussed: M. Night Shyamalan movies, the existence of souls, and many Garys.</p>",
