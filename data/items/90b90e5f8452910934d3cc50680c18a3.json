  "description": "Before jumping on the stage of Bourbon & Beyond Festival, Greensky Bluegrass members Anders Beck and Paul Hoffman join Fred for some backstage sipping. They drink Kentucky Owl, Wilderness Trail, Richland Rum Elijah Craig and more. Fred and the fellas discuss Artificial Tongues, drinking on the road and much more.\n\nSPONSORS\n\nColorado Whiskey: https://distillery291.com/ \n\nMichter's: https://michters.com/ \n\nB-Line (Northern Kentucky Bourbon Trail): https://findyoursippingpoint.com/ \n\nSan Francisco World Spirits Competition: http://www.sfspiritscomp.com/\n\nABOUT Greensky Bluegrass (From their website)\n\nListen to their latest release.\n\nFollow Greensky Bluegrass\n\nCatch them at: https://www.campgreensky.com/ After 18 years together, up to 175 shows per year, nearly 1,000 different setlists, six studio albums, and a litany of live releases, Greensky Bluegrass embodies more than just music for members Anders Beck [dobro], Michael Arlen Bont [banjo], Dave Bruzza [guitar], Mike Devol [upright bass], and Paul Hoffman [Mandolin]. Truthfully, it embodies an ironclad creative bond, familial brotherhood, and a lifelong commitment to fans. At this point, it goes without saying the band means everything (and more) to the Kalamazoo, MI bluegrass mavericks. So, with a wink and a smile, they offer up a cleverly titled seventh full-length, All For Money, in 2019.\n\nABOUT Fred Minnick\n\nAmerican whiskey critic Fred Minnick has appeared on Bravo's Top Chef, Discovery's Moonshiners, CNBC, CBS This Morning, NPR, Fox News and many more, just to discuss the state of whiskey. He's the host of the Amazon Prime show Bourbon Up and Spirits Network's Frontier Filmmakers. In addition, the Wall Street Journal-bestselling author wrote seven books, including Whiskey Women, Rum Curious, Bourbon Curious, MEAD, and Bourbon: The Rise, Fall & Rebirth of An American Whiskey. He has written for the New York Times, Scientific American, Parade Magazine, Forbes Magazine and is the editor-in-chief of Bourbon+ Magazine. Minnick is a co-founder to Bourbon & Beyond and curates both B&B and the Hometown Rising Festivals, as well as being 1/3 of the popular Bourbon Pursuit podcast. But most importantly, he wears ascots.\n\nFOLLOW FRED\n\nNew Podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fred-minnick-show-podcast/id1490483021 \n\nFree Drinks Newsletter: https://www.fredminnick.com \n\nBourbon Plus: https://BourbonPlus.com\n\nSpirits Network: https://explore.spiritsnetwork.com/fredvip/ \n\nBourbon Pursuit: https://BourbonPursuit.com \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fredminnick/ \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/fred.minnick/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FredMinnick \n\nBooks: https://www.amazon.com/Fred-Minnick/e/B002N1IVXW?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1&qid=1581362119&sr=8-1\n\n \n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
