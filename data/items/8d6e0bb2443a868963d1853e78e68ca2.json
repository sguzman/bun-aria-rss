  "description": "<div>Today on an unforgettable episode of Real Ghost Stories Online that will make you crave the sweet goodness of a canned meat product. I mean, what is better than a delicious Vienna sausage and a good ghost story. I like to slurp down sweet slimy sausage, after sweet slimy sausage while listening to this podcast. That, or get a big spoonful of fresh spam and let it slide down my gullet. Damn, that’s good! <br>\n<br>\nWhat happens when an innocent child starts to realize that their childhood isn’t exactly like that of the other boys and girls in his classroom. But rather, littered with bizarre experiences that he can’t talk about with his friends, for fear of being ostracized and teased. <br>\n<br>\nExperiences that are all too real and won’t seem to ever go away. <br>\n<br>\nThat story, and so much more, today, On Real Ghost Stories Online.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>If you have a true ghost story, share it with the top horror podcast around!<br>\n</strong><br>\n<strong>If you have a real ghost story or supernatural event to report, please write into our show or call 1-855-853-4802!</strong><br>\nIf you like the show, please help keep us on the air and support the show by becoming an EPP (Extra Podcast Person).
