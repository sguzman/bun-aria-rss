  "description": "<p>The world is full of color, but how do our eyes see it? In this episode we’ll explain how color vision works, complete with a journey to a jazz club in the back of your eye. We’ll also look at the cultural meanings of the color red, we’ll find out about a new type of blue, and we’ll find out why stoplights use green to mean go. Our Moment of Um tackles the question, “why are bees black and yellow?”</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by KiwiCo (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://kiwico.com/brainson&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw2wtPp5d7RuKWXXafd11Wft\" class=\"default\">kiwico.com/brainson</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://nurturelife.com&sa=D&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw0DtkHuOEmuylBnFrhASawi\" class=\"default\">Nurture Life</a> (use code: BRAINS at checkout).</p>\n",
