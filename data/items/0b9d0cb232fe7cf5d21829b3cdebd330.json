  "description": "Our audiobook this week is THE NEIGHBOR by Brighton Walsh! \n\nNarrated by Mackenzie Cartwright\n\nOn a day when nothing seems to be going my way, I just want to binge my favorite show and inhale a couple—okay, a dozen—cupcakes. But the black cloud that’s followed me all day comes back when I realize I’m out of sugar. I resign myself to the fact that I’ll have to—*shudder*—ask a neighbor for some neighborly help and set out to harass my fellow apartment-dwellers, all in the name of chocolate.\n\nWhen a dripping wet and freshly showered hottie I’ve definitely never seen before answers my impatient knock, I’m rendered speechless. Okay, not speechless, because that’d be far too easy for me. Instead I humiliate myself in typical Lucy fashion, then bail, certain if I try hard enough I can go the rest of my life without running into Hot Neighbor Guy again.\n\nTESSA EVER AFTER (FREE!): https://amzn.to/2Tather\n\nBrighton Walsh GIVEAWAY: http://readmeromance.com\n\nLove Her or Lose Her by Tessa Bailey: https://amzn.to/35BysH7\n\nBaiting Him by Aurora Rose Reynolds: https://amzn.to/2tITO86\n\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\n\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\n\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\n\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
