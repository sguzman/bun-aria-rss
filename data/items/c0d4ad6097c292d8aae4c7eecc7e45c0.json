  "description": "<p>From the <em>Lawfare</em> Archive, February 19, 2020: Jessica Stern, who served on the National Security Council during the Clinton administration, has a remarkable skill: she interviews really bad people, and she writes about them in really interesting ways. She spent quite a bit of time interviewing Bosnian-Serb war criminal Radovan Karadzic, who is serving a life sentence at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The Hague for genocide in connection with the Bosnian conflict in the 1990s. Their conversations led to the publication of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/My-War-Criminal-Encounters-Architect-ebook/dp/B07R6MPYMB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">book</a>, \"My War Criminal: Personal Encounters with an Architect of Genocide,\" which triggered a remarkable outpouring of rage at Jessica Stern.
