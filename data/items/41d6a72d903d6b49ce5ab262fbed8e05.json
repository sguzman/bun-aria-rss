  "description": "Every day in Trumpassic Era seems like a million years in geological time.  Sex scandals, echoes of old pee tapes, pending missile strikes in search of a strategy, waves of national security experts leaving the White House, the president calling the former FBI director a “lying slimebag”, the FBI director launching a book that is the most stunning attack by a top former official on a sitting president in memory…and the president, according to his staff, just sitting around fuming, eating and watching TV.  It’s a mad whirl and we’ve got it all right up to, but not including, the Khloe-Tristan cheating scandal.
