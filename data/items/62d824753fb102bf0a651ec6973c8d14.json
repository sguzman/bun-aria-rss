  "description": "<p>This 4th of July, Hobby Lobby took out a controversial full page newspaper ad featuring quotes, or mis-quotes, from America’s founders about being a Christian nation. An editorial from Robert P. Jones says July 4th is a time to decide what we believe more—the Declaration of Independence that says all people are created equal, or the European doctrine of discovery which enshrined white supremacy? And David French asks what it really means to be a patriot and love our country well as Christians.<br /> Then, Karen Swallow Prior is back on the show to talk about a recent address she gave to the Evangelical Press Association about Christian publishing’s addiction to celebrity and lack of integrity. But who’s really to blame—Christian book publishers, or Christian book consumers? All of that, plus is Spiderman & the Pope the best MCU team up yet?</p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://news.yahoo.com/pope-francis-meets-spider-man-130000577.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://news.yahoo.com/pope-francis-meets-spider-man-130000577.html\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://news.yahoo.com/pope-francis-meets-spider-man-130000577.html</a></p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.hobbylobby.com/about-us/holiday-messages?modal=one+nation+under+god\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.hobbylobby.com/about-us/holiday-messages?modal=one+nation+under+god\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.hobbylobby.com/about-us/holiday-messages?modal=one+nation+under+god</a></p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.scarymommy.com/stop-shopping-hobby-lobby-now/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.scarymommy.com/stop-shopping-hobby-lobby-now/\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">https://www.scarymommy.com/stop-shopping-hobby-lobby-now/</a></p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://religionnews.com/2021/07/02/lets-celebrate-this-fourth-of-july-without-the-myth-of-white-christian-innocence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://religionnews.com/2021/07/02/lets-celebrate-this-fourth-of-july-without-the-myth-of-white-christian-innocence/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://religionnews.com/2021/07/02/lets-celebrate-this-fourth-of-july-without-the-myth-of-white-christian-innocence/</a></p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.relevantmagazine.com/faith/church/the-american-conservative-does-the-unthinkable-and-defends-the-unmarked-indigenous-graves-as-good-actually/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.relevantmagazine.com/faith/church/the-american-conservative-does-the-unthinkable-and-defends-the-unmarked-indigenous-graves-as-good-actually/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.relevantmagazine.com/faith/church/the-american-conservative-does-the-unthinkable-and-defends-the-unmarked-indigenous-graves-as-good-actually/</a></p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/how-do-christian-patriots-love-their\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/how-do-christian-patriots-love-their\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/how-do-christian-patriots-love-their</a></p> <p>Patreon Bonus: <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.patreon.com/posts/53681162\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.patreon.com/posts/53681162\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.patreon.com/posts/53681162</a></p>",
