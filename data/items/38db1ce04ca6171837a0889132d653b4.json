  "title": "Akon Owes Millions But Plans to Build $6BN \"Phallic\" City in Senegal?",
  "description": "<p>Akon was once known for being one of the biggest pop stars and producers in the world, and he may have even been the one to discover Lady Gaga.  After a good run in the music industry, Akon shifted his sights over to business, including plans to build a $6BN city in Senegal called “Akon City”, meant to be a real life “Wakanda” - an oasis for the Senegalese (except the buildings are pretty phallic-shaped if you ask us). But after years of planning, no city has been built and many question his intentions. Now, his former business partner and best friend is suing him for millions and calling “Akon City” a Ponzi scheme. Oh and the IRS is after him too.
