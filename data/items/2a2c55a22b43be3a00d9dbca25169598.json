  "title": "David Swift, \"The Identity Myth: Why We Need to Embrace Our Differences to Beat Inequality\" (Constable & Robinson, 2022)",
  "description": "In conversations about polarised political issues, phrases like ‘it’s not about race, it’s about class’ have become the perfect way to induce a stalemate. It seems as though the traditional, materialist critique of inequality has been supplanted by a fast-evolving set of reflections on group identity. Mainstream politics makes fast and loose assumptions about the relationship between class and identity, and economic conditions and culture. These assumptions are fodder for the culture wars.\nIn The Identity Myth: Why We Need to Embrace Our Differences to Beat Inequality (Constable & Robinson, 2022), David Swift covers the four different kinds of identity most susceptible to rhetorical and cultural manipulation – class, race, sex, and age. He considers how the boundaries of identities are policed and how diverse versions of the same identity can be deployed to different ends. Ultimately, it is not that identities are simply more ‘complex’ than they appear. Rather, there are commonalities more important to the creation of solidarity.\nDavid Swift speaks to Pierre d'Alancaisez about the crisis of class and the deceptive allure of identity politics. We talk about the divisive nature of the contested claims of identity and about strategies for regaining control of the narrative. In a powerful call to arms, Swift argues that we must unite against these identity myths and embrace our differences to beat inequality.\nDavid Swift is a historian and writer who specialises in the history and contemporary politics of the British Left. He has written on the state of the Left for The Times, Fabian Review, Progress Online, Jewish Chronicle, and The Critic. He is the author of A Left for Itself, 2019.\n\nThe Emily Thornberry white van tweet story,\n\n\nGordon Brown's 'bigotgate',\n\n\nKeir Starmer and 'beergate',\n\nTomiwa Owolade's essay on Anglican social conservatism in London, 'rooted' in David's work,\n\nRachel Dolezal is now an artist,\n\nSan Francisco school board recall,\n\n\nWhite narcissism at a BLM protest.\n\n\n﻿Pierre d’Alancaisez is a contemporary art curator, cultural strategist, researcher.
