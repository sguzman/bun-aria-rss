  "description": "After a brief hiatus we start the news roundup with the capsizing of a ferry in South Korea.  While back in Eastern Europe the conflict has now shifted to Eastern Ukraine.  Following the third anniversary of Fukushima, the people of Taiwan have rallied against the use and development of nuclear energy in their country. The Boko Haram militants have struck again in Nigeria as the government struggles to protect schools in the Northeast. Our latest film recommendation is called The Unknown Known and you might not smile but there is something amazing about this documentary.",
