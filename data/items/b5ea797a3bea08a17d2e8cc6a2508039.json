  "description": "Teri A. McMurtry-Chubb is the author of Race Unequals: Overseer Contracts, White Masculinities, and the Formation of Managerial Identity in the Plantation Economy, published by Lexington Books in 2021. Race Unequals takes a look at the complex relationship between enslavers and overseers in order to explore the ways in which the “white South” was not a monolithic identity, but one in which white male identity was constantly created, contested, and compromised over. By examining contracts, public law, and plantation management, McMurtry-Chubb shows how the plantation not only created one of the nation’s first class of managerial people, but how this system stymied upward mobility, created and controlled social boundaries, and furthered white supremacy.\nTeri A. McMurtry-Chubb is a Professor of Law and Associate Dean for Research and Faculty Development at the University of Illinois Chicago Law School.\nDerek Litvak is a PhD candidate at the University of Maryland—College Park. His dissertation, \"The Specter of Black Citizens: Race, Slavery, and Citizenship in the Early United States,\" examines how citizenship was used to both bolster the institution of slavery and exclude Black Americans from the body politic.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
