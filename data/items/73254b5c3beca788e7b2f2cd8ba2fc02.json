  "description": "Lee B. Wilson is the author of Bonds of Empire: The English Origins of Slave Law in South Carolina and British Plantation America, 1660-1783, published by Cambridge University Press in 2021. Bonds of Empire explores how English law gave the institution of slavery its ability to thieve and grow. By looking at how law was practiced, instead of solely focusing on how it was written, Wilson follows the development of the institution of slavery in South Carolina and the English law of slavery in the colony. The day to day legal life of slavery in the colon shows just how much English law was crucial, and not opposed, to the enslavement of people.\nDr. Wilson is an Associate Professor at Clemson University.\nDerek Litvak is a PhD candidate at the University of Maryland—College Park. His dissertation, \"The Specter of Black Citizens: Race, Slavery, and Citizenship in the Early United States,\" examines how citizenship was used to both bolster the institution of slavery and exclude Black Americans from the body politic.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
