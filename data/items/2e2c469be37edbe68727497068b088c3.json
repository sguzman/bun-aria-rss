We see him as a knowledgable crypto outsider, which is a rare trait we've seen throughout the posts on his blog, Noahpinion.</p> <p>In today's episode, we cover geopolitics in broad strokes—Noah thinks we're already at war in the form of an economic showdown between the New Allies and New Axis.</p> <p>We also turn to crypto, where Noah gives his bull case while also addressing some misconceptions he sees in the crypto community.</p> <p>The sum of all of this is an episode title we thought we'd never see on Bankless—The Future is Fiat.</p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO
