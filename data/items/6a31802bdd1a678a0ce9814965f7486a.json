In these three months, I’ve traveled to India, Colin has taken 2 cross country road trips and we’ve lived out a dream of ours by working with Samsung to unveil their latest phone on stage with them at their unpacked event in San Francisco.\nOn this episode we truly pull back the curtain and take you through the last three months, which have not been the easiest months for us, they’ve actually been both some of the most challenging as well as most surreal and exciting months in our career.
