Jimi Hendrix’s career lasted only four years while alive (with decades of posthumous releases to follow), but he remains one of the most influential guitarists in history. He pioneered new uses of the guitar, experimenting with feedback, distortion, and effects on a higher level. The songs weren’t so bad either, of course, kicking off with the single releases of “Hey Joe” and “Purple Haze” and continuing through </span><i><span>Are You Experienced?</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Electric Ladyland</span></i><span>. Hear Jeff and Jane fight over the relative merit of Noel Redding’s songwriting contributions to the band! And as for those posthumous releases? We spend specific time discussing </span><i><span>First Rays of the Rising Sun</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Blues</span></i><b>, </b><span>along with various live releases. So much has been said about the music of Jimi Hendrix, but we find new angles for you to consider on this edition of </span><i><span>Political Beats</span></i><span>.</span></p>\n",
