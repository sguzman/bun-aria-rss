  "description": "Contributor(s): Dr Amal-lee Amin, Carlota Cenalmor, Professor Lord Stern, Josué Tanaka | The challenge of scaling up sustainable investments to support a strong and green recovery and the much more difficult environment for mobilising finance in the post-pandemic world has highlighted the importance of strengthening the role of national and international development banks. This panel event examines the role of the multilateral development banks (MDBs) in achieving this mobilisation from the global north to the global south including scaling up and aligning action with climate responsible development, and sustaining that action.\nEven though the need to mobilise greater sums of private finance to meet climate goals is well accepted, this will only increase in the post-COVID-19 world. The three agendas of climate finance, MDBs and mobilisation are the key channels where the global north currently takes actions consistent with its “responsibilities” (including as set out in the Paris agreement). Yet, none of these channels directly set out north-south equity arguments or justifications for global north responsibility around recovery and transformation in the global south.\nMeet our speakers and chair\nAmal-lee Amin (@AmaleeAmin) is Director of Climate Strategy at CDC Group and Senior Advisor to the UK Government on COP26. Before this she was Chief of the Climate Change Division at the Inter-American Development Bank.
