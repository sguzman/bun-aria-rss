  "description": "Jordan Stephens was formerly one-half of the band Rizzle Kicks, formed with his childhood friend while they were both at school. He is now an actor, a solo musician, a writer and - as if that weren't enough - a gifted artist too. He's also a super smart, funny and perceptive human. It's always a joy to talk to him and today's episode was no exception - we cover male vulnerability, sobriety, competitiveness, the challenges of fame (and dating a celebrity superstar but keeping it private), the dangers of reality TV and how the phrase 'toxic masculinity' has outlived its usefulness. Plus, his failure...to get naked. Not one we've ever had before on the pod, but well worth a listen!<br /><br />--<br /><br />Jordan's children’s book, The Missing Piece, is out now and available to buy here: <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-missing-piece/jordan-stephens/beth-suzanna/9781526618139\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-missing-piece/jordan-stephens/beth-suzanna/9781526618139</a><br /><br />--<br /><br />How To Fail With Elizabeth Day is hosted and produced by Elizabeth Day.
