  "description": "There are 3 things that are for certain in this life: death, taxes, and being force-fed information about MGK and Megan Fox.\nWe’re happy to have you back Sloots. We have A LOT to fill you in on. In case you haven’t heard, Sofia is now TikTok’s newest star! Shout out to the NY Post for making this possible. This week Sofia dissects her latest media debacle and how this podcast will soon come to an end due to her newfound fame. Once she snapped back into reality, Sofia then covers the most blood-sucking news of the week…Megan Fox and MGK’s engagement. At this point, we (unfortunately) know more about their relationship than we do ourselves. After devising her plan to sneak into their Twilight-themed wedding, Sofia moves on to the most important period of the week: SLOOT UNIVERSITY. This week, Professor Sloot embraces her motherly role and brings us in with a warm embrace. Whether you’re just entering or exiting your twenties, Sofia’s Declassified Survival Guide will help you get through them (or at the very least let you know you’re not the ONLY shit show around here). From student loans to job hunting, and outgrowing friends - Sofia has it ALL covered. Pencils and paper out Sloots, we know you needed this one. \n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \nOK Cupid: Download OK Cupid from the App Store or Google Play today!\nNative Deodorant: http://www.nativedeo.com/SOFIA or use promo code SOFIA at checkout and get 20% off your first order\nZola: http://www.Zola.com and use promo code SAVE50 for 50-percent off your save the dates\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
