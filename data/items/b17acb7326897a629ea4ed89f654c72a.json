  "description": "<p>No matter how dedicated you are to self-improvement, you’re bound to have a bad day every once in a while. We’re human, and that means sometimes we’re unmotivated, uninspired, or just plain cranky. It’s okay to have a bad moment or a hard day. But what truly matters is your ability to pivot and get back to your baseline of happiness and health.</p> <p>The reason I felt so compelled to share this message is because I’ve recently been in that dark place. No matter what strategies or tools you use to get out of a funk, there’s no denying that listening to inspirational stories can help you channel your motivation. This episode is a compilation of motivating and thought-provoking interviews that you can turn to when you need a mood boost.</p> <p>You’re going to hear eight incredible stories about improving your self-image, finding the lessons throughout hard times, and harnessing your power to create change. I hope you’ll listen intently, find the pieces that resonate with you and revisit them the next time you need to fill your cup.</p> <p>In this episode you’ll discover:</p> <ul> <li>My personal inspiration for putting together this compilation.</li> <li>The two factorsthat go into building your subconscious mind.</li> <li>How to proactively change your self-image.</li> <li>Where self-confidence and self-worth come from.</li> <li>How engaging in simple activities can contribute to your confidence.</li> <li>Why your identity is like a thermostat.</li> <li>How reading can help you change your identity.</li> <li>What an expectation hangoveris, and how to overcome it.</li> <li>How to use your difficulties as an opportunity to grow and improve.</li> <li>Why being attached to old stories about yourself can stunt your growth.</li> <li>What it means to truly take responsibility for your life.</li> <li>How to find the balance of loving yourself, while also striving to improve.</li> <li>Why you should consider muting notifications on your devices.</li> <li>How to gauge whether or not a decision is right for you.</li> <li>The importance of writing down your goals.</li> <li>How to make positive decisions for your future self.</li> </ul> <p>Items mentioned in this episode include:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/foursigmatic\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Foursigmatic.com/model </a>⇐ Get 15% off your daily health elixirs and coffee!</li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/organifi\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Organifi.com/Model </a>⇐ Use the coupon code MODEL for 20% off!</li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/the-art-of-living/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Instantly Shift Your Mindset with Bob Proctor – Episode 137</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/ed-mylett/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Financially Fit & Maxout with Ed Mylett – Episode 282</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/christine-hassler/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eliminate Self Sabotage with Christine Hassler – Episode 273</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/average-to-phenomenal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Go from Average to Phenomenal with Eric Thomas – Episode 263</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/lita-lewis/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Redefining What It Means to be Fit & Healthy with Lita Lewis – Episode 288</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/bedros-keuilian/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Truth About Discipline with Bedros Keuilian – Episode 265</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.com/man-up-bedros-keuilian/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Deal with Failure with Bedros Keuilian – Episode 309</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/andrea-navedo/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gaining Strength from Adversity with Andrea Navedo – Episode 290</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/jemal-king/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Take Control of Your Financial Health with Jemal King – Episode 325</a></li> </ul> <p>* <a href= \"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/themodelhealthshow/Episode+344.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download The Transcript</a></p> <p>Thank you so much for checking out this episode of The Model Health Show.
