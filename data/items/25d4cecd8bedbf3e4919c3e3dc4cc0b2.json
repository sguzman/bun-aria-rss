  "description": "In today's podcast we learn that FireEye is warning of patient reconnaissance on the part of the (probably) Iranian APT34. The Electronic Ghosts of the Caliphate have so far failed to say \"boo,\" except maybe in South Jersey. Flaws discovered in mobile banking apps. Bike-sharing service leaked data. Bitcoin's bubble. Microsoft patches its Malware Protection Engine. Chris Poulin from BAH on closing the gap between IT and OT people in ICS. Adam Segal from the Council on Foreign Relations on the rollout of their cyber operations tracker. And biometrics have come to the beagles: your pet door can now recognize Rover or Boots, and let them on in. Their raccoon pals stay outside.",
