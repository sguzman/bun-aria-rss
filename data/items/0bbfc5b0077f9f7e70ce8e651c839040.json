  "description": "<p>Estimating Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) of arbitrary source points\nis essential in immersive binaural audio rendering. Computing each individual's\nHRTFs is challenging, as traditional approaches require expensive time and\ncomputational resources, while modern data-driven approaches are data-hungry.\nEspecially for the data-driven approaches, existing HRTF datasets differ in\nspatial sampling distributions of source positions, posing a major problem when\ngeneralizing the method across multiple datasets. To alleviate this, we propose\na deep learning method based on a novel conditioning architecture. The proposed\nmethod can predict an HRTF of any position by interpolating the HRTFs of known\ndistributions. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture\nimproves the model's generalizability across datasets with various coordinate\nsystems. Additional demonstrations show that the model robustly reconstructs\nthe target HRTFs from the spatially downsampled HRTFs in both quantitative and\nperceptual measures.\n</p>",
