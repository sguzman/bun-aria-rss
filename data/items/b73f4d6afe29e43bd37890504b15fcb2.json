  "description": "<div>This week, the gals discuss a few “Lucky Bastards” (i.e. Creeps who got away with murder for wayyy too long), including Robert \"Killed 'Em All\" Durst, Willie Pickton of Piggy Palace infamy, and, of course, Herman Mudgett (aka Leonardo DiCaprio) (aka HH Holmes). By popular demand, for this episode we’ve selected a bottle of 19 Crimes Red Blend out of Australia. We hear this wine pairs beautifully with Long Pig (aka “The Other Other White Meat”). Um, maybe don’t Google that.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
