  "description": "<p>This week's chat was inspired by a book called Alchemy by Rory Sutherland. The premise of the book is that the best way to solve any problem is to abandon logic and cast aside rationality. We discus the different ways irrational thinking could be applied to life and to art. For example, can we do away with common ways of operating and make our own rules? (Would people prefer prices that are based not on size of painting but on how much the artist like a piece or how much time they spent on it?) This book has prompted Alice to rethink the way her paintings might be available and it has spurred Louise to face up to some pricing blocks. Perhaps our conversation will spark some similar realisations for you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Alchemy by Rory Sutherland <a href=\"\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alchemy-Surprising-Power-Ideas-Sense/dp/0753556529/</a></p>\n<p>Louise's Find Your Joy taster course <a href=\"\">https://www.louisefletchercourses.com/wait-list-fyj-2022</a></p>\n<p>Alice's Time To Shine 14 day program <a href=\"\">https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/shine</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
