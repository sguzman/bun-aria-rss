  "description": "<p>June is the 150th anniversary of the birth of <strong>Frank Lloyd Wright</strong>, the most famous architect in the world, still showing off 58 years after his death. Few architects have come close to Wright's arrogance, his brilliance, and his incredible output that's still with us plus buildings he designed that never got built.</p> <p>Today we talk with <strong>Eric Lloyd Wright</strong>, grandson of Frank, and son of <strong>Frank Lloyd Wright, Jr.,</strong> aka Lloyd Wright. Although he aspired for another career, Eric eventually returned to his roots in architecture. Following his apprenticeship with his grandfather 1948-1956 he moved back to Los Angeles to work with his father until 1978. He has since been in private practice, creating his own projects plus helping clients of his grandfather and father restore and expand their buildings.</p> <p>Eric is the Obiwan Kenobi of architecture, involved in seven decades of buildings you know and love, such as the Guggenheim Museum in New York and Monona Terrace in Madison, Wisconsin; the Wayfarer’s Chapel in Palos Verdes, California; plus restoring older Wright projects such as Auldbrass in South Carolina; the Storer and Ennis Residences in LA, and his own house – still under construction after 30 years in Malibu.</p> <p> </p>",
