  "description": "<p>I would sit out on the back deck at night and would hear wood knocks and an occasional whoop but had never seen one. Sometimes I would take a baseball bat and hit a tree or even the railing of the deck and sometimes would get an answer. Any way, one day, this was about 20 years ago, I cut up over the ridge and was on the blacktop. I was almost to the back entrance of the park when this huge creature jumped the fence along the park, it was on my right, and stood in the road. I had to slam on my brakes or I would have hit it. When I stopped, I could not have been more than 15 to 20 feet away from it, if that. This thing was huge. I am guessing it was about 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall and 3 feet across the shoulders. It had dark brown hair all over its body except on its face. Broad nose, wide set eyes, a protruding forehead and its arms almost appeared to be normal from the shoulders to the elbows and from the elbow to the hands, the arms were very long. It just stood there and we made eye contact for a full minute. Maybe a little longer. I had the window down on my truck and there was a slight breeze and I caught a whiff of a strong odor. It was almost like a bad body odor. https://www.internationalbigfootconference.com https://sasquatchchronicles.com/          </p>",
