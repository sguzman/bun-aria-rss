  "description": "<p>A representation theory for Bol algebras is proposed. For a suitable\n(2,3)-cohomology theory for Bol algebras, we define a (2,3)-coboundary with\ncompanion and next we define a (2,3)-cohomology group. Deformations of Bol\nalgebras are investigated. In particular, one-parameter infinitesimal\ndeformations of Bol algebras are characterized in terms of Bol algebras of\ndeformation type and (2,3)-cocycles with coefficients in the adjoint\nrepresentation. The (2,3)-cohomology group is also applied to study abelian\nextensions of Bol algebras.\n</p>",
