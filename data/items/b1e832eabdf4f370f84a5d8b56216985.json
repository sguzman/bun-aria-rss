  "description": "<p>Nick Youssef takes a break from his busy day of mentoring jihadists to joing me on the roof of the Comedy Store for a podcast. This is the first one I've done from up there. We talked about his time on the AIDS LifeCycle where he rode a bicycle from San Francisco to Los Angeles. We talked all about bikes and then ended it by Youssef making a bet he could never hope to win because he sucks.</p>",
