  "description": "<p>On this week’s episode of The Literary Life Podcast, Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks delve into part one of a two-part discussion of Leo Tolstoy’s <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/3aowFdK\">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</a>.</em> Our hosts kick things off talking about their background with Russian literature, and Thomas gives some biographical information on Tolstoy. They also talk about the concept of the “holy fool.” Some ideas discussed in this episode include the characters’ responses to death, the mask of respectability, and the problem of discontent.</p> <p>Cindy is hosting a new summer discipleship course for moms this year, so head over to <a href= \"https://morningtimeformoms.com/product/morning-time-for-moms-summer-discipleship-2021/\"> morningtimeformoms.com</a> for more info and to sign up!
