That won’t be awkward at all for anyone, especially you, person who just realized Maryland is undefeated.\n--Miami and FSU might be playing in a hurricane, which would be cool\n--Georgia and South Carolina might be playing in a hurricane, which really wouldn’t be any different since South Carolina always looks like they’re playing in a stiff wind and driving rain even in clear skies and bright sunshine\n--The Red River Rivalry is happening this weekend! Abandon hope, wake up early, and just see how nothing you anticipated happening happens again for the 111th time in a row\n--Ryan leaves the podcast early, a la Mack Brown in the middle of the Toledo/BYU game\n--Jason and Spencer answer reader questions as fast as they can, including the all-important question of what game is better for freakish weather than the 2000 Independence Bowl where it snowed in Shreveport?
