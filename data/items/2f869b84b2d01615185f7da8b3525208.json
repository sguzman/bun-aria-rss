  "description": "<p>Today on the show we had to open up the phone lines for Breakfast Club court with DJ Envy on the stand, after a listener called in wanting her money back after missing her flight going to the Envy's Carchella. The listeners had to determine if Envy should pay the woman back or not help her out at all since it was not his fault anyway. In addition, we also, opened up the phone lines to see if our listeners would tell a stranger on a street that their pricetag is hanging off their clothes or would they mind their business, after Envy had a situation when telling a stranger about their tag hanging. And Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to a TacoBell employee for being arrested for arson inside the restaurant.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
