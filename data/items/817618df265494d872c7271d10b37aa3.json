  "description": "<p>THE HARDEST THING TO DO WHEN YOU GET OLDER IS CHANGE A HABIT. There is a Buddhist metaphor of the elephant and the rider. We are all riding an elephant. We think that we are in control. We have the reigns. But the elephant could overpower us at any moment.  No matter how much we use our minds, our emotions ultimately are more powerful. This applies to the way we eat. We become slaves to our cravings and desires. Sometimes it takes something big to get back in control of our “elephant.” On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about changing habits, being authentic, and what it takes to build the longest running act in Vegas with one of the world’s most famous magicians: Penn Jillette. Penn Jillette is a magician, actor, musician, inventor, television personality, and best-selling author best known for his work with fellow magician Teller as half of the team Penn & Teller. The duo has been featured in numerous stage and television shows such as Penn & Teller: Fool Us, and Penn & Teller: Bullshit!, and are currently headlining in Las Vegas at The Rio. He has published eight books, including the New York Times Bestseller, God, No!: Signs You May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales. Not many people can keep a marriage together for over forty years, let alone a working partnership. Penn is someone who shows up authentically every day. He isn’t afraid to express his thoughts and values even though they upset some people. So get ready to learn how to doubt yourself less and care about the things that matter on Episode 814.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhy do we live in so much fear when we’re safer than ever? (8:00)<br />\nWhat are you most proud of in the last few years? (9:00)<br />\nWhich of your parents is the most influential in your life?
