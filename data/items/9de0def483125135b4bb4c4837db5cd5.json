We can see ourselves sleeping in, sipping hot coffee, and diving into a good book. But it’s more likely someone will get sick, the traffic will be terrible, and the diaper bag will be left at the house. In this episode, Emily and Laura offer a “Mom Heart Check” to help find the root of difficulty in family trips. When we travel, it’s not about being served but about serving others. We can prep our hearts before, during, and after a trip by rethinking our expectations and remembering the servant love of Christ.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1552418462011_67400\" class= \"sqs-block button-block sqs-block-button\" data-block-type=\"53\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1552418800355_478\" class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1552418800355_477\" class= \"sqs-block-button-container--center\" data-alignment=\"center\" data-button-size=\"small\"><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"risenmotherhood.com/transcriptions/ep-124-traveling-with-kids-the-adventure-you-didnt-hope-for-transcript\" data-initialized=\"true\">VIEW TRANSCRIPT</a></div> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1552418462011_69434\" class= \"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\" data-block-type=\"47\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1552418462011_68846\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <h2><strong>RELATED ARTICLES, RESOURCES, AND CONTENT:</strong></h2> <p><em>Mentioned on the show:</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/newsletter\">R|M Newsletter Sign-Up</a></p> <p><em>R|M-related:</em></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/show-archive//2016/06/ep-19-bad-moment-doesnt-have-to-make.html\"> Ep. 19, A Bad Moment Doesn't Have To Make A Bad Day: Redeem Your Day</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/transcriptions/ep-21-idols-of-a-moms-heart-transcript\"> Ep. 21, Idols of a Mom’s Heart</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/show-archive//2017/01/ep-47-facing-cold-flu-season-with-grace.html\"> Ep. 47, Facing the Cold and Flu Season with Grace</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/show-archive//2017/02/ep-49-when-momma-gets-mad-part-1-whats.html\"> Ep. 49, When Momma Gets Mad, Part 1: What's Under the Surface?</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/show-archive/ep-123-motherhood-is-ministry-how-to-see-and-serve-your-kids\"> Ep. 123, Motherhood is Ministry: How to See and Serve Your Kids</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/blog/2017/4/5/see-needs-and-meet-them?rq=serving\"> “See Needs and Meet Them” Laura Wifler</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/blog/the-kingdom-of-mom\">“The Kingdom of Mom” Maggie Combs</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/blog/a-mothers-hope\">“A Mother’s Hope” Christina Fox</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/blog/a-god-who-serves-mothers?rq=god%20who%20serves%20mothers\"> “A God Who Serves Mothers” Amanda Criss</a></p> <p><em>Around the web:</em></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/your-child-is-your-neighbor/\"> “Your Child is Your Neighbor” Jen Wilkin</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://gospelcenteredwoman.com/summer-vacation-and-the-gospel/\">“Summer Vacation and the Gospel” The Gospel-Centered Woman</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/summer-vacation-is-no-sabbath/\"> “Summer Vacation is No Sabbath” Kathryn Butler</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.reviveourhearts.com/true-woman/blog/you-are-responsible-for-your-own-actions/\"> “You Are Responsible for Your Own Actions” Nancy DeMoss Wolgemuth</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/when-god-interrupts-your-plans\"> “When God Interrupts Your Plans” Christina Fox</a></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1552418462011_70048\" class= \"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\" data-block-type=\"47\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1552418462011_70111\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <p><strong>R|M Apply:</strong></p> <ol data-rte-list=\"default\"> <li> <p>Consider your heart motivations when planning and prepping for a trip.
