Comedian, writer, and performer Wonder Dave tells us how his parents got it right by slipping him quality learning materials early on, and how he shared his newfound knowledge with his best friend Nate. 2 teenage boys on a sleepover, what could go wrong? Well for starters, they could establish good ground rules like no slut-shaming, discover how to clearly communicate their needs and feelings, and determine the importance of a high thread count.
