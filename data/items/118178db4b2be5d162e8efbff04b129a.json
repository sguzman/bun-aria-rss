  "description": "<p>A room filled with some heroes - Dan Hanzus, Marc Sessler, and Gregg Rosenthal preview all the games on the Week 9 slate with a couple of running themes: teams on a downward trend with a chance to stop the slide, and other teams with a good \"measuring stick\" kind of game. We start with the primetime games, Titans-Chiefs (3:16) and Ravens-Saints (12:18), before moving on to the draft: Rams-Buccaneers (17:50), Bills-Jets (26:03), Seahawks-Cardinals (34:34), Chargers-Falcons (40:22), Dolphins-Bears (46:04), Colts-Patriots (54:27), Panthers-Bengals (1:02:48), Packers-Lions (1:10:56), Vikings-Commanders (1:16:44), and finally, Raiders-Jaguars (1:22:21). Each of the heroes makes their lock-of-the-week pick, and we check in on the lock standings towards the end of the episode.</p>\n<p>Note: timecodes approximate.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
