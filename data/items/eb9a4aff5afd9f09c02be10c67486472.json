  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss ideas about the Stone Age people who created the extraordinary images found in caves around the world, from hand outlines to abstract symbols to the multicoloured paintings of prey animals at Chauvet and, as shown above, at Lascaux. In the 19th Century, it was assumed that only humans could have made these, as Neanderthals would have lacked the skills or imagination, but new tests suggest otherwise. How were the images created, were they meant to be for private viewing or public spaces, and what might their purposes have been? And, if Neanderthals were capable of creative work, in what ways were they different from humans? What might it have been like to experience the paintings, so far from natural light? \n\nWith \n\nAlistair Pike\nProfessor of Archaeological Sciences at the University of Southampton\n\nChantal Conneller\nSenior Lecturer in Early Pre-History at Newcastle University\n\nAnd\n\nPaul Pettitt\nProfessor of Palaeolithic Archaeology at Durham University\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
