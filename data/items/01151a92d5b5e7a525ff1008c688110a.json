  "description": "Our first interview today is about a novel that, believe it or not, was actually written before the coronavirus pandemic even started. <em>The End of October</em>, written by Lawrence Wright, is about...a pandemic. But Wright told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly he wishes he hadn't gotten so much of it right. The second interview is with two friends, Marilyn Hacker and Karthika Nair, who were separated by the pandemic. So to connect with each other, they wrote a book of poetry called <em>A Different Distance</em>. They told former NPR host Noel King that the collaboration actually strengthened their friendship.",
