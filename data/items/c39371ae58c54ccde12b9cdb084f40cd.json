  "description": "<p>More than 100,000 people die every year from snake bites. Snake venom can have up to 200 different toxins inside it and each toxin has a different horrible effect to your body. Some attack your muscles, while others attack your nerves. And sometimes two different toxins can work together to form an even more sinister combination. Part of the reason people are dying is because they're not getting antivenom - the medicine required to fight these horrible toxins - fast enough. The system we have to create snake antivenom is a time-consuming and inefficient process that basically hasn't changed for more than 100 years.</p>\n<p>This is a collaboration with the great podcast <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/science-vs\" target=\"_blank\">Science Vs</a> from Gimlet</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=37092&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">Science Vs Snakes</a></p>\n",
