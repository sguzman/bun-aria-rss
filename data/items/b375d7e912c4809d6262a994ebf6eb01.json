  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, July 4th is when white supremacists and systemically racist individuals get together to celebrate independence day and if they’re people of color then they are sell-outs, at least that's what the democrat mob and media tell us. The media is also reporting tens of thousands of new cases of coronavirus but fails to report on who's in the hospital ICU's and who is dying from this virus. They won't report that, just like they won't report the huge increase in jobs today — 4.8 million Americans are back to work! Then, the Senate proposed a resolution to condemn violent protests, but Democrats oppose it. Just like Joe Biden refuses to acknowledge that the Pandemic is improving and that fewer people are dying, that's a fact. Later, the NFL has announced that they will play a song known as the \"Black National Anthem\" before the U.S National Anthem before every game. This disrespect to America will only add to the divisiveness being promoted throughout the culture. Afterward, Rep Adam Schiff's intelligence committee staff has acknowledged that Schiff was briefed on the same intelligence the NY Times claims was provided to the President and Schiff took no action on the alleged intel.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
