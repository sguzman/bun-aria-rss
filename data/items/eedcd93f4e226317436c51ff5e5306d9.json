Underscored in \"Men In Black,\" is the idea that activist judges are incapable of doing impartial justice. Then, Justices Ginsberg and Sotomayor have decided to break with the tradition and precedent of jurists by making political statements about the President of the United States.

Afterward, Jim Acosta was up to his old tricks making statements to smear the President instead of asking questions of him. Lastly, the Coronavirus pandemic overseas has been politicized by Sen. Chuck Schumer and the Democrats despite the virus not actually affecting Americans at this time. Plus, a recap of the exclusive interview with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the peace deal for Israel and Palestine proposed by the U.S.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
