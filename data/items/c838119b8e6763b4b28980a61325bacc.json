  "description": "<p>On this episode of On Purpose, I sat down with Katee Sackhoff. Katee is an actress, most well known for playing Lieutenant Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace on Battlestar Galactica. She is also a cancer survivor. We discussed everything from failure, to work ethic, to overcoming false beliefs about ourselves. She brings a unique and profound perspective to the table, in how she’s able to situate herself from the negative external opinions we too often let creep up on us. We dove into her strategies for overcoming these tough moments of self-doubt, how she’s able to understand that who you are is not what you do, and why we should never take “no” personally. </p>\n",
