  "description": "<p>Whenever you are inordinately anxious, angry, proud, deflated, it’s because at that moment you’re forgetting who the God of the Bible is— or maybe it’s because you never understood who he was. That’s why there is nothing more practically important than to know the God of the Bible in depth. </p>\n<p>This sermon focuses on two questions. How do we know God exists? And how do human beings get the knowledge of God? We’ll look at four things Paul tells us in Romans 1: 1) We can know God; 2) We actually do know God; 3) Yet paradoxically we don’t know God; and 4) How we can know God truly and personally again.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 14, 2010. Series: To Know the Living God – The God Who Can Be Known. Scripture: Romans 1:16-25.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
