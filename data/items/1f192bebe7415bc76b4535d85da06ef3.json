  "description": "Big announcement! I am going on tour! Get tickets at heathermcdonald.net \n\nI recap Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and discuss how the trip to Aspen turned into a mean girl's sleepover. Maitland Ward from Boy Meets World is here, but she has gone through some changes since you last saw her on that family-friendly sitcom. Her first on-screen role was on the soap opera Bold and Beautiful when she was 16, but as an adult, she found herself in the porn industry. Since starting porn, she has won many awards and plans to continue to explore her sexual side but only on-screen. Go check out her book that comes out today, Rated X, and it focuses on her story of transitioning from Hollywood to porn. Enjoy! It’s a juicy one.\n\nSubscribe on Apple Podcasts to get exclusive Extra Juicy episodes every Friday and get all episodes of Juicy Scoop, ad-free\n\nOr get access to Extra Juicy on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/juicyscoop\n\nTo bring your brand to life in this podcast, email podcastadsales@sonymusic.com\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
