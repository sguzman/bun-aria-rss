From the time you open your eyes, your brain is kicking in and most likely living in overdrive. The unfortunate truth is most likely you’re not even aware of all the ways your brain is under attack. Social media is being consumed at an unhealthy rate in both your personal and business life. Even if you have a generally healthy diet, processed foods and chemicals that damage the brain are still sneaking into your body’s system. Is there any wonder why anxiety, stress, and depression, trauma and PTSD are now considered to be the norm? Dr. Daniel Amen is a psychiatrist, brain scan expert and third time guest. In this episode, he’s unleashing the truth about the emotional dragons you are likely dealing with. He gets into some of the most common dragons attacking your emotional brain today, anxious, wounded and inferior to name a few. If you’re low-key feeling attacked on a daily basis, breathe deep and listen in on ways you can start changing your brain and changing your life for the better.   SHOW NOTES: 0:00 | Introduction Dr. Daniel Amen 1:10 | Dragons From the Past 4:18 | Balancing the Prefrontal Cortex 7:38 | Knowing Common Dragons 10:59 | Identify Accurate Thinking 14:18 | Strategies To Tame Your Dragons 16:35 | Techniques to Help with Trauma 20:35 | PTSD & Stimulating Trauma 29:57 | Rewriting 12 Steps for Bad Habits 32:00 | Tell Your Brain What You Want 39:09 | Unhealthy Weight to the Brain 45:01 | Brain Health, Anxiety & Diet Link 48:49 | Your Brain on Marijuana   QUOTES: “When you take the emotion out, something's going to replace it, and if you have skill in managing your mind, you'll often look for what's right rather than what's wrong.” [27:35]   “Negative thinking disrupts brain function, but at the same time [...] positive thinking by itself is harmful, we have to be thoughtful.
