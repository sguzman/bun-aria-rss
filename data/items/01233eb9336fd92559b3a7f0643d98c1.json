  "title": "PMS 2.0 132- The Voice Of College Football, Kirk Herbstreit, Stops By For A Hell Of A Conversation About Life",
  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the boys are joined by the Voice of College Football, one of the most handsome men working in sports today, friend of the show, Kirk Herbstreit. They discuss this past Saturday’s installment of College Gameday and when pat knew that he was going to bellyflop into the Brazos, the CFB playoff committee’s mindset when selecting their top 4 teams, why he thinks Alabama is on the outside looking in, Kirk chats about which quarterback’s he likes watching in the NFL and who he thinks is in that tier. They also cover how each of them got to where they are now, including Kirk’s winding road from doing local radio in Ohio to being the face of college football and the different bumps he encountered along the way, and gives his thoughts on when the next installment of NCAA Football might be coming out. It’s an incredible conversation about football and life (2:07-52:04). Pat and the boys also cover what is currently going on in the NFL as they get a pulse for what Steeler fans are thinking and why they may or may not hate Mason Rudolph, discuss whether the Lions or the Bears are in a worse position, and gush about Bill Belichick having a little fun in his post game press conference after the Eagles game. Today’s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
