  "description": "<p>Setting goals is an important part of growth, but often people make goals without the wherewithal to see things through. This is why so many people fail at popular New Year’s resolutions. Goals, like saving money or getting in shape, are broad and without a plan in place, they can be pretty hard to accomplish. In order to create lasting change, you have to implement an actionable, digestible strategy to help you reach those goals.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Instead of aimlessly working toward what you want, it’s much more effective to reverse engineer your life and create direct action steps that can bring you to your goal. This gives you a sense of clarity and a direct roadmap to become who you want to be.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Steve Weatherford has used this strategy in many aspects of his life, from becoming the fittest man in the NFL to building strong relationships with his wife and children. His superpower is reverse engineering his visions and bringing them to reality. No matter what you plan to accomplish in the new year, an actionable and intentional approach is key.
