  "description": "This morning’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading came in at a staggering 9.1%... but because the CPI is a lagging indicator, this number leaves out important data that shows we could be near peak inflation. I explain why inflation is no longer the biggest threat to the market… and what’s really concerning me about the economy right now. And Daniel and I debate what the Fed needs to do to bring back the bull market. Could Elon Musk end up in hot water—or even jail—for backing out of his deal to buy Twitter (TWTR)? I recap the dramatic, ongoing spat between Musk and Twitter… and how it’s a battle of who’s more full of s***. Daniel and I disagree about whether to consider Twitter for a trade… and I highlight the biggest risk that no one is talking about. In this episode:  Why today’s high CPI reading could represent peak inflation [1:53] The biggest risk to markets right now isn’t inflation [7:10] What we need to see from the Fed for markets to rally [13:50] Could Musk go to jail over the Twitter fiasco? [19:44] Musk vs. Twitter: Who’s more full of s***? [21:50]  Is TWTR a good trade? [27:00] The biggest risk to Twitter no one’s talking about [28:40]    Enjoyed this episode?
