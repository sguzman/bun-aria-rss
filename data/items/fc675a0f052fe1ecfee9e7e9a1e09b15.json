  "description": "The legendary Jane Goodall is a scientist, convservationist and humanitarian, whose 60-year study  of wild chimpanzees in Tanzania challenged and overturned much of the conventional scientific thinking at the time. Her tireless work over the years - she is now 88 - has won her a legion of admirers, including David Attenborough, Leonardo di Caprio, Prince Harry and Greta Thunberg who calls Goodall ‘a true hero’. She joins me to talk about the resilience of hope, whether chimpanzees have a sense of failure, her own failures in language, correspondence and motherhood, and her belief in the next generation. This was one of the most enlightening podcast interviews I've ever had the privilege of doing. Please listen!<br /><br />--<br /><br />Jane Goodall's latest book, The Book of Hope: A Survival Guide for Trying Times, is out next week in paperback and is available to pre-order here <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/320237/the-book-of-hope-by-goodall-jane/9780241479469\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/320237/the-book-of-hope-by-goodall-jane/9780241479469</a><br /><br />--<br /><br />How To Fail With Elizabeth Day is hosted by Elizabeth Day, produced by Naomi Mantin and Chris Sharp.
