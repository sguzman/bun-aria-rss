You don't have to worry about whether Pluto is a planet because planets do not exist. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",
