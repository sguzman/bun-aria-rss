  "description": "The hardest part of research isn't answering a question. It's knowing what to do before you know what your question is. Where Research Begins: Choosing a Research Project That Matters to You (and the World) (University of Chicago Press, 2022) tackles the two challenges every researcher faces with every new project: How do I find a compelling problem to investigate--one that truly matters to me, deeply and personally? How do I then design my research project so that the results will matter to anyone else?\nThis book will help you start your new research project the right way for you with a series of simple yet ingenious exercises. Written in a conversational style and packed with real-world examples, this easy-to-follow workbook offers an engaging guide to finding research inspiration within yourself, and in the broader world of ideas.\nRead this book if you (or your students):\n\nhave difficulty choosing a research topic\n\nknow your topic, but are unsure how to turn it into a research project\n\nfeel intimidated by or unqualified to do research\n\nworry that you're asking the wrong questions about your research topic\n\nhave plenty of good ideas, but aren't sure which one to commit to\n\nfeel like your research topic was imposed by someone else\n\nwant to learn new ways to think about how to do research.\n\nThomas S. Mullaney is professor of history at Stanford University and a Guggenheim fellow. His books include The Chinese Typewriter: A History and Your Computer is on Fire. \nChristopher Rea is professor of Asian studies at the University of British Columbia.
