  "description": "<div>THIS WAS NOT WHAT WE MEANT WHEN WE SAID \"LET THE WOMEN DO THE WORK.\"<br>\n<br>\nCharles Manson WAS NOT AN EVIL GENIUS. He was, as Gillian describes him, a puny little twerp. HOWEVER, the crimes committed at his behest are infamous. And surely you've heard the stories before, but this time we're hearing them FROM THE WOMEN WHO WERE THERE!! Squeaky, Gypsy, A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD NAMED SNAKE, you can't make this stuff up. Anyway,  buckle up and pull the hell over, the Manson Girls have the floor. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>YOU GUYS WE LAUNCHED A NEW PODCAST!!</strong> Each week on <a href=\"https://www.centuriespod.com/\">\"Crimes of the Centuries\"</a> host Amber Hunt (of the Accused podcast) takes us on a deep investigative dive into a crime that was huge when it happened, but has been lost to time--and one you've likely never heard of. Episodes 1 & 2 are available right now! <a href=\"https://www.centuriespod.com/post/episode-1-mary-phagan\">Episode tells the story of the 1913 murder of 13-year-old Mary Phagan</a> which resulted in one of the country's first high-profile murder trials. <a href=\"https://www.centuriespod.com/post/episode-2-leopold-loeb\">Episode 2 tells the story of the Jazz Age killers Leopold & Loeb</a>, who murdered a boy just to prove they could get away with it. <strong>Find \"Crimes of the Centuries\" wherever you get your podcasts. </strong>\n</div>\n",
