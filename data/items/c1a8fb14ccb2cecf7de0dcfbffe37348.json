  "description": "Banks were bailed out during the financial crisis in 2008. In the US the Treasury bought billions in mortgage backed securities. In the UK half a trillion pounds was allocated to a bank rescue package. The government took a 58 percent stake in RBS and remains a significant shareholder to this day.

Phil Dobbie talks to Prof Steve Keen about how to moderate the behaviour of banks for the good of society.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
