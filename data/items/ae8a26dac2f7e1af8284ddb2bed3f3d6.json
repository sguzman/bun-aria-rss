  "description": "Kara and Scott talk about IBM's new CEO as the company struggles to keep up with cloud computing. They also discuss Zuckerberg's \"new approach to social media\", and breakdown Amazon's major earnings. In \"Friends of Pivot\" Jon Lovett, host of the Crooked Media podcast \"Lovett or Leave It\" says we should be prepared for the Trump campaign's major ad push. In wins and fails, Kara remembers Leila Janah an entrepreneur who focused on creating jobs in the world's poorest communities; she passed away this week at the age of 37. Scott's win is the halftime show at the Superbowl (although his kids would say his dancing is a FAIL). We end the show by questioning Jeff Bezos' dating choices after his girlfriend's brother sues him for defamation.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
