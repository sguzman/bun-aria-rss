  "title": "How to Love Your Single (or Dating) Life - with Stephanie May Wilson",
  "description": "<p>With the holidays just around the corner, we know that the site of mistletoe or sound of a Christmas love song can be enough to make a single girl cringe. We get it. The cute, snuggly photos friends share with their boyfriends/husbands and engagement announcements all over Instagram are nice but when you feel like the one who's still not having the best time in the dating scene, it can be HARD to really be happy with where we're at. So, Jordan called in the expert. Literally. Stephanie May Wilson's mission is to help women thrive in their single and dating lives and in this episode, she unpacks a beautiful middle ground between two equally destructive perspectives we tend to swing between when it comes to singleness and marriage, how to invest in your single life, and even how to intentionally prepare to become the right person more than just looking for the right person. If you're needing a little insight on how to thrive in your single or dating life this holiday season, look no further than this episode right here. <br />Thank you to our sponsors, Mejuri, ZipRecruiter, and Boll & Branch. </p>\n<p>Take advantage of our special offers here: </p>\n<p>Mejuri: For free shipping on orders of $100 or more, go to <a href=\"http://www.mejuri.com/she\">www.mejuri.com/she</a></p>\n<p>ZipRecruiter: Try it for free by going to <a href=\"ZipRecruiter.com/she\">ZipRecruiter.com/she</a></p>\n<p>Boll & Branch: For $50 off your first order, go to <a href=\"http://www.bollandbranch.com/\">www.bollandbranch.com</a> and use the code \"SHE\"</p>\n<p><br />Grab Steph's Prayer Journal Here: <a href=\"https://www.smaywilsonshop.com/shop/every-single-moment-prayer-journal\">Every Single Moment</a><br />Follow Steph on social here: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/smaywilson\">@smaywilson</a></p>\n",
