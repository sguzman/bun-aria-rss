  "description": "Jennifer Lopez flashed her crotch and danced on a stripper pole during the Super Bowl. Feminists have hailed the performance as empowering and liberating, but I'm not sure that description quite fits. Also, is it crazy to suggest that maybe the Super Bowl should be appropriate for the whole family? And in other Super Bowl news, multi-millionaire couple Beyonce and Jay Z sit during the Anthem, which makes sense because they have been treated so badly by this country.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
