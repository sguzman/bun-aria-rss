  "description": "In this message, Victoria will show how to have a winning attitude with our family members. The Scripture says, “Let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds” (Hebrews 10:24). If we’re going to create the life that we want to live with our family, we have to keep the tone of a winner. We’re going to celebrate in the good times, and we’re going to keep that winning spirit in the difficult times. I believe that if we will maintain that consistent tone, we’re going to have a great life not only for ourselves but for our families!<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
