  "description": "<p>The properties of the $X(3872)$ and its spin partner, the $X(4014)$, are\nstudied both in vacuum and at finite temperature. Using an effective hadron\ntheory based on the hidden-gauge Lagrangian, the $X(3872)$ is dynamically\ngenerated from the $s$-wave rescattering of a pair of pseudoscalar and vector\ncharm mesons. By incorporating the thermal spectral functions of open charm\nmesons, the calculation is extended to finite temperature. Similarly, the\nproperties of the $X(4014)$ are obtained out of the scattering of charm vector\nmesons. By applying heavy-quark flavor symmetry, the properties of their bottom\ncounterparts in the axial-vector and tensor channels are also predicted. All\nthe dynamically generated states show a decreasing mass and acquire an\nincreasing decay width with temperature, following the trend observed in their\nmeson constituents. These results are relevant in relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions at high energies, in analyses of the collective medium formed after\nhadronization or in femtoscopic studies, and can be tested in lattice-QCD\ncalculations exploring the melting of heavy mesons at finite temperature.\n</p>",
