  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, there is a growing anti-semitism within the Democrat party and the media is silent. Bill Clinton sat on stage with Louis Farrakhan at Aretha Franklin's memorial service and the media didn’t say a word. Yet, the Washington Post unfairly smeared Ron DeSantis for speaking at a conservative conference which the radical Left has labeled a hate group. These 2 events expose who the media really are. The Democrat’s never rebuke Anti-Jewish activist Linda Sarsour who has repeatedly disparaged Israel and received praise from the left including socialist starlet, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Moreover, President Trump has been one of the greatest presidents for certain communities, including the Jewish community; moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem and reducing regulation to increase job growth including the African-American community. Finally, why is Barack Obama being so vocal in campaigning as of late? He’s worried if Republicans hold the House and the Senate that the investigations into the illegal unmaskings will get to a point where people will ask, what did Obama know and when did he know it.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
