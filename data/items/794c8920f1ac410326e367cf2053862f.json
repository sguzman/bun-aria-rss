Use my link https://bit.ly/MathemaniacDCJan22  and check out the first chapter of any DataCamp course for FREE! \n\nI can't pronounce \"parametrisation\" lol\n\nA crash course in complex analysis - basically everything leading up to the Residue theorem. This is a more intuitive explanation of complex integration using P√≥lya vector field.\n\nYou might notice that my explanation on parametrisation is a bit similar to the Jacobian, and you will be right! Jacobian is really important in this area (and also understanding complex differentiation and Cauchy-Riemann equations).\n\nI have made this slower in comparison with some of my other videos, because when I myself watched some of my other videos that are faster, I couldn't comprehend if I was not paying too much attention on the screen, let alone the audience watching it for the first time. If somehow, miraculously, you think this is way too slow, feel free to speed it up!\n\nI said the more general Cauchy integral formula is related, because in my original plan, I did want to say that Laurent coefficients take on exactly the same form, but it just occurred while I was finally editing the video that we don't find Laurent coefficients using integrals, and I don't want to send my Cauchy integral formula bit to waste, so here it is.\n\nThroughout this video series, of course I have left out lots of theorems in complex analysis, only talking about the things that I find more \"applicable\" (read: more audience want to watch). Things like Fundamental theorem of algebra, or maximum modulus principle, or even winding numbers are not presented, but in my defense, they are not really \"essence of\" anymore, because they use the concepts that we have developed in this series instead - like Cauchy integral formula as seen here.\n\nThis video was sponsored by DataCamp.\n\nüìñüìñMORE READINGüìñüìñ\n\n(Simply connected version) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_integral_theorem\n\n(Homologous to 0 version)\nhttps://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~brubaker/docs/8701-F13/dixon.pdf\n\nSurely, You‚Äôre Joking, Mr Feynman: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Surely-Youre-Joking-Feynman-Adventures/dp/009917331X\n\nMath StackExchange thread: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/253910/the-integral-that-stumped-feynman\n\nResidue theorem example links:\n\nWikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_theorem#An_integral_along_the_real_axis\n[The example that I nicked from]\n\nYou will need - estimation lemma (a.k.a.
