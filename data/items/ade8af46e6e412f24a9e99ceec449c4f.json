  "description": "<p>USModernist Radio goes to Palm Springs each February for the incredibly popular Modernism Week.  It’s a fascinating array of sunshine, architecture, lectures, parties, tours, exhibits, and you can even order martinis for breakfast. Yes, you can do that anywhere but you'll feel glamorous in Palm Springs. USModernist Radio's <strong>George Smart</strong> was there with keynote speakers and other special guests who make Modernism Week a blast.</p> <p><strong>Nate Cormier</strong> is a Principal working Los Angeles-based Rios Clementi Hale Studios. He discusses the new public space in downtown Palm Springs, a wonderful area that will include the Big Marilyn as well as Frey and Kocher's Aluminaire House.</p> <p><strong>Michelle Delk</strong> is a Partner, Landscape Architect and ASLA Discipline Director with Snøhetta, an architecture and design firm that has garnered international acclaim for projects including the Bibilioteca Alexandrina in Alexandria, Egypt, the expansion of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Norwegian National Opera and Ballet in Oslo, and the Jim Hunt Library in Raleigh NC.  She discusses the design of the Willamette Falls Riverwalk in Oregon and how landscape architecture inspires us in ways most people don't realize.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",
