  "description": "<p>Darkness Radio presents The Miracle Collectors with guests Joan Hill & Katie Mahon<br>\nDave & Tim open up today about Miracles in their own lives in a raw and emotional discussion with guests Joan Luise Hill & Katie Mahon.<br>\nAs part of their own spiritual quest, miracle experts, Katie Mahon and Joan Luise Hill, discovered that when we are truly awake and present, miracles abound. While some defy explanation, others invite us to take a closer look, to discover common ground with each other, and to seek meaning in a whole new way.<br>\n<br>\nKatie Mahon became a miracle expert the hard way. At nineteen, she walked away from serial killer Ted Bundy with the help of a stranger who appeared, seemingly, out of nowhere. <br>\n<br>\nJoan Luise Hill's introduction to miracles evolved as a series of coincidences that ultimately could not be ignored. <br>\n<br>\nGet their book here: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3tV32bb\">https://amzn.to/3tV32bb</a><br>\n<br>\nVisit their site here: <a href=\"http://www.themiraclecollectors.com/\">www.themiraclecollectors.com</a></p>\n",
