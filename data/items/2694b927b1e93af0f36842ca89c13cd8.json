  "description": "<p>Treating Post-COVID, Or Long-Hauler, Syndrome | This episode is brought to you by BetterHelp</p><br><p>By now, most of us are familiar with post-COVID syndrome, also called long-haulers syndrome, in which a patient who has had COVID-19 experiences long-lasting symptoms. While medicine is still trying to fully understand the reason why a percentage of COVID-19 patients go on to also experience post-COVID syndrome, there appear to be parallels to chronic fatigue syndrome experienced from the Epstein-Barr virus. In this minisode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. Patrick Hanaway about using a Functional Medicine approach to treat post-COVID syndrome. He also speaks with Dr. Matt Cook about several cutting-edge therapies he is using to treat his patients with post-COVID syndrome.</p><br><p>Dr. Patrick Hanaway is a board-certified family physician trained at Washington University. After 10 years as Chief Medical Officer at Genova Diagnostics, Dr. Hanaway became the Chief Medical Education Officer for the Institute for Functional Medicine. In 2014, Dr. Hanaway was the founding Medical Director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine. His research focus is on nutrition, the microbiome, and evaluating value in Functional Medicine models of care. Currently, his teaching focus is on cancer, COVID, and uncertainty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Hanaway was initiated in 2009 as a Mara’akame (Indigenous healer) by the Huichol people of the Sierra Madres in Mexico. He holds community fires, leads ceremonies, and offers traditional healing sessions. This part of his practice provides some much-welcome spiritual and emotional insight into addressing our imbalances as a nation.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Matthew Cook is a board-certified anesthesiologist who has completed a fellowship in Functional Medicine. His practice, BioReset™ Medical, provides treatments for conditions ranging from pain and complex illness to anti-aging and wellness. At BioReset™ Medical, Dr. Cook treats some of the most challenging to diagnose and difficult to live with ailments that people suffer from today, including Lyme disease, chronic pain, PTSD, and mycotoxin illness. His approach is to use the most non-invasive, natural, and integrative ways possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Regarding the current pandemic, Dr. Cook has spent the past several months distilling the latest research, talking with experts around the world, and integrating his vast clinical experience to provide up-to-date information to the public and medical practitioners.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by BetterHelp.
