  "description": "NoSleep Podcast Presents The New Decayed Episode 02\nIt's episode 02 of The NoSleep Podcast presents: The New Decayed. On this week's show we undergo a macabre medical exam, and audition for a petrifying porno.\nDisclaimer: This is our first experimental miniseason. For this five-part series you’ll be joining Jessica McEvoy and Olivia White as they delve into the experimental, dark abyss of horror. Instead of taking an extended break during the European tour, we thought we’d try out something new. We’ll be taking this miniseason in directions outside of the usual mandate of The NoSleep Podcast. Some episodes of this miniseason are not for the faint of heart. Some are not for the squeamish. It’s not mandatory listening. If you choose to consider this a break and wait for Season 14, that’s fine. If you choose to join us, then brace yourselves. We’ll be taking you places.\n\"Breast Exam\" written by Holly Dionis (Story starts around 0:05:03)\nTRIGGER WARNING!\nProduced by: Phil Michalski\nCast: Narrator – Jessica McEvoy, Loretta Carson – Erin Lillis, Real Loretta Carson – Sarah Thomas\n\"The Casting Couch\" written by Olivia White (Story starts around 0:20:55)\nTRIGGER WARNING!\nProduced by: Phil Michalski\nCast: Jenna – Addison Peacock, Niah – Eden, Director – Graham Rowat\nClick here to learn more about the voice actors on The NoSleep Podcast \nClick here for tickets to our UK/EU Tour in January 2020 \nClick here to learn more about Hasani Walker's Kickstarter \nClick here to learn more about Olivia White \nClick here to learn more about Audrey McEvoy \nExecutive Producer: David Cummings\nHost: Jessica McEvoy\nThe New Decayed showrunner: Olivia White\nMusical score composed by: Brandon Boone\n\"The Casting Couch\" illustration courtesy of Audrey McEvoy\nAudio program ©2018-2019 - Creative Reason Media Inc. - All Rights Reserved - No reproduction or use of this content is permitted without the express written consent of Creative Reason Media Inc.
