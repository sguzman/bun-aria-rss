  "description": "In her most recent book, Holocaust: An American Understanding (Rutgers University Press), Deborah Lipstadt reviews and analyzes the emergence of Holocaust scholarship in the academy, and Holocaust consciousness in the American public, in the second half of the twentieth century. Professor Lipstadt, Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish History and Holocaust Studies at Emory University, demonstrates that, even as the magnitude and the horror of the Holocaust became known in the United States, it became a decisive influence on American Jewish identity, and on American moral and political consciousness, during a turbulent period. Professor Lipstadt talks about the evolving understanding of the Holocaust, as well as the phenomenon of Holocaust denial, in this wide-ranging discussion.\n\n\n\nDavid Gottlieb is a PhD candidate in the History of Judaism at the University of Chicago Divinity School. His research interests center on the influence of midrash in the formation of Jewish cultural memory. He can be reached at davidg1@uchicago.edu.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
