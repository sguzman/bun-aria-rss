  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 4/25/22",
  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, Elon Musk has succeeded in buying Twitter to take the company private, make its algorithms open-sourced, and ensure free speech on the platform. Thanks to this new ownership this program has begun Tweeting again. Free speech is a God-given human right, it's not the social engineering that the left is used to. Plus, the left within the media is blaming Gov. Ron DeSantis for interfering with the private sector, but the private sector (Disney) was interfering with a law passed by the legislature and signed by the Governor. The media immediately turns to false bi-naryism to paint the future of Twitter as a hate-filled dystopia with no content moderation because of free speech. Later, former president Trump was held in contempt of court by a judge and NY Attorney General Letitia James requested daily fines of $10K per day until Trump produces documents (that are not in his possession). Afterward, U.S Army National Guardsman Bishop Evans is dead today for doing the job that President Biden and the federal government are tasked with - protecting our nation's borders. Evans tried to rescue two drug traffickers that were drowning in the Rio Grande River. When a Capitol police officer died of natural causes after the J6 riot, the media condemned Trump and blamed him for it. Will the media blame Biden for the death of Bishop Evans? Will BLM attend his funeral? Finally, this program's endorsed Candidate for Ohio's US Senate seat, Josh Mandel, joins the show. Josh reiterated his commitment to our nation as an enlisted Marine fighting in Iraq and his service as Treasurer of the State of Ohio where he had to challenge Gov. John Kasich when he acted like a Democrat. Mandel noted that the odds are steep with multiple RINOs and Never-Trumpers spending millions to stop his conservative message.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
