  "description": "<p>Let me ask you a question: are you a <em>player</em>, or are you a <em>pretender</em>? Sometimes it can be harder to see the difference in ourselves than it is to see it others. So, today we begin a series in which John Maxwell teaches the difference between players and pretenders and how the world needs more leaders who will lead authentically and add value to their people. For the application portion of the episode, Mark Cole and Traci Morrow will be back to deep dive into John’s lesson and offer some application for you to apply this to your own life and leadership! They also have a special offer just for you, plus they read a comment from one of our listeners in the Philippines! Our BONUS resource for this series is the “Players vs. Pretenders Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
