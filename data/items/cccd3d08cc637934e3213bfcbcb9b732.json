Plus, Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School, discusses the special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional district, which pits Republican Rick Saccone against up-and-coming Democrat Conor Lamb, who has the chance to retake what was once a solidly republican district. The election is further complicated by Pennsylvania’s congressional voting map, which is due to be redrawn before the end of the year.
