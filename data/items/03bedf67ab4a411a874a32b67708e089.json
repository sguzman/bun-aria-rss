Learn how Sana started the brand with a small tax refund, and how she’s grown the privately-held Diaspora Co. over the past four years with no outside investment. Also, learn about her recent sourcing trip to India and beyond and what new products will be launching soon. \n\nThank you to Sitka Salmon Shares for supporting this episode. \n\n",
