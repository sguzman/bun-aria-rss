  "description": "<p>This week’s Alpha Trader podcast features hosts Aaron Task and Stephen Alpher speaking with Scott Redler, chief strategist at T3 Live and the T3 Trading Group.\nAmong the topics discussed:\nDon’t get hurt with opinions, says Redler, a pure technical trader. He keeps his eye on the 8- and 21-day moving averages for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Russell 2000. When above, says Redler, that means “risk on,” and he’ll look to buy individual names with the best technical setups.</p>\n\n<p>Redler is unconcerned that equity markets continue to make new record highs even as falling long-term yields might suggest some trouble ahead. For now, says Redler, stocks are unconcerned about what the bond market might be saying. Again - don’t get hurt with opinions. At some point it might be an issue, but for now the direction for stocks remains higher.</p>\n\n<p>Among recent small- and mid-cap buys thanks to good technical setups are Skillz (SKLZ), Sunpower (SPWR), Churchill Capital (CCIV), and NIO (NIO).</p>\n\n<p>Crypto has charts as well, and Redler sees a battle being waged on bitcoin (BTC-USD) around the $30K level. It’s fallen below that level a couple of times in the past few weeks, but has quickly bounced. That tells him there’s a pretty good chance last week’s $28.8K is the lowest we’ll see for a few months.</p>\n\n<p>Listen to or subscribe to Alpha Trader on these podcast platforms:\nApple Podcasts\nSpotify\nGoogle Play\nStitcher\nLearn more about your ad choices.
