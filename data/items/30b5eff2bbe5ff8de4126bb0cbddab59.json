  "description": "Billionaire “Bond King” Jeffrey Gundlach believes Bitcoin will plummet further to $10,000 per BTC despite having already fallen by about 70% from its all-time high.\n\nIn a new CNBC interview, the CEO of asset management firm DoubleLine Capital says he wouldn’t be “surprised at all” if the flagship crypto asset fell by more than 50% from the current levels to around $10,000.\n\n“The trend in crypto is clearly not positive. I mean it topped out a long time ago. Remember, I was with you in July of last year, and Bitcoin was up at like $60,000 or something. And then it dropped down to $30,000…\n\nIt managed to rally back but it looks like it is being liquidated. So I’m not bullish at $20,000 or $21,000 on Bitcoin. I wouldn’t be surprised at all if it went to $10,000.”\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
