But like it or not, we're communicating messages about ourselves every day with the clothes we wear, the cars we drive, and the products we use. In the final installment of our Money 2.0 series, we revisit favorite conversations with <a href=\"https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/amreed/\">Americus Reed</a> and <a href=\"https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TdJqAAK/neeru-paharia\">Neeru Paharia</a>. We'll consider how companies create a worldview around the products they sell, and then get us to make those products a part of who we are.  </p><p><i>If you like this show, be sure to listen to the other episodes in this series, including </i><a href=\"https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/money-2-0-rewrite-your-money-story/\"><i>our conversation</i></a><i> about the mental scripts that shape our choices around money.</i></p><p><i>Also, check out our new podcast, </i><a href=\"https://hiddenbrain.org/myunsunghero/\"><i>My Unsung Hero</i></a><i>!
