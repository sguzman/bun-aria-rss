    "media:description": "It's November. You know what that means. Completely ignore Thanksgiving and bust out those Christmas decorations and cover your home in holiday cheer before you cozy up next to a fire to relive your childhood while Tim Allen reprises his iconic role in The Santa Clauses on Disney Plus. And if that's not enough nostalgia for you, why not check out the brand new comedy series Blockbuster, where comedian Randall Park works at the last remaining store of the once bustling video rental chain.",
