  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including how the National Hockey League's Carolina Hurricanes are responding to the criticism of Hockey Night in Canada announcer Don Cherry. The analyst called the players ``a bunch of jerks'' for their post-game celebrations that began with the team skating down the ice and slamming into the glass. Traditionally, teams would gather at center ice and raise their sticks. The team's celebrations have included a Viking clap, and a simulated bowling game, a limbo line and duck, duck, goose.  Also discussed is Major League Baseball's deal with Sportradar, which is providing the league's official data to betting houses. Also talked about is baseball's deal with the Atlantic League, which will experiment with rules changes that might include robot umpires. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-WilliamsProducer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
