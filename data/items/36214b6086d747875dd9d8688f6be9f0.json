  "description": "This week we decided to experiment with the format of this podcast. We decided to wear wireless lav mics and walk around Venice beach answering the questions that you put in the reviews of our show. The idea came from a conversation we had about \"Daily Vlogging\" in podcast form and what that would be like, we thought it would be interesting to hear what it sounded like to go through daily life with a mic on. \nLet us know what you think about this episode and of this format, you can tweet at us @colinandsamir and you can also rate & review our podcast. Feel free to leave a question in our reviews and we will answer it on a future episode. \nWe reference a YouTube video in this episode about a book that became the number 1 best seller on Amazon - here's the link to that video: https://youtu.be/_DRsu5Cv3O0\n- Colin and Samir",
