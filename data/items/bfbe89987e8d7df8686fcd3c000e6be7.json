  "description": "<p>The Hannah House in Indianapolis, Indiana was the family home of Alexander Hannah. This home was meant to be a place of refuge for runaway slaves along the Underground Railroad. Tragedy struck when a lantern that a group of the formerly enslaved people were using tipped over. A fire erupted and they were trapped in their hiding place and none survived. Their bodies were more than likely buried on the property. This event has led to hauntings in what is now a museum. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Hannah House. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by John Michaels and features the oldest drawing of a ghost in Babylon and This Month in History features OK entering the national vernacular. Our location was suggested by Ed Jones and Sarah Silver. </p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br />  <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2022/02/hgb-ep-425-hannah-house.html  <br /> Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>Music used in this episode: </p> <p>Main Theme: Lurking in the Dark by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>(Moment in Oddity) Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4578-vanishing<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>(This Month in History) In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3906-in-your-arms<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>Outro Music: Happy Fun Punk by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Long Winter's Night by Steve Glozer</p>",
