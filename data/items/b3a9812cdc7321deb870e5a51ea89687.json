This paper aims to outline Putin's short-term goal: to disrupt the NATO alliance by weaponizing inflation. Putin is choking the European fuel supply as a response to various economic sanctions; however, the European Union is working towards finding alternatives. The commission is establishing a network of scientists working to find energy alternatives and increase the efficiency of their nuclear reactors. Putin is also working toward his long-term goal of disrupting US hegemony by skirting the SWIFT system. The US government has abolished the Russian financial institutions from its enhancedfinancial messaging system, with companies like Google Pay, PayPal, etc., exiting the Russian market. Russia is developing alternate methods by employing a vast network of programmers to develop an alternative to the SWIFT System and various currency swap agreements. Putin is employing a short-term and long-term strategy to establish a multipolar order and reinvigorate Russia's global standing.\n  \n\n  \n   "
