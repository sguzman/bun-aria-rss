It also grows on the Pelješac Peninsula and on Brač and Hvar, and other islands</p> <ul> <li>The wine is aromatic, herbal, grassy, and acidic. Can be oaked, aged on the lees, huge styles, passito for region’s traditional sweet wine Prošek</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Debit</strong> is like minerally Sauvignon Blanc but with more lime than grapefruit flavor. With oak age this wine can be like a medium bodied Chardonnay.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Maraština</strong> is dry and full-bodied with peach, nut, and floral aromas and a full, viscous texture.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Vugava:</strong> Mostly found on island of Vis in central Dalmatia, which has steep hillsides.</p> <ul> <li>The grape is similar to the Rhône Valley’s Viognier –it can get overripe and its lovely notes of apricot, honey, and flowers can verge on excessive, especially when accompanied by high alcohol and low acidity.

Both ripen to very high alcohol and have problems with uneven ripening, which makes them difficult to grow.</li> <li><strong>Differences with Zinfandel:</strong> Plavac Mali is denser and heavier than Zinfandel and can have more black cherry flavors and more tannin.

It is grown Northern Dalmatia, NE of Split, some on the island of Korčula</p> <ul> <li>The grape is related to Dobričić so it is also a relative of Plavac Mali</li> <li>The wines are full bodied, herbal, acidic, with cherry notes, soft tannins, and lower alcohol levels</li> </ul> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Teran</strong>: Grown in <strong>Istria</strong>, this lighter style, thin-skinned grape was grown in Istria for centuries, replaced with French varieties but is making a comeback</p> <ul> <li>The wines have good acidity and tannin.
