It's all down to how Public Health England estimates the size of different populations. \n\nThe Office for National Statistics described 2020 as \"the deadliest year in a century\". Now that we're more than two-thirds into 2021, we examine how this year is shaping up. We answer your questions on the new health and social care levy, and have words of congratulations and caution following Emma Raducanu's astonishing win in the US Open.
