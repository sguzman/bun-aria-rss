Instead, he complained about OP's house and sent OP links to other houses for OP to buy that are more suitable for his tastes. So, one free house wasn't enough for this choosing beggar. He wants to choose a different, nicer free place to stay! If you like this content, follow my podcast for more daily Reddit episodes!</p>\n",
