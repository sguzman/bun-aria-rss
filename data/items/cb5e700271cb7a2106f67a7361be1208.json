  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys chat about the all the big news stories happening in the NFL including Khalil Mack being traded to the Chargers for a 2nd and 6th round pick, what the latest on the Deshaun Watson situation is and if we'll get any more clarity after today's hearings, which remaining free agent QB's will end up where, what to expect when the legal tampering period begins and Monday, and much more. Joining the program is a Stanley Cup Champion, 16 year NHL veteran, former Head Coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins, current color commentator for the NHL on TNT, and friend of the show, Eddie Olczyk. Pat and Eddie chat about what he's been up to, if the Pittsburgh Penguins are currently the best team in the NHL, a few incredible stories, and more (29:11-49:18). Next, Super Bowl Champion, 48th overall pick of the 1994 NFL Draft, NFL Network Analyst, co-host of the Move The Sticks podcast, fresh off a week in Indianapolis at the NFL Scouting Combine, Bucky Brooks joins the progrum. Pat, Bucky, and AJ chat about the prospects that really flashed in Indianapolis, who stole the show, the Quarterback play at the combine and why that might have motivated teams to get their Quarterback affairs in order elsewhere, if the athletes coming into the league are going to continue to get faster and stronger, and more (1:03:25-1:18:52). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show and listen on Sirius XM Channel 82, Mad Dog Radio.
