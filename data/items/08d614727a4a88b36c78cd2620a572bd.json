Northrop Grumman’s 18th contracted cargo resupply mission with NASA to the International Space Station will deliver more than 8,000 pounds of science and research, crew supplies and vehicle hardware to the orbital laboratory and its crew.

The Cygnus spacecraft will be filled with over 8,000 pounds of supplies for the crew and scientific experiments to be conducted in the microgravity environment of the space station. Carried by an Antares rocket, the Cygnus for this mission has been named Sally Ride in honor of the <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/space/sally-ride-womens-history-month/\">American spaceflight pioneer</a>.</p>\n<p>The weather is looking promising for the launch, with <a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/ng-crs-18/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">NASA sharing</a> that there is 80% favorable conditions in the area. There is &#8220;a slight chance of low-level clouds that may potentially violate cloud ceiling requirements,&#8221; NASA writes, but the generally warm and calm conditions are good news for the planned launch.</p>\n<h2>How to watch the launch</h2>\n<p>The launch of the cargo mission will be livestreamed on NASA TV. You can tune into coverage beginning at 5:30 a.m. ET (2:30 a.m. PT) on Sunday, November 6, either by using the video embedded near the top of this page or by heading directly to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">NASA&#8217;s Live channel on YouTube</a>. The launch itself is scheduled for 5:50 a.m. ET (2:50 a.m. PT).</p>\n<p>The cargo craft will travel to the space station throughout Sunday and Monday and is scheduled to arrive early on the morning of Tuesday, November 8. Coverage of its arrival and capture will begin on NASA TV at 4:30 a.m. ET (1:30 a.m. PT) on Tuesday, with coverage of the installation of the craft to the ISS beginning at 7:30 a.m. ET (4:30 a.m. PT).</p>\n",
