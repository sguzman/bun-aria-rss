  "description": "As part of our special Mother's Day Bald and the Beautiful Extravaganza, we are so excited to welcome Trixie's Mom to the show. Folks, this is like a Jerry Springer episode on steroids. We're talking extreme drug addiction, baby mamas, aliens, cults, and secret second families in Canada. In all honesty, Trixie and her Mom both led shockingly well-adjusted lives and love each other very much. But they do talk about edibles, familial drama, and Trixie's Mom getting hit on whilst in drag. So it's not all rainbows and ponies, people. (but it is very touching at times, which is disgusting)\n\nFollow Trixie: @TrixieMattel\nFollow Katya: @Katya_Zamo\n\nTo listen to our podcast on YouTube: http://bit.ly/TBATBYT \n\n\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the podcast for free wherever you're listening or by using this link: http://bit.ly/baldandthebeautifulpodcast\n\n\nIf you want to support the show, and get all the episodes ad-free go to https://thebaldandthebeautiful.supercast.com/\n\n\nIf you like the show, telling a friend about it would be helpful!
