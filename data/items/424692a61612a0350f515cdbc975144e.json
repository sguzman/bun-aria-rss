  "description": "Hey beautiful Listener! We're back with Part 2 of The Sky Is Everywhere by Jandy Nelson. Gah! It's so beautiful! In the second half we get to see these two crazy kids get together, break up, and come back to each other. And a ton of this occurs on a whimsical forest bed! \n Bonus Content: doodles, more HS band hot takes, the logistics of a forest bed, cathartically slashing up a battered copy of Wuthering Heights, Tennessee Williams, and Jandy's follow up to this novel: a standalone thriller about a criminally voyeuristic innkeeper. Look, when we come up with ideas, they're just GOLD. \n Lady Loves: \n Melody: I got a  NEW BRA! \n Erin: Find the corner of tiktok where you get thirst videos of old-timey men. Maybe try #paulnewman or #marlonbrando and teach the algorithm to treat you right. \n Episode sponsor: Sierra Simone's SAINT, the third full-length standalone in the PRIEST universe. It comes out on 9/7/2021. She promises more angst, more red hot sex, and more elevating the profane to the sacred than ever before! And if you're a Heaving Bosoms patron at the $10 tier and up, you get a free advance copy! \n Check out https://www.rimandab.com/links (The Rosecast)! It's one of Melody's favorite podcasts recapping the Bachelor franchise. These long-distance best friends give me big HB vibes, if you replace our raunchy shenanigans with two sports-loving, good dudes. \n Patreon Shout Out: \n Andi M., you are descended from Lilith, one of the most ancient mystical figures in Judeo-Christian lore. She’s now known as the dark moon goddess in astrology and is associated with uncontrollable feminine vitality. Andi, you’re respected and revered in part because Lilith has always been so feared by the patriarchy. Anyone that ancient men deem demonic, I see as a badass of antiquity who had to be vilified lest she overpower them. So, you continue owning your sexuality, relying on the prudence and wisdom of your intuition, and being courageous in your demands of the world. That’s all Lilith asks. \n Subscribe! Rate! Review!
