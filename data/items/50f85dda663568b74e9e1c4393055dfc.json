  "description": "You may know Asha Rangappa as the witty, brilliant legal & national security analyst that graces your television screens on CNN. But, I know her as my tap dancing, french fry loving snark sister.  What makes Asha's voice so important in today's political conversation is her trailblazing career and unique experience; she's one of the first Indian Americans to work FBI counterintelligence. She brings a breadth of knowledge and perspective that is so needed in today's dialogue. We discuss Mueller (insert heavenly singing), intelligence careers, our favorite theater roles (cause of course she's a thespian) and we tap dance. Yup, we throw down! So tune in for the espionage & Trump dumpster fire talk, but stay for the tap dancing.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
