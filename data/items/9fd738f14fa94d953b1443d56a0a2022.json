  "description": "I meet Mary Koval at her booth of antique quilts at one of the shows. I’ve always loved stopping in to see what type of quilts she has found. Mary also has a shop and retreat center in Beford PA. Her fabric lines are based on Antiques, can’t wait to hear about the newest!\n-----\nI meet Angela Huffman of Quilted Joy when we were both doing demos for a long arm company. She was traveling, running her business and raising her triplets. Angela taught me a lot about longarming and working a business your own way. She now has a beautiful shop and you can visit her!\n------\nI love finding fresh new creative designs by quilt makers. Kristina Brinkerhoff of Center Street Quilts is creating amazing and fun design after design! She has a cool way of using checkerboards in her quilt that is next on my list to do.\n================\nvisit American Patchwork & Quilting at http://allpeoplequilt.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/apqmagazine\nPat's Facebook group - https://www.facebook.com/groups/QuiltWithPatSloan/\nVisit host Pat Sloan at http://www.patsloan.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.
