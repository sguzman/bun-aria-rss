  "title": "Richard Jefferson, Kentucky Derby, NBA Playoffs, S8E4 GoT Recap",
  "description": "<p><p>Kentucky Derby ends in controversy and somehow gets political (2:27 - 12:01). NBA Playoffs are awesome. Celtics struggling to flip the switch, Steph gets stuffed by the rim, Kawhi is basketball robot, and Magic Johnson helps us make sense of the Nugs/Blazers (12:01 - 25:10). Embrace Debate for the NHL Playoffs (25:10 - 28:19). Who's back of the week (28:19 - 42:04). Zero time NBA All Star/Bronze Medal Winner Richard Jefferson joins the show to talk about the playoffs, how he dealt with refs that wanted to control the game, Kyrie as a team leader, and Kevin Durant being the most unguardable player of all time (42:04 - 62:04). Segments include \"No Swag Off\" for the New York Giants, Tim Tebow Update, Lebron Update, Monday Reading \"my wife hung out with an athlete but didn't have sex\" and the dumbest Game of Thrones recap on the internet (starts at 82:23).Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
