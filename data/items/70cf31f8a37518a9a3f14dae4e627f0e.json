  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, as was shared on this program last year the letter from the National School Boards Association (NSBA) was an inside job. New information from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request reveals that Education Secretary Miguel Cardona appears to have solicited the letter from the NSBA comparing concerned parents to domestic terrorists and using the Department of Justice to investigate them using the Patriot Act. The Department of Justice has now established a Domestic Terrorist Unit. Then, in addition to bare grocery shelves, the cereal boxes at the supermarket are promoting gender fluidity and the left's woke attack on your children. Similarly, the left maintains that there was absolutely no fraud in the 2020 elections. It is a known fact that Marc Elias led a group of lawyers to extra-constitutionally change voting laws. It is also a known fact that Mark Zuckerberg funneled $400 million to a bunch of front groups to influence the 2020 election. Later, President Biden hypocritically gives a speech attacking Republicans for voter suppression and trashes the very voting system that got him elected. Interestingly, he's not getting banned by any social media or news organizations. Afterward, Sen. Rand Paul grills Anthony Fauci in a Senate hearing over the origins of the Wuhan lab leak. Fauci vehemently denied any involvement and accused Sen. Paul of attacking him personally, instead of offering answers on how America will beat this pandemic and asked for additional time.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
