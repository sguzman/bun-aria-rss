  "description": "<p><em><strong>Faithful vs. Effective</strong></em>. Two words we possibly misunderstand or misapply to our lives, our 'calling,' and our relationships to both God and one another. Today, Tim hijacks the conversation to ask Mike about fighting back against a religious right that is looking to emulate Hungary and seize more governmental power in order to mandate morality. It is a very raw conversation. Tim is struggling with the 'focus on your community' approach and asks Mike about staying idle when people are being harmed in God's name. How far does staying on your cross extend? What is the actual cruciform posture? If we aren't meant to also seize power to help, what are we supposed to do? Do we allow people like Floridian governor Ron DeSantis to bastardize and weaponize scripture to rile up his religious base? Sean Feucht?? What was Jesus's approach? What of the early church? As Howard Zinn posited, can we not stay neutral on a moving train?</p>\n<p>The NYTimes article referenced can be read here: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/magazine/viktor-orban-rod-dreher.html\"><em><strong>How the American Right Fell in Love With Hungary</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
