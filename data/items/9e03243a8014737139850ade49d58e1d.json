  "description": "<p>Becoming a manager can be a triumphant milestone of working life. It’s often a recognition of leadership and, in the tech industry, technical skill. Many argue those skills necessarily become casualties to the management track. But it’s hard to let go of your creative side to make room for managing others. Can they do both? Should managers code? It’s an old question that never seems to receive a clear answer. <br /><br />From the Red Hat offices to the moons of Jupiter, <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/compiler-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Compiler</a> explores why it’s such a complex issue. We spoke with Red Hatters who are vocal about what role, if any, managers have in the code base—and why they fight to keep their hands on keys for as long as they can. <br /> </p>\n",
