  "description": "Could DAOs, or \"decentralized autonomous organizations,\" be the key to building the next great city? Experimental urbanist Scott Fitsimones shares how these mission-driven, blockchain-governed, collectively owned organizations could increase the speed and efficiency of building cities (among many other applications) -- all while pooling decision-making power in a radically collaborative way. Hear about how he started a \"crypto co-op\" that bought 40 acres of land in Wyoming and learn more about the potential for DAOs to get things done in the future.",
