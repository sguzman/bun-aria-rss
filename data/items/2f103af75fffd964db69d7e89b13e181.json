  "description": "Hello - hei! My name is Dag and I'd like to welcome you to One Minute Norwegian from the Radio Lingua Network. In this podcast I'm going to be teaching you the basics of Norwegian. The great thing about this language course is that you'll be learning all you need to know in just 60 seconds - or thereabouts! Each one minute language lesson will equip you with just enough Norwegian to help you get by in lots of situations, either on holiday, or on a business trip to Norway, or just to impress your Norwegian-speaking friends or colleagues. Our course will be starting very soon. In the meantime, visit our website on http://www.oneminutelanguages.com",
