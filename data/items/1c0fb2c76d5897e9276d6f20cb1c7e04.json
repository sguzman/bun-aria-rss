  "title": "Episode 151: The Mysterious Death of Tamla Horsford",
  "description": "Well, we have another mishandled case for you weirdos. The 2018 death of Tamla Horsford is tragic but it is also wildly suspicious. This 40 year old, mother of 5 was found face down in a back yard after attending an adult sleepover. Her injuries were varied and seemingly unexplainable for a fall from a second floor balcony. What makes this worse is the fact that this took place in Forsyth County, Georgia, a place with a documented history of racial prejudice. The case was quickly closed and called an accident despite several pieces of evidence pointing to something more sinister. Now, in 2020, Tamla's case has been officially reopened and what happened on that evening in November 2018 may finally come to light. <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://justicefortam.org/docs/bridget-fuller/\" target=\"_blank\">Links to interview transcripts</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/09/15/494063372/the-racial-cleansing-that-drove-1-100-black-residents-out-of-forsyth-county-ga\" target=\"_blank\"><br>\n1912 \"Racial Cleansing\" of Forsyth County</a><br>\n<br>\nMORE LINKS:<br>\n<a href=\"https://sandrarose.com/2019/02/tamla-horsfords-autopsy-shows-she-suffered-broken-neck-traumatic-brain-injuries/\" target=\"_blank\">https://sandrarose.com/2019/02/tamla-horsfords-autopsy-shows-she-suffered-broken-neck-traumatic-brain-injuries/</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1460408616659683\" target=\"_blank\">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1460408616659683</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/mynews/cumming/the-attorney-representing-the-family-of-tamla-horsford-says-the-evidence-suggests-tamla-was-involved-in-a-struggle-and-the-investigation-was-compromi/85-b2896eb3-8482-478d-8601-d30e7f9d9e29\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/mynews/cumming/the-attorney-representing-the-family-of-tamla-horsford-says-the-evidence-suggests-tamla-was-involved-in-a-struggle-and-the-investigation-was-compromi/85-b2896eb3-8482-478d-8601-d30e7f9d9e29</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.patheos.com/blogs/raceandgrace/2019/02/questions-remain-about-tamla-horsfords-mysterious-death/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.patheos.com/blogs/raceandgrace/2019/02/questions-remain-about-tamla-horsfords-mysterious-death/</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.patheos.com/blogs/raceandgrace/2019/02/questions-remain-about-tamla-horsfords-mysterious-death/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.patheos.com/blogs/raceandgrace/2019/02/questions-remain-about-tamla-horsfords-mysterious-death/</a><br>\n<br>\nThanks to our sponsors!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Daily Harvest<br>\n</strong>Go to <a href=\"http://DailyHarvest.com\" target=\"_blank\">DailyHarvest.com</a> and enter promo code MORBID to get twenty-five dollars off your first box! <br>\n<strong><br>\nGrubhub<br>\n</strong>Just for our listeners, if you download the Grubhub app you’ll get $10 off your order of $30 or more every day from participating restaurants.
