  "description": "<p><p>On this special edition of Zero Blog Thirty, Uncle Chaps and Captain Cons travel to the nation's capital to interview Seth Moulton, who represents not only Massachusetts in the House of Representatives, but the Marine Corps as well. The boys talk to Seth about balancing being a Marine and a politician, respecting the American flag, and that time he let an Iraqi TV station broadcast Basic Instinct (spoiler,,, it went actually bad). Chaps and Cons also discuss Donald Trump's recent mishap with Sean Hannity, and that the Army is changing their uniforms AGAIN. All this and more on ZBT!</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
