  "description": "<div>Sam Leith's guest in this week’s Book Club is Ian McEwan – whose latest novel <em>Lessons</em> draws on his own biography to imagine an 'alternative life' for himself. He tells Sam about what drew him, in his late career, to using autobiography; about why there’s no contradiction in combining realism with metafiction; about the importance of sex; the rise of cancel culture – and why literary fiction by 'comfortable white men of a certain age' may have had its day, but he’s not complaining.</div>\n",
