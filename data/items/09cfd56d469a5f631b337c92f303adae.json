The folks at Mogul are going to tell you Reggie’s story — his early days growing up a hip-hop head in Brooklyn, his time as a lawyer representing legendary artists like Jay-Z and Dame Dash and his reinvention as Combat Jack, hip hop’s flagship podcaster.\nSubscribe to Mogul on Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
