  "description": "<p>A true force of nature, today's guest needs little introduction. Meet <strong>Ingrid Newkirk.</strong></p><p>The original doyenne of animal activism, Ingrid is the legendary and infamous co-founder and president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a non-profit she personally shepherded into the largest animal rights organization in the world, currently boasting more than 6.5 million members and supporters.</p><p>Under Ingrid's stewardship, PETA quite literally put animal welfare on the map. Operating under the principle that animals are not ours to experiment on, eat, wear, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way, PETA has a storied and often controversial history of exposing countless acts of gruesome and horrifying animal abuse, with it's media-savvy provocateur in chief grabbing headlines and creating significant awareness, policy changes and legal protections along the way.</p><p>Named a top businessperson of the year by <em>Forbes,</em> Ingrid has&nbsp;been profiled in countless publications -- including twice by <em>The New Yorker -- </em>and&nbsp;has&nbsp;appeared in seemingly every prominent media outlet including the <em>Today Show, The Oprah Winfrey Show, Larry King, Politically Incorrect, Crossfire,</em> <em>Nightline</em>, and <em>60 Minutes.</em></p><p>Irrespective of your opinions about PETA, Ingrid is someone who has dedicated every breath to what she believes in. Combating injustice. Taking action to change what many of us simply want to deny or avoid. Looking suffering straight in the eye. And doing something about it.&nbsp;</p><p>That level of purpose -- the courage to speak truth to power, tenacity to weather persistent criticism and stay the course for change -- is rare. It's impressive and laudable.</p><p>Behind it all, there is an undeniable sincerity to Ingrid. A fascinating, complex, and charismatic character, she’s also deeply sensitive. Quite self-aware. And surprisingly funny. Today Ingrid shares her story.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>This conversation was recorded pre-pandemic on February 18, 2020. Therefore there is no coronavirus discussion. However, I think Ingrid's message is profoundly of the moment given the undeniable role animal agriculture plays in fomenting disease.</p><p>The visually inclined can watch it all go down on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/ingridnewkirk516\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube.</a>&nbsp;And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpitunes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpspotify\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify.</a></p><p>In this moment of forced repose, my hope is that we reflect on humanity's misguided entitlement to dominion over all things. Our intelligence is not the gauge of the animal kingdom. And our relationship with the living beings with whom we share this imperiled planet is broken.</p><p>Ingrid is here to recalibrate that relationship.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><p>Rich</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
