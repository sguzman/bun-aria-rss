  "description": "<p>Kirk was assaulted on his morning run. That's his story and he's sticking to it... The Warden of the North has found new audio from S.E. Robinson's old battles with Thom Hartmann (0:31:40). The MLB investigation into the Red Sox cheating scandal has, predictably, thrown some unknown underling under the bus, while exonerating Alex Cora and the front office. There are plenty of questions worth asking, but you won't get that from the Boston media. (0:45:10). NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh both find ways to sound like buffoons in the middle of the coronavirus crisis. Erika K. Nardini joins the show for a heated fight with Kirk.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
