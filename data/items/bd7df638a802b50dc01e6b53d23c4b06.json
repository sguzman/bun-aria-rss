  "description": "<p>On the first Battles & Banter episode of 2022, Avery takes a solo look at one of the more overlooked and significant U.S. victories from the American Civil War: The Battle of Mill Springs. Also known as the Battle of Logan's Crossroads, the engagement that took place in southeastern Kentucky on that rainy day of January 19th, 1862, marked the first major land victory for the North. Not only did it put General George H. Thomas on the map as a reliable U.S. commander, but it opened the gates for the Federal forces to invade Tennessee and led to the more famous battles of Forts Henry and Donelson a few weeks later. Join Avery as he summarizes the battle and its significance and lays out the upcoming plan for the 2022 BnB schedule. Enjoy!</p>",
