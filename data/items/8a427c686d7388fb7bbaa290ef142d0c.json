  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Michelle Obama is once again complaining about the persecution she has suffered as a black woman in America. She’s not alone. LeBron James, Oprah Winfrey, Meghan Markle and other black millionaires and billionaires have all frequently complained about our racist system of white privilege. Today we will reflect on their stories. Also Five Headlines including Dr. Fauci finally giving a definitive date for when we can return to normal. It’s a year away. And the CIA doubles down, releasing yet another woke ad. Plus, Sarah Silverman comes after Caitlyn Jenner, proving a few points that I will explain today. And in our Daily Cancellation, we will consider the story of the rapper who was shot and killed by a 15 year old boy for his Rolex watch. What should we say about a man who promotes street violence and then dies by it? Well, we can say a lot, and I will today, and it will make people very mad. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
