  "description": "<p>Today we talk about the tragic accident that took the life of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins while working on the set of the movie “Rust” in New Mexico.&nbsp;Hutchins was accidentally shot during a scene rehearsal by actor Alec Baldwin who had been handed what he thought was a “cold” gun, which discharged as he was practicing drawing the weapon from his holster.

Jon has worked on projects such as J.A.G., Punisher, NCIS, and Criminal Minds. Details are still emerging, and many questions still need answering but one thing is for sure — Halyna was failed miserably by many people who’s job it was to keep her, and everyone else on the set, safe.
