  "description": "In this episode, Sharon chats with Professor Nick Seabrook, who has written a new book, <em>One Person, One Voice</em>, that details the long history of gerrymandering in the United States. While gerrymandering predates our country, Professor Seabrook argues that it’s a bigger problem today than it has been in the past because we have more sophisticated access to data and technology. This access has flipped the script, and politicians are choosing their voters instead of voters choosing their politicians. Join the conversation as Sharon and Professor Seabrook talk about how we got here--the myths, the history, and what we can do to slow this threat to democracy.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
