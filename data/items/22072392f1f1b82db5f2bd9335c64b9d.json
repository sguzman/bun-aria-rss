But, at the same time, we also saw rising levels of debt. This week, Phil Dobbie asks Steve Keen how you can have rising savings and debt at the same time. If you have spare cash sitting in your bank account, wouldn’t you use it to pay off your debts. The fact that people are not doing that tells us something about the state of the economy. And where did all these extra savings come from anyway?
