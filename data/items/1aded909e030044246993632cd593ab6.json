  "description": "<p>We are joined on this episode by Assistant Producer Steven Pappas and he shares his experiences as well as the history and supernatural experiences at Old Salem in North Carolina. When most people think of cities in North Carolina, they think of Charlotte or Raleigh. These are the state's two sprawling metropolises and home to many large industries. What most people don't think about is a city mid-way between the two and that is Winston-Salem. Winston-Salem is a town that is not only the home to the headquarters of some large companies such as Texas Pete and RJ Reynolds, but also has a rich history which began as a religious settlement in Old Salem that is still standing 250 years after being established. The town of Old Salem is considered to be an archaeological site. This is a place where people put down roots, and it seems some spirits may have as well. Come with us as we explore the history and the hauntings of Old Salem, North Carolina. The Moment in Oddity features Violet Jessop as suggested by Bob Sherfield and This Day in History features the first Mardi Gras in New Orleans by Jessica Bell.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and Matt's creepy ghost picture can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/02/hgb-podcast-ep-108-haunted-old-salem.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/02/hgb-podcast-ep-108-haunted-old-salem.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer and help us produce more content: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
