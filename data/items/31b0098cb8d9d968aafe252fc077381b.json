  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Ben Ferguson of WREC fills in for Mark. We’re 50 days into the Biden administration, and we’ve got a border crisis, skyrocketing gas prices, stagnant unemployment rates, rising opioid deaths, and back into wars in the Middle East. Our schools are still shut down but our borders are wide open, with more kids in cages than ever before. The $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill is paid for by us; the government just robbed us so we can get 9 cents for every dollar spent, and we’re supposed to say thank you. In his news conference, Joe Biden said he might give us the right to celebrate the 4th of July with our families in our backyards. It’s insane if you believe government can allow you to celebrate a holiday. If Biden wants us to get vaccines, he can’t give us conditions on what we can and can’t do afterward. Also, Andrew Cuomo is now an outsider to the Democrat insider family, just like in the Godfather movies he’s out of the circle. None of this is about the sexual assault allegations, but politics and figuring out what they’re supposed to say. This isn’t about right and wrong or cleaning things up for the left, but to take his power.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
