  "description": "<p>r/Choosingbeggars In today's episode, OP attends a wedding and leaves her prescription drugs in her purse in a private room. That was apparently a stupid a mistake, because one of the wedding guests breaks into her room, steals her prescription drugs, and then approaches OP to ask if she has any other drugs that he can steal. Normally I'd think someone like this is a moron, but in this case he's probably just high as a kite. If you like this content, follow for more daily Reddit content!</p>\n",
