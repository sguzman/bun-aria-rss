  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 11/02/22",
  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, as usual, Democrats are spreading disinformation about violence and trying to pin it on Republicans. Yet, the media is silent about it. To what extent are the Democrats and the left within the media responsible for spreading violence for failing to do their jobs objectively? Then, President Biden makes a political speech days before the midterms. He ignored inflation, but he promoted his big lie that the attack on Nancy Pelosi was somehow related to January 6th, instead of putting the blame on a drug-addicted, mentally ill illegal alien nudist with a history of leftwing activism. The Democrats do this because they cannot run on their records of impoverishing the citizenry and affirmatively supporting violent criminals to remain on the street. Later, Michigan Gubernatorial Candidate Tudor Dixon calls in with a quick update from the campaign trail on her plan to restore education in Michigan and return power to the people. Afterward, Arizona US Senate candidate Blake Masters joins the show to remind us how the media and the Democrats work hand-in-hand to advance their common political goals. Masters says the Republican ticket in Arizona is united. Finally, Nevada US Senate candidate Adam Laxalt, former State Attorney General of Nevada, checks in with a report on his race against Sen. Castro-Masto. Laxalt says that the era of rubber stamps for Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer must end. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
