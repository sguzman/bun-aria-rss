Unhappy with their representation in state legislature, the Appalachian communities in the Northwestern part of Virginia took advantage of Virginia’s secession during the Civil War to apply for their own statehood. Sharon and Annie talk about what makes West Virginia unique in its geography, culture, and history and why it has been sued multiple times by more than one of its neighboring states.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
