  "description": "#294: Vitamin E: How To Cultivate Equanimity Amidst Political Chaos | Election Sanity Series | Roshi Joan Halifax\nIt’s part four in our Election Sanity series. Throughout October, we have been trying to help you stay engaged in current events without losing your mind. As you know, we’ve been drawing on an ancient Buddhist list called The Four Brahma Viharas, which are four mental skills that can be enormously useful. Over the last three episodes, we’ve taken deep dives into loving-kindness (or friendliness), compassion (or giving a crap), and sympathetic joy (the opposite of schadenfreude). This week, it’s equanimity, the secret sauce that allows you to apply to aforementioned skills in difficult times. Our guest this week is perfect for this subject, precisely because she freely admits that equanimity -- which she calls “vitamin E” -- doesn’t come easily for her. Roshi Joan Halifax is a Buddhist teacher, Zen priest, anthropologist, and pioneer in the field of end-of-life care. She’s been passionately politically engaged for much of her life-- and, as you will hear, she doesn’t hold back on her own personal views, even as she calls for extending respect to people with whom we disagree. Wherever you stand politically, this interview is filled with practical advice for cultivating equanimity without going dull.\nQuick reminder before we dive in: our Free Election Sanity meditation challenge starts in the Ten Percent Happier app TOMORROW, you can join the challenge right now by downloading the Ten Percent Happier app and be ready for day 1 of the challenge tomorrow. We're really excited about this Challenge. We designed it specifically to meet you in this moment and help you lean into the commotion of the election, without getting burnt out or overwhelmed. To join the Challenge, just download the Ten Percent Happier app today. See you in there.\nThis interview was recorded on October 7, 2020.\nWhere to find Roshi Joan Halifax online:\nWebsite: https://www.upaya.org/about/roshi/\nSocial Media:\n•   Twitter: https://twitter.com/jhalifax\n•   Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/joan.halifax\nOther Resources Mentioned:\n•   Shantideva: https://www.shambhala.com/authors/o-t/shantideva.html\n•   Thich Nhat Hanh: https://plumvillage.org/about/thich-nhat-hanh/biography/\n•   Angela Davis: https://www.biography.com/activist/angela-davis\n•   Eli Pariser: https://www.elipariser.org/\n•   Kazuaki Tanahashi: https://www.brushmind.net/\n•   Eight Worldly Winds: https://www.lionsroar.com/buddhism-by-the-numbers-the-eight-worldly-concerns/\n•   Uchiyama Roshi: https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/506986.Kosho_Uchiyama\nFull Shownotes: https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/joan-halifax-294\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
