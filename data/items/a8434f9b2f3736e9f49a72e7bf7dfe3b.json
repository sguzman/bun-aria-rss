  "description": "<p>On Alasdair MacIntyre's <em>After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory</em> (1981), mostly ch. 3-7 and 14-17. What justifies ethical claims? MacIntyre claims that no modern attempt to ground ethics has worked, and that's because we've abandoned Aristotle. We see facts and values as fundamentally different: the things science discovers vs. these weird things that have nothing to do with science. In Aristotle's teleological view, everything comes with built-in goals, so just as a plant will aim grow green and healthy, people have a definite kind of virtue towards which we do and should naturally strive. <a href= \"http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/07/05/ep59-macintyre-citizen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the full discussion at partiallyexaminedlife.com.</a></p>",
