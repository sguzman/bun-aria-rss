  "title": "Spittin' Chiclets Episode 83: Conference Finals Preview",
  "description": "<p><p>On this week's Friday episode, the guys open up with the just-concluded Game 7 in which Winnipeg beat Nashville to advance to the Western Conference Finals. They discuss the chintzy neutral zone stick foul that essentially ended the game, whether each team was somewhat desensitized to the road atmosphere due to their own home atmosphere, what the difference in the series was, and more. Next, they preview the Washington/Tampa and Vegas/Winnipeg series with positional breakdowns provided by each guy, series odds (real and speculated), and predictions for the penultimate round of the playoffs. The show closes with a wild interview with the angel investor for the upcoming Barstool Sports documentary series \"Biz Does B.C.\" that explains exactly how our guy Biz got bankrolled. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
