  "description": "<div>Covid has put a spotlight on housing in Britain - the inequalities, the challenges, but also the opportunities. As what we want out of our homes, offices, and even the high street, changes, public policy will have to follow suit. So how do we create sustainable towns and cities that ensure quality and access for all?<br>\n<br>\nKate Andrews is joined by Christopher Pincher, Minister for Housing, Iqbal Hamiduddin, Associate Professor at the Bartlett School of Planning at the UCL, and Kath Fontana, President of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).<br>\n<br>\nSponsored by RICS.</div>\n",
