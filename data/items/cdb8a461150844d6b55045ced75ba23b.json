  "description": "BDSM means six things: Bondage and Discipline, Dominance and Submission, and Sadism and Masochism. My guest, fellow sex podcaster Sex Nerd Sandra, and I are ironing out the kinks in your relationship, whether you’re new to the BDSM or waiting for the perfect time to whip out the ropes and assless leather. First, we discuss women having less orgasms than men during one-night-stands. SHOCKER. We talk about why women aren’t orgasming like crazy, and why some guys don't know how to please women... yet. I know guys talk about their penis a lot, but how often do they talk to their friends about how to pleasure a woman? Le sigh, if only all women could orgasm at the drop of a hat or click of a camera. Wait, there is a actually a woman who insta-orgasms when she hears the click of a camera. She must really like taking selfies. If you can’t give a woman an orgasm by whispering sweet nothings in her ear, we will tell you how to do it. Next, Sandra and I take callers and give our advice about BDSM and humping inanimate objects. Then we answer the question, should I stay with my boyfriend even though he loves me a lot more than I love him? When should you cut your ties... and when should you get tied up?
