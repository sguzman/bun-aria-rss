  "description": "“The big question of our time is less, ‘What does it mean to be American?’ than, ‘What does it mean to be white American in an age of ethnic change?’” writes Eric Kaufmann in his new book Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration, and the Future of White Majorities. \nKaufmann’s book is unusual in two respects. First, it’s explicit (and persuasive) in its argument that demographic change and the white backlash to demographic change are behind the rise of rightwing populism across the West. Second, it argues that the right response is to slow demographic change and calm the fears of white majorities.\nI think Kaufmann’s framework of what’s driving political conflict right now is correct. I have more trouble with his vision of what to do about it. But this is a book, in my view, that gets to the core debate of contemporary politics and takes it on directly. That’s why I wanted to have this conversation.\nBook recommendations:\nThe Ethnic Origins of Nationsby Anthony D. Smith\nThe Cultural Contradictions Of Capitalismby Daniel Bell\nNEXT AMERICAN NATION: The New Nationalism and the Fourth American Revolutionby Michael Lind\nLearn more about your ad choices.
