  "title": "Vegans...we need to talk with Psychologist Melanie Joy",
  "description": "In Episode 112 I sit down with Harvard-educated Psychologist and best selling author Melanie Joy to discuss how we form our beliefs about food and how vegans can have healthier, more productive, conversations with non-vegans. An episode that I believe will be highly instructive regardless of the diet that you follow.\n\nIn this episode we cover:\n\n\nMelanie's personal journey to studying Psychology at Harvard and writing her award winning book \"Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows: An Introduction to Carnism\" \n\n\nWhy our food choices matter\n\nThe carnism ideaology\n\nCarnistic defense systems and the three N's: 'Normal, Natural and Necessary\n\nEffective vegan advocacy: how to communicate better as a vegan\n\nShame vs guilt\n\nThe idea of thinking about process vs content when communicating with someone who holds a different opinion to you\n\nWhy the debate format sets us up to fail\n\nHow you can be a part of the solution\n\nWhat a 'vegan ally' is\n\nThe idea of watering the right seeds\n\nand much more\n\n\nWhile my episodes usually focus on nutrition science I found this exchange fascinating and believe many of the learnings hold true for our communication in general, whether that be related to food choices and the exploitation of animals or not. My plan is to extend this into a 3-4 part series, with Melanie to return and another high profile vegan activist in the coming months so we can continue exploring this topic together.\n\nResources:\nThe 3 minute video on Carnism created by Melanie and her team Beyond Carnism that I referred to in this conversation\nConnect with Melanie on Instagram @beyondcarnism\nCarnism.org website\nMelanie's Book Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows: An Introduction to Carnism, 10th Anniversary Edition\nThe Vegan Matrix - another book written by Melanie exploring what she believes is a serious problem with the vegan movement: unexamined privilege.\nMelanie's 2015 TedX Talk Toward Rational, Authentic Food Choices\n\nMy Book:\nMy book is coming out early 2021 published with Penguin - I cannot wait to share with you.
