The butterfly is a powerful symbol of change but more importantly, for self-transformation.

And within our cocoon, we face our own struggles. We know that through struggle comes strength and with challenge comes change. So while we're in this cocoon of our home, instead of feeding our fear, our doubts, our regrets, our loneliness, we have the opportunity to identify the thoughts that no longer serve us. Because the same level of thinking that got us where we are isn't going to get us where we need to go.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help with this transformation, I want to give you the FIVE things I'm doing while staying at home. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*** Do you want to stay up to date with every new episode and get my brand new Kwik Brain Accelerator Program?
