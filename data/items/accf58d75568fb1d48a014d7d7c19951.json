Maybe you need a full day to recover from 20 minutes on the elliptical.\n\nEither way, this one likely applies to you: tech obsession. The zeitgeist’s current fixation with new-wave, at-home, tech-enabled fitness is changing the way we define success, both in terms of personal health goals and in terms of happy business endings (read: IPOs).\n\nThis week on Business Casual, we talk to Mirror CEO Brynn Putnam to understand exactly how tech’s influence on today’s fitness startups is impacting the business world. Brynn explains…\n\nWhat about the at-home fitness business model works\n\nHow good tech and smart engineering can scale the unscalable\n\nWhy every company is fighting for a tech valuation, even if it doesn’t deserve one\n\n\nOne parting idea: Putnam thinks in-home fitness streaming devices can become the next iPhone.
