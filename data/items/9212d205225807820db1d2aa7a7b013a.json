  "description": "We know, we know. Another British Tom? YES. We had to put Tom Hardy under our microscope to examine his ability to disappear into roles like Heathcliffe from Wuthering Heights to Eames in Inception to Tuck in This Means War, one of the best worst rom-coms ever. Tom’s made some difficult choices in life but his love of dogs is pure and endearing. His raspy voice changes with every role but what remains is its intensity... and that mouth! What it do, Tom? We have a delightful Thirst Sommelier request from someone who needs a new Shia LaBeouf in their life. Fanfic Wars might burn your brain but we wouldn’t have it any other way.
