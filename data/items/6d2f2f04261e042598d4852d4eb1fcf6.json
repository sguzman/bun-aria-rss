  "description": "<p>We’ve got something very special for you this week! As many of you know, John Maxwell sets aside the last week of every year to reflect on the previous 365 days. He calls this his “Year in Review.” This annual exercise provides John the clarity to identify what he did well this past year and what he needs to improve in the year to come.</p> <p>John has talked about his week of reflection in previous episodes, but we’ve never shared an episode in which John tells you, step-by-step, his process for this exercise. Until now. This week, John walks you through his process for his Year in Review, so you can set aside time for yourself and apply this proven practice to your life.</p> <p>John has made some of his biggest life and business decisions during this week. So, we wanted to add value to you by giving you this powerful process. It’s changed John’s life, it’s changed the lives of our team members, and we believe it’ll change your life too.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Year in Review Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Review and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.johnmaxwellacademy.com/mentor-with-maxwell\">Maximum Impact Mentoring with John C.
