    "media:description": "Avatar 2 is coming out this year so I decided to rewatch the first one and see how it holds up. I remember really loving it in the theaters, but I felt very outnumbered by the lackluster response. It seemed to me, from what I heard from friends and the internet in general, is that most people didnâ€™t like it very much. Why have I heard nothing but negative stuff about this film? If its so bad, why is it getting a sequel? People say it's \"overrated\", so let's investigate.\n\nDirected by James Cameron, Avatar (2009) stars Sam Worthington as Jake Sully and Zoe Saldana as Neytiri a Na'vi Warrior. Also starring Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Giovanni Ribisi.\n\nFollow James:\nhttps://twitter.com/cinemassacre\n\nFor everything else Cinemassacre:\nhttps://cinemassacre.com/\n\n#Avatar #Avatar2 #JamesRolfe #Cinemassacre",
