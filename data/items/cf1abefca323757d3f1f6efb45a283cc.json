For this new show-within-a-show, Craig and Andrew will be reading Emily Wilson's new translation of The Odyssey a book at a time and having a more in-depth chat about it than they do about most books.</p><p>Patreon supporters get these episodes monthly, but every two months we'll combine them for general consumption. First you'll hear our introduction to the show (and the translation) and our chat about Book 1. Then our journey across the wine-dark sea continues with our episode on Books 2 & 3. Talking points for that one include rowdy town council meetings, Athena's god moments, and Poseidon slash-fiction.</p><p>Find out more about how to get these episodes monthly at <a href=\"http://patreon.com/overduepod\" target=\"_blank\">patreon.com/overduepod</a>.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
