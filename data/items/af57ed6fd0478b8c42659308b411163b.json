  "title": "Rising up to celebrate Mardi Gras 2021",
  "content": "Every year, hundreds of thousands of people gather on Oxford St to celebrate<a href=\"http://www.mardigras.org.au/\"> Sydney’s Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras</a>. While this year’s event looked a little different, the 2021 theme called on the community to <a href=\"https://www.mardigras.org.au/rise\">RISE</a> up and celebrate loudly, proudly – and safely.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Over the past 5 years, we’ve supported Mardi Gras’ vision to provide a platform for LGBTQI+ people and their allies to share stories, connect and express themselves.   We’ve provided funding to individuals, community groups and not-for-profits through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mardigras.org.au/parade-grants\">Mardi Gras Community Grants Program</a> to help organisations deliver their messages and dazzle during the parade.  These organisations have advocated across a range of issues – from sport to health and the creative arts.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Among our grantees this year are <a href=\"https://hakaforlife.org/\">Haka for Life</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CorroboreeForLife/\">Corroboree for Life</a>, two Perth-based suicide prevention organisations with a mission is to empower people to connect with culture through traditional Aboriginal dance and the Māori Haka.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"border: none; display: inline-block; height: 442px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; overflow: hidden; width: 494px;\"><img height=\"657.8604651162791\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hK8dxtpPWgdXBwqljE_DjYhCyclJ0GmNXIQ6Me5c9L2Zgxt8Chyuun4PJbAM0ZgoTahKGoBGS6jS1_OzQsLam5M3PHuJNy8oKoVaXrey210VGEeC0ZSF37ub3Y49q98KoGe91EaDfcpVVqqybP4ACB5MM4U9VuHcsGvkbu5X7R15bIiO\" style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-top: -37.95348837209302px;\" width=\"494\" /></span></div><div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-eea62488-7fff-a846-1d50-dd6e68809e41\"><span style=\"background-color: white; font-family: &quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"></span></span></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>This year, Haka for Life and Corroboree for Life paraded traditional costumes and powerfully performed Corroborees and the Haka across the Sydney Cricket Ground.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"border: none; display: inline-block; height: 468px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; overflow: hidden; width: 624px;\"><img height=\"468\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AzhUhbo6wrQ3wiJ6LDiLxW-xTiagHrYZ2D_biyXm8I5DyTrtyuvvXBKP2HrCWHf1T-OI5Qc9n-jNY1gz7iTQhf3QyizwdRwFqHl-Lt7NUja8miw13KkN3VtM0svn97Tl3ts64rto349PxUmMRZugtxyu76YU7aQSNPXTMccqc_JoFC2A\" style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\" width=\"624\" /></span></div><div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-6dd4f417-7fff-d3fb-f86a-026d8d23249c\"><span style=\"background-color: white; font-family: &quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"></span></span></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>We’re delighted to award grants to many other LGBTQI+ focused organisations, representing trans, regional and indigenous communities (and more).&nbsp; This includes:&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://www.antra.org.au/\">ANTRA</a> (澳纽彩盟) - Australia &amp; New Zealand Tongzhi Rainbow Alliance is a NSW registered community organisation advocating for the rights, livelihood and welfare of Australia and New Zealand’s Mandarin &amp; Cantonese speaking LGBTQIA+ communities.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://www.autismspectrum.org.au/\">Autism Spectrum Australia</a> - A not-for-profit working in partnership with people on the autism spectrum to understand, engage and celebrate the strengths and interests of people on the autism spectrum, including the Autistic LGBTQIA+ community, as the Neurodiversity Rainbow.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Point-Clare-Families-110503290562688/\">Point Clare Families</a> - A grassroots community group from the Central Coast representing same sex parented, opposite sex parented and single parent families.
