    "media:description": "by Jose Maria Valera Reales\n\nOur profession is constantly evolving; therefore, it demands a non-stop learning process. Embracing the change is not optional in our software industry. We need to create spaces to get out of our comfort zone, so our cognitive brain can train and improve how to adapt to our surroundings, which are constantly transforming. A solution for this could be by integrating internal tech talks or katas which provides the team a great opportunity to have fun while learning and sharing knowledge between the team members.",
