In July 2014, 18-year-old Conrad Roy died by suicide in his car at a parking lot in Fairhaven, Mass. Police soon discovered a series of alarming text messages from his girlfriend, 17-year-old Michelle Carter, that seemed to encourage him to kill himself. This discovery sparked sensational headlines nationwide, leading to a trial that raised difficult questions about technology, social media and mental health, while asking if one person can be held responsible for the suicide of another. Jerry Weichman, a clinical psychologist and adolescent specialist as well as an author, speaker and parenting expert provides commentary and insight. </p><p><br></p><p>Producer David Eitel reviews Couples Therapy on Showtime, which unlocks a hidden world: other people’s relationships.
