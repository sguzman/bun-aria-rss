    "media:description": "Some spanning sets are better than others.  But what are the properties that make one spanning sets better than another one?  In this video, we focus on one important property that vectors can have: linear independence. \n\nThis video was a pain to make!  It took me a long time to find a way to describe linear dependence/independence in a way that felt intuitive to me.  I hope that the video was worth the wait.\n\nThis video is a part of \"From Zero to Geo\", a series where we formulate geometric algebra, an incredibly powerful branch of mathematics, from the ground up.
