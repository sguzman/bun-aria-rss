  "description": "The House Impeachment managers are meticulously making an irrefutable case against former President Trump and they are meeting very little resistance from Trump's almost comically inept defense team. But what then? What if the vast majority of GOP Senators vote to acquit? (As they will.) Where does the party go from here? What will the influence of the small but noticeable Sanity Caucus be going forward? We discuss with two noted, brilliant commentators, Max Boot of the Washington Post and David Frum of the Atlantic. They answer questions from host David Rothkopf and from an audience that joined the discussion as part of our new, weekly, \"Ask the Blob\" Webinar Series. Join us.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
