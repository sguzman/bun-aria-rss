  "description": "On this season of Working, we visit the city of Baltimore, to talk to people about their jobs there. We're hoping to learn about how the city informs their work, and how they are shaping Baltimore itself, by working.\nOn this first episode, crime novelist Laura Lippman tells us about how she first got started writing fiction, how she approaches writing and revising her books, and why she's tired of arguing about the validity of genre novels. She loves Baltimore despite its problems, and the city infuses her books, including the Tess Monaghan detective series.\nIn a Slate Plus Extra, Lippman tells us about her connection to the progenitor of detective novels Edgar Allan Poe, another Baltimore citizen.
