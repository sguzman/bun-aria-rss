  "description": "<p>Chaps and Cons catch up with Riggs for a poignant discussion to reflect on the outcome of the Presidential election. Chaps tells us what it was like to be at President Obama's Inaugural Ball to find out how much cream cheese goes into a Presidential cheesecake. The second half of the show the boys are joined by Bad Ass of the Week, Matt Eversmann. Matt fighting in the Battle of Mogidishu in 1993 was turned into a book and eventually the movie, Black Hawk Down. Matt tells us what it was like to have his life turned into a movie, what Hollywood got right, what they got wrong, and how he felt about having a much less sexy man, Josh Hartnett, play him in the movie!!!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
