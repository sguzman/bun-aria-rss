His work has been featured in Traditional Home, Architectural Digest, Style Blueprint, Nashville Lifestyles, and more. Roger takes pride in creating spaces that can not only be admired but lived in. We talk about his love of patterns, dining rooms, breaking the rules, and more. And why he doesn’t sweat the small stuff!\n\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nTrials & Triumphs about Caroline’s basement project, another baby joining the HTD family (which also means a nursery!), and all about Karen’s trip to Scott’s Antique Market.\n\nHow Roger is able to pull off a loose and casual style.\n\nRoger loves a neutral couch with patterns and texture.\n\nOur strong feelings on throw pillows.\n\nWhy Robert loves his books—especially Elements of Style.\n\n\nIs painting the walls, trim, molding, etc., all the same color classic or trend?\n\nHow to work with couples who have different styles.\n\nRobert’s tips for picking fabrics.\n\nWhy does Robert love a dining room so much?\n\nShedding light on a go-to way to quickly update the look of a room.\n\nWhy Robert doesn’t sweat the small stuff.\n\nWhen is it better to recover or reupholster a piece vs. replace it?\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Jenn,\n\nI personally think the chair can work just as it is. I will always go to draperies because I think they finish the room. The big-ticket items are probably the rug and the upholstery and because they are neutral and soft enough, I would be more inclined to pull a color from the rug and use it in the drapery panel; you only need one long rod along the wall for the panels and place the panels in between the glass sections. They don’t necessarily have to function—more for the aesthetic! The blue color from the rug is really nice. Also, I would change up the warmer-toned pillows like the burgundy and blush. Or find a bridge fabric that has those colors as well as the colors of the rug in it. It’s a very inviting aesthetic you have! So maybe they find something with all of these colors that has a fun pattern. There might be a bit of a sticker shock on the drapery, but it will be SO worth it.\n\nIn the kitchen, I would maybe put some faux Roman or valance in the window over the sink. On the wall opposite the sink with the mirror, that would be a great place to maybe install panel molding and paint inside of that the color of your drapery. You could even upholster in there with the drapery fabric. It’ll be a very impactful statement and will tie everything in. I would love to see some kind of large lantern for a lighting fixture or just something heavy over the island. Even one with a shade the color of the drapery like the Margot could be perfect here!\n\n\nFor the bar, if you’re open to painting, I love that pale grey-blue accent color from the rug like I talked about. You could do the cabinets on the bar that color. So, it would be the same color as the drapery and the panel wall in the kitchen. A lamp would also be pretty in there, too. We would take all of the small things out and slowly add them back until you get to the look you want. Caroline likes the idea of tiny art on the wall…almost like wallpaper out of art. Robert and Karen are open to that, but not as sold! Robert is more apt to paint the back wall the same color as the cabinets, stopping the paint on the inside corners just at the top of the window molding. Not on either of the sidewalls; just the back wall.\n\nWe know we’ve given you a ton of different ideas here, so we can’t wait to see what you do. But we already love this room. The big stuff is mostly done here; you just need a few tweaks. So great job, Jenn!\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nR Higgins Interiors\nR Higgins Interiors on Instagram\nElements of Style by Erin Gates",
