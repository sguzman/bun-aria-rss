    "media:description": "Find all my publications on my website: https://protesilaos.com\n\n* * *\n\nIn this entry, I scaled a mountain to make a philosophical point pertinent to the titular topic.  This talk is a bit less than an hour long.  The main ideas:\n\n* We sometimes think of self-improvement only as a means to an ulterior goal, such as money, fame, sex.\n* Use the example of climbing to the top of the mountain in hope of finding those \"rewards\".\n* Elaborate on the connection between the transactional view of self-improvement and the concept of entitlement.  The latter was also covered in my previous talk about [loss, entitlement, and presence](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-17-loss-entitlement-presence/).\n* Explain that self-importance is okay but how it can go awry.  A relevant theme was covered in my talk about [On self-importance and elitism](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-09-self-importance-elitism/).\n* Discuss how philosophy helps us overcome the self-centric view.  We do not expect rewards.\n* Talk about expectations and entitlement, with a view to how they can make a person turn their disappointment into a weapon that is used against others.\n* Remark how philosophy helps us remain calm and not go to extremes.",
