  "description": "<p>TRAUMA and PAIN takes on many forms and is an extraordinary CHALLENGE many of us face daily.  <br /><br />This week, my guest GABBY BERNSTEIN and I are going to talk about PAIN and TRAUMA, digging deep into a subject that’s affected a lot of us. In fact, I talk to a lot of people, and I’ve seen how we’re collectively reeling from trauma more than ever.   <br /><br />That’s why I asked Gabby to sit down and shed light on a topic that remains elusive and damaging for many people.<br /><br />We’re going to unmask the nature of trauma, and Gabby will help you TAKE MORE CONTROL of your life and HEAL from the traumas that are hurting you.<br /><br />Gabby is well qualified because she's no stranger to trauma. She’s overcome extreme challenges in her life, including the difficult battle of beating addiction and getting sober several years ago.<br /><br />Since then, she’s published several NEW YORK TIMES bestselling books on spirituality, personal growth, and radical life change, including her new book HAPPY DAYS, THE GUIDED PATH FROM TRAUMA TO PROFOUND FREEDOM AND INNER PEACE.<br /><br />Gabby explores the disconnect between outward success and difficulties you face trying to reconcile how the world sees you vs. how you see yourself. That CONFLICT is a breeding ground for trauma, and shedding light on it can help ease mental stressors that can easily descend into trauma.<br /><br />One of the most important things we talk about are TRIGGERS AND PATTERNS. Reacting to things that have happened in our past creates triggers like disassociation, shame, or denial, and Gabby does a great job of breaking things down to help you recognize these things in you.<br /><br />She also reveals how we can heal ourselves from trauma by connecting with our INNER CHILD and PROTECTORS. Childhood trauma often carries forward to adulthood, and we develop protectors to do just that, protect us from long-standing traumas.<br /><br />There’s also a physical price to pay for trauma. Gabby has got important insights on THE TOLL TRAUMA TAKES ON OUR BODY.<br /><br />And she also shares exercises we can do to lessen physical trauma, including the “heart hold” and “tapping,” which is a technique I’ve been a fan of for a long time.<br /><br />This week is a HEALING week.<br /><br />Gabby helped me during our talk, and when you listen, I have no doubt SHE’S GOING TO HELP YOU TOO.</p>\n",
