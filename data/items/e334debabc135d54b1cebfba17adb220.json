  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Sen Lindsey Graham should not be taking heat for calling for the assassination of Vladimir Putin, a man who has unleashed Chechen assassins against the president of Ukraine and attacked their largest nuclear power plant. The more appeasement you show in the face of aggressive military action like Russia, the more brutal and aggressive they will become. The Biden administration response has been awful, telling Putin everything they will or won't do with Iran while withholding information from Congress. This is very serious and President Biden will not open the spigot to our oil in Alaska or sanction Russian oil. This is why Biden will not open America's economy or industrial might. He is selling out to the Russians, Iranians, and using the Russians as the middlemen to negotiate a deal with Iran. That's what's taking place, and they're worried about what Lindsey Graham says about Putin. Biden has made the world extremely dangerous through his ideologies and incompetent buffoons he surrounds himself with. Everywhere you look the Biden agenda has lit fuses, and now we have theaters all over the world. Also, West Virginia legislature today voted to join the convention of states, making them the 18th state to do so. Mark Meckler calls in to explain other states looking to join.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
