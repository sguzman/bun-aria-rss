  "description": "Willie kicks Miss Kay out of the room she's been using at Duck Commander, but now she's about to get her way like a BOSS. Kay reveals what she's giving Phil for Christmas and has the boys in stitches over her unexpected reason for taking in rescue dogs. Uncle Si, Martin, and John-David drool over Kay's cooking — especially the Swiss steak, spaghetti sauce, and pies — but there are a few recipes Phil insists on taking over from her. And Kay shares some of her favorite memories of Si.
