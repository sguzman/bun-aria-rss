  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, another police shooting has sparked protests. But while the Left, Democrats, and protesters put all the blame on the police officer as usual, I think we need to start asking some questions about the personal responsibility of the suspects in these situations. Are they not responsible for their own behavior? Also Five Headlines including a “Black Trans Lives Matter” protest over the weekend. What was the point of this protest and why was it needed? It wasn’t needed, and I’ll explain why. Plus our Daily Cancellation and much more. \n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
