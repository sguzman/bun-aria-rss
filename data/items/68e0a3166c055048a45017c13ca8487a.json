  "description": "Donald Trump has given the blessing of the U.S. to a Turkish invasion of Northern Syria that could lead to a humanitarian catastrophe for the Kurds, the alienation of an important ally, greater distrust among our other allies, and benefits for the Assad Regime, Iran and Russia. It has triggered a rare, bi-partisan chorus of condemnation of the president...and, within hours, military action on the Turkish-Syrian border. We are joined by a former U.S. Under Secretary of Defense Michele Flournoy, Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake of the IISS, and Ed Luce of the Financial Times to discuss this latest calamitous decision by Trump and its likely consequences. Don't miss this essential conversation. \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
