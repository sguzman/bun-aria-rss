  "description": "<p>We all remember our first kiss, our first love, but for some of us our first cigar trumps them all as it ignited a passion that would become our careers. In the first hour we begin the countdown to episode five hundred and look back at the cigars that were our first and the cigars that changed our lives as we smoke the Serino Maduro XX Belicoso from The Cigar Authority care package.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t stop there though as we asked many of the manufacturers who were present at the Two Guys Smoke Shop 34th Anniversary what their first cigar was and you might be shocked at some of the answers. We will listen to them as we smoke a La Gianna Maduro in honor of Gianna’s birthday.</p>\n<p>We will have this all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.2GuysCigars.com%2F&redir_token=__oxaDyDdFvL0tSDitXGL8P7Hqd8MTU2NTQ2OTY0NkAxNTY1MzgzMjQ2&event=video_description&v=5KB10PtanU4'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
