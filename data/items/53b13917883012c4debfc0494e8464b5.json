  "description": "<div>Three generations of evil carried the Bush family name, and all of them were focused on trying to dismantle America while pretending to do the exact opposite.<br>\n<br>\nFrom financing the rise of Adolph Hitler to running the CIA, to shooting American presidents and kicking off multiple wars in the Middle East, the Bush family has been deeply involved in just about every major war over the past century.<br>\n<br>\nIf George H.W. Bush was the Emperor, then Dick Cheney was Darth Vader, using fear and intimidation to silence the media from questioning his intentions to forcing his will on Congress and the courts to support Draconian changes to the laws regarding privacy and due process. Dick Cheney was the most destructive Vice President in American history, but there is more to his story than most people realize.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sponsors</strong><br>\nScribd: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/37XqNUF\">https://bit.ly/37XqNUF</a>\n</div>\n<div>Curiosity Stream: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3a3DyhI\">https://bit.ly/3a3DyhI</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Online Connection</strong>\n</div>\n<div>Website: <a href=\"http://www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com/\">www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com</a>\n</div>\n<div>Facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol\">www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macroaggressio3\">www.twitter.com/macroaggressio3</a><br>\nTwitter Handle: @macroaggressio3<br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q\">www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Purchase \"The Octopus Of Global Control\"<br>\n</strong>Amazon:<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr\">https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr</a><br>\nBarnes & Noble: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ\">https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ</a>\n</div>\n",
