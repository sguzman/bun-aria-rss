  "description": "<p>Kyron Horman /// The Disappearance </p>\n<p>Part 1 of 4</p>\n<p>The Disappearance</p>\n<p>It's a parents worst nightmare... You send your kid off to school and you think they are safe. Once they get inside the four walls of their school nothing bad should happen. In June of 2010, 7 year old Kyron Horman was dropped off at his school. His stepmother last saw him walking to his classroom. She left when Kyron was just feet from the classroom door. When school was let out, Kyron was to be picked up from the bus stop. When the bus arrived and let the kids out, Kyron was not there. Sometime during the school day he was taken from his school. Tonight we discuss the tragic story of a missing little boy.Beer of the week - Liquid Sunshine by Breakside BreweryGarage Grade - 4 and a half bottle caps out of 5</p><p><a href=\"https://truecrimegarage.com/home\">Beer Fund: https://truecrimegarage.com/home</a></p>\n",
