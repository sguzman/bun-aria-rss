  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">In Italy’s arsenal of great wines of the world, Brunello di Montalcino may be the most coveted of all. Its small production and terroir-driven style represents the pinnacle of Sangiovese, widely considered Italy’s most famed grape. Made in the small and historic Tuscan hilltop village of Montalcino, just south of Siena, the grapes thrive in the climate and soils of this rugged area. Although the youngest of all the Italian greats, Brunello, with its rich flavors, elegant balance of acidity and tannin, and incredible ability to improve with age, is a wine that everyone should experience even if just once in their wine lives. In this show we delve into the nuances of Brunello and talk about just what makes it so special.</span></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style= \"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\"><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Montalcino_town.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /><br /></span><a href= \"https://www.consorziobrunellodimontalcino.it/en/home/home\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><span style= \"font-size: 8pt; color: #000000;\">Photo: Montalcino town & Vineyards, from Conzorzio di Brunello di Montalcino</span></em></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">Here are the show notes:</span></p> <p><span style= \"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">Location:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">The small production zone of Montalcino is centered to the northeast of the namesake village in a wooded, hilly area with the most notable feature being Monte Amiata, the highest peak in Southern Tuscany.</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">The village is Iabout 25 miles/40 km south of Siena, about 40 miles 77 km from the sea, and 62 miles/100 km from the Apennine Mountains, which affects the climate</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><span style= \"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">History</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">I won’t give all the detail we do in the show, but the summary is that Montalcino has had a reputation for special wines for about 600 years but the wine as we know it today wasn’t created until the late 1800s. This is when first Clemente Santi, and then his grandson Ferruccio Biondi-Santi isolated the clones of Brunello/Sangiovese Grosso at their Il Greppo estate and made a wine of a quality the world had rarely seen from Italy. They began better vineyard work, meticulous cellar work, and extended aging that built the reputation of the area. Despite the accolades, the wine was such small production and Montalcino so obscure, that it wasn’t until the 1970s, when others started to recognize the potential in the area and by 1980 the supply of Brunello was adequate for wine lovers to be able to access this wine, created by one passionate family (who sadly no longer owns Biondi-Santi but whose legacy remains!).</span></li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/riserva.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" /><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Photo from Biondi-Santi</em></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\"> </span></p> <p><strong><span style= \"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">Climate</span></strong></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">Montalcino is marked by a Mediterranean climate: it is dry with some continental conditions.
