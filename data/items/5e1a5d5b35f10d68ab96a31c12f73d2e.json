  "description": "In this episode of The Barron Report, host Paul Barron talks with Scott Lawton, the chief executive officer and co-founder of bartaco, to explore technology, ordering systems, and labor shortages. <br /><br />Three Key Points:<br /><br />Lawton talks about bartaco’s business growth as well as taking on the pandemic. He shares bartaco’s roll out of an entirely touchless dine-in operation and the creation of a more efficient labor model that allows them to compensate the staff well. <br /><br />Lawton talks about the bartaco culture and how a living wage has impacted their business. Bartaco switched their operating model to pooled tips, which allowed starting pay to be twenty-three dollars an hour or more at some locations. Lawton says that they don’t need to find people with a lot of experience, just great attitudes. <br /><br />In terms of technology advancements, Lawton talks about using Wisley for their customer relationship management, holding all of the customer data and onedine, their partner for the ordering process in the restaurant. Lawton says those two pieces have created a whole wealth of data. <br /><br />Tweetable Quotes:<br /><br />We really put all of our attention into developing these service leaders, and they are salaried employees who make a bonus, who get benefits and they are really engaged in making sure the customers are happy.” - Scott Lawton<br /><br />We think we have actually elevated the experience and we are seeing that in all of the comments on social media and our shops, where they are just blown away by the service.” - Scott Lawton  <br /><br />Industry veteran Paul Barron takes restaurant business to the next level.
