  "title": "The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg",
  "description": "Duhigg explores why we do what we do and how to change certain habits that we have. The book explains how our brains form habit usually driven by a Cue, Routine and Reward mechanism known as a ‘habit loop’. Scientific discoveries studying both animals and humans have described the brains flexibility when adapting to new habits. By understanding the causes of habit formation, we are better able to change them to positively affect our lives. Duhigg does a wonderful job writing this book. He gives clear scientific examples, whilst also describing the impact that a single person’s habits can have on the wider community as seen in the Civil Rights movement. The real-life stories that emerge from this book make it a captivating read. It must be noted that towards the end of the book Duhigg briefly mentions how to change our existing habits, its brief but provides value. I rate this book five stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
