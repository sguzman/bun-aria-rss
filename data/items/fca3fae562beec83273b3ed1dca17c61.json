Come close to Me and know that I will help you.”There’s no mess you’ve made that He can’t help you clean up. In Jesus, you are made right with God. There is nothing that God cannot do for you through Jesus Christ. There’s nothing on the inside of you that would make you distant from God. He loves you just the way you are!<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
