  "description": "<p>It's a party as we are joined by the Head of Consumer Marketing for Altadis USA, Brad Winstead as we fire up a cigar from the March Care Package. We will discuss and smoke the Montecristo Nicaragua Series. We will look at the footprint of Altadis and discuss the cigars within their portfolio and perhaps get a sneak peek at what is coming this year.</p>\n<p>In the second hour the celebration continues as Barry turns 50. We will fire up the first cigar he ever gave a 100 rating to back on June 11, 2008. We will share our thoughts on the WinsteadNatural and ask, \"Why does Barry rate cigars so high? And why does it bother people so much?\"</p>\n<p>Rumor has it that there might be a bottle of Flor de Cana rum present. It's a rumor Barry started because it's true. The boys are drinking again so this one might fly off the rails.</p>\n<p>Hop on board the crazy train known as The Cigar Authority, the most listened to cigar podcast in the world. We will have all the usually suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at http://www.2GuysCigars.com/.</p>\n",
