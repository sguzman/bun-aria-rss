Matt Walsh has a problem with females entering the sports world. Quantum Week Chris brought another game, Box Office Baseball. Howard Stern says \"fuck their freedom\" to all unvaccinated individuals and mocks the radio hosts that passed away. We get another \"Lock of the Week\" for this weekend's college football matchups and much more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
