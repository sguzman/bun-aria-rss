  "description": "There are things in this world that really grinds Moe’s gears. This week Moe shares two things he’s most recently mad about. Starting with the poop pitching magician!\nHis friend invites a girl over for a first date. The girl needs to use the restroom, takes a poop and the toilet gets clogged. Long story short, the girl grabs a cup from out of the bathroom, scoops up the poop from the inside of the toilet and proceeds to throw the poop out the window into Moe’s friends back yard.\nMoe’s friend asked her about it and you’d never believe what she told him!\nSecond on the list for what made Moe mad this week was Moe and Romeo’s unintentional twin day at The Bert Show. On Wednesday the two were dressed exactly alike, even down to their red underwear!\nWhat upset Moe wasn’t the fact that they were matching, but the number of DMs Moe got of people asking him if it were planned.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
