  "description": "But so is a round Earth. So how do these square pegs in round holes justify themselves? With YouTube videos, of course, but also sometimes with some violence. Mike talks with Kelly Weill, author of Off the Edge: Flat Earthers, Conspiracy Culture, and Why People Will Believe Anything about these sometimes-problematic folks. In the Spiel, Mike considers the case against an opera about Emmett Till that was co-written by a black composer and a white librettist. And in Senate Judiciary Hearing news, Senators and potential Supreme Court justices agree: murderers are bad.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist \nLearn more about your ad choices.
