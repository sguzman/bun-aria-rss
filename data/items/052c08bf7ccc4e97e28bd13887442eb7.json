  "description": "<p>Do \"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation\" or are we actually pretty happy most of the time?  As it turns out humans are far more resilient than you think.  Ever heard of the term \"affective forecasting\"?  It's something we do every day and very often we make mistakes doing it.  In this episode you'll learn more about positive psychology from the authors of a new book called Pollyanna's Revenge.  Another myth put to rest: \"depressive realism\" - the idea that there's an advantage to being depressed - that depressed people are more realistic about the world than non-depressed people.  That's not so either and I think you'll find a lot of interesting information in this episode about what affects your own level of happiness.  Join me for a fascinating discussion about how we really react to the ups and downs of life.</p>",
