  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing 60 second life in review videos of older actors and what they accomplished in their careers. They also discuss vaudeville and Pagliacci leading to a conversation about music pitting Smokey Robinson's 'Tears of a Clown' against Prince's 'Erotic City' with a very animated Adam giving his thoughts. Drew later circles back to his studies of performers and points out his astonishment that many, if not most of those who succeeded came from affluent backgrounds. They also discuss how that phenomenon translates to very little today with the notable exception of Formula 1 racing. The discussion of racing leads Adam to harken back to his childhood and experiences of going to Malibu Grand Prix with friend's fathers. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nCon-Cret.com/Podcast\nGetRoman.com/ADS\nBabbel.com/ADS",
