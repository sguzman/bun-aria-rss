  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys effectively find a way to fix the NFL Draft amid the Coronavirus outbreak, as they have already decided that there will no be fan involvement whatsoever. Also, to beat the quarantine, Pat welcomes on Super Bowl Champion, former middle linebacker for the Green Bay Packers, friend of the show, AJ Hawk. AJ and Pat react to all the craziness of the start of NFL free agency. Which teams are interested in Brady, where is he potentially going? How did the Cardinals manage to fleece the Texans so bad in sending DeAndre Hopkins to Arizona, which teams are getting better? Which teams are getting worse? Pat and AJ break down all the above, plus much, much more (9:15-1:39:41). As always, stay safe out there, and try to make the best out of this quarantine situation. Today is a fun one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
