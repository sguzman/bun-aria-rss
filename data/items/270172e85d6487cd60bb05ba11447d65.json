  "description": "<p>The Eastland Disaster was the most deadly shipwreck in Great Lakes history. More passengers would die in this disaster than in the sinking of the Titanic. This was supposed to be a fun excursion to the grounds of a company picnic. The annual employee appreciation event had become a much anticipated break from the six-day work weeks that the lower middle class employees endured. On this fateful day in 1915, hundreds would die including whole families and leave a mark forever on Chicago. Locations that housed the dead until they could be identified are still haunted by the tragic event, both figuratively and literally. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Eastland Disaster! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Scott Booker and features the origins of pink lemonade and This Month in History features Michelangelo. Our topic was suggested by listener Kimmie Page.</p> <p>Our sponsors for this episode are the Stereo App - Go to stereo.com/historygoesbump, download the app and follow us to start getting in on the fun, live conversations and HelloFresh - Go to hellofresh.com/bump12 and enter code bump12 for 12 free meals and free shipping!</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br /> <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2021/03/hgb-ep-377-eastland-disaster.html</p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>Music used in this episode:</p> <p>(Moment in Oddity) Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4578-vanishing<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>(This Month in History) In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3906-in-your-arms<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>Hammock Fight by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3847-hammock-fight<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Row Your Boat to Hell by ALIBI Music<br /> Haunting Theme by 5 Alarm Music<br /> Sad Day by 5 Alarm Music</p>",
