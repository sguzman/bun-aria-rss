It's something completely different. The Left, perhaps since Rousseau and definitely since Hegel, has been dialectical in its thinking. It is the Dialectical Left. What is the dialectic, though? What is dialectical thinking? In short, it's the fusion of opposites in a way that understands them from a higher-level perspective, which is necessarily synthetic. In this slightly longer episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay explains the dialectic and dialectical thought in some detail with a considerable number of examples to help you understand this synthetic approach to thought and why it's always going to be a catastrophe in the making.\n\nSupport New Discourses: https://newdiscourses.com/support\n\nSubscribe to New Discourses on other platforms: https://newdiscourses.com/subscribe\n\nFollow James Lindsay: https://linktr.ee/conceptualjames\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
