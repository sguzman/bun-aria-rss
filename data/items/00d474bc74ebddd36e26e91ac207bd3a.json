  "description": "<p>The ongoing transition from a linear (produce-use-dispose) to a circular\neconomy poses significant challenges to current state-of-the-art information\nand communication technologies. In particular, the derivation of integrated,\nhigh-level views on material, process, and product streams from (real-time)\ndata produced along value chains is challenging for several reasons. Most\nimportantly, sufficiently rich data is often available yet not shared across\ncompany borders because of privacy concerns which make it impossible to build\nintegrated process models that capture the interrelations between input\nmaterials, process parameters, and key performance indicators along value\nchains. In the current contribution, we propose a privacy-preserving, federated\nmultivariate statistical process control (FedMSPC) framework based on Federated\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) and Secure Multiparty Computation to foster\nthe incentive for closer collaboration of stakeholders along value chains. We\ntested our approach on two industrial benchmark data sets - SECOM and ST-AWFD.\nOur empirical results demonstrate the superior fault detection capability of\nthe proposed approach compared to standard, single-party (multiway) PCA.\nFurthermore, we showcase the possibility of our framework to provide\nprivacy-preserving fault diagnosis to each data holder in the value chain to\nunderpin the benefits of secure data sharing and federated process modeling.\n</p>",
