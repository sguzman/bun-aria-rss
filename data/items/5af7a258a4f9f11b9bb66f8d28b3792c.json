  "description": "  Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. It may look like you can't miss by going short now… Most stocks are at all-time highs… we’re seeing new records almost every week... and at this point, even perma-bulls are stuttering. The inevitable is just around the corner, right? For the past eight months short-sellers have had it increasingly rough. Just take a look at the charts. It’s obvious. Minor market pullbacks have been met with even bigger buying opportunities. And earnings along with valuations today continue to surge. Expectations… well, they’re still bullish. Simply put, if you want to short in today’s game, investors have to be more methodical than ever before. Which leads me to today’s guest - short-selling expert, Michael Alkin. Michael is a former hedge fund analyst, portfolio manager and is currently the Editor & Founder of The Stock Catalyst Report. As Michael points out, even in today’s market, some expectations are far from reality. With all the day-to-day noise we hear surrounding Wall Street, Michael breaks down some alarming, yet subtle changes particular companies are making that are going completely unnoticed… Leaving short-sellers, for those that are still alive, with a surprisingly exciting opportunity. The only hard part is -- where do you look? Tune in as Michael unveils his favorite short-selling methodology… showing listeners exactly where to find these opportunities and the all the risks that come with it. On the flip side, Michael brings up a sector he’s going “all-in” on. Frequent Wall Street Unplugged listeners have heard the same thesis over and over again from some of the smartest people in the industry. However, to end the episode, Michael brings up two catalysts listeners have yet to hear. “In my 20-plus years of my career, this is the best risk/reward ratio on the long-side I’ve ever seen.” Good Investing, Frank Curzio",
