  "description": "<div><!--block-->Recently, Jessa attended a fascinating exhibition of mysticism and art at the IMMA in Dublin called “As Above, So Below: Portals, Visions, Spirits & Mystics.” Pádraic E Moore, writer/curator/art historian from Ireland based in Brussels, was a curatorial advisor for the exhibition. He joins Jessa via Skype to discuss the secret history of the occult and modernism and the role it played in art, writing, and revolution. Pádraic E. Moore (b. 1982) is a writer, curator, and art historian. He holds a BA in History of Art and English Literature from University College Dublin (2004), an MA in Visual Art Practices from IADT, Dublin (2007), and completed CuratorLab, the postgraduate programme at Konstfack University, Stockholm (2010). Moore’s practice is shaped by the belief that visual art enables alternative modes of interaction in a world increasingly led by techno­logical rationality. Moore’s curatorial methodology is meticulous but subjective, and is informed by an acute awareness of the artist’s individual position. Moore’s research interests focus on the influence of esoteric philosophies upon the literary and visual arts. Recent study considers how occult organisations, such as the Theosophical Society, offered a vital catalyst for change in late 19th and early 20th century art. Moore’s projects often explore how contemporary culture has embraced aesthetics and ideals informed by such esoteric traditions; chronicling the work of artists who refer to or follow in this tradition is an integral aspect of his practice. Recent projects include: Drawing Down the Moon at the Irish Museum of Modern Art (2017); I Went to the Woods: The Artist as Wanderer, Glucksman Gallery, Cork (2016) Music for Chameleons, a project for Parcours: Art Basel, (2016); Now is forever lasting constant in the mind, a project for Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, (2016); Ψ (Psi), a project for Fokidos, Athens. “As Above, So Below: Portals, Visions, Spirits, & Mystics” IMMA page: <a href=\"http://www.imma.ie/en/page_237202.htm\">http://www.imma.ie/en/page_237202.htm <br /> </a></div> <div><!--block--></div> <div><!--block-->SUBSCRIBE to the #PublicIntellectual #Patreon page to access bonus content, merch, and more:<br /> <br /></div> <div><!--block--><a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/publicintellectual\">https://www.patreon.com/publicintellectual</a></div>",
