  "description": "<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, OP is a minority in America, and she just loves to cook. She starts bringing some of her dishes into class. For some reason, a racist classmate gets all pissed off at OP for bringing in minority food, and she lectures OP about how she should only cook white people food... even though OP isn't white. OP happily complies. If you don't want any minority food, then she'll stop making extra food for you to eat! Enjoy going hungry, you racist jerk!</p>\n",
