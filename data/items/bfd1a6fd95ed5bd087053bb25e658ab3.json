  "description": "<p>Political elections ought to bring out the good in people – aren’t they a chance to talk about plans and hopes for the future? But lately they have come to resemble brawls on a playground. When did it become OK to wave insulting signs at rallies or call candidates ugly names? Why are so many candidates focusing on the personal instead of policy? In this episode, Jonathan Haidt, PhD, talks about incivility in politics and how psychological research can help us understand each other a little better and return civility to politics.</p> <p>APA is currently seeking proposals for APA 2020, click here to learn more <a href= \"https://convention.apa.org/proposals\">https://convention.apa.org/proposals</a></p>",
