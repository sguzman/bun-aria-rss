  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Season Four starts today, you Magnificent Firebirds!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/the-books\">Season One</a> gave us a full lAD deep dive (if you’ve never read Kresley Cole’s Immortals After Dark, general existential malaise is a really good reason to start), and <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/season-two-books-that-blooded-us\">Season Two</a> gave us <em>The Books That Blooded Us</em>&nbsp;-- the books that made us the romance readers we are. <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/season-three-back-on-our-bullsht\" target=\"\">Season Three</a> was during a pandemic, so just let us live (but also, there was a Roy Kent episode)! </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Now, Season Four is here, and we have — dare we say — a plan?  We’re going to deep dive on books that are new and fabulous, old and transformative, and generally reveal how vast and magnificent the romance pool can get. We’ve got some great interstitials planned, including some fabulous, brilliant guests on deck…and when Munro is released, we’ll (obviously) drop everything and read with you!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But we’ve got something new and different to add to the mix — a collection of interviews with trailblazers of the genre—the people who have built the romance house over the last fifty years. We’re already blown away by who we have on deck, with many many more to come! Stick with us, it’s going to be a terrific ride. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We begin our read alongs in two weeks with a delicious book that did not bring romance the bluestocking, but definitely made sure we all knew who she was. It’s Amanda Quick’s <em>Ravished</em>—which Sarah describes as “Harriet, in a cave, with a rake.” It’s great.
