    "media:description": "When did you get you first computer? \n\n\nIn this video I look at the countries with the highest penetration of home computers. In other words, the percentage of each country's population with a home computer. What surprised me the most was that the superpowers didn't even make it to the top 20. I projected the value for this year, since that data has not been collected. The rest of the data comes from Statista. \n\n\n\nI failed to find a new song similar to the one I've been using for the past 2 years, Epic Motivation. So I tried creating a new song in a similar style, this is the first draft called Epic Inspiration.",
