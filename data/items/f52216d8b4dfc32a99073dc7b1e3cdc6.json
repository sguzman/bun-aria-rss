border: 2px solid black;\">\n<b>Thm 1:</b> For any kernel $K(c)$, we can construct an activation function $\\tilde{\\phi}$ such that, when inserted into a <i>single-hidden-layer</i> FCN, its infinite-width NTK or NNGP kernel is $K(c)$.\n</p>\n\n<p>We give an explicit formula for \\(\\tilde{\\phi}\\) in terms of Hermite polynomials\n(though we use a different functional form in practice for trainability reasons).\nOur proposed use of this result is that, in problems with some known structure, it’ll sometimes be possible to write down a good kernel and reverse-engineer it into a trainable network with various advantages over pure kernel regression, like computational efficiency and the ability to learn features.\nAs a proof of concept, we test this idea out on the synthetic <em>parity problem</em> (i.e., given a bitstring, is the sum odd or even?), immediately generating an activation function that dramatically outperforms \\(\\text{ReLU}\\) on the task.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"one-hidden-layer-is-all-you-need\"><strong>One hidden layer is all you need?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Here’s another surprising use of our result.\nThe kernel curve above is for a 4HL \\(\\textrm{ReLU}\\) FCN, but I claimed that we can achieve any kernel, including that one, with just one hidden layer.\nThis implies we can come up with some new activation function \\(\\tilde{\\phi}\\) that gives this “deep” NTK in a <em>shallow network</em>!\nFig. 3 illustrates this experiment.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/ntk-reveng/rev_eng_fig3.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:20%;
