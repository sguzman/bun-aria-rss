Whilst Jonathan is a New Yorker his father and aunt were from Hull, England. Michael and Christine were on the 100th floor of the South Tower when the plane struck and as his aunt attempted to escape his father made one last phone call home to say goodbye to his family. Jonathan tells Dan about his memories of that terrible day, how he dealt with his loss and the impact it has had on him and his family.</p><br><p>Secondly, in an extract from our sibling podcast, <a href=\"https://podfollow.com/the-world-wars/view\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Warfare</strong></a> Joe Dittmar shares with James his story of surviving 9/11.
