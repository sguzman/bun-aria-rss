    "media:description": "This week we are presenting Odilon Redon’s Noirs. As a surrealist and symbolist, here he presents a series of charcoal drawings and lithographs depicting nightmarish and hybrid creatures. In this series Redon explores emotions, the real and the unreal, as well as anything that might have been seen in a dream. Some of Redon’s art is in a private collection, while much of it is at MoMA. \n\n\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/TheCanvas\n\n#arthistory #art #surrealism #symbolist #frenchsymbolistmovement #lithographs #lesnoirsodilon #odilonredon",
