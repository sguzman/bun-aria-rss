  "description": "<p>In many circles, Angela Duckworth’s name has become synonymous with the word grit, this elusive trait that fuels the sustained action-taking in the face of relentless adversity that leads to big achievements. Her book <em>Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance</em> was a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, and Duckworth is founder and C.E.O. of Character Lab, a nonprofit that uses psychological science to help children thrive.&nbsp;</p><p>She is also the Christopher H. Browne Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, faculty co-director of the Penn-Wharton Behavior Change for Good Initiative, and faculty co-director of Wharton People Analytics. A 2013 MacArthur Fellow, Angela has advised the White House, the World Bank, NBA and NFL teams, and Fortune 500 C.E.O.’s, and her TED talk is among the most-viewed of all time.
