  "description": "<p><em><strong>In Your Attempt to Both Sides Everything... </strong></em>This episode, Mike and Tim attempt to tie up the conversation on Faithful vs. Effective. Mike brings some miserable musings on <strong>Al Mohler </strong>and his recent speech to 'pray, vote and stand' against the left and it's place amongst the marrying of the evangelical and politically right. This deepens the conversation on how we are to reimagine and think beyond the two dimensional political reality we live in. How can we usurp our 'two-sides' thinking to have a more nuanced and Christlike view of the world and our neighbors? Tim has a terrible time with the recent political stunt by Governors DeSantis and Abbott shipping immigrants to Martha's Vineyard. What do we do when human lives are used as pawns? If we don't fight, then what??</p>\n<p>The bulk of the episode is centered on a critique Mike was given via email on both sidesing everything. Mike responds and a conversation is had about the true thesis of these last few episodes as well as most 'political' VOXOLOGY episodes. Is there a both sides? Is there life beyond the binary? How are we meant to resist? How do we advocate for change?</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
