  "description": "Earlier this week, a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court suggested that after nearly 50 years, the court intends to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. <br/><br/>Almost as soon as abortions became legal, opponents began organizing efforts to repeal the law. Eighteen states now have so-called \"trigger laws\"  that will ban abortions the moment that Roe v.
