Three servants are left sums of money (talents) by their master. The first, who the master believed was most able, doubled his five talents into ten. The second was given two and used it to earn two more. The third was more cautious and less ambitious, and simply buried his in the ground.

But with the conservative and cautious one, he was quite upset. Why hadn’t he invested the money? Even the return from a banker would have been better than burying it. So he punished the servant and uttered, in the process, two of the most famous sentences in <a href='https://geni.us/wL1p'>the Bible</a>: </p><p>“For to all those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.
