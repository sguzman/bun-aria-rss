  "description": "WWE Superstar Thaddeus Bullard aka Titus O'Neil doesn't believe in the word \"can't\" and has every reason not to. Born into poverty to a pre-teen mother, Titus had a troublesome youth early on. After finding life-altering guidance at a Florida Sheriffs Boys Ranch, Titus fully tapped into a mentality that took him from problem child to being inducted into The University of Florida Hall of Fame, 2015 Celebrity Dad of the Year, and committed humanitarian. Titus O'Neil talks how he conquered the odds, and the potential of others to do the same in this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu. Tom Bilyeu is the co-founder of 2014 Inc. 500 company Quest Nutrition — a unicorn startup valued at over $1 billion — and the co-founder and host of Impact Theory.
