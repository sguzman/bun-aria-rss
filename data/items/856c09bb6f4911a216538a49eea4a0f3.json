  "title": "NFL Trade Deadline Preview: Potential moves for the Patriots, Cowboys, Vikings, Bengals and more (Football 10/27)",
  "description": "The trade deadline is quickly approaching, so it only makes sense for Will Brinson to bring on NFL Insider Jason La Canfora to preview all the potential action. The Patriots need to make something happen if they intend to defend their longstanding AFC East crown, but what's out there for them (3:45)? Wide receiver is the obvious target and JLC breaks down who could be available. The Cowboys are in a much different spot and positioned to be sellers after a disastrous start. Aldon Smith and Everson Griffen are names that make sense to be on the move but could Dallas even aim to move on from Amari Cooper (14:05)? Will and Jason also discuss the Falcons & Texans (21:35), Vikings and Bengals (27:15) and Eagles (33:00), examining their options heading into next Tuesday's deadline.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, , @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
