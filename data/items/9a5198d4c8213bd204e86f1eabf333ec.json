Mona’s compassionate approach to therapy is based on brain science. She describes disruptive behaviors as “just the tip of the iceberg,” important signals a child may be sending that are symptoms of an underlying issue. This is common ground for Janet, as she has long held that many behaviors which parents deem negative are rarely motivated, intentional, or consciously anti-social. They are, in fact,  reflections of a dysregulated emotional state which needs to be acknowledged. Mona’s new book is available on Amazon: “Beyond Behaviors: Using Brain Science and Compassion to Understand and Solve Children's Behavioral Challenges.”\n\nFor more advice on common parenting issues, please check out Janet's best-selling books on Audible, FREE with a 30-day trial membership if you use this link: adbl.co/2OBVztZ.
