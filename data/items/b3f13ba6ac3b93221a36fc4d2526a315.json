  "title": "Carlos Garrido Castellano, \"Beyond Representation in Contemporary Caribbean Art\" (Rutgers UP, 2019)",
  "description": "A work of art about doing nothing; a work of art that invites people to take it apart; a work of art that consists of two people walking in a town in the Dominican Republic. These are just some examples Carlos Garrido Castellano takes up in Beyond Representation in Contemporary Caribbean Art: Space, Politics, and the Public Sphere (Rutgers University Press, 2019), his provocative and complex exploration of conceptual art in the Caribbean as it has been presented over the last thirty years. He argues for a way of experiencing and writing about art that explodes all of our assumptions, and makes new spectators of us all. This book proposes that we can understand this art as creating agency in and through space. Its success is evident in the urgency it generates: we need to experience these creative interventions in order to better understand the Caribbean.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
