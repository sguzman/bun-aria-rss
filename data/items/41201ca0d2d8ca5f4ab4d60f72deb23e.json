  "description": "Investigation Discovery has a new series they are filming in the Minneapolis area this week called THE UNSOLVED.  The series is focusing two hours on the Christopher Jenkins murder case.  Jenkins, a student at the University of Minnesota, was last seen Halloween night 2002 leaving the Lone Tree Bar after he was thrown out.   Four months later his body was found in the Mississippi river near the Horse Shoe Damn area.  Authorities at first ruled it an accidental drowning, but after four years changed it to a murder case.  \n\nAs part of the series, Investigation Discovery investigators are looking into the case and trying to come up with answers.  They are asking for your help.  If you have any knowledge of this case, please reach out and contact THE UNSOLVED team at 612/643-1410",
