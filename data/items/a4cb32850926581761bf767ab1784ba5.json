  "description": "The man, the myth, the legend Boris Diaw joins Logan and Raja on a veritable odyssey through his interests and career, starting with his travels around the world on his catamaran and close calls with wildlife on safaris (0:27). Then they talk about the rise and fall of the Steve Nash–era Phoenix Suns (20:14), how and why Boris was traded with Raja to the Charlotte Bobcats (37:50), and his unceremonious buyout in Charlotte, which led to a championship-winning stint in San Antonio (55:30). Finally, they get into his time with the Spurs: playing with Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Kawhi Leonard (1:00:07), guarding LeBron James in the NBA Finals (1:11:41), and getting his ring in 2014 (1:15:52). \nHosts: Logan Murdock and Raja Bell\nGuest: Boris Diaw\nAssociate Producer: Sasha Ashall\nLearn more about your ad choices.
