  "description": "<p>We present results of twisted plasma waves driven by twisted ponderomotive\nforce. With beating of two, co-propagating, Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) laser pulses with different frequencies and also\ndifferent twist indices, we can get twisted ponderomotive force.\nThree-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are used to demonstrate the\ntwisted plasma waves driven by lasers. The twisted plasma waves have an\nelectron density perturbation with a helical rotating structure. Different from\nthe predictions of the linear fluid theory, the simulation results show a\nnonlinear rotating current and a static axial magnetic field. Along with the\nrotating current is the axial OAM carried by particles in the twisted plasma\nwaves. Detailed theoretical analysis of twisted plasma waves is given too.\n</p>",
