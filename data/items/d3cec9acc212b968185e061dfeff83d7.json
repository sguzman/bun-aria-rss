  "description": "<p>Part 3 - Joy - Present Heart: The Universal Expressions of Love (2018-02-21) - <em>Joy</em> blossoms in the moments our hearts open boundlessly to reality, to the 10,000 joys and sorrows.</p> <p>This series reflects on four primary expressions of an awake, wise heart: lovingkindness, compassion, joy and equanimity. In each talk we explore the habitual patterning that blocks our full realization of these innate capacities, and the understandings and practices that nurture their unfolding.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely.
