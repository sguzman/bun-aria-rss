  "description": "Welcome back to Wall Street Unplugged! This week's episode is a special one. A lot of ground is covered as I have, not one... but two separate interviews. I am first joined by CEO Greg Smith. Listen in as Greg introduces his company, JDL Gold Corp., and explains how they have the recipe to become next \"superstar\" in the mining industry. After just their first week of trading, Greg talks about the company's future plans and projects going forward. This is not your typical mining company... and apart from the insiders, not many people have heard of it. However, JDL Gold might have the greatest shareholder base I have ever seen in the industry. Just wait until you hear this list... Our second guest is current managing director & portfolio manager at Point View Wealth Management, John Petrides [40:45]. As we enter earnings season, John and I talk about recent stock evaluations. At one point, John compares today's market to 2008! After six straight quarters of negative earnings growth, John shares his thoughts on these ridiculous consensus expectations. Then, to end the episode, John and I break down a few stock picks. This includes one of the worlds largest tech company, and a retailer that should be on everyone's radar.",
