  "description": "<p>In this episode of the Being Human is Good For Business Podcast, we meet a young leader with an international pedigree who found her experience of working with a leadership coach to be transformational as she sought to transition from her job with one of the Big Four accounting firms to work that she finds a lot more meaningful. </p><p>Our guest, Patricia Njoya, connected with <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/\">Trilogy Effect</a> founding partner <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/wendy-appel\">Wendy Appel</a> through a not-for-profit organization called <a href=\"https://tcfs.org/\">The Coaching Fellowship</a>, an organization dedicated to developing young women social impact leaders. </p><p>“I’ve volunteered with The Coaching Fellowship for a number of years now,” explains Wendy. “I’ve found it to be super rewarding because it blends two of my passions: social impact and supporting young women leaders.” </p><p>In this interview, Patricia shares how working with Wendy as her leadership coach taught her a lot about herself both as a person and as a leader.  She describes how she uses the Enneagram framework to understand her own reactions, behaviors, and perfectionist habits to make better choices. </p><p>Patricia also discusses how this coaching experience has taught her to be more open to others’ ideas and points of view, which allows her to be more adaptable to changing situations. She's now in her dream job with an organization called <a href=\"https://www.purprojet.com/\">PUR Projet</a>, a progressive environmental services company based in Paris.</p><p>“I had heard about the Enneagram and although I was curious about it, I was also a bit skeptical of its value,” says Patricia. “But once I started working with Wendy, I soon learned that I’m a Type 1, and I feel that this is 100 percent accurate. I have come to understand my blind spots and motivations, and this helps me better relate to others in my workplace.” </p><p>Listen to the podcast to learn: </p><ul><li>Techniques to be your best self at work</li><li>About tools to gain greater self-awareness </li><li>How finding meaningful work is the key to career success</li></ul><p>Links to helpful resources and information about some of the tools and concepts mentioned on the show:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/free-leadership-guidebook\">Trilogy Effect’s free leadership guidebook to be as your best self as a leader</a></li><li><a href=\"https://trilogyeffect.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f3bb4d65509a4554061667986&id=bc6ea99e78\">Our free newsletter, full of leadership advice and practical tips.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/InsideOut-Enneagram-Game-Changing-Guide-Leaders/dp/0984884203\">InsideOut Enneagram: The Game Changing Guide for Leaders, by Wendy Appel</a></li></ul><p> </p><p>We invite you to subscribe to the Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast on iTunes, Amazon, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio and Spotify (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
