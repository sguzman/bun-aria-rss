  "title": "ðŸš¨ Travis Kelce follows George Kittle by agreeing to massive extension - Emergency Podcast (Football 8/13)",
  "description": "George Kittle wasn't the only tight end that got paid big bucks on Thursday. Just a few hours after Kittle agreed to a record extension, his counterpart/rival Travis Kelce came to terms on a deal that could pay him nearly as much money. To recap an eventful August afternoon for TEs, Will Brinson welcomes Ryan Wilson and John Breech for their reactions (3:15). What does the timing of the deal say? Do the dollars make sense? When will it be Zach Ertz's turn? Then, the guys go through a couple more news items that occurredÂ since they last chatted (just a few hours ago). The Bills gave Dion Dawkins a huge extension of his own (20:45), a Seahawks rookie got cut for trying to sneak a female visitor into the team hotel (23:15) and it appears that Todd Gurley could be limited (30:45) That's just some bonus content on this Travis Kelce emergency podcast!\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts.Â \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @johnbreech, @ryanwilsonCBS\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visitÂ https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visitÂ https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
