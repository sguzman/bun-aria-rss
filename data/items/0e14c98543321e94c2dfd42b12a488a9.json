  "description": "<p>John writes \"I stepped out of my tent and turned on my spot light and Wes I’ll be honest I pissed my pants I was so scared. About 10 yards stood a family group of 4 or 5 creatures that stood about 10 feet tall the small ones were about 6 1/2 feet tall they screamed and whooped and threw rocks and it got much much worse. This is the most terrifying experience I’ve ever had and I haven’t gone back to this property since. I can’t tell you everything through email because this story would take about an hour or so to fully describe what I saw that night.”</p>",
