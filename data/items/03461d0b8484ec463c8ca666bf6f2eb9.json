  "description": "<p>Kirk Minihane is enraged to discover that someone in his operation posted a promotion for an Entercom show on KMS social media property. We investigate who in the KMS world is playing digital footsies with mortal enemies. Speaking of Entercom, the vaunted Digital Sports Network has become yet another casualty of the coronavirus economy. Did the Boston Globe's Shirley Leung use the newspaper she works for as a tool in her NIMBY fight? (0:42:30) We open to the phone lines to talk with Shirley the Magnificent and Ted, the gentleman whom Mike will be pushing around for the Dave Portnoy Memorial 5k (Sign up here: KirkMinihaneShow.com). Fireworks near the end of the show as Blind Mike walks out, leaving Steve and Kirk to pick up the pieces.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
