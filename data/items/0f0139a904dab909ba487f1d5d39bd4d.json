  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about Shannon Sharpe calling Julio Jones on air on Undisputed this morning, and Julio saying that he's \"outta there\" in Atlanta and that he wants to go somewhere he can win, Phil Mickelson becoming the oldest major champion ever after winning the PGA Championship at Kiawah Island, and Pat's weekend at the Mecum Auto Auction and the whole process and how exhilarating it was before welcoming Mecum Auto Auctioneer Matt Moravec to chat about Mecum, being bred to become an auctioneer, when he started, and why it's such an electric atmosphere (9:36-31:01). Later, Pat and AJ chat about the Julio Jones situation and which teams would aggressively pursue him, video of Aaron Rodgers in Hawaii with Shailene Woodley, Miles Teller, and his wife having a good time and how OTA's start this week, and how electric it was watching Phil win yesterday and what's going on in the NHL playoffs (33:19-1:41:49).
