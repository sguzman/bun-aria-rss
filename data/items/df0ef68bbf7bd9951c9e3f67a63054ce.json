  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, Russia has begun the invasion of eastern Ukraine under the pretext that there are two independent Russian provinces along the border. The unrest and guerilla warfare already occurring in these provinces was initiated and funded by the Russians. What if Putin doesn't stop at Ukraine, and rolls straight through to conquer the Balkans or other areas of eastern Europe? Its clear that our enemies are watching this just as they watched Biden's failure in Afghanistan. If Putin is not stopped he will drag us all into World War III. Then, Canada continues to threaten protesters with criminal investigations and financial sanctions. The Canadian government is embracing totalitarianism and strengthening itself as a police state. Later, James Carafano from the Heritage Foundation joins the show from Hungary, noting that Putin has slowly amassed a presence in several neighboring states and noted that this incursion will not stop with you Ukraine as this is a long game to regain former soviet states. Carafano says that this aggression is in response to Biden's weakness and defensive responses instead of taking an offensive posture as Trump did. Afterward, Matt Schlapp Chairman of the American Conservative Union calls in to discuss his new book \"The Desecrators: Defeating the Cancel Culture Mob and Reclaiming One Nation Under God.\" Schlapp added that conservatives are the largest voting bloc in America and need to act like it.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
