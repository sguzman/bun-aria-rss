  "description": "<p>On this episode, we’ll be talking more about the Folsom archeological site with Steve Rinella and Dr. David Melzter. We’re going to learn about gourmet butchering and what ancient hunters did with the meat. We'll discuss how the Folsom hunters likely lived and we’ll learn the science behind carbon dating. We'll bring up the controversy the Folsom site stirred up with those that believe the bible and we’ll even talk a bit about the arrival of man on planet earth. Host Clay Newcomb gives his personal positions on the book of Genesis as it relates to the age of the earth and the antiquity of humans, and we’ll be continuing to hack away at the question of why any of this is important or relevant. The story is robust, the drama is thick, and you could cut the suspense with Folsom stone point.</p><p><br></p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p><p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p><p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p><p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
