  "description": "Olivier Zunz is the author of Philanthropy in America: A History (Princeton University Press 2014). The paperback addition of the book has recently been published with a new preface from the author. Zunz is Commonwealth Professor of History at the University of Virginia.\n\nThe book tracks the origins of philanthropy in America as a pact between the very rich and reformers. This was a movement that began in the Northeast, but then spread to the South where the construction of schools for African American children dominated the philanthropic agenda. The book also unearths the historic legal precedents related to how nonprofit organizations are regulated today, the introduction of tax exemption, and prohibitions on lobbying. In sum, Zunz places philanthropy, big and small, into the center of a conversation about the development of American democratic practices. It is a worthy ready for those interested in American politics, the role of the US in world affairs, and the nonprofit sector.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
