    "media:description": "Do you feel like a deer in headlights when making investment decisions these days? If so, you're not alone. We're dealing with one of the oddest investing periods in the past two decades. It's enough to freeze most people in their tracks. So in this episode of Making Money With Matt McCall, Matt invites Austin Root, chief investment officer at Stansberry Asset Management, to help navigate this volatile market.\n\nAustin and Matt discuss many topics… from investor sentiment to key catalysts to what Austin's clients are most concerned about. Austin shares how he's positioned in two top-performing sectors in the market heading into this year… and discusses the sectors he's looking at today as potential buying opportunities.\n\nPlease note: Stansberry & Associates Investment Research (\"Stansberry Research\") and Stansberry Asset Management (\"SAM\") are separately operated and are overseen by different boards. SAM has no special or early access to Stansberry Research's investment research. SAM receives information from Stansberry Research just like any other Stansberry Research subscriber does – after any material is published.\n\n#investing #bearmarket #stockmarket \n\n00:00 Austin Root Introduction\n3:00 AAII Investor Sentiment \n6:48 Midterm Election Rally\n9:17 Where is the Opportunity?\n17:30 Austin's Advice to his Clients\n23:15 Investment for the Next 10 Years\n\n➡️  Follow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/StansberryResearch \n➡️  Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/stansberry \n➡️  Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/stansberry_research\n➡️  Follow us on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stanberry-research",
