  "description": "<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #72</strong>, another \"Soul Series\" interview, my guest is author and minister <strong>Maria Felipe</strong>, who joined me for a fantastic conversation that can change lives. We discussed her unique story going from a successful <em>(but ultimately unfulfilling)</em> career as an actress, model, and Latina boxing announcer to spiritual teacher and motivational speaker.</p> <p>And we talked about her brand new book, <em><strong>Live Your Happy: Get Out of Your Own Way and Find the Love Within</strong></em> <em>(New World Library)</em>, in which she shares more than twenty years of experience studying and living the principles from A Course in Miracles (ACIM). Live Your Happy is not a philosophic explanation of the Course; it is a practical guide for living it.</p> <p>The book includes real-world examples from the author’s life and from her students’ experiences. In nine crystal-clear chapters, she shows readers how to get the “cuckoo voice of the ego” out of the way, connect with their “inner teacher,” and access personal power and strength.</p> <p><em>“This book is a simple but not necessarily easy guide to learning to live your happy. I will share practical spiritual tools to get you there, along with stories of my own journey and of people I’ve counseled. I empower my clients not by telling them what to do but by helping them understand that they have the answer within,” she writes. “I ask that you trust me and be gentle with yourself. Step by step, I will train you to listen to your right mind. In turn, you will become free to live in happiness consistently. You will even be happy when you have so-called ‘problems.’ How’s that for a miracle?”</em></p> <p>About: a Cuban-American born in Miami, <strong>Maria Felipe</strong> stands at 5’9\" tall with a towering personality to match. Her charisma has captivated thousands of viewers across the United States and beyond, as her pursuit of an acting career resulted in dozens of appearances in national commercials, hosting successful TV shows (including World Wrestling Federation shows with live audiences of 20,000), and traveling the world as a model.</p> <p>After success in her field she felt called inward, and studied to become a Reverend with Pathways of Light, an accredited religious school inspired by A Course in Miracles.</p> <p>Maria is a dynamic speaker in both Spanish and English. She leads services monthly at Unity Church in Burbank, where she created the church's first regular Spanish service, as well as performing services in English. Her talks now draw both Spanish and English speakers from all over Southern California. She also leads workshops.</p> <p>Maria has created her own channel on You Tube by hosting MariaCoconut TV, a show designed to share and expand the message of love by interviewing other spiritual leaders. In 2013, Maria been a regular guest on Unity Radio, Awakening Together Radio and Center Of Light Radio.</p> <p>She’s also recently appeared as a motivational speaker on TV shows and news programs for Univison, Telemundo and CNN. She has also spoken alongside prominent teachers David Hoffmeister and Gary Renard in Los Angeles, Mexico, and Greece.</p> <p>People magazine once referred to Maria Felipe as ’’Una Campeona Sin Rival,’’ which means a champion without rival. This is an apt label for this young, vivacious and talented actress, host, and minister. And the gifts she can share with countless others continue to multiply as she allows the expression of her talents to be guided by the inner light of God.</p> <p>To learn more about <strong>Maria's</strong> work, visit: <a href=\"https://www.mariafelipe.org/\" target= \"_blank\">https://www.mariafelipe.org/</a>.</p>",
