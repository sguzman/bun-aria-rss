  "description": "Today on the show, as we all suffer through another Robert Mueller news cycle, I’d like to turn our attention back to the story of Erica Thomas. She claimed she was verbally assaulted by a racist white man, but now the police report is out, and it’s very bad for her. When a race hoax is exposed, I think we should talk about it, rather than simply move on. Also, an actress comes out as pansexual, even though the term pansexual has no meaning. And finally, Forever 21 comes up with the most unintentionally hilarious marketing gimmick of all time. Date: 07-24-2019\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
