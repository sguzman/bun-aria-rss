  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 7/25/18",
  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, it’s great that President Trump announced that his administration and the European Union president will work toward zero tariffs and zero subsidies – this has always been the Levin position! If it happens, this will ultimately result in a more prosperous America, rather than seek protectionist tariffs to shield American industries against global competition. Then, the pseudo media always tries to drive the narrative that Trump's dealings with former lawyer Michael Cohen are a violation of campaign law. But, we hear from Bradley Smith, the former Chairman of the Federal Election Commission, saying he's done nothing wrong. Later, the media continues to malign Trump despite asking off-topic questions of the President; asking about Michael Cohen during his meeting on tariffs with the President of the European Union. The purpose of a free press and a press conference is not for the press, it’s for the American people, and the press are not our representatives, especially when they take sides. But when individuals like Kaitlan Collins and Jim Acosta from CNN abuse the process, to push an agenda and embarrass the president, we've clearly missed the mark. Finally, Gregg Jarrett calls in to discuss his new book - The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
