They are place holders for &#39;someone doing some coding&#39;. If we actually saw someone doing some coding, I think we&#39;d roll our eyes for another reason.</p>\n<p>This model probably works for any exposure of any technical area in a movie from coding to cooking to sailing to farming. Rather than criticizing the creators of the movie for lack of research, it is so much easier to recognize these moments as symbolic fillers with a dramatic twist.</p>",
