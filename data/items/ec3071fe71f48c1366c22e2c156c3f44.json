  "title": "Is being disorganised part of the process - with Anna Macdonald [181]",
  "description": "<p>Have you ever convinced yourself that being disorganised is an essential part of the creative process - but get constantly frustrated by looking for images or planning projects? \"If I'm tidy I'm not a true artist\" is one belief Anna Macdonald had. Today Anna and Alice talk about accepting the way you are and how to find the mental space to support your route to becoming the artist you want to be.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We talk about choosing your words carefully, and the curse of being 'busy'. There's a difference between being busy and productive and as a teacher, artist and mum, Anna shares her approach which has allowed her to develop her art and life. We discuss the different ways we use a bullet journal, and also the overwhelm when it comes into organising our digital life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Find more on Anna's website <a href=\"https://www.annafmacdonald.com/\">annafmacdonald.com</a> where you can sign up for a free class this October and find out more about her Artist Laptop course and the Bullet Journal course <a href=\"https://www.annafmacdonald.com/courses\">for artists HERE</a></p>\n<p>Find Anna on Instagram at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/annafmacdonaldart/\">@annafmacdonaldart</a></p>\n<p><strong>Also Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Alice and Anna both use Leuchtturm notebooks for bullet journals</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gommie_poem/\">@gommie_poem</a> on Instagram</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Find Alice and Louise at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
