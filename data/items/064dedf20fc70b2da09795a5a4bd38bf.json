  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week, we’re talking about a beloved contemporary romance, the first in Julie James’s FBI/US Attorney series —  <em>Something About You</em>. This one is a fascinating look at a series connected by not the romance standard of friends or families, but by work. Set in Chicago, it contains all the mystery of a romantic suspense without ever straying from the contemporary romance path. The characters are sharp, the writing is clever, the structure is fascinating, and it will likely make you read the rest of the series almost immediately. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thanks to Avon Books, publisher of Lynsay Sands’s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3vHR7kW\"><em>Immortal Rising</em></a><em>, </em>and Kelly Cain, author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KCpHC3\"><em>An Acquired Taste</em></a>, for sponsoring the episode.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://juliejames.com\">Julie James</a>&nbsp;is the author of 9 books in the FBI/US Attorney series.
