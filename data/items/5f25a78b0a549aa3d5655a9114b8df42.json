  "title": "537 - Chris and Nani on Lake Eyasi, Tanzania",
  "description": "<p>Chris and Nani manage the amazing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://entara.co.tz/kisima-ngeda-camp/\">Kisima Ngeda Camp</a>, on Lake Eyasi, Tanzania. Chris grew up nearby after his German parents moved to Africa on an impulse, and stayed on, while Nani stumbled into this oasis while adventuring through as a penniless, apparently fearless traveler. The story of how they met, fell in love, and built a world will make you feel good about life, people, and chance. (I never got around to taking a photo of Chris and Nani, but they’re even more attractive than you’re imagining.)</p><p>Intro music “Brightside of the Sun,” by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\">Basin and Range</a>. “N'Jariñu Garab,” by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cheikhlomusic.com/\">Cheikh Lo</a>; Outro: “Smoke Alarm,” by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.carsieblanton.com/\">Carsie Blanton</a>.</p><p>To receive bonus material, please consider becoming a paid subscriber.</p><p>And now something extra just for you lovely Substack subscribers, further proof that Africa really does look like Africa:</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
