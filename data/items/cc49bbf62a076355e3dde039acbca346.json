  "description": "<p>Ever wonder if it’s possible to build a flourishing career and global brand, without going to college?</p><p>Growing up in San Diego and Tampa, <a href=\"http://www.rebeccaminkoff.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rebecca Minkoff</a> (http://www.rebeccaminkoff.com/) learned at a young age, if she wanted something, she’d have to work for it, or make it herself. That work ethic led her to begin making her own clothes in her early teens, then designing and creating costumes for theater in high-school.</p><p>Desperate to leave Tampa behind as soon as she could, but not feeling college, she headed to New York at 18 years old and began to work in the world of fashion and design, learning everything from design to all aspects of business. She began making her own designs and, working tirelessly, created a single t-shirt that would seed the launch of a business that would grow to produce an iconic line of handbags, apparel, accessories, footwear, jewelry and build a global brand.</p><p>And, more recently, she’s headed into entirely new territory with the launch of her own podcast, <a href=\"https://www.rebeccaminkoff.com/pages/superwomen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Superwomen</a> (https://www.rebeccaminkoff.com/pages/superwomen) which celebrates the multidimensionality of women, from CEOs to chefs, entrepreneurs to instructors who shape culture, change the world, and lift each other up along the way.</p><p>We talk about all of this and much more in today’s Good Life Project episode.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
