  "description": "<p>Decolonizing Our Food System | This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://paleovalley.com/promos/drhyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paleovalley</a></p><br><p>Many of our sustainable farming practices actually stem from African and indigenous roots. However, the division of land, government subsidies, and financial resources that are available favor white farmers. In fact, since 1920 African-American farmers have lost over 14 million acres of land. This decline of Black, Brown, and Native farmers has had far-reaching negative impacts. It means a decline of wealth and continued generational financial hardship. It means a disconnection from history and cultural practices that connect people to the land. It also means that these communities don’t have access to the same fresh, healthy foods as predominantly white communities</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman discusses these topics with Leah Penniman.</p><br><p>Leah Penniman is a Black Kreyol educator, farmer, author, and food justice activist from Soul Fire Farm in Grafton, NY. She co-founded Soul Fire Farm in 2010 with the mission to end racism in the food system and reclaim our ancestral connection to land.&nbsp;</p><br><p>As Co-Executive Director, Leah is part of a team that facilitates powerful food sovereignty programs—including farmer training for Black and Brown people, a subsidized farm food distribution program for communities living under food apartheid, and domestic and international organizing toward equity in the food system. Her book, Farming While Black: Soul Fire Farm's Practical Guide to Liberation on the Land is a love song for the land and her people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Find Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation with Leah Penniman: <a href=\"https://drmarkhyman.lnk.to/LeahPenniman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/LeahPenniman</a></p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Paleovalley.
