  "description": "The 2018 NFL Draft is almost halfway home and Chris Trapasso and Ryan Wilson are joining Will Brinson to recap the second day of the draft. Fun fact: Wilson, a Steelers fan, owns an Oklahoma State sweatshirt for no reason other than it was $5 at TJ Maxx. Was it a SIGN? Maybe! Trapasso is huge on Mason Rudolph and James Washington, so they debate whether the picks were good for Pittsburgh. They also dive into the great second day for the Giants, David Akers destroying the Cowboys fans, whether or not the Colts had a good group of draft picks in the second round, if the Bears are helping Mitchell Trubisky, whether Josh Rosen is a winner already, what the Oakland Raiders are doing, how the Patriots are hiding their Jimmy G situation and much, much more.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
