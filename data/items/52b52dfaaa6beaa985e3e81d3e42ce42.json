  "description": "<p>You don’t typically think of bridges as architecture, not the highway ones, particularly.  There are about 600,000 in the US, with only a few dozen getting anyone excited, and most of those like the Golden Gate Bridge and the Verrazano Narrows Bridge were built nearly 100 years ago.  Today from the UK we welcome <strong>Martin Knight,</strong> an architect whose heralded bridges worldwide create portals to cities while helping cars, trains, and pedestrian traffic from one place to another. Founded in 2006, his firm won several high-profile international design projects and what soon will be the longest bridge in Helsinki, Finland.  He joins us from just outside of London in a place called Taplow, which is an award-winning 1966 Modernist area designed by <strong>Eric Lyons</strong>.</p>",
