OP asks the neighbor to keep it down, but of course that never works. So, OP decides to get some prorevenge against his douchebag neighbor by taking a closer look at his neighbor's illegal activities. OP figures out that his neighbor is commuting a serious federal crime, so he reports it to the authorities and then sits back to enjoy the fireworks!</p>\n",
