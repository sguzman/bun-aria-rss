  "description": "<p>This week, in Montville, Ohio, an act of kindness is rewarded with an act of terrible murderous brutality. The killer seems to have been training for this moment, for his entire messed up life. All seems open and shut, with the killer brazenly sending bloody & threatening notes to everyone involved, including the victim's families & the prosecutor. In the end, the blame isn't put on a bad upbringing, or even genetics, but instead, it's placed squarely on video games. GTA III, to be exact. But instead of using this for a defense, the killer decides to praise Hitler & make more threats! Just when you think it's all over... Another, even more shocking murder pops out of nowhere!!</p><p><br></p><p>Along the way, we find out that railroad work camp is not a privilege, that you can't blame all the world's murder on video games, and that some people just can't be fixed!!</p><p><br></p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo and Jimmie Whisman</p><p><br></p><p>New episodes every Thursday!</p><p><br></p><p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com and use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com</p><p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports!</p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on...</p><p><br></p><p>twitter.com/@murdersmall</p><p>facebook.com/smalltownpod</p><p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder</p><p><br></p><p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
