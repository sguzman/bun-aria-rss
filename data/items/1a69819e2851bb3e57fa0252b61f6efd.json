Coming up on today&#8217;s show:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning languages 140 characters at a time with TwitterLearn</li>\n<li>Introducing our Community Managers</li>\n<li>New features for Radio Lingua premium members</li>\n<li>Announcing our Summer Sale</li>\n<li>Updates on the latest shows</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>TwitterLearn</strong> It seems that in the past few months the entire world has started twittering, helped by the huge number of celebrities using the microblogging service. Some write it off as another banal social media fad, but here at Radio Lingua we&#8217;ve been using Twitter for many months to update listeners on the latest podcast episodes and other news from Radio Lingua. This summer, we&#8217;ve decided to take our twittering a stage further and we&#8217;ve designed a course in French, Italian and Spanish for beginners, delivered in daily tweets of 140 characters, and podcasts of 1 minute 40 seconds. You can join Twitter at  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/\">http://twitter.com</a> and follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/learnspanish\">@learnspanish</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/learnfrench\">@learnfrench</a> or <a href=\"http://twitter.com/learnitalian\">@learnitalian</a> to start your micro language-learning course.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Managers</strong> This summer we&#8217;re joined by three new members of the Radio Lingua team. Ellie, Katie and Marylou are going to be working over the summer on developing our learning communities on the website and they&#8217;re also working on the TwitterLearn courses. Initially they&#8217;ll be helping to develop the conversations on our Facebook pages. We really hope that Ellie, Katie and Marylou enjoy working with Radio Lingua over the summer months. If you&#8217;re a Facebook user, head over to the Facebook pages for <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/coffeebreakspanish\">Coffee Break Spanish</a>, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Coffee-Break-French/25593416122?ref=ts\">Coffee Break French</a>, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Show-Time-Spanish/48009449677?ref=ts\">Show Time Spanish</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Radio-Lingua/91097236722\">Radio Lingua</a> where the conversations are increasing daily.
