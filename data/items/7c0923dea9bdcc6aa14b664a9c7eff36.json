    "media:description": "For those that adored the Manic Street Preachers in the early 90s, no other band will ever compare. At first mixing political rhetoric and literary wit with populist glam punk, they kicked back against the impartial shoegaze, baggy and acid House scenes, and, for the first time since the Smiths, they felt like a British band that actually had something to say. \n\nTheir masterwork 1994’s The Holy Bible, formed of dark metallic post-punk, tangled head on with the worst impulses of human-kind, masterminded by their driving force “guitarist,” Richey Edwards. But if one gazes too deeply into the abyss, there is a chance that person might get lost. This is New British Canon and this is the story of The Holy Bible. “4 stone 7 pounds”\n\n#ManicStreetPreachers #TheHolyBible #MusicDocumentary\n\nFact-checking by Serenity Autumn.\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Clouds (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nJesse Gallagher - The Golden Present\nLuar - Anchor (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\n\n00:00 Prologue\n01:11 Manic Street Preachers: An Introduction\n08:42 \"I Want Everyone Corrupt\": Faster\n13:29 \"The Sky is Swollen Black\": Creating The Holy Bible\n17:35 \"Such Beautiful Dignity in Self Abuse\": 4st 7lb\n24:58 The Aftermath of The Holy Bible\n27:27 \"Libraries Gave Us Power\": A Design For Life\n\nYou can also follow me here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrashTheory\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TrashTheoryYT\n\nOr support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TrashTheory",
