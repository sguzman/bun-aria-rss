    "media:description": "A short Lab tour video I made back in 2015. My lab back then was in a modest, rundown damp shed in our house. Even though I’d already uploaded this video on youtube around that same time, I had to take it down some years ago due to copyright issues (I used a copyrighted music as background). \nOver the years since I made this video, my lab has evolved so much more, with new concrete housing, and new equipments and general labware acquired along the way. I plan on making a proper lab tour video as well, of my current lab, as it stands today.\nBut for now, I hope you’ll enjoy this small tour of my cherished space as much as I do. \nAnd Please don’t mind the horrible video quality; video recording was from a android jellybean-era phone.\n\n#ThomasTKtungnung #UniqueHobbies",
