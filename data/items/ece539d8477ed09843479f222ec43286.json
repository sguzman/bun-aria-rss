It gets even more disturbing, when these exact same strange details are found to have existed in a murder, 7 years earlier, including matching cans of hair mousse. These details tie both of these awful acts to one man, who was raised seemingly to do this exact kind of thing. You can't help but wonder if there's more bodies, or other terrible acts that just never came to light!!</p><p> </p><p>Along the way, we find out that Hawaii doesn't need any mottos, that how you're raised has a definite impact on your future sicknesses, and that no on that hears this will want to use hair mousse, ever again!!</p><p> </p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman</p><p> </p><p>New episodes every Thursday!</p><p> </p><p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com & use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com</p><p> </p><p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports!</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on...</p><p>twitter.com/@murdersmall</p><p>facebook.com/smalltownpod</p><p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder</p><p> </p><p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
