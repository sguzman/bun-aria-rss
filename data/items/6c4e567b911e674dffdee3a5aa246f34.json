  "description": "<p>NO ENTREPRENEUR CAN BE SUCCESSFUL WITH SOMEONE WHO ISN'T INDEPENDENT<br />\nAs you know, it's important to continually grow (especially if you're an entrepreneur). I'm not excluded from that.

He gives me advice for my next ten years but also gives you invaluable advice on so many topics that you won't hear anywhere else.<br />\nGary is known for his unapologetic truth-telling attitude.
