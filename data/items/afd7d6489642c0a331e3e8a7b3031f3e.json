  "description": "The novel coronavirus — and America’s disastrously inept response — has shuttered the economy, leaving factories quiet, businesses closed, workers unable to do their jobs. Pulling out of this hole will require an economic effort unlike anything in recent history. We don’t just need a bit of stimulus. We will need a remobilization. But towards what end?\n\nThis is the first episode in a four-part series exploring how to rebuild the economy after COVID. Future episodes will look at a Green New Deal, a children-centric economy, and a universal basic income. But I wanted to start at the beginning. What can the government do? What is the economy for? Why should we trust politicians, rather than markets, to allocate resources on this scale?\n\nZach Carter is a senior reporter at HuffPost and the author of a new book, The Price of Peace: Money, Democracy, and the Life of John Maynard Keynes. The book, which has widely been hailed as one of the year’s best, is a remarkable biography animated by a question many of us have forgotten Keynes asked: What values should guide an economy? What are the higher purposes economic policy should serve? Carter and I discuss:\n\nWhat Keynes would advise the US government to do if he were alive today\n\nHow good domestic economic management can reduce the risk of global war\n\nWhether economics should be about maximizing consumer preferences or pursuing a social purpose\n\nThe limits of democracy\n\nThe role advertising plays in economic preferences\n\nWhy the gold standard was — and is — a terrible idea\n\nWhy Democratic politicians are stuck in the 1990s when it comes to their thinking on budget deficits\n\nModern Monetary Theory (and its discontents)\n\n\nAnd much more.\n\nBook recommendations:\nThe Globaists by Quinn Slobodian\nThe Deluge by Adam Tooze \nNova by Samuel R. Delany\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith: His Life, His Politics, His Economics by Richard Parker \n\n\nThis podcast is part of a larger Vox project called The Great Rebuild, which is made possible thanks to support from Omidyar Network, a social impact venture that works to reimagine critical systems and the ideas that govern them, and to build more inclusive and equitable societies.
