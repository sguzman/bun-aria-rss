  "description": "<p>Nicki Kindersley and Oystein Rolandsen talk to us about their latest article on violence against civilians in the wars of South Sudan. Through a broad range of empirical evidence, they trace the practices and norms of war in the region from the onset of the British colonial period in the late nineteenth century to present day. In doing so, they reveal that local populations have long been apprehended as strategic assets to be both targeted and controlled, problematising the categories of civilian and military actors that international agencies rely upon to guide their interventions. Hosted by Antoine Bousquet.</p> <p>SD Podcast Number 26: Nicki Kindersley and Oystein Rolandsen: Who are the Civilians in the Wars of South Sudan?</p>",
