  "description": "This week, the gals return to their hometowns to investigate some sh*t that went down a little too close to home. Topics include a family man turned cold-blooded murderer, an ex-landlord with a grudge, and a domestic dispute that was a little overkill (literally). Pop open a bottle of Winc's fruity Ville Basse Merlot, tell your parents you're coming home for the weekend, consider investing in an elevator, be nice to your office manager, and tune in for Hometown Gory.    This ep is supported by TalkSpace.
