  "description": "<p>Savannah Dexter is a singer on her rise to fame, a Southern Belle and strong woman at heart, and most importantly - a guest on Bunnie's game of \"Sexy Truth or Dare\" this week. Things get wild on the game, and then Savannah joins Bunnie for a deep conversation on getting out of domestic violence, conquering her own demons, and embracing the high road. Savannah also talks about what's really going on with Adam, and what we can expect from her in 2021. Is it possible for a babe to be this hot and inspiring at the same time? We think yes. </p> <p><strong>Say Hi to Bunnie: </strong></p> <p><a href=\"linktr.ee/Bunniexo\">linktr.ee/Bunniexo</a></p> <p>Savannah's instagram: <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/savannahdextermusic/?hl=en\">@savannahdextermusic  </a></p> <p>\"You don't have to be what was projected on you. You can be better than that.\" - Savannah </p>",
