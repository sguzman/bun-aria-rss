  "description": "Hi listeners! If you’re into art and into movies, then I’ve got a special treat for you. I recently featured on a bonus episode, “The Pickup Shot,” for the Subgenre podcast, hosted by Josh Dasal (and truth be told, if the name wasn’t a dead giveaway: he’s my husband). In this episode, we chat about all the art in one of the artsiest films of the past two decades, The Thomas Crown Affair, from 1999.\nWant more movies, and more of me and Josh? Be sure to subscribe to Subgenre, and I’ll be guest-hosting a full-length episode of Subgenre, releasing in April— the theme of this season is “Charming Thieves,” and the movie I’ve chosen is a personal (and Dasal Fam) favorite.
