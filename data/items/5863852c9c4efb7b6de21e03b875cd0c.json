  "description": "<p>The DC Sleuth is on the trail of racial and gender inequality at one of New England's largest public media outlets. Comedian Shane Gillis blows of the KMS to join a tongue-tied KFC on KFC Radio. Joe Rogan and Bill Maher side with Blind Mike in the debate over Louis C.K. Mike invites his intern to a company dinner in Miami, whereupon we discover that Mike plans to share a hotel room -- and a bed -- with his intern next week (0:49:25). The great Harry Minihane makes his debut on the Kirk Minihane Show to break down the presidential election, women's athletics, and the upcoming Royal Rumble (1:10:30). Minihane revisits his criticism of an all-too-convenient Greg Bedard column about Aaron Hernandez pissing on a taxi. The Ringer's Bill Simmons has some very odd thoughts about the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. (2:06:45).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
