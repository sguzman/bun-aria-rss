  "description": "Join Mike Alkin for the maiden voyage of The Mike Alkin Show--Talking Stocks Over a Beer! In this episode, you’ll hear about an industry where the risk/reward ratio is one of the best available anywhere. As Mike interviews Jordan Trimble, CEO of Skyharbour Resources, you‘ll discover the state of the uranium market today… The trigger that set off a major bear market in uranium... And why the market is about to move much higher very quickly. You’ll learn… How uranium exploration companies have survived a major bear market… Why global demand is increasing… the nations that are driving demand… and why there is tremendous upward price elasticity that could send prices soaring. Jordan exposes the false narrative about uranium demand and shares the truth (it’s the opposite of what you hear through the rumor mill)... Where the richest uranium deposits in the world are located... The forces that have created a uranium deficit—even with secondary uranium supplies— which will take uranium prices to new heights... How major uranium miners are forcing prices higher... A major IPO that is also pushing prices up... How changes to public commodities markets are adding momentum to upward price action... Why a $50 spot price is a very realistic expectation—and how that will create parabolic growth for equity investors... Why ”grade is king” when it comes to uranium—and where you find the highest grade uranium in the world… How Skyharbour is using drones to improve the ability to discover new uranium deposits… and a unique new mining technique that will drive extraction costs down… ease permitting requirements… and minimize environmental impact… And how that could drive improved returns for equity investors. Skyharbour’s growth plans for the next 6 months, including its specific financial situation and exit strategy... Plus, how it plans to take advantage of the macroeconomic shifts occurring today… And what investors might expect from the company as a result. Finally, Mike wraps up with an educational segment in which he shares a surprising nugget of wisdom: Why “mom & pop investors” have a big advantage over professional investors… and exactly what actions you should take to win against the pros. There’s a ton of wisdom packed into today’s episode—so be sure to listen closely!",
