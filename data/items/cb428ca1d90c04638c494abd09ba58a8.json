  "description": "Hey HBs! We're here with Red, White, and Royal Blue by Casey McQuinston! It's an enemies to lovers romance about the First Son of the United States and a Prince of England. OMG. The writing is stunning, the banter is delectable, and the romance is full-body-tingle-inducing. It's the best book either of us read in 2019. \n Bonus Content: Melody's drunk on hot chocolate, Rooster has several new jobs and worried Erin with her snoot problems, ROYAL BONERS, *Bing Boong Bong* Turkey Bombs with Erin, and so much more! \n We're running a design contest!
