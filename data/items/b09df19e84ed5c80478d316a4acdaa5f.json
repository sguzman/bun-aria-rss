  "description": "<p>Today we share a sample from our new Word on Fire Institute course titled <a href= \"https://wordonfire.institute/courses/faith-science-and-sin/\"><strong> \"Faith, Science, and Sin\"</strong></a> taught by Dr. Christopher Baglow.</p> <p>Dr. Baglow considers the mysteries of the Catholic faith in dialogue with scientific discoveries, allowing us to avoid the shallowness that John Paul II says debases the Gospel and leaves us ashamed before history.</p> <p>This course introduces us to some of the richest insights of the Catholic intellectual tradition. We confront the problem of evil amidst God’s good creation and consider these fundamental questions: What makes being human so special? How might modern science become a stepping-stone rather than a stumbling block to understanding what we believe?</p> <h2><strong>Links</strong></h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://wordonfire.institute\"><strong>Join the Word on Fire Institute!</strong></a></li> </ul> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --> <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> <em>Do you like this podcast? <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bishopbarron\">Become a patron</a> and get some great perks for helping, like free books, bonus content, and more.
