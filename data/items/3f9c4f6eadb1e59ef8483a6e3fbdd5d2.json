  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear about some Pokémon-themed Linux rootkits. An evolved Linux Trojan is herding I0T botnets. Social media monitoring leads to convictions of jihadist plotters in Australia and the UK. Pegasus spyware and NSO Group's pricelist. Election hacking on four continents. Are the Shadow Brokers engaged in intelligence or influence operations? (In any case, no one's really bidding on the Equation Group code the Brokers say they're auctioning.) The FBI releases information on its investigation into former Secretary of State Clinton's email. Accenture Labs' Malek Ben Salem describes frameworks for Industrial IoT. And for a while it looked like cyber high noon at the G20 talks.",
