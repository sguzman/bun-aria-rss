    "media:description": "The technical term for modern humans is Homo Sapiens Sapiens, we are the current iteration of a genus going back two million years. There were however, obviously many species of humans who did not go on. Who for whatever reason could not adapt to their environments well enough to carry on their DNA. Examples include, Homo Neanderthalensis, Homo Erectus, and Homo Floresiensis. In the novel, Blindsight, Peter Watts, merely adds an additional species to that list, they evolved in a different way, the wrong way.\n\nThis particular species of human lacked the ability to synthesize the protein, protocadherin - Y, which other species of humans produced naturally. Their brains and bodies were different as well, they were smarter, stronger, and faster than other humans. And in the earlier eras of humanity, when myth and legend were still being formed they preyed upon us in the night. Ancient humanity was only able to drive them to extinction when they discovered that the creatures had an aversion to right angles. This trait had developed naturally through some fluke of genetics. It was seemingly neutral at first as right angles do not form very often in nature. But once this fact was revealed to humanity, they drove them back into the darkness, seemingly forever. Until many eons later science brought them back.\n\nGet this book: https://amzn.to/3qZF27n\n\nCHECK OUT MY NEW GRAPHIC NOVEL: https://www.quinnhoward.net/theliebehindthestar\n\nArt: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rWiriwUewTnuuul0ZT4N4eV2yoHyO9zJCV9CV5qp9Ro/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nMusic: https://youtu.be/ZHLcZxOJLAU \n\nBlindsight Fan Trailer: https://youtu.be/VkR2hnXR0SM\n\nFOLLOW QUINN ON TWITTER: Twitter: https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRE\n\nThree-Body Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXGGVBzHLUfIzEhovpQJ2ENiNvJoOD2A\nH.P.
