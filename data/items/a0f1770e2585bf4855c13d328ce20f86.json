She’s the first–and at this time only–Chinese American movie star.&nbsp;But behind the scenes...she is reaching the end of her rope. How did a Chinese American girl from a poor family defy expectations to become an international star? And what is now fueling her Hollywood rebirth?</p><br><p>Thank you to our guests: Professor Shirley Lim, author of Anna May Wong: Performing the Modern; and actor Michelle Krusiec, from Netflix's \"Hollywood.\"</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
