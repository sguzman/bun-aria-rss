  "description": "<p>We're returning to the great sport of Moguls to talk to Australian Olympian Sophie Ash. Sophie tells us about her family's history in skiing and what brought her into Moguls in the first place. We go over her experience in Beijing and what it was like competing during the Olympics during the pandemic. Sophie also tells us about her art and award winning Moguls film she made. We also question her on the possibilities of a 2nd Moguls event being added for future Olympics, as well as who on the Australian team she would pick for a team event. It's another great interview covering the most recent Winter Olympics that you'll need to download now to hear all about.</p>",
