  "description": "<p>The eastern side of the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, is closed in by mountains. On the cityâ€™s west side, a mesa rises out of the Rio Grande Valley.</p>\n\n\n<p>In 2005, subdivisions and new housing were being built along the West Mesa. The construction pressed up against the vast desert that stretches beyond where you will find tumbleweeds, high tension wires and trash. It is a desolate isolated spot.</p>\n\n\n<p>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-27-west-mesa-bone-collector/\"><strong><a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-27-west-mesa-bone-collector\">casefilepodcast.com/case-27-west-mesa-bone-collector</a></strong></a></p>\n",
