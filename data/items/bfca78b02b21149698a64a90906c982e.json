  "description": "<p><em><strong>Not Over, But Alongside.</strong></em> Today, Pastor Suzie Lind joins Mike and Tim to conclude a conversation that started two weeks ago about fighting back against a religious right that is looking for power in order to mandate morality. How do we approach this practically and not rhetorically? What does a cruciform life look like when we can see others in our tribe exerting power over? How do we not become that which we resist? What of the fear of Christians openly embracing and advocating violence?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mike brings in some content on what it means to be not-of-this-world. How did Jesus speak to Israel resisting Rome? Who are we in that conversations and how do we apply Jesus's specific words then to now? How do we remain a people of hope when so many in our own tribe advocate fear???</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
