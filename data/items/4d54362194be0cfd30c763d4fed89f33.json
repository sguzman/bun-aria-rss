  "title": "Credential Stuffing and Account Takeover -- The Business View",
  "description": "Account takeovers (ATOs), in which criminals impersonate legitimate account owners in order to take control of an account, cause tremendous pain for businesses in all industries. This pain may be monetary, such as losses from stolen accounts, but may also include a number of related problems, like regulatory and legal issues, lost customers, and the inability to gain new consumers due to a lack of trust. Losses from ATOs and new account fraud are estimated at more than $10 billion annually in the United States alone.",
