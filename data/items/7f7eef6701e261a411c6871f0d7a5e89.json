  "title": "Uncle Si Catches Willie Telling Whoppers",
  "description": "Si calls Willie out for spreading very fake news about the Robertson family. Johnny D is shocked to learn that grandmas spank people. Si broke a whole lotta butcher knives as a kid and ALMOST didn't live to tell the tale. Stone remembers his mom whipping his butt at basketball to teach him a lesson. Martin's grandmother put a unique (and possibly poisonous) spin on washing kids' mouths out for cussing. Si explains why he and Jase are practically the same person. Stone shares a pic of the homemade hazmat suit Jase wore when bats invaded his house. Si talks about how God brought him back to Louisiana when his wife said she'd never return. And the boys reveal their favorite Disney princesses.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
