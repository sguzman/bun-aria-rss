  "description": "You've probably heard about victims of con artists -- like the people who hand over their life savings to sketchy gurus or psychics, or the people who wire thousands of dollars to a \"Nigerian prince\" who just needs some help getting his far bigger fortune to you. And you've probably thought to yourself, \"What a sucker. I'd never fall for something like that.\" But are you sure? In this episode of Rationally Speaking, Julia interviews Maria Konnikova, science journalist and author of \"The Confidence Game: Why we fall for it... Every time,\" who explains why con artists are so effective that even the best of us are vulnerable. Along the way, they explore questions like: Why do people refuse to believe they've been conned? Are con artists getting more sophisticated over time? And how do con artists view themselves -- do they rationalize their actions, or are they impassive sociopaths?",
