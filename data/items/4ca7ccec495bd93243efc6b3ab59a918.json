  "description": "This week on the CAFE Insider podcast, Joyce Vance is joined by guest co-host Maya Wiley while Preet is at the Code Conference. Maya is the President and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. She has also served as counsel to the mayor of New York City and in the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. And, she was a candidate for New York City mayor in 2021.\nIn this sample from the episode, Joyce and Maya break down Judge Aileen Cannon’s order granting former President Donald Trump’s request for a special master to review the documents seized during the FBI’s Mar-a-Lago search. Does Judge Cannon’s reasoning hold up to scrutiny? And how could the order inhibit the Justice Department from continuing the investigation into Trump’s handling of the documents? \nIn the full episode, Joyce and Maya discuss: \n– The special master issue, including the strengths of Trump’s claims of attorney-client privilege and executive privilege, and the factors the DOJ is balancing in deciding whether to appeal Judge Cannon’s special master order; and\n– The January 6th Committee’s request to interview former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and the likelihood that former Vice President Mike Pence testifies before the Committee.\nStay informed.
