Speaking at the 1992 UN Earth Summit in Rio De Janeiro, Severn caught the attention of the media with her passion and anger. Severn has been speaking to Phil Marzouk about her feelings then and how they’ve changed over the intervening decades.\n\nPhoto: Severn Cullis-Suzuki (2nd left) and her friends at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992.
