  "description": "<div>Scott and Yarmila Falater had it all. A beautiful marriage, 2 kids who adored them: the perfect upper middle class existence. But then, on January 16, 1997, Scott brutally murdered Yarmila while their children slept. He stabbed her 42 times before throwing her body into the family pool to make sure she was dead. He has never denied doing this. However, he says he's not responsible because he was sleepwalking. Is that possible? Can a person murder another person in the most brutal way imaginable...in their sleep?
