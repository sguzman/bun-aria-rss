The cyber-spies of APT41 seem to be doing some moonlighting. An accused criminal who bribed telco workers to unlock phones is in custody. Scammers are exploiting the tragedies in El Paso and Dayton. And a call at Black Hat for the security sector to bring in some safety engineers. Ben Yelin from UMD CHHS on Virginia updating legislation to address Deep Fakes.
