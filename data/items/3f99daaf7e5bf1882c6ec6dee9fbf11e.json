  "description": "<p>Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease characterised by the formation of\nplaques, which are deposits of lipids and cholesterol-laden macrophages that\nform in the artery wall. The inflammation is often non-resolving, due in large\npart to changes in normal macrophage anti-inflammatory behaviour that are\ninduced by the toxic plaque microenvironment. These changes include higher\ndeath rates, defective efferocytic uptake of dead cells, and reduced rates of\nemigration. We develop a free boundary multiphase model for early\natherosclerotic plaques, and we use it to investigate the effects of impaired\nmacrophage anti-inflammatory behaviour on plaque structure and growth. We find\nthat high rates of cell death relative to efferocytic uptake results in a\nplaque populated mostly by dead cells. We also find that emigration can\npotentially slow or halt plaque growth by allowing material to exit the plaque,\nbut this is contingent on the availability of live macrophage foam cells in the\ndeep plaque. Finally, we introduce an additional bead species to model\nmacrophage tagging via microspheres, and we use the extended model to explore\nhow high rates of cell death and low rates of efferocytosis and emigration\nprevent the clearance of macrophages from the plaque.\n</p>",
