  "description": "<p>Single-photon atom gradiometry is a powerful experimental technique that can\nbe employed to search for the oscillation of atomic transition energies induced\nby ultralight scalar dark matter (ULDM). In the sub-Hz regime the background is\nexpected to be dominated by gravity gradient noise (GGN), which arises as a\nresult of mass fluctuations around the experiment. In this work we model the\nGGN as surface Rayleigh waves and construct a likelihood-based analysis that\nconsistently folds GGN into the sensitivity estimates of vertical atom\ngradiometers in the frequency window between 1 mHz and 1 Hz. We show that in\ncertain geological settings GGN can be significantly mitigated when operating a\nmulti-gradiometer configuration, which consists of three or more atom\ninterferometers in the same baseline. Multi-gradiometer experiments, such as\nfuture versions of AION and MAGIS-100, have the potential to probe regions of\nscalar ULDM parameter space in the sub-Hz regime that have not been excluded by\nexisting experiments.\n</p>",
