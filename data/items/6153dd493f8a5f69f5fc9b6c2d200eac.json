We are also looking good machines, and we are machines that just spend all of our time trying not to be dominated, and trying to look good” [5:17] “by focusing on one thing, I've got a bigger life than I ever, ever could have imagined for myself.” [12:07] “It's so often the broken way in which you depict something that establishes your authority” [55:15]   And so every book is only something you can do at a certain point in your life. And if you pass that point, without having done that thing, you always look back and think Why was I so gutless? [57:56] “unless you go to the too far you're kind of wasting your life, in my opinion.” [59:35] “I'm much more compelled by a character who is corrupt, but is just trying to do the right thing. Even if it's kind of a despicable thing. But it's the only right thing that the character can think of doing. “ [1:02:50] “...the other thing about sort of working the vein of the extreme, is that if you can lodge yourself in people's memory, whether or not they like you the first time, if they remember you, people change and the culture changes.” [1:07:20] “I am this constant, sort of gathering this harvesting, of human experience, and then organizing, that experience and presenting it in a narrative, so that the experience has a context.” [1:30:35] “...getting back to zero, getting back to sort of empty and meaningless so that you can start the next project without being too attached to the previous project.” [1:32:31] “So in lieu of fixing somebody, I always kind of strive to kind of present them with something that is going to make them excited about living. Blah blah blah” [1:54:34]   Follow Chuck PALAHNIUK: Website: <a href=\"https://www.chuckpalahniuk.net/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.chuckpalahniuk.net/</a> Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chuckpalahniuk\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/chuckpalahniuk</a> Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chuckpalahniuk/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/chuckpalahniuk/</a> Twitter:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chuckpalahniuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/chuckpalahniuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</a>",
