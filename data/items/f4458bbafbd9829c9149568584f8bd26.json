  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys celebrate St. Patrick's Day and watch the NCAA tourney games live on the show and welcome in two legends. First, 13 year NBA veteran, 2005 NBA 3-Point Contest Champion, 18th overall pick of the 2000 draft, co-host of the Knuckleheads podcast, Quentin Richardson joins the show to chat about today's NBA, how the league has changed since he was in it, what young players need to do to really break through, his career as a whole, if he follows college basketball at all, what is wrong with Russell Westbrook, if one guy can win a championship anymore, and much more (30:53-1:02:50). Later, friend of the progrum, Shams Charania joins the show to chat about breaking news, if he's watching the NCAA tournament, if he has a beef with Kevin Durant, and what's going on around the NBA (1:16:42-1:36:56). Also joining the progrum is friend of the show, NFL Network, Ian Rapoport, to chat about where Deshaun Watson is going to wind up and how close that decision is, where Baker Mayfield is going to wind up, Von Miller's new deal with the Bills, and what else we need to be paying attention to (12:02-22:58). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show. We appreciate the hell out of all you. See you tomorrow, Happy St. Patrick's Day, cheers.</p>\n",
