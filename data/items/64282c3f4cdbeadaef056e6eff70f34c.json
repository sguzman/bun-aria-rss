  "description": "<p>If you have a difficult time setting aside money for the future and saving towards retirement, then identifying why it is that you’re saving might be what you’re missing. Studies have even shown that we will save more money for retirement when we’re able to see an older version of ourselves- so maybe trying out FaceApp is a good thing after all! Even though we all might have different motivators, it’s healthy to remind ourselves of why it is so important to save and invest. And actually realizing and understanding that we’re going to be old one day is crucial when it comes to maintaining a high savings rate in our 401k, IRA, and other investment vehicles.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Christmas Bomb by Prairie- a big thanks to Jeff for donating this beer to the show!
