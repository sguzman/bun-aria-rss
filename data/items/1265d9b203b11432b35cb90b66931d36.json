  "title": "No Dating Subordinates on Kirk Minihane's Watch",
  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane addresses the controversy surrounding his old producer's love life and the utterly predictable mishandling of the situation by Entercom and WEEI. You won't get the details on this one from Beat the Press or the Boston Globe. Blind Mike made it into to work despite the evisceration he suffered Friday at the hands of Dave Portnoy. The crew reacts to Mike's performance and tries to get to the bottom of Portnoy's anger. Minihane shares a phone call he had with Kmarko, the Barstool Sport's editor whose whining started the whole affray. The parody songs continue to roll in, but not all parody songs are equal. Minifan President DEC is the first to get us into the holiday spirit. Speaking of DEC, this is Election Week and we will have the full results of the cabinet elections soon. Steve Robinson continues to be bizarre.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
