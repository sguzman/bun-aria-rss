  "description": "Detecting and treating brain injuries continues to be a high priority for USSOCOM. That's why ReBlast is so important. ReBlast is a pilot study researching the long-term effects of repetitive, low-level blast exposure (RLLBE) on Special Operations Forces service members.<br /><br />In this episode, SOFcast is on the road again, this time to Massachusetts General Hospital's Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. SOCOM Senior Enlisted Leader Command Chief Master Sergeant Greg Smtih sat down with ReBlast study researchers Dr. Yelena Bodien and Dr. Brian Edlow, and the Master Chief Petty Officer of the U.S. Navy Russell Smith to talk about how ReBlast is helping researchers better understand the effects career-long repetitive blast exposure has on brain health and function. <br /><br />\"Optimal cognitive performance and brain health are more important than ever to ensure that SOF can achieve the mission successfully that they need to achieve in the future\" <br />- Dr. Brian Edlow",
