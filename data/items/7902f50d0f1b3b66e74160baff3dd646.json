  "description": "<p>Glass eyes! Pelts! Antlers! Hides! Bones! Tanning! Hilarious, charming and globally celebrated taxidermist Allis Markham chats about her passion for preserving animals for museums and institutions. She’s won multiple awards for her artful poses and meticulous work as an ethical taxidermist. With her flair for vintage styling, is perhaps the most elegant badass on planet Earth. Learn the process of making museum taxidermy, her favorite pieces she’s ever made, the best diorama halls, how to DIY it at home, the dos and don’ts of picking up roadkill, why she’s not a fan of 'crap taxidermy' and if ...humans could theoretically be ... stuffed.
