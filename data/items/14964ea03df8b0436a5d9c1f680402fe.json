  "description": "<p>This paper proposes a uniqueness Shapley measure to compare the extent to\nwhich different variables are able to identify a subject. Revealing the value\nof a variable on subject $t$ shrinks the set of possible subjects that $t$\ncould be. The extent of the shrinkage depends on which other variables have\nalso been revealed. We use Shapley value to combine all of the reductions in\nlog cardinality due to revealing a variable after some subset of the other\nvariables has been revealed. This uniqueness Shapley measure can be aggregated\nover subjects where it becomes a weighted sum of conditional entropies.\nAggregation over subsets of subjects can address questions like how identifying\nis age for people of a given zip code. Such aggregates have a corresponding\nexpression in terms of cross entropies. We use uniqueness Shapley to\ninvestigate the differential effects of revealing variables from the North\nCarolina voter registration rolls and in identifying anomalous solar flares. An\nenormous speedup (approaching 2000 fold in one example) is obtained by using\nthe all dimension trees of Moore and Lee (1998) to store the cardinalities we\nneed.\n</p>",
