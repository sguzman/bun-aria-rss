  "title": "Episode #93: Cherchez La Femme, or The Woman Behind the Art--Berthe Weill (Season 11, Episode 2)",
  "link": "https://artcuriouspodcast.com/artcuriouspodcast/93",
  "description": "There’s a phrase in the French language that goes, “Cherchez la femme.” In translation, it means “find the woman,” or “look for the woman,” and typically it’s derogatory, a phrase used as an explanation for the reasons why a man may be behaving badly. Cherchez la femme, some say, meaning that “woman troubles” are assumed to be at the core of any man’s real problems. But I like the idea of appropriating the phrase “cherchez la femme” to mean that we’re going to look for the women who made things right in art history, who bolstered and brought attention to some big-name artists.\nWelcome to season 11 of ArtCurious, where we’re highlighting the lives and work of the women who supported some of the world’s favorite artists. Today, meet Berthe Weill, an art dealer who made many artists famous, including some of the biggest names of the 20th century.\nPlease SUBSCRIBE and REVIEW our show on Apple Podcasts and FOLLOW on Spotify\nTwitter / Instagram / Facebook\n\nSPONSORS:\nKiwi Co: Get 30% off your first month plus FREE shipping on ANY crate line with promo code ARTCURIOUS\nIndeed: Listeners get a free $75 credit to upgrade your job post\nBetterhelp: Get 10% off your first month of counseling\nGEM Multivitamins: Get 30% off your first order\n\nWant to advertise/sponsor our show?\nWe have partnered with AdvertiseCast to handle our advertising/sponsorship requests.
