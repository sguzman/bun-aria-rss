    "media:description": "\"Because the Romans were weird\" is the answer to a lot of questions about why our culture does this or that.\n\nSOME SMALL CORRECTIONS:\n1. Calling \"Caesar\" a \"last name\" is more questionable than I thought.  It was a name that people inherited from their parents, but Roman naming was weird and not exactly analogous to the modern system.\n2. I implied that modern Russia was significantly more ethnically diverse than the HRE.  I'm not so sure about that anymore.  Measuring diversity is hard though, especially for thousand-year-old countries.\n\nI missed a couple of Patrons in the credits:\nPokemonTom09/Ruminations (pretend this one's bold)\nE3qualsz None (pretend this one's bold)\nRTT12\n\nTo become a Patron:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Xidnaf\n\nIntro-song:\n\"Flight of the Breezies\" by Kadenza\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWXvSBHB210",
