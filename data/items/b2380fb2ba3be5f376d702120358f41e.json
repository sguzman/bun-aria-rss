  "description": "<p>Are you ready for ThorCock at Burning Man on 30 hits of Acid? Nomadic writer Lacyeloo Winkelpleck thinks that this annual arts event in the Nevada desert is the sexiest place on Earth - & finally, she’s solo and free to be wildly inappropriate, and the playa gives her the microphone and stage she needs to express herself. So when a game of drug-fueled ‘Pick a Sparkle’ leads her to tall Viking-like Thor, together they climb dangerous oil derricks and wrestle and grind on beds while hundreds watch. After such an night, wouldn’t it be rude not to sample the d*ck? #Ineffable #Yoner #TripperMath #LetGo</p> <p>Hosted by Sexual Folklorist Dixie De La Tour</p> <p>Opening Music: 8 Miles Wide by Storm Large</p> <p>Song: ‘Adventure of a Lifetime’ (ColdPlay)</p> <p> </p> <p>Episode Links</p> <p>Our next Bawdy Livestream will be on Saturday, April 17th at 7 PM PST. if you missed our last livestream with Margaret Cho, you missed an incredible show!
