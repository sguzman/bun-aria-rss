  "description": "Astrophysicist Adam Frank is a big fan of science and movies. He's even been a science adviser to Marvel's \"Doctor Strange.\" So we asked Adam to give us his sci-fi films of the decade - movies that tell us about striking the right balance between science and storytelling. Here are the movies we couldn't get to in the episode: 'Annihilation' (2018), 'Coherence' (2013), 'Gravity' (2013) and 'Looper' (2012). Plus, Adam's favorite TV show of the decade was 'The Expanse.' | Follow Maddie on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maddie_sofia\">@maddie_sofia</a>.
