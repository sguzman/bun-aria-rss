  "description": "There’s never a last time until the last time you do anything. Supernatural limits can be pushed to the max until we can’t come back from them. But more often than not, we like to tempt fate for the thrill of seeking out what can be hiding out there. Hiding within the unexplored parts of our minds and even inside the digital sphere in the palm of our hands. We all keep pushing further and further subconsciously hoping to find our final destination. First, flying high on the thrill of a final score. Next, seek the grave watcher and you shall find your end. After that, a reading of The Russian Sleep Experiment by Anonymous. And finally, a warning from the ghost in the machine.\nAs a listener, you’ll get 10% off your first month by visiting BetterHelp.com/Scary\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
