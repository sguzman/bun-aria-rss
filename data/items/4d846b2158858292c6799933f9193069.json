  "description": "It's not often that you hear of a player who suffered a devastating injury that radically changed his physical ability (an injury that also basically broke new medical ground along the way), but still went on to have a successful career. Well, how about one that did just that and is in the hall of fame? Enter Grant Hill. The former Duke legend and NBA HOF member joins JJ and Tommy for an incredible discussion that covers just about everything he went through during his career. From his days at Duke and the iconic full court pass to Christian Laettner to beat Kentucky, the relationships with Laettner and Hurley during those championship runs, all the way through his NBA career and what it was like to be considered the next MJ, and the difficult road he had to travel to get through the demoralizing and crushing ankle injury that nearly ended his career. The conversation is just like Grant himself - real, honest, humble, and outstanding. \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
