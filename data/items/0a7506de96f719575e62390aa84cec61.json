  "description": "<p>The Old Jail in Charleston, South Carolina is an architecturally beautiful building that dates back to the early 1800s. The jail has seen its share of thieves, murderers and even pirates. A stone building that has stood for centuries tends to carry far more than just memories of years gone by. The spirits of those who were locked inside the structure still seem to resonate within those walls. Death may not have been the end for those condemned. Do some of these people still carry on in the afterlife? Let's explore the history and hauntings of Charleston's Old Jail. The Moment in Oddity features the Hardy Tree and This Day in History features the invention of the corn cob pipe.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/07/hgb-podcast-ep-55-old-charleston-jail.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/07/hgb-podcast-ep-55-old-charleston-jail.html</a></p>",
