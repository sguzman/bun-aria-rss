  "description": "Contributor(s): Professor Jessica Wilson, Dr Vanessa Seifert, Philip Ball | The biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky wrote that nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. Is there an even more general theory that can make sense of all the sciences? The various scientific disciplines each have their own methods, theories, and practices. This is the case even when different sciences try to explain the same phenomena. Can we translate between these distinct disciplines? What does this even mean? Might all of science be reduced to physics one day? Our panel discuss reduction, emergence, and the unity of the sciences.\nMeet our speakers and chair\nPhilip Ball (@philipcball) is a science writer and Editor of Nature.\nVanessa Seifert (@seifert_vanessa) is Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Bristol.\nJessica Wilson is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto.\nClare Moriarty (@quiteclare) is a Fellow at the Forum for Philosophy and IRC Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Trinity College Dublin.\nMore about this event\nThe Forum for Philosophy (@forumphilosophy) hosts events exploring science, politics, and culture from a philosophical perspective.\nTwitter Hashtag for this event: #LSEForum",
