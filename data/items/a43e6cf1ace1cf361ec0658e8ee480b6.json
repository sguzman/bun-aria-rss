  "description": "<p>Jaspreet Singh joins us on the podcast today and he can probably best be described as a serial entrepreneur. However, a life of entrepreneurship wasn’t always the plan for him. Jaspreet was born to immigrant parents and grew up bilingual in a traditional Sikh family, with the strong expectation that he was going to be a doctor, but that didn’t end up being the case! A growing interest in investing led him to YouTube where his channel Minority Mindset now has close to 650k subscribers. Through Jaspreet’s educational and entertaining videos, he is able to share wisdom around personal finance and investing. During this episode we talk all about entrepreneurship, what it means to have a Minority Mindset, and how to go about building a YouTube channel from scratch.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Bright Day Coming by 3 Taverns!
