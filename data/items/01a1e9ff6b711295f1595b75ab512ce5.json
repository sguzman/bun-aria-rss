  "description": "<p>On today's episode of The Literary Life, Angelina and Cindy interview poet, author and mother, Sally Thomas. You can find Sally and some of her writing at <a href= \"http://www.sally-thomas.com/\">www.sally-thomas.com</a>. Sally talks about her early reading life beginning with her memories of her family members reading themselves and to her. Cindy and Angelina ask her about her early forays into storytelling and writing. They discuss how literature and story are for everyone, including scientists and mathematicians, not just those who already have a bent toward reading. Sally shares about the influential teachers she had who fed her love of the written word.</p> <p>Angelina asks about how Sally approaches the balance between the reading life and the writing life. They also discuss how the seasons of Sally's family life shifted her focus somewhat away from active writing but were still fruitful in other ways. Cindy asks what Sally likes to read as a diversion, and Angelina brings up the topic of how to deal with a reading slump. They wrap up their chat reveling in the reward of homeschooling and teaching their own children, and what a joy it is both to raise readers but to become better readers themselves.</p> <p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p> <h3>Upcoming Events:</h3> <p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Angelina Stanford and Thomas Banks will be presenting a 3-day webinar series on Charles Dickens' <em>A Christmas Carol</em> on November 12-14. <a href= \"http://angelinastanford.com/webinars/\">Register here</a> to get lifetime access to the sessions.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Angelina will also be in Austin, TX at Christ Church on November 25, 2019.
