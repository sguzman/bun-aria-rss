  "description": "<p>Register for my 2020 Virtual Mental Health Solutions Summit here:https://www.drleafconference.com &nbsp;**Early bird tickets end October 15 &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s can be incredibly frightening. The idea of losing your mind, the very thing that makes you human, is a scary thing, especially since it seems to happen more these days than ever before, and at a younger age. There is so much we don’t know about why this happens, or why Alzheimer’s is the 3rd leading causing of death in USA today. Brain diseases and cognitive decline are the last frontier: it is the area where we have been the least successful in science and medicine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But there is reason to hope!
