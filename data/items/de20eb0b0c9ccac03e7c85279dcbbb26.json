  "description": "<p>The Olympics in Beijing are officially here and we're back to review the Opening Ceremony in classic Off The Podium style! Was this an opening ceremony that we can finally enjoy for once or was it once again a bit of a let down? Why did we enjoy kids falling down too much? What segment are we really starting to get sick of? What did we think of the flag bearers and why were the uniforms amazing this year? As well as the opening ceremony we also talk up some of the great events we have seen so far, including why Australia is going absolutely curling crazy and why we love Dean & Tahli so much, what the hopes are for both Australia and Canada to hold onto our lead in the men's and women's moguls and also just why our first ever DAILY DALE might go down slightly interestingly today. It's an action packed episode you won't want to miss, so get to listening!</p>",
