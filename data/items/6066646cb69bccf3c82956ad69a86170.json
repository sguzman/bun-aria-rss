  "description": "Today I talked to Chester Elton, coauthor of Anxiety at Work: 8 Strategies to Help Teams Build Resilience, Handle Uncertainty, and Get Stuff Done (Harper Business, 2021).\nDuring my interview with Elton, the theme was really about the importance of creating a sense of psychological safety for employees, with gratitude being the other key in terms of providing social support. As to specific solution, quelling uncertainty, signaling that perfectionism can be harmful, and that a philosophy that less can be more when it comes to curbing burn-out were all keys. So too is normalizing conversations about anxiety on the job because, right now, 90% of workers don’t feel like this crucial topic is something they can discuss with their boss. Finally, employees can manage to be resilient more easily when these three motivators are in place: a job role that enables making an impact, ongoing learning, and doesn’t compromise the importance of family.\nThe two lead authors have teamed up on three previous New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestsellers and have sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide. Adrian Gostick is ranked among the top 10 global gurus in leadership and organizational culture. Chester Elton is ranked number 2 among organizational culture experts globally and in the top 10 for leadership. Anthony Gostick adds a millennial perspective to this work.\nDan Hill, PhD, is the author of eight books and leads Sensory Logic, Inc. (https://www.sensorylogic.com).
