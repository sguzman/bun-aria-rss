  "description": "QAnon. Pizzagate. Conspiracy theories. Why are humans drawn to these? How has a faction of the Church latched on to the dangerous and anonymous Q and the wild theories he purports. What effect does this have on theology and social engagement? How does all this fit into the Sermon on the Mount and our involvement with what Jesus was starting?\n\nWe are thrilled to have great friend of the show Skye Jethani with us today as we dissect and discuss. Skye is cohost of our cousin podcast, the Holy Post. Skye has a new book out on the Sermon on the Mount called “What If Jesus Was Serious?: A Visual Guide to the Teachings of Jesus We Love to Ignore.” \n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram. \n\nYou can find Skye's book here: https://www.amazon.com/What-Jesus-Was-Serious-Teachings/dp/0802419755/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1DMUD8F8RC926&dchild=1&keywords=skye+jethani&qid=1597611830&sprefix=skye+j%2Caps%2C349&sr=8-1\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\n\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
