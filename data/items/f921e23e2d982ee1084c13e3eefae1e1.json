  "description": "On Thursday’s The Mark Levin Show, Joe Biden has been a race baiter his entire political career, and he’s doing it again now lying about the Georgia voting bill, calling it Jim Crow on steroids and un-American. Biden and Jen Psaki keep lying about how it restricts voting, despite expanding early voter access and making it easier to vote. Even the CEOs of Delta and Coca Cola are calling for boycotts to Georgian businesses. Woke-ism and the left is trying to make an example out of Georgia in order to stop other Republican state legislatures from daring to constitutionally take back their voting system. Also, the Biden administration is doing gymnastics to explain how the infrastructure bill barely contains actual infrastructure. Jen Psaki has to sell the bill as a once in a lifetime investment, taking a page out of the FDR progressive playbook. The infrastructure bill is just another way to empower centralized government and politicians. Later, the rampant inhumanity of small children being thrown over the border wall is disgusting, but President Biden and the media would rather continue to ignore this crisis. Biden’s reckless border policy is hurting Latinos on both sides of the border.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
