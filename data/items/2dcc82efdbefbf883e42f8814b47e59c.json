  "description": "Sports Illustrated calls Trevor Moawad “the world’s best brain trainer.” With an accolade like that, and a history of working with the world’s elite athletes, you might expect him to have some sort of fancy, highly-complex system. If so, your expectations would be wrong. Moawad keeps it simple and straight-forward, focusing on changing what people say, what they consume, and how they form habits. On this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Trevor Moawad discusses a realistic alternative to the trendy idea of positive thinking, explains the connection between what you say out loud and how your life turns out, and proves conclusively that, contrary to popular belief, your past does not predict your future.

So think about that. If I say something out loud, it’s 10x. If it’s negative, it’s four to seven times more powerful. So when I say negative things out loud, it’s 40 to 70 times more likely that that will happen--or cause a result that won’t be good for me--than if I just didn’t say anything.” [7:21]   “If you say stupid sh*t out loud ultimately you’re predicting and perpetuating exactly what you don’t want to have happen.” [13:42]   “The past is real. But the only thing that makes it predictive is if my behavior stays the same.” [16:00]   FOLLOW:   WEBSITE: <a href=\"https://moawadconsultinggroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://moawadconsultinggroup.com/</a> INSTAGRAM: <a href=\"https://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly</a>/2V5XmwK  FACEBOOK: <a href=\"https://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly</a>/3bS3Q8w  TWITTER: <a href=\"https://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly</a>/2T1QOgc      BOOKS MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE:   “It Takes What It Takes: How to Think Neutrally and Gain Control of Your Life”, Trevor Moawad <a href=\"https://amzn.to\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to</a>/32b7upH  “Man’s Search for Meaning”, Viktor Frankl <a href=\"https://amzn.to\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to</a>/39KkOUq ",
