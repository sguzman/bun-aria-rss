In this second series, we're following the adventures of Swiss student Charlotte and her friends Lucas and Théo as they take a trip through historic locations in northwestern France. In each episode, teachers Mark and Pierre-Benoît discuss Charlotte's travel diary and look at interesting vocabulary and expressions for intermediate learners of French. In this first episode, we join&nbsp;the trio on the first leg of their trip as they take the train from Geneva to Paris before setting off on their adventure. Listen out for adjectives of nationality, the conjugation of <em>venir</em> in the present tense, and the conjugation of <em>aller</em><strong> </strong>in the future tense. <em>C'est parti !&nbsp;</em></p><br><p>The podcast episodes will be published weekly from 11th February.
