  "description": "<p>True Crime Tuesday presents The Flat Tire Murders: Unsolved Crimes of a South Florida Serial Killer with guest Michael P. Burns<br>\n<br>\nSouth Florida in the 1970s was one of the nation's most dangerous locations. Behind the image of sun and surf, young women were the victims of a brutal killer. In the mid-1970s, over a dozen young women were murdered and found in canals. These cases became known as the Flat Tire Murders and the Canal Murders. Only one case was ever solved. More than four decades have passed since these crimes, and no arrests were ever made.Â </p>\n\n<p>Get the book here: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://amzn.to/2YnhzlO&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw1JKggYPAcAgsgLAKc4K6wM\">https://amzn.to/2YnhzlO</a></p>\n",
