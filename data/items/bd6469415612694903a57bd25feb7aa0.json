  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that North Korea's Sun Team is rising in Red Dawn. Much PII, mostly out of Japan, appears in the black-market stall of a poorly reviewed vendor. The Mexican bank raid seems, the Central Bank says, to have started with a small brokerage and spread from there. Facebook and Google+ continue to be infested with jihadist inspiration. More charges for alleged Syrian Electronic Army hoods. A man gets fifteen years for, among other things, DDoSing former employers. And mobile app users? XYZ. Ben Yelin from UMD CHHS on controversy involving North Carolina police using overly broad warrants to gather location data from Google.",
