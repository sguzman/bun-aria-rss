To help us explore this world, today I’m joined by Dr. Racquel Gates. Dr. Gates and I chatted about the complicated nature of Black women’s representation on reality tv, how audiences often respond to majority Black casts, the stereotypes that are both upheld and dispelled through reality tv, and the changes that often happen between season 1 and 2 of a show.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Gates</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.racquelgates.com/\">https://www.racquelgates.com/</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/racquelgates\">@raquelgates</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p><p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
