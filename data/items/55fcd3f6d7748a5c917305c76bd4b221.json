  "description": "<p>In part 1 (start-17:45), the guys briefly recap the series so far. Jon summarizes by saying that the overarching theme is the human calling to rule, as outlined in the Genesis and garden of Eden narrative. The question is, will humans rule wisely or foolishly?</p>\n<p>In part 2 (17:45-27:00), Tim and Jon discuss how Proverbs lays out two paths, which are the same two paths outlined in Genesis. A person can either choose to live wisely, depicted as listening to “Lady Wisdom,” or a person can choose to live foolishly, depicted as listening to “Lady Folly.”</p>\n<p>Early in Proverbs, the “Solomon” narrator warns the “seed of David” about how to live in the fear of Yahweh and discover true wisdom. The wise and righteous man embraces Lady Wisdom (Proverbs 1, 3, 8, 9).</p>\n<p>The goal of finding “a woman of valor” (Prov. 5, 31) avoids the wicked and violent man, avoids Lady Folly (Prov. 9), and avoids the “wayward woman” (characterized as an adulteress).</p>\n<p>Tim notes that there are four speeches each that talk about Lady Wisdom and Lady Folly, for a total of eight speeches. The components of these speeches are designed to mirror each other.</p>\n<p>In part 3 (27:00-39:00), Tim outlines Proverbs 9, which is an example of the two women mirroring each other.</p>\n<p>Proverbs 9:1-6<br />\n\"Wisdom has built her house,<br />\nShe has hewn out her seven pillars;<br />\nShe has prepared her food, she has mixed her wine;<br />\nShe has also set her table;<br />\nShe has sent out her maidens, she calls<br />\nFrom the tops of the high places of the city:<br />\n‘Whoever is naive, let him turn in here!’<br />\nTo him who lacks understanding she says,<br />\n‘Come, eat of my bread<br />\nAnd drink of the wine I have mixed.<br />\n‘Forsake your folly and live,<br />\nAnd proceed in the way of understanding.’”</p>\n<p>Proverbs 9:13-18<br />\n“The woman of folly is boisterous,<br />\nShe is naive and knows nothing.<br />\nShe sits at the doorway of her house,<br />\nOn a seat by the high places of the city,<br />\nCalling to those who pass by,<br />\nWho are making their paths straight:<br />\n‘Whoever is naive, let him turn in here,’<br />\nAnd to him who lacks understanding she says,<br />\n‘Stolen water is sweet;<br />\nAnd bread eaten in secret is pleasant.’<br />\nBut he does not know that the dead are there,<br />\nThat her guests are in the depths of Sheol.”</p>\n<p>Tim notes that accepting divine wisdom is the way to discover the blessings of Eden. Consider Proverbs 3:</p>\n<p>Proverbs 3:1-8, 13-18<br />\n“My son, do not forget my teaching,<br />\nBut let your heart keep my commandments;<br />\nFor length of days and years of life<br />\nAnd peace they will add to you.<br />\nDo not let kindness and truth leave you;<br />\nBind them around your neck,<br />\nWrite them on the tablet of your heart.<br />\nSo you will find favor and good repute<br />\nIn the sight of God and man.<br />\nTrust in the Lord with all your heart<br />\nAnd do not lean on your own understanding.<br />\nIn all your ways acknowledge Him,<br />\nAnd He will make your paths straight.<br />\nDo not be wise in your own eyes;<br />\nFear the Lord and turn away from ra’.<br />\nIt will be healing to your body<br />\nAnd refreshment to your bones.”</p>\n<p>“How blessed is the man who finds wisdom<br />\nAnd the man who gains understanding.<br />\nFor her profit is better than the profit of silver<br />\nAnd her gain better than fine gold.<br />\nShe is more precious than jewels;<br />\nAnd nothing you desire compares with her.<br />\nLong life is in her right hand;<br />\nIn her left hand are riches and honor.<br />\nHer ways are pleasant ways<br />\nAnd all her paths are peace.<br />\nShe is a tree of life to those who take hold of her,<br />\nAnd happy are all who hold her fast.\"</p>\n<p>Tim cites Proverbs 3 because he notes that the wise woman metaphorically becomes the tree of life. This maps onto the Garden of Eden narrative. Tim says that the book of Proverbs is designed to be a reflection on Genesis 1-3.</p>\n<p>In part 4 (39:00-end), Tim outlines Proverbs 31. Tim notes that the woman outlined here could be said to be a sort of real-life version of the metaphoric “Lady Wisdom” depicted earlier in the book. Tim notes that while Proverbs views the pursuit of wisdom from a male perspective of choosing between two metaphorical women, the next book, Song of Songs, flips it, and views the pursuit of wisdom from a female perspective.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n<p>Send us your questions for our upcoming Q+R on the Wisdom books in the Bible!
