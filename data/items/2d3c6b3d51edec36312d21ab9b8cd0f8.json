  "description": "<p>21-year-old Adam Castillo left his Willcox, AZ home on the evening of September 13, 2008. His plans that night were to attend a party. He left his phone and wallet behind at the house. Adam caught a ride to the party that was taking place outside of town, between Willcox and Kansas Settlement, AZ, in an area that locals call \"the loop.\" It has been reported that there were many partygoers there, and they all made it home, except Adam Castillo. The last reported sighting of Adam was around 2 am on the September 14. Law enforcement conducted extensive searches in the area where the party was held, but no trace of Adam has ever been found. Investigators interviewed numerous people who were at the party. Still, no one seems to know when Adam left or who he may have left with. Adam's family has been working to piece together the clues for the past 12 years, and they remain hopeful that someone will come forward with answers.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Adam Castillo, please contact the Cochise County Sheriff's Office at (520) 803-3280.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://upstart.com/Vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Upstart</a>- Find out how Upstart can lower your monthly payments today when you go to <a href=\"http://upstart.com/Vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Upstart.com/Vanished</a>.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.
