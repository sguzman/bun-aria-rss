  "title": "278 - Where Do We Go From Here?",
  "description": "We are still processing the events of last week, as we’re sure many of you are as well. It feels like too big of a moment to gloss over, so we decided to crack it open. This is, again, raw and in real time, recorded this morning. We answer a question dealing with an undecided nature involving Church, and Nationalism spouted from the pulpit. How long do you stay in a Church that you feel is Theologically off-center? How has that rhetoric fueled what we saw last Wednesday, January 6th? Is this a false Gospel, a false Jesus? Is this Christianity, radicalized? Is it divisive to call all of this out? \n\nWe at VOX are committed to not only confronting all of this, first in ourselves, but also to wrestle with what Jesus would have for us in this time. We are committed to repentance and a pursuit of discernment. \n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram. \n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nVoxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
