  "description": "Former United States Solicitors General Paul Clement and Donald Verrilli are among the “top tier” of Supreme Court advocates, according to Greg Stohr who covers the Court for Bloomberg News. So, it’s big news that both announced in September that they are joining Big Law firms. In Clement’s case, he’s taking his whole boutique appellate firm, Bancroft, with him to Kirkland & Ellis. While, in Verrilli’s case, his return to Big Law was not quite as unexpected. The firm he joined however, Munger Tolles & Olson, was a surprise. Many observers expected Verrilli to rejoin his former firm, Jenner & Block. Stohr speaks with the hosts of the Big Law Business podcast, Josh Block and Casey Sullivan, about Clement, Verrilli, and what to expect as the new Supreme Court term begins.\n\nSponsored by Bloomberg Law: \nwww.bna.com/bloomberglaw?promocode=BLBBLAW\n\nSubscribe to the Big Law Business podcast on iTunes:\nitunes.apple.com/us/podcast/big-l…d1074067483?mt=2",
