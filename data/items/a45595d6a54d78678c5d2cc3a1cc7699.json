  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden will go to Philly on Thursday and give a speech to explain how democracy is under attack, not by China, Iran, or Russia, but by conservative Republicans. This is from the same Joe Biden who has supported racist segregationists, tried to destroy the first black Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, and denied the first Black woman nominated to the high court, Janice Rogers Brown. Clearly, Biden knows who is writing the history books so he's doing whatever he wants, and he doesn't care if he turns Americans against each other. Then, Woodrow Wilson trashed the Declaration of Independence, saying to forget the first part about rights and liberty and focused on the second part, grievances. The Democrat Party was born in hatred for America, hatred for equality, and today that's even more clear. Biden is further to the left than Wilson and will use demagoguery and corruption to get what he wants. Later, isn't the open border an attack on democracy? Why is Biden funding the police? Because the Democrats defunded them and now cities across America are suffering. Incidentally, the Democrats blame the Republicans for this. Afterward, Mikhail Gorbachev passed away. Gorbachev was critical of Putin saying he's created a sham democracy. Finally, US Senate candidate for Nevada, Adam Laxalt, former Attorney General of Nevada, joins the show to discuss how the border patrol has endorsed his race. Laxalt reiterated how his opponent is simply a rubber stamp for Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
