  "description": "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>Christianity is the largest religion in the world: with almost 2.5 billion followers across the globe, nearly one in three people have faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Essential to the Christian worldview is the belief that the universe was created by a maximally great God: a being who is invested in the moral lives of his people and offers salvation to all who embrace his teachings. He is a God of three persons, a God of maximal power and intelligence, and a God who loves us all unconditionally. For many Christians, this belief is a matter of faith, but is this faith reasonable?</p> <p>Joining us this episode to discuss the nature and existence of God is Visiting Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology and Professor of Philosophy at Houston Baptist University, Dr William Lane Craig. With over thirty books and two hundred publications, Dr Craig has had a profound and lasting impact on academic debates within philosophy and theology. As well as being one of the leading philosophers of our time, Dr Craig’s work extends beyond the dusty chalkboards of university campuses. As the founder of the hugely popular non-profit organisation Reasonable Faith, Dr Craig is best known for his online lectures and for taking on the world’s most prominent philosophers and scientists in defence of Christianity. In the words of James Porter Moreland, ‘It is hard to overstate the impact that William Lane Craig has had for the cause of Christ. He is simply the finest Christian apologist of the last half century.’</p> <p>Without God, says Craig, morality is groundless, metaphysics is hopeless, and life is meaningless. The God of Christianity is the wellspring from which all life and values come into being. It is God who made us without dust, and it is to God to whom we shall return.</p> <p><strong>Global Philosophy of Religion</strong></p> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1621784338235_7326\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <p class=\"\">This episode is produced in partnership with <a href= \"https://www.global-philosophy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">The Global Philosophy of Religion Project</a> at <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/ptr/departments/philosophy/research/projects/global-philosophy-of-religion.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">University of Birmingham</a>, led by <a href=\"https://www.yujinnagasawa.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Yujin Nagasawa</a> and funded by the <a href= \"https://www.templeton.org/grant/the-global-philosophy-of-religion-project\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">John Templeton Foundation</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1621784338235_6553\" class= \"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\" data-block-type=\"47\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-183a6e33ff6c69743ed6\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <p class=\"\"><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Part I.
