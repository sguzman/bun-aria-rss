  "description": "<p>Brooke Lopez is our new King as the Bucks take a series lead (00:02:48 - 00:09:16). The Suns get to the Finals and Chris Paul's legacy game. Ballmer acted nuts and Pat Beverley went out with a bang (00:09:16 - 00:28:41). NIL talk and our first sponsored athlete, AOC (00:28:41 - 00:36:29). Bryson's caddy quits on him and the question of whether we should feel bad at all is proposed (00:36:29 - 00:45:27). Tim Woods joins the show to continue our Dungeons and Dragons game and we hunt and kill Billy, again (00:45:27 - 01:39:16). Fyre Fest of the week to wrap up the show. \n\nhttp://barstool.link/athletes</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
