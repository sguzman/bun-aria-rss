  "description": "We've taken a bit of a hiatus, but we're back and we've got two topics that are hot. A few months ago, Buffalo Trace announced there would be no George T. Stagg in the 2021 release of the Antique Collection. Many theories arose such as holding it back on purpose to create a media frenzy or potentially having a new brand come from it. However, Buffalo Trace has gone on record saying it didn't reach the standard they come to expect from it. We'll analyze this from both sides. In the second half of the show, we'll look at the sheer volume of brands that are built on MGP and how some have hype and some are still finding their way.\n\nShow Partners:\n\nCatoctin Creek has been honoring that tradition of small craft rye whisky since 2009.
