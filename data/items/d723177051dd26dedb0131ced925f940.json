  "description": "At the dawn of the radio age in the 1920s, Frederick Du Vernet—Anglican archbishop and self-declared scientist—announced a psychic channel by which minds could telepathically communicate across distance. Pamela E. Klassen retalls Du Vernet’s imaginative experiment in her newest book, The Story of Radio Mind: A Missionary's Journey on Indigenous Land (University of Chicago Press, 2018). Following Du Vernet’s journey westward across Canada, Klassen examines how contests over the mediation of stories—via photography, maps, printing presses, and radio—reveal the spiritual work of colonial settlement.\nPamela Klassen is Professor in the Department for the Study of Religion at the University of Toronto.\nHillary Kaell co-hosts NBIR and is Associate Professor of Religion at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
