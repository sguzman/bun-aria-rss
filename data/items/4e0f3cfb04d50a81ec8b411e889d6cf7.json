  "description": "<p>For downward skip-free Markov chains on non-negative integers killed at $0$,\nexistence of a quasi-stationary distribution is studied. Scale functions for\nthese processes are introduced and the boundary is classified by the\nintegrability of the scale function, which gives an extension of Feller's\nclassification of the boundary for birth-and-death processes. The existence and\nthe set of quasi-stationary distributions are characterized by scale functions\nand the classification of the boundary.\n</p>",
