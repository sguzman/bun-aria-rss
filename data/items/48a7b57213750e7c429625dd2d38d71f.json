  "description": "<p>Robert Andrade explores the values and meaning embedded in materials symbols and structures of the built environment by employing the use of industrial materials and construction methods evocative of urban spaces and various landscape typologies. Andrade is also interested in how humans intervene in the natural world, imposing order and artifice on raw wild life. He works in many different mediums including sculpture, photography, drawing, sound and more recently landscape design. He has exhibited throughout the United States and also enjoys collaborative projects at all scales. He currently lives and works in Los Angeles.</p>",
