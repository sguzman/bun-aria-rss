  "description": "<p>In this 93rd in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>In this episode, we discuss school. Beginning with a discussion of our individual experiences in school, we then share an excerpt from chapter 10 (School) of our forthcoming book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century. What is school for, and what does it help make us become? Is genius common, or rare? What is the purpose of the scientific method? How is fear used to corral students (and others)? How does a relationship with risk help young people become more adept adults? Are our bodies necessary to our education, or can we be educated as if we were just brains in jars?<br/><br/>Get your Goliath shirts right here: store.darkhorsepodcast.org<br/><br/>Heather’s newsletter, Natural Selections (subscribe to get free weekly essays in your inbox): https://naturalselections.substack.com<br/><br/>Support the sponsors of this show:<br/><br/>MUD\\WTR: is a coffee alternative with mushrooms and herbs (and cacao!) and is delicious, with 1/7 the caffeine as coffee.
