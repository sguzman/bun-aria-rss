  "description": "In today's podcast we get an increasingly familiar update: Fancy Bear is dancing and prancing through poorly protected networks, and she doesn't seem to care who knows it. More politically motivated hacking out of Russia prompts US promises of investigation and costs to be imposed. Failures in digital hygiene continue to be exploited. SCADA hacks worry the electrical grid. Joe Carrigan from the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute offers tips for safe device sharing. SentinelOne's Tim Strazzere describes an Android vulnerability his research uncovered. And some good news: NIST has released a new cyber self-assessment tool, and they'd like you to give it a spin.",
