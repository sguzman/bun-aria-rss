In our longest interview yet, we learn the amazing story of Jo’s swimming career and how lessons she learnt during her time as an athlete were some of the best lessons she learnt in life. We also learn just how she was able to so seamlessly transition from being an athlete into television and the challenges she faced along the way, just why she is still so passionate about live television today as she was when she first started broadcasting, which of her seven Olympics she has covered she rates as the best as well as giving us potentially the greatest Bruce McAvaney story you will ever here. It’s one hell of an interview that you simply can’t miss! So get to listening!</p>",
