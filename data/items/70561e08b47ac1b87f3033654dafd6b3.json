  "description": "Ukraine’s president addressed the U.S. Congress on Thursday and closed his speech with a direct appeal to President Biden for a no-fly zone and more weapons. In other Russia news, Stephen wonders if he will be the next American sanctioned after the Kremlin announced they will begin sanctioning media figures who are critical of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, fans of big potatoes may be bummed to hear about a ruling from the folks who track world-record size tubers, and Stephen imagines how Parisians might have reacted to watching their iconic Eiffel Tower grow by 20 feet this week. Next, Michael Bublé had the experience of a lifetime when he got to work with Paul McCartney, who produced Michael’s cover of “My Valentine” on his new album, “Higher,” which is available everywhere on March 25th. And in this Pod Show exclusive extended interview, Rose Matafeo finds common ground with Stephen Colbert as the two discuss their bungee jumping experiences in New Zealand. Season two of her show “Starstruck” premieres March 24th on HBO Max.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
