  "description": "<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, we have an awesome story about a student who completely destroys their teacher in class. When a class clown jokes that the teacher is doing a bad job of explaining a lesson, the teacher snaps and says, \"Do YOU want to teach this class?\" The student says, \"Sure!\" and the teacher lets him try, because he's sure the student will fail. The student actually does a better job than the teacher, which just embarrasses him even more.
