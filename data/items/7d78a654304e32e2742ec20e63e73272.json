    "media:description": "by Krystian Gaus\n\nWhile general-purpose smart contract platforms such as Ethereum are revolutionary, they bring several limitations and design constraints into play.\n\nSubstrate offers a flexible and modular alternative to these limitations. Rather than creating a smart contract on top of an existing blockchain, Substrate provides the tools to build an upgradeable special-purpose blockchain with the core application logic being an integral part of the blockchain runtime itself.\n\nIn this talk, we will briefly examine the idea of a heterogeneous multi-chain, and in the main part, we will set up a Substrate-based multi-node network.",
