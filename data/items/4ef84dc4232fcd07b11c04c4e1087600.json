  "description": "After getting his Ph.D., writer Jonathan Malesic struck out in this search for  an academic job, so he took a position as a parking attendant across the street from his alma mater. He's had a myriad of jobs since then but Malesic told NPR's Michel Martin that he's never been happier because he was able to maintain such a stark work-life balance. Malesic's new book, <em>The End of Burnout: Why Work Drains Us and How to Build Better Lives</em>, is about how to maintain that balance in any job.  And he reminds us that even your dream job is still just a job.",
