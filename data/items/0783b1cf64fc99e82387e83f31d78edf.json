  "description": "This week Alaina covers the weepy voiced killer for our 209th episode! In 1980 on New Year’s Eve Paul Michael Stephani brutally attacked Karen Potack after abducting her from outside of a bar. She sustained some of the worst injuries seen by investigators,  but she lived. This would be the first in a string of bizarre an gruesome attacks on women that potentially would lead to murder. The strangest piece of this case is that the killer called the police himself to report the attack....an he did it while weeping hysterically. <br>\n<br>\nAs always, thank you so much to our sponsors:\n<br>\n\nHelloFresh: Go to <a href=\"http://HelloFresh.com/10morbid\" target=\"_blank\">HelloFresh.com/10morbid</a> and use code10morbid for 10 free meals, including free shipping!\n<br>\n\nBetterhelp: Special offer for Morbid listeners get 10% off your first month at <a href=\"http://betterhelp.com/Morbid\" target=\"_blank\">betterhelp.com/Morbid</a>\n\n<br>\n\nFirstleaf: :Join today and you’ll get 6 bottles of wine for $29.95 and free shipping!
