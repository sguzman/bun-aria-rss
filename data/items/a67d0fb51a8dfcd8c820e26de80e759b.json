In this episode, Lisa, Mikey, and Jamie are taste-testing 13 products from the popular neighborhood grocery store! We scoured the aisles and found products from cold brew andmeats to salsas and sweets! Lolly even gets to have some fun taste-testing a new dog treat. (The gang may or may not have tried it too!) So alert your taste buds, because almost all these products are homeruns, and you’ll definitely want to have our <a href=\"https://www.hungry-girl.com/pages/foodcast\">foodcast</a> page handy the next time you head out to Trader Joe’s!</div>\n",
