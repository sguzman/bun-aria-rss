  "description": "The definition of a grandee, Sir Malcolm reflects on his astounding political career. This is a corker, taking us inside the Thatcher and Major governments at the times of Poll Tax, Maastricht and the move towards peace in Northern Ireland. Sir Malcom is one of only a handful of ministers who served in the government for the entirety of the 79-97 Conservative government and this wonderful episode charts some of the big moments as well as providing a contrast with politics today. Especially fascinating is his experience as Secretary of State for Scotland many years before devolution which meant he had far more power and influence than most of his successors.
