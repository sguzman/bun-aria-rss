  "description": "Odds are if we asked you sing your favorite advertising jingle from when you were a kid, you’d be able to recall every single lyric. Yet we don’t hear many advertising jingles these days. Why is that? This is the story of the rise, fall, and brain science of the jingle. In this episode we talk to UCLA’s Timothy D. Taylor, author of The Sounds of Capitalism, and Durham University’s Kelly Jakubowski. \n20K is hosted by Dallas Taylor and made out of the studios of Defacto Sound. \nConsider supporting the show at donate.20k.org \nEpisode transcript, music, and credits can be found here: https://www.20k.org/episodes/jingles\nLearn more about your ad choices.
