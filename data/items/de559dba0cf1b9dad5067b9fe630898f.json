  "description": "Phil unveils his theory on why we still can't get enough toilet paper and paper towels. Jase finally finds his favorite brand of paper towels, but there's a twist he didn't see coming. The guys dive into Acts 2 and how the disciples were given the ability to be heard in all languages. Jase offers his response to \"What would Jesus do?\" Phil makes a pitch for what to put on church signs. And Zach and Jase discuss the dangers of making a name for yourself. God often uses the last person you'd expect, in a way you'd never choose.
