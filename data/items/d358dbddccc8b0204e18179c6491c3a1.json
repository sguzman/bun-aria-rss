  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Dr. Anthony Fauci has stated that Coronavirus wasn't very serious, yet he's offered high praise to the President, and has even said that masks weren't necessary. Now Fauci has different positions, yet he is leading the science that President Trump has been following. Fauci himself says that Trump has never challenged 'the science' and has always followed his recommendations. So what culpability does Fauci have in all of this? If Fauci was a medical practitioner he'd be sued for malpractice. What's worse is the irregular reporting of coronavirus numbers on the CDC website which seem to keep changing. Later, the outrage continues over the commutation of Roger Stone, yet no one batted an eye when Barack Obama pardoned FALN terrorists, convicted a CIA Director and a General that was found guilty. Bill Clinton was even worse, pardoning family members and more. Yet Stone is the problem. Afterward, billionaire leftists like George Soros are plentiful on the left and remain focused on starting and funding racial justice organizations. These groups promote and normalize anti-semitism spreading propaganda to liberal jews and others. It's as if the left and BLM are pushing for a race war in America.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
