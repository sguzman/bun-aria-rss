  "description": "<p>2000's. United Kingdom. During the 2000's, Post Office Ltd discovered that hundreds of their SubPostmasters were stealing money and punished them for it. Well over 700 people were prosecuted or took plea deals resulting in fines and even prison sentences. As the numbers grew and the postmasters suffered, a reality began to sink in; the Horizon system that was built by Fujitsu to handle transactions, stocktaking, and accounting for Post Office was more complex and buggy than they wanted to publicly admit.
