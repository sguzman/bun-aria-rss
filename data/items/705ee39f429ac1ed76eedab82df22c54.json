  "description": "<p>Happy Friday! Got a wonderful off the rails episode for you to carry you gently into the weekend.\n\n-RockyBoots.com promo code \"ZBT\" for 25% off!-\n\nROUND 1: Nothing good seems to come from the land of military TikToks and that’s certainly the case with one that made the illustrious New York Post this week for a MAJOR safety violation\n\nROUND 2: A Marine living off-base at Camp Lejeune was willing to put his career on the line when he saw the conditions his fellow devil-dogs were stuck under in the barracks. Mold, boiling temps, broken facilities. Will his viral Facebook post save the day or get him in deep trouble?\n\nROUND 3: A $1 TRILLION spending package has been proposed in the Senate that’s meant to tackle economic fallout from COVID-19… so uh what’s up with $30 BILLION worth of draft items tucked in there for the military?\n\nRound 4: Michel Paridis who wrote a book! WOW\n\nROUND 5: An Ohio HVAC company is offering its services to President Trump after an errant Tweet. They played it pretty… cool if you ask us.\n\nROUND 6: Zero Blog Thirty has been around for 285 episodes. Nearly 4 years. 1,422 days. Something happened this week that has never happened in the history of the show and we are NOT happy about it!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
