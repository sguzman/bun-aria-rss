  "description": "<p>This is an in-the-field recording of the Bear Grease [Render]! Clay hosts his son, Bear John, and MeatEater's Cory Calkins, as they discuss a harrowing encounter they had calling in a black bear and grizzly at the same time. They recount the story Bear Newcomb's first-ever spring boar -- a blonde bear Clay calls \"the most beautiful bear I've ever seen.\" Later in the episode, they touch on the second Genuine Outlaw podcast. This all comes to you straight from the back country as the boys sit around the fire and render down the fat of Bear Newcomb's bear. This episode is full of great stories and close calls.</p>\n<p><br>Connect with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p>\n<p>Clay on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>MeatEater on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p>\n<p>Shop&nbsp;<a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
