  "description": "<p>Back in the frigid streets of NYC, Mal & Rory rehash their weekend work trip to Atlanta, and how it felt returning back to their igloo of a hometown. The footage of them learning to fight crime in Detroit has been posted to our YouTube, and they once again reiterate that Dale’s techniques (*might*) actually work. They get into Big Sean’s Drink Champs episode where he responds to Kanye’s previous comments, and wonder how Pusha T is handling the “reconciliation” of Drake & Kanye. This leads into a conversation about friendship, and how women and men handle them differently. Of course, we wouldn’t be us if we didn’t give people relationship advice they didn’t ask for, so we try to help Justine through her breakup with Giveon (somewhat). New music is spoken on, Christmas plans, having a loose caboose, and more!</p>\n",
