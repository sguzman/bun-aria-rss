Then, Trump announced that 1.8 million jobs have been restored per today's jobs report cutting the unemployment rate by nearly half to 10.8%. More than half of all counties in the US reported less than 20 cases last week. Later, sportscaster Stephen A. Smith joins the show to talk about sports and culture.

Chip Roy to discuss his run against Democrat Wendy Davis.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
