  "description": "In this episode, Sharon talks with Will Hurd, a former CIA officer and member of Congress. Will recently released his book, <em>American Reboot: An Idealist’s Guide to Getting Big Things Done</em>. In it, he details some of the issues he’s seen up close and personal through his careers, and carries with him his mother’s advice: you’re either part of the problem or part of the solution. Will talks about what being part of the solution looks like: appealing to the middle, not to the edges, showing up for people, and learning to inspire and not fear-monger. Will and Sharon also talk about the importance of America retaining its democracy, which may seem like a given, but is dependent on how we uphold the principles that support political involvement and freedoms.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
