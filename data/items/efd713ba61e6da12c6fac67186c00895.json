  "description": "<p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 1:</p><p>Dr. Fauci says football may not happen. Hard to see how any sports leagues open, if one player gets COVID-19, everything will shut down. Bolton book will have zero impact on election. Bolton held out for book deal. Deep Staters all wanted a shot at changing Trump's mind. Total BS: Bolton claims Trump asked ChiCom president for help in his election, Lighthizer denies. Roberts sides with liberals on DACA, says Obama's executive order stands, but Trump's doesn't. Roberts is Chief Justice of the Deep State Washington Establishment, devoted to obstructing Trump, open borders, keeping power for Washington elites. They're trying to tell you there's no point voting Republican. We need to keep voting Republican because there's no reasonable alternative, need a Trump second term to keep whacking away at the establishment, keep looking for the next Thomas, Alito. The cultural revolution we're in the midst of will start eating itself. We have to fight to save America from cultural rot, corrupt ruling class and institutions.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>Conservative missionaries to the blue states? Radical revolutionaries wind up destroying each other. Seattle African-American woman who explained the history of Democrats to CHOP radicals. Trump back up to 47% in Rasmussen. Moral values for humanity are universal. The largest cities in the blue states have been run by Democrats for years. Caller on the impact of a season without college athletics. How Trump was convinced to shut down the country by Dr. Fauci and The Scarf Queen. Trump knew after two weeks the push to lock down was political. Roberts ruling on DACA is all about blocking Trump, not really about the content of the executive order. Idea of conservative missionaries to blue states is not about religion, it's about presenting an alternative view of life.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p>The \"conservative\" brand has been destroyed. Facebook takes down Trump ads. We need to find a new word. Actor Terry Crews on \"black supremacy\", black people judging black people who aren't Democrats, calling them Uncle Toms. Victor Davis Hanson on radical revolutions. Roberts and Trump. DACA and reparations. Democrats think they're cruising to a landslide, repeating all the same mistakes they made in 2016. Pollsters don't know how to reach Trump voters, don't know who they are. Father's Day sale in Rush Store.
