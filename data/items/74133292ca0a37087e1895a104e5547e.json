  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott made remarks today the way we hoped our President would have but instead, Biden politicized the deaths of these innocent children in Texas. But then former Congressman Beto O'Rourke rushed the stage to heckle the Governor and blame him for deadly gun laws. Then, the candidates for the US Senate primary in Pennsylvania are in court as David McCormick has filed a slip-and-fall lawsuit. The Pennsylvania Constitution is clear that the Secretary of State and the Supreme Court cannot change election laws, yet they did years ago. Moreover, all of the extras like forced mail-in ballots, poll workers dating and 'curing' ballots for voters and skipping the signature verification of ballot envelopes; all of these actions legally void a ballot (but they didn't in 2020). This is not a civil rights issue; this is a legal issue. If McCormick’s campaign wins this lawsuit it will pave the way for Democrats to follow suit for the next election. Later, America doesn't need an absolute full-throated demagogue trashing the police officers that responded to this mass murder. Yet, Biden harped on the frayed public trust he claims is broken with police. Interestingly, Biden never signs an executive order to stop the killings happening in big cities in blue states run by his fellow Democrats. No mention of the same cities with the strongest gun control laws being the same cities with the most shootings and killings, just look at New York City and Chicago where crime is out of control and lunatics are on the loose. Afterward, those that hate America have always operated through a vehicle known as the Democrat Party. whether it was promoting, slavery, the Ku Klux Klan, and Jim Crow or the anti-Semitism, Critical Race Theory, and hatred for the Constitution that we see them espouse today. Now the American Marxists use the government as their personal iron fist to silence or spy on political dissidents. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
