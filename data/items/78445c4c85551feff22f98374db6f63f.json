  "description": "My nephew, Joe Davide, is back on the show to discuss investing from the Gen Z perspective. If you’ve never heard Joe before, you’re in for a treat... Listeners love his authenticity and transparency. [0:38] Today, he gives an update on how his portfolio has fared over the last six months. [3:45] In a great teachable moment, we discuss how to manage winners and losers... and what led Joe to have a change of heart and sell several positions. [6:30] He explains where he’s finding his ideas... and how he conducts research before pulling the trigger on stocks. [9:37] Next, Joe shares why he only holds one position right now—a SPAC—and explains why he’s planning to hold for the long term.  I share my opinion on this name… point out a few things to pay attention to when looking at the fundamentals… and explain why SPACs could have a lot of pain ahead. [11:25] Finally, we discuss the most important investing lesson… why you must focus on portfolio management... and staying in the investing game over the long term. [23:30] Enjoyed this episode?
