  "title": "Why We're Polarized, with Jamelle Bouie (live!)",
  "description": "The Why We’re Polarized book tour kicked off this week with a wonderful event at Sixth and I in Washington, DC. My conversation partner for this one was New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie. Our interview was great, and then the audience questions were so good we had to keep them in as well. We discuss:  \n• Why things were far worse in the “golden age” of the 1950s and ’60s than they are today\n• Why the key question isn’t so much “why are we polarized?” as “why weren’t we polarized?”\n• Why “moderate” Republicans end up losing to conservatives\n• Why demographic change is the core cleavage of American politics today\n• How polarization makes bipartisanship irrational and political dysfunction the norm\n• Why Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are not the causes of polarization but rather the most clear manifestations of it\n• That more information doesn’t rescue politics\n• Why America today is not functionally a democracy (and why I hate when people claim it is a “republic” to justify our current system)\n• Why the most underrated divide in American politics is not that between left and right but between the informed and the uninformed\n• Why we can’t reverse polarization and instead need to reform our political system so that it can function amid polarization\n\nNew to the show?
