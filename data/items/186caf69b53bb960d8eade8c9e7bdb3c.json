  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 8/6/19",
  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the pressure is on to destroy the Second Amendment. If you believe President Trump is the reason that this mass shooting took place then why do you need to take away our weapons? All the Democrats need to do is defeat Trump, right? So why go after the Second Amendment? Because it's a lie!  Two domestic terrorists with socialist, racist and progressive views commit atrocious acts of terror and they continue to blame Trump. Despite one shooter's support for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, they still blame Trump. The Democrats and the media endlessly lobby for more gun control without ever casting blame on themselves.  Then, Joe Biden, Beto O'Rourke and others say they're open to taking tyrannical measures to make the United States more like Australia (a gunless society). Every major communist and fascist in history gained control by eliminating everything we protect in our First and Second Amendments; speech, press, faith, and the right to keep and carry guns.  Afterward, despite Trump's multiple disavowal's of white supremacy, Sen. Cory Booker and sympathizers in the media continue to malign Trump falsely accusing him of racism. It's difficult to see if they even care about this shooting at all, or just relish in attacking Trump and the Second Amendment. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
