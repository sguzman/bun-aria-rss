  "description": "<p><strong>Jim Druckman</strong> grew up in the furniture industry. As a young man he followed his father into the family distribution business and learned the trade. Then, in the 1990s Druckman took over at the <a href=\"https://nydc.com/\">New York Design Center</a> and began transforming the building into the high-end, design-driven destination it is today. In that role, and as president of the board at Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club, he has helped build the interior design industry as we know it. </p><p>In this episode of the podcast, coinciding with the 95th anniversary of the New York Design Center, Druckman speaks with host Dennis Scully about how showrooms and design centers need to keep offering designers a reason to come shopping, what the lasting effects of COVID might be, and why the biggest challenge the industry faces has little to do with pricing or transparency, and everything to do with educating the public on the value of great design. </p><p><i>This episode is sponsored by </i><a href=\"https://www.theshadestore.com/customer-service/to-the-trade\"><i>The Shade Store</i></a><i> and </i><a href=\"https://www.onsidedoor.com/\"><i>SideDoor</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n",
