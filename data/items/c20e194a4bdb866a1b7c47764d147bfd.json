  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, President Trump is attacked for having stamina and mental fitness. Trump has traveled the country for work, his re-election campaign, leisure, and vicious interviews with the hostile media. Joe Biden, however, is missing in action and he only appears digitally because he rarely leaves his house. He eliminates any opportunity to be tested or questioned in a tough manner by the media. The media hasn't even given any close examination to Biden’s possible VP choices, Kamala Harris and Susan Rice, either. Sadly the Democrat Party is like the Communist Party, choosing Party and power over people. Then, Trump announces a $10 Million bounty on hackers interfering with the upcoming 2020 elections. Computer fraud will not be tolerated, although fraud from the FBI and the CIA doesn't seem to bother Democrats. Later, Michelle Obama might be one of America's best capitalists and simultaneous Marxists. Running for any public office would open her up to scrutiny over her finances. Notwithstanding the fact that Michelle Obama has accomplished nothing. Afterward, ANTIFA has historically sought to destroy capitalism and subvert and overthrow the American government. They claim to be against fascism but use it to achieve their goals. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
