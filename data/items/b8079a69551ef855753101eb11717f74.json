  "description": "<p><p>Grit Week 19 continues. We've been up and down the coast interviewing guests and Big Cat got the re-follow from Anna Kendrick after some help from AWL Zac Efron (3:22 - 9:49) . It's been a weird long week already. NBA playoffs, Drake sucks, the Raptors are back, and Steph Curry is amazing (9:49 - 20:30). The Blues are in the Stanley Cup Final (20:30 - 23:17). Hot Seat/Cool Throne (23:17 - 38:21). Rams Head Coach Sean McVay joins the show to talk about the Super Bowl loss, him not giving us suites for the big game, Kliff Kingsbury possibly being hotter than he is, having the BOAT in his QB room, and remembering plays (38:21 - 60:19). Segments include Uhhh Ya Think, Bad Visual for Daniel Jones and Eli  being identical, hurt or injured Cespedes, and Guys on Chicks. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
