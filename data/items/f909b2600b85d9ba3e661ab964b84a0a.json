In this podcast I talk to my guests about their open relationships and how they navigate their boundaries, attraction, and transcend jealousy.</p><p>First, in these interviews from 2017, I talk to actor and model Nico Tororella about his fluid sexuality and the open communication required in his relationships. Then I speak with my friend and colleague at SiriusXM, Australian radio host, professional skateboarder and MMA fighter Jason Ellis about his open relationship and how to put your partner first in a threesome. You’ll be surprised to hear how different Jason and Nico’s boundaries are, even in open relationships. Thinking about making your relationship a little more alternative?
