  "description": "<p>Wireless sensor networks consist of sensor nodes that are physically\ndistributed over different locations. Spatial filtering procedures exploit the\nspatial correlation across these sensor signals to fuse them into a filtered\nsignal satisfying some optimality condition. However, gathering the raw sensor\ndata in a fusion center to solve the problem in a centralized way would lead to\nhigh energy and communication costs. The distributed adaptive signal fusion\n(DASF) framework has been proposed as a generic method to solve these signal\nfusion problems in a distributed fashion, which reduces the communication and\nenergy costs in the network. The DASF framework assumes that there is a common\ngoal across the nodes, i.e., the optimal filter is shared across the network.\nHowever, many applications require a node-specific objective, while all these\nnode-specific objectives are still related via a common latent data model. In\nthis work, we propose the DANSF algorithm which builds upon the DASF framework,\nand extends it to allow for node-specific spatial filtering problems.\n</p>",
