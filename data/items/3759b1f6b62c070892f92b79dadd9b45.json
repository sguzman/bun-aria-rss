    "media:description": "It's time to go a little deeper with our understanding of classical physics! From the very introductory conceptual tutorials on electricity and magnetism, we need to apply some more rigor and use advanced math that will help us really understand these topics. To start we will examine Maxwell's equations. These are the gold standard for describing electromagnetic fields. If the math looks unfamiliar be sure to visit my mathematics playlist for some review. First up, Gauss's law for the electric field!\n\nWatch the whole Classical Physics playlist: http://bit.ly/ProfDavePhysics1\n\nModern Physics Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDavePhysics2\nMathematics Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveMaths\nGeneral Chemistry Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveGenChem\nOrganic Chemistry Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveOrgChem\nBiochemistry Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveBiochem\nBiology Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveBio\n\nEMAIL► ProfessorDaveExplains@gmail.com\nPATREON► http://patreon.com/ProfessorDaveExplains\n\nCheck out \"Is This Wi-Fi Organic?\", my book on disarming pseudoscience!\nAmazon: https://amzn.to/2HtNpVH\nBookshop: https://bit.ly/39cKADM\n&#13;Barnes and Noble: https://bit.ly/3pUjmrn \nBook Depository: http://bit.ly/3aOVDlT",
