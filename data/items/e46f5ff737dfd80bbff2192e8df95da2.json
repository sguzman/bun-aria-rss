  "description": "Jeff Brown, editor of the  newsletter and former head of divisions at tech giants Qualcomm and Juniper Networks, says it's the best time to invest in technology in 40 years. He breaks down the biggest trends in the industry including Big Data, Robotics and Cyber Security. \nJeff then talks about the private equity (pre-IPO) market.  As an angel investor, he's more than doubled his money several times over by investing in the right area in technology at the right time. He highlights how it used to take a typical Fortune 500 company roughly 20 years to reach a $1 billion market-cap.  Today, it takes as little as three years for companies like Uber and Snapchat to achieve this milestone.   \nJeff explains how to invest in private companies. More important, he shares his favorite segments - within the private tech sector - that are seeing the most interest from multi-billion dollar venture funds.",
