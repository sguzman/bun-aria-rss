  "description": "The commonly held, idealized picture of technology is that tech makes our lives easier, safer, and better in just about every respect. But an unintended consequence of that picture is an unjustified assumption that companies will sell more products if they serve the public interest, and that may not be so. On the consumer side, personal technology investments are often a race to the price bottom, with little attention paid to the security of the products we buy. Vendors may enjoy less scrutiny and accountability, but that's not necessarily in the consumers' interest. Good things almost always come when technology steps out of the shadows and into the light of the mainstream.\nIt’s time that happened in cybersecurity, where everyone, from suppliers to consumers, has a role to play. In this episode of CyberWire-X, knowledgeable representatives across that spectrum to learn what they have to say about risk, accountability, and, above all, transparency. Guest Dr. Georgianna Shea from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies shares her insights with the CyberWire's Rick Howard, and Sponsor Tanium's CISO for the Americas Chris Hallenbeck joins the CyberWire's Dave Bittner to discuss achievable steps the government, private sector, and the broader public can take to start moving the needle on cybersecurity.",
