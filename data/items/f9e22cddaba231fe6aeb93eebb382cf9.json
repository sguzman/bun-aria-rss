Go buy an ad. Cisco patches the wi-fi KRACK. NotPetya's still costing manufacturers and their insurers a lot of money. MalwareTech, a.k.a. Emily Wilson from Terbium Labs responding to post-Equifax breach credit agency claims that they can scan the Dark Web. Michael Sutton, CISO at Zscaler on zero-day hoarding. Marcus Hutchins, gets to take off that GPS and stay out late, since the judge decided his pre-trial behavior has been pretty good.",
