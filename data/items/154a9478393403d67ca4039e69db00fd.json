A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. \n\nGuilty as charged.  Its that time again to stand and advance the simple facts, that as I am Politically Incorrect, and so are many of you, that telling the truth is an act of disobedience. The very simplest of things are what are being used as a social experiment, that education, economics and critical thinking, are not being advanced but undermined in order to create a group of drones, slaves if you will to do the masters bidding. Are you ready to be a slave?\n\n Podcast: Galtspeaks.com Contact: Radio@galtspeaks.com Follow us on twitter.com/radiomarkowitz & Facebook.com/radiomarkowitz Spreaker-www.spreaker.com/show/the-warren-markowitz-show & our new home on Redstatetalkradio.com Support the podcast, use the next level of autonomy, cryptocurrency: BTC: Azen7A8rsEwQ84SCB3ZsbuYALpNCGgqNc",
