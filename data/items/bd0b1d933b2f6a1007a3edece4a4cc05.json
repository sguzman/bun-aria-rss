    "media:description": "On Friday the 26th of November 2010, at 5.15pm, Yara said goodbye to her family, left home, and walked the short distance to her gym. Five hours later, she would die alone in a field while her whole family was out looking for her.\nIt would be six years before justice was served, but this case is proof of what a justice system is capable of when the police focus on catching a murderer.\n\nSimon's Social Media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SimonWhistler\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/simonwhistler/\n\nLove content?
