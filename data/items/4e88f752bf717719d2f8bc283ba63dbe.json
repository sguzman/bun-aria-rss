  "description": "<p>It's the last episode of 2017 and it's only fitting that Las Culturistas ends the year with a little twist! Matt has been whisked off to Los Angeles for 24 hrs, so in his stead, the Floridian Queen & host of Fresh Batch podcast, Michelle Collins, joins forces with Bowen to welcome a true Culturista to the pod, Eliot Glazer (New Girl, Broad City). And if you're thinking this episode WOULDN'T cover sound baths, then you're extremely wrong. Because they talk about sound baths. As well as Twee Culture, Jada Pinkett Smith's metal band \"Wicked Wisdom,\" modern parenting, The View (and Michelle's experience as a host), Plus, Hot Engineer Will tells the insane story of being flown out to LA to walk on the red carpet with 30-50 other Will Smiths for the premiere of Netflix's \"Bright\", starring Will Smith. And of course, three hot \"I Don't Think So, Honeys!\" to close out the year.
