  "title": "Why more sanctions won’t convince North Korea to give up its nukes",
  "description": "Yochi, Jenn, and Zack look at why decades of US economic sanctions haven’t stopped North Korea’s nuclear program — and why the Trump administration’s new ones probably won’t, either. They examine how such a devastatingly poor country has managed to develop an advanced nuclear weapons program, how Kim Jong Un stays so rich while his people starve, and how the country profits by selling illegal mushrooms and building Stalinist statues across Africa. On Elsewhere, they look at why protesters in Germany just threw a tomato at Angela Merkel, Donald Trump’s least favorite European leader (hint: it has to do with Syrian refugees). \nLearn more about your ad choices.
