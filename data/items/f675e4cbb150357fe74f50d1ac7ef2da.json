  "description": "<p>In the latter half of 2021, Jai Bhavnani of Rari Capital and Joey Santoro of FEI Protocol went to each other's governance forums and proposed the FEI RARI token merge: the biggest protocol merger that we've ever seen in the space.</p> <p>The concept garnered high engagement and a ton of community response, and the formal votes received overwhelming support on both sides. This unprecedented merge is a historical moment for DAOs. The verticalization of DeFi is happening with new 'mafias' emerging in several corners of DeFi. Uniting capital efficiency, values, and communities, we are right alongside Jai with his excitement to see how this all plays out.</p> <p>With new conversations of anti-trust and competition, it's clear that the DAO space is continuing to mature. Integrated DeFi stacks are increasingly exciting, and in this episode, we dive into the details with two pioneers of interDAO relationships.</p> <p>------<br /> 📣 ONJUNO | Crypto from your Checking Account!<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/OnJuno\">https://bankless.cc/OnJuno</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>🍵 MATCHA | SMART ORDER ROUTING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Matcha\">https://bankless.cc/Matcha</a> </p> <p>🚀 SLINGSHOT | LAYER 2 SOCIAL TRADING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Slingshot\">https://bankless.cc/Slingshot</a> </p> <p>🏦 GEMINI | TURN FIAT INTO CRYPTO<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Gemini\">https://bankless.cc/Gemini</a> </p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Brave\">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 5:50 The TribeDAO Merger<br /> 10:48 Rari Capital & FEI<br /> 13:37 FEI & Rari Capital<br /> 17:14 Liquidity Engines<br /> 24:36 Turbo Verticalization<br /> 29:12 Aligning Incentives<br /> 32:08 The God Theory of DAOs<br /> 35:19 RGT & Operations<br /> 40:53 The Broader DAO Space<br /> 46:36 Anti-Trust in Crypto<br /> 52:36 TribeDAO Roadmap<br /> 56:42 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Jai on Twitter: <br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/jai_bhavnani?s=20\">https://twitter.com/jai_bhavnani?s=20</a> </p> <p>Joey on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/joey__santoro?s=20\">https://twitter.com/joey__santoro?s=20</a> </p> <p>FEI:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/feiprotocol?s=20\">https://twitter.com/feiprotocol?s=20</a> </p> <p>Rari:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/RariCapital?s=20\">https://twitter.com/RariCapital?s=20</a> </p> <p>Jai's Forum Post:<br /> <a href= \"https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-51-fei-rari-token-merge/3642\">https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-51-fei-rari-token-merge/3642</a> </p> <p>Joey's Forum Post:<br /> <a href= \"https://forums.rari.capital/d/177-feirari-token-merge\">https://forums.rari.capital/d/177-feirari-token-merge</a> </p> <p>Swap RGT for TRIBE:<br /> <a href= \"https://feirari-swap-interface.vercel.app/\">https://feirari-swap-interface.vercel.app/</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
