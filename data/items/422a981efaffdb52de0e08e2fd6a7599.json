We're bringing on Ryan Wilson and Dan Schneier to talk about Ryan's latest mock draft and react to the picks. First, should dynasty managers consider trading out of the 2022 rookie draft in order to get in on the 2023 rookie draft (3:00)? And Ryan will give you a little introduction to the elite wide receivers of this year's draft (6:35) as we will talk much more about them later on the show ... Ryan has three offensive tackles in his first six picks, but will they have any impact in Fantasy (11:10)? Of course Garrett Wilson to the Falcons at #8 overall (21:30) will have a Fantasy impact, as will Jameson Williams to the Jets and Drake London to the Commanders (24:40). If those three scenarios play out, who would be our favorite wide receiver in that group? ... The first quarterback comes off the board and it's Malik Willis to New Orleans (33:15). We give a scouting report on Willis before getting back to the wide receivers. Green Bay takes Treylon Burks and Kansas City takes Chris Olave (39:00)! Let's talk about these guys and what to make of Burks' disappointing 40 time. Then we'll spend the rest of the show talking more about wide receivers and tight ends (55:40) plus some movie reviews at the very end! ...
