  "description": "It was 2016, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yebbasmith?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Yebba's</a> career was beginning to take off.  But 2016 was also the year that something awful happened: Yebba's mother committed suicide. And that changed everything, too.<br/><br/>Now, after years of collaborating with artists the likes of Sam Smith, PJ Morton and Robert Glasper, Yebba has her own standalone album. It's called <em>Dawn,</em> a reference to her mother's name. In this chat, Yebba and Sam talk about the emotional toll it took to make <em>Dawn</em>, growing up in the church, and shedding old beliefs while making room for new ones.",
