  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, this election is about the culture, the country, and the future. Crime is out of control, sanctuary cities are a haven for illegal immigrants, and Democrats are responsible for promoting it all. Yet they blame you for the anarchy and lawlessness that they allow and encourage. Since when is it a good idea to shut down energy production and increase inflation and government spending? Then, why aren't President George W. Bush, former Speakers John Boehner, and Paul Ryan, or Governor Chris Christie speaking up and campaigning for Republican candidates in this last week before the midterm elections? Later, Kelly Tshibaka, the US Senate candidate in Alaska, calls in with an update on her final push to unseat Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Tshibaka says she needs our help to win in Alaska. Afterward, JD Vance, the US Senate candidate for Ohio joins the show with an update on this final week of campaigning before Election Day. Vance says that there are only 1000 billionaires in the U.S we don't need 87,000 more IRS agents. Vance rejected the hormonal experimentation that is done on our children in the name of gender equality. Finally, Leora levy, the US Senate candidate for Connecticut calls in to explain how close the race is between her and Sen. Blumenthal and how much of a failure his record is. Levy added that Connecticut pays more for energy than almost all other states in the country. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
