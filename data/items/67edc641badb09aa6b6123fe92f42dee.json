  "description": "<p>During today’s episode we’re going to explain how you need <em>more</em> financial stress in your life!.. Well, not quite, but we do think that the <em>proper</em> amount of stress in our lives can be helpful in achieving the money goals we’re pursuing. All things in moderation though- just like you want to avoid having too much of a good thing, we obviously want to avoid overwhelming stress in our lives. But the thing is, it’s oftentimes not even the stress itself that is bringing us down, but the negative coping mechanisms and habits that we turn to that can be the most destructive, and that can cost us the most. We believe that by reframing how you view stress and by putting it in the proper light, you can use financial stress to your advantage. Listen and we’ll explain how!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Coconut Stout by Easy Chair Brewing Garage- thanks to Jess for donating this one to the podcast!
