In the summer of 2015, Sgt Wickett led a team of Grey & Simcoe Foresters on an International Skill-at-Arms Competition where the team placed First, internationally and Fourth overall. Sgt Wickett is currently undergoing training to become an Infantry Warrant Officer and Platoon 2iC.</p>\n<p>Cpl Allan Wickett initially enrolled in the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment in the City of Belleville, Ontario, in 1954, at the age of 15, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. After a lengthy absence from the Canadian Forces, Al re enrolled in the Princes of Wales Own Regiment in Sept 1993 to participate in competitive shooting as a service member. After relocating with his family due to work, Cpl Wickett transferred to the Gray & Simcoe Foresters in 1998, where he changed trades to Vehicle Technician. He applied the skills of his new trade at the 3<sup>rd</sup> Canadian Ranger Patrol Group at CFB Borden.  Cpl Wickett had the opportunity to deploy on a Technical Assistance Visit to Afghanistan to conduct required upgrades and maintenance on the LAV-3 and the T-LAV (formerly the M-113) in 2008. Al retired from the Canadian Armed Forces in June of 2014. He has been awarded the Afghanistan Star, the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Medal and the Canadian Forces&#8217; Decoration.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-1026-8\" preload=\"none\"
