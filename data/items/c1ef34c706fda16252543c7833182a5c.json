  "description": "<p>On this episode, Kevin interviews Civil War historian <a href=\"http://www.allenguelzo.com/\">Dr. Allen Guelzo</a> , Senior Research Scholar at Princeton. Dr. Guelzo’s new biography of Robert E. Lee paints a portrait of neither a sinner nor a saint, but a full picture of a complex human being. Dr. Guelzo is a historian with a solid theological background. He and Kevin address how General Lee could be both opposed to slavery and commit treason to defend it. The South came very close to victory: How would that have changed history? How did Lee’s fatherlessness affect his leadership? And of course they cover the question of the removal of statues. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Life and Books and Everything</em></strong> is sponsored by Crossway, publisher of new books by <a href=\"https://www.crossway.org/authors/michael-reeves/\">Michael Reeves</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crossway.org/authors/dane-c-ortlund/\">Dane Ortlund</a> . </p>\n<p>For 30% off this book and all other books and Bibles at Crossway, sign up for a free Crossway+ account at crossway.org/LBE.</p>\n<p><strong>Timestamps:</strong></p>\n<p>Dr. Allen Guelzo, First-time Listener [1:02 – 2:47]</p>\n<p>Guelzo’s Other Historical Works [2:47 – 12:53]</p>\n<p>The Making of a Great Course [12:53 – 14:13]</p>\n<p>Writing a Biography of Robert E.
