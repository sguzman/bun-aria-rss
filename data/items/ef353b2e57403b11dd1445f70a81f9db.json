  "description": "<p> A lot of us learn how to love, but we don’t necessarily learn how to cope with not loving everything about the person we love. This episode is all about the difference between disliking some things about your partner and/or disliking your partner. How do you know if something small and annoying can turn into something big and unbearable down the road? What should you do when you get to the place where the two of you just can't seem to get along?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jazzmyne Jay is back in this episode to share why she moved in with her partner and then moved out once she found that they just couldn’t get along. And guess what -- they are still together to this day despite that storm. I am also joined by my husband Jared Brady and we discuss why we've never liked each other less than we do right now. Plus, we go through an exercise to try and understand this phase we’re currently in.
