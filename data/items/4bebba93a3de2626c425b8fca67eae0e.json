(You cannot pick bad day, or any song with loser in it) // \n\nYou’re riding your brand new bicycle down your towns biggest hill! As you’re soaring you start to lose control. Your life flashes before your eyes. You know your gonna have knees filled with gravel and maybe lose a tooth, but somehow, you even out and don’t crash! Why song plays through this epic core memory? // \n\nIt’s your birthday. Your cousin gets you a…cat. You did not ask for a cat. What song plays?",
