  "description": "<p>This is pragmatism as its most inspirational. Anna Turley is here to sort stuff out and is passionate about solving problems. She was the Labour MP for Redcar until 2019 when the toxicity of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership turned a proud Labour seat into a Tory gain. Anna describes how she was simultaneously trying to mitigate the catastrophic loss of the steel industry in the area, while fighting a legal case against Unite the Union and a hard left website. On top of that, she had to deal with the far right and, incredibly, those on the left who were helping them. Ultimately this is a hopeful tale of using public office to change things for the better.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Anna on Twitter: @annaturley</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NEW GUESTS ANNOUNCED FOR THE POLITICAL PARTY LIVE:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>27 Sept: Andy Burnham</p><p>11 Oct: Penny Mordaunt</p><p>25 Oct: Caroline Flint</p><p>8 Nov: Anas Sarwar</p><p>22 Nov: Anthony Scaramucci</p><p>6 Dec: Jeremy Hunt</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Buy tickets to The Political Party, live at The Duchess Theatre including the opening night with&nbsp;<strong>Andy Burnham on Monday 27 September</strong>&nbsp;here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nimaxtheatres.com/shows/the-political-party-with-matt-forde/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nimaxtheatres.com/shows/the-political-party-with-matt-forde/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read Keir Starmer's pamphlet, The Road Ahead, here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Road-Ahead-KEIR-STARMER_web.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Road-Ahead-KEIR-STARMER_web.pdf</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Email the show: <a href=\"mailto:politicalpartypodcast@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">politicalpartypodcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Matt on Twitter: @mattforde</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
