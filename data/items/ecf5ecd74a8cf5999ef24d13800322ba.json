  "description": "<p>The British Museum in London is a site to behold with over thirteen million objects in its vast collections from around the world. Over 17,000 people visit the 14-acre complex every single day, making it the most popular attraction in Great Britain. There is no doubt with the relics and other objects that are here, that a ghost or two might be hanging out due to attachments and such. And keeping in mind that some of these collections should probably be repatriated to their home countries, it's no wonder that spirits may be at unrest. Join us as we explore the history, collections and hauntings at the British Museum! The Moment in Oddity features the Two Headed Boy of Bengal and This Month in History features the Lewis and Clark Expedition's only death.</p> <p>Our sponsor for this episode is Sunbright Realty, LLC.
