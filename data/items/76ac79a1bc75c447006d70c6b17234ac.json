  "description": "2019 has been a BIG year for Tablo and Epik High. Let’s recap: Epik High independently released their chart topping album #sleeplessin___________, toured in both Europe and North America (25 shows in 24 cities), played festivals and shows across Korea, and are now gearing up for tours in Australia, China, and Southeast Asia this summer. While this rap god & genius is busy with all of these activities, he still manages to be a fantastic father and husband at the same time.
