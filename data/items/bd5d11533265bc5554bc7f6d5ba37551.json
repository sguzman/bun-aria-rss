On March 26 1993, she arranged to meet her ex-boyfriend Matt Elser at the animal hospital where she worked part-time in the small Northern Indiana city of LaPorte. But when Matt arrived to pick Rayna up, the lights were off in the building and she was nowhere to be seen. <br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>_ _ _ <br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>The Rayna Rison Memorial Scholarship<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>c/o Director of Music<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>602 F Street<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>La Porte, IN 46350<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>_ _ _ <br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Episode narrated by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/casefilehost\">Anonymous Host</a><br>\nResearched and written by <a href=\"http://agpstories.com/\">Anna Priestland<br>\n</a><br>\n\n</div>\n<div>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-79-rayna-rison/\">casefilepodcast.com/case-79-rayna-rison<br>\n</a><br>\n\n</div>\n",
