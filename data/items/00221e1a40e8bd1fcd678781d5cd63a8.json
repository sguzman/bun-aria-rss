  "description": "This week, we welcome legendary designer Markham Roberts to talk about his new book, Notes on Decorating. We talk about how his style has evolved, and he shares his knowledge and humor with us. We discuss why practicality is key, how to better combine traditional and modern style, and why his love of hot dogs is unparalleled.\nWhat You’ll Hear On This Episode:\n\nMarkham thinks the most important thing is understanding your clients and what makes them happy.\n\nPracticality is key.\n\nNot all decorating is created equal. Markham recommends considering the difference between mountain houses vs. beach houses, country vs. urban, etc., and to choose materials that reflect location, terrain and climate.\n\nWhen combining traditional and modern styles, Markham thinks there are no rules and it’s best just to DO IT. See what happens and how they relate to each other.\n\nWe talk about 3 houses Markham decorated all out West, belonging to 3 clients that were friends, that are very different.\n\nThe Nantucket house that Markham decorated truly indulged his creativity. The client’s unique and blunt personality challenged him to make a mix of styles work together.\n\nWe love how much Markham uses humor in his approach, and in his book, to enjoy his work. We dive into some of our favorite parts of his book.\n\nMarkham tells us how he got creative with a client’s antique pieces so they could be highlighted and not hidden.\n\nWe ask Markham about his guidelines on the contrast trend.\n\nMarkham talks to us about his love of subtlety, details and the use of simple ticking of fabrics.\n\nWe ask Markham for his best nuggets about textiles; don’t always go for the most formal and expensive fabric, play around with them, look at larger samples to really study it.\n\nMarkham shares what he loves about one of his personal properties in a small Victorian town in Washington state and how he and his partner, James, have worked for 20 years to make this home truly their own.\n\nMarkham tells us why he loves antique quilts and how to be careful when purchasing them.\n\nThe only thing that compares to Markham’s love of his dog and tennis, is hot dogs.\n\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\nMarkhamRoberts.Com\nMarkham’s Instagram\nNotes on Decorating \nDecorating the Way I See It  \n\nFind all of the show notes at Ballarddesigns.com/podcast.",
