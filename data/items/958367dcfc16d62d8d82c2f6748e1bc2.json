Burns (1759-1796) was born in Ayrshire and his work as a tenant farmer earned him the label The Ploughman Poet, yet it was the quality of his verse that helped his reputation endure and grow. His work inspired other Romantic poets and his personal story and ideas combined with that, giving his poems a broad strength and appeal - sung by revolutionaries and on Mao's Long March, as well as on New Year's Eve and at Burns Suppers.\n\nWith\n\nRobert Crawford\nProfessor of Modern Scottish Literature and Bishop Wardlaw Professor of Poetry at the University of St Andrews\n\nFiona Stafford\nProfessor of English at the University of Oxford\n\nand \n\nMurray Pittock\nBradley Professor of English Literature and Pro Vice Principal at the University of Glasgow\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
