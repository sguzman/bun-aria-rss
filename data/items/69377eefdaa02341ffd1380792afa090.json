By 2030, 50% of Americans will be diabetic or pre-diabetic. Not only is chronic illness is killing us, it's bankrupting our economy. </p><p>It’s insanity—and a reality that today’s guest lived, transmuted, and has committed his life to changing.</p><p>Meet New York City’s next mayor,<strong>&nbsp;Eric Adams</strong>.</p><p>At age 54, Eric woke up unable to read his alarm clock. Concerned about his vision and numbness in his extremities, he reluctantly went to the doctor, who delivered a grim diagnosis of advanced Type II diabetes. Progressive eyesight loss was inevitable. His nerve damage was leading him on a path to amputation. Going on a battery of medications for the rest of his life was a given.</p><p>Refusing to believe his fate was sealed, Eric decided instead to take matters into his own hands. Rather than googling ‘<em>living with diabetes</em>‘, instead he searched ‘<em>reversing diabetes</em>’. What he found was a plethora of support, science, and experts—many of which have appeared on this show—that inspired him to ditch his lifelong allegiance to the standard American diet in favor of a whole food plant-based diet.</p><p>Within weeks of this nutritional shift and without any medication whatsoever, Eric’s symptoms subsided and his diabetes indeed reversed. His vision returned. His nerves repaired themselves. In the months that followed, he lowered his cholesterol by 30 points. He dropped 35 pounds. And a new lease on life was signed.</p><p>Now five years hence, Eric is the fittest he’s ever been. His remarkable transformation inspired him to create radical initiatives as Brooklyn Borough President to improve the nutrition, health, and lives of New Yorkers and beyond. A commitment he’s adamant about expanding as New York’s next mayor.</p><p>Those who have followed this mayoral race closely know it’s been focused on one issue: law and order. Under-reported is Eric's incredible commitment to revolutionizing health policy, the direct result of his very personal experience with chronic lifestyle disease. </p><p>So today we dive into Eric’s remarkable journey from ill to well, and the purpose-driven mission it has birthed within him to revolutionize health not just in NYC, but across America.</p><p>I suspect you will end this exchange wanting to know more, in which case you should check out Eric’s book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Last-Plant-Based-Preventing-Reversing/dp/1401960561\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Healthy At Last: A Plant-Based Approach to Preventing and Reversing Diabetes and Other Chronic Illnesses.</a></p><p>I appreciate Eric for taking time out of his busy schedule to talk to me.
