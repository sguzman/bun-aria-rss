Today I spoke on <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/ianozsvald/making-pandas-fly-europython-2020\">Making Pandas Fly</a> with a focus on making Pandas run faster. This covered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Categories and RAM-saving datatypes to make 100-500x speed-ups (well, some of the time) including <a href=\"https://github.com/ianozsvald/dtype_diet/\">dtype_diet</a></li>\n<li>Dropping to NumPy to make things potentially 10x faster (thanks James Powell and his <a href=\"https://github.com/ianozsvald/callgraph_james_powell\">callgraph</a> code)</li>\n<li>Numba for compilation (another 10x!)</li>\n<li>Dask for parallelisation (2-8x!)</li>\n<li>and taking a view on Modin & Vaex</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We might ask &#8220;why do this&#8221; and my answer is &#8220;let&#8217;s go faster using the tools we already know how to use&#8221;. Specifically &#8211; without investing time learning a new tool (e.g. Intel SDC, Vaex, Modin, Dask, Spark and more) we can extend our ability to work with larger datasets without leaving the comfort of Pandas so you can get to your answers quicker.
