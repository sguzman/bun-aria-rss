For example, she and her colleagues have noted a &#8220;Fresh Start Effect&#8221;:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>The popularity of New Year’s resolutions suggests that people are more likely to tackle their goals immediately following salient temporal landmarks. &#8230; We propose that these landmarks demarcate the passage of time, creating many new mental accounting periods each year, which relegate past imperfections to a previous period, induce people to take a big-picture view of their lives, and thus motivate aspirational behaviors.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>What we&#8217;re looking for are <em>your </em>examples of fresh starts &#8212; whether it&#8217;s a new timeframe, job, relationship, living situation, etc. &#8212; and how it may have motivated some aspirational behaviors of your own.</p>\n<p>Use your <a href=\"http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-use-voice-memos-on-your-iphone.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"http://www.verizonwireless.com/mobile-living/tech-smarts/how-to-record-audio-smartphone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android</a>, or other recording device to make a short audio recording of your answer and e-mail the file to <a class=\"Xx\" dir=\"ltr\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"mailto:radio@freakonomics.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">radio@freakonomics.com</a>.
