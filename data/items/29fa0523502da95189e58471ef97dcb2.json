The same goes for agriculture and climate change. We can’t just blame cows and call it a day. It’s a complex issue that deserves a comprehensive plan of action. Regenerative agriculture recognizes the essential role of grazing animals in an ecosystem to create stronger soils, healthier crops, and produce better meat. On today’s episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, I sit down with Nicolette Hahn Niman to explore where we’ve gone wrong when it comes to raising meat, some of the biggest areas to focus on for a positive climate impact, and so much more. As a vegetarian rancher for almost two decades who now eats meat, she offers a unique perspective on raising and eating animals.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Nicolette Hahn Niman is a writer, attorney, and livestock rancher. She authored the books <em>Defending Beef </em>(2014, and second ed. 2021) and<em> Righteous Porkchop </em>(2009), as well as numerous essays for the <em>New York Times, Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. She has also written for T<em>he Atlantic, The San Francisco Chronicle</em>, and <em>The Earth Island Journal</em>, among others. Nicolette has appeared on T<em>he PBS Newshour, The Dr. Oz Show, </em>and in numerous films and documentaries, including <em>Eating Animals</em> and <em>Sustainable</em>. Previously, she was the Senior Attorney for the environmental organization Waterkeeper, where she focused on agriculture and food production; before that, she was an environmental lawyer for National Wildlife Federation.
