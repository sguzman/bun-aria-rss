  "description": "Before we review our mock draft, we wonder what the best draft slot is. Do you want a Top 6 pick? Or is it better to lock up two stud RBs with picks 7-12? Then we've got a lot of news to run through (10:00) with Melvin Gordon struggling with altitude, A.J. Dillon and Jonathan Taylor looking gigantic, Clyde Edwards-Helaire running with the starters and much more. And find out the other rookies who are turning heads (17:15) like Brandon Aiyuk ... Let's look at our 0.5 PPR mock draft! We tried some new strategies and we'll discuss what worked and what didn't. First of all, why did Jamey take Edwards-Helaire ahead of Michael Thomas (19:40)? And why did Derrick Henry make it to Round 2 (21:50)? ... We analyze Dave's team (27:30) beginning with his third round pick of Patrick Mahomes and how that shaped his roster. Did he regret taking Mahomes 25th overall? Then we shift to Adam's team (35:00) as he made it a point to establish RB depth early while still getting a potentially elite QB. Finally, Jamey's team (40:40) looks great with guys like Aaron Jones and Mike Evans. Let's just hope his starting QB doesn't stink! ...
