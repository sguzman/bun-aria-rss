  "description": "<p>Setting goals can be a difficult task. Well, setting goals isn’t difficult but setting goals that stick is a difficult task. We know this because 83% of new years resolutions are broken by February. Therefore the problem to solve is how to set BETTER goals. Today I share my 9 steps process for setting photography goals that stick.</p><p><b>Step 1: Realize you need to make a change</b></p><p>You can only make change when you WANT to change.</p><p><b>Step 2: Figure out WHERE you need to make a change</b></p><p>Ask yourself “What feels broken” “What do I need help with” because where you feel the most pain you can make the most growth.</p><p><b>Step 3: Set More Epic Goals</b></p><p>Don’t set goals too crazy or too simple. “Book 60 weddings” when you have never shot a wedding is crazy. “Learn Photography” it too simple. Create a goal thats in between.</p><p><b>Step 4: Write down your goals and make it seen</b></p><p>When you physically write out your goals on paper you’re 43% more likely to achieve them. When you post them somewhere you see them every day you increase that chance exponentially. My goals are posted above my computer.</p><p><b>Step 5: Make Baby steps</b></p><p>Make baby steps that it will take to achieve your goals to keep the momentum going.</p><p><b>Step 6: Make a challenge out of it</b></p><p>When you turn your goals into a game you’re more likely to keep up with the baby steps. Write them down on a calendar and mark them off every day.</p><p><b>Step 7: Check in with your goals</b></p><p>Set a date on your calendar quarterly to check in with your goals, re assess, and plan for the next quarter for new goals.</p><p><b>Step 8: Hang out with people who are also moving forward</b></p><p>“You are the sum of the 5 people closest to you” When you spend more time with photographers doing great things, you will elevate your skills and desire to do great things. Nowhere is that more important than when you go from hobby photographer to making money with your camera. Surrounding yourself a group of others dedicated to growing their business and making money is the key to quick growth.</p><p><a href='https://www.patreon.com/BeginnerPhotographyPodcast'><b>Become a premium member and get access to the premium members facebook group to surround yourself with like-minded hungry photographers!</b></a></p><p> </p><p><b>Step 9: Simulate what your life would look like after you hit your goals</b></p><p>Achieving your goals both planning and motivation.
