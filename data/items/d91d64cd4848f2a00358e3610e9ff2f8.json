  "description": "<p><p>Marathon 4 hour show today. Kirk Minihane responds to Bob Murchison's latest pathetic attempt to ruin his life. Minihane checks in with his friends at Surf & Turf. Minihane, Blind Mike and Steve Robinson explains their problems with each other as well as when they lost their virginity. Turn out, some high schools are more sexualized than others and Blind Mike was too embarrassed to buy a condom and probably has a kid. MHB calls in to defend his honor against accusations that Rich Kelleher is now the more valuable Minifan. KFC calls in to talk about potentially relocating to Boston as part of a mass exodus of Barstool employees to HQ 2. Humor with Ronald Reagan.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
