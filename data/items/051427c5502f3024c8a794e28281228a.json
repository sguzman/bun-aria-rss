Even better, a fix via pull request will ensure that your bug will be addressed in a timely manner and for the benefit to others in the community.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: Please don’t email directly via the email in the RSiteCatalyst package, it will not be returned. Having a valid email contact in the package is a requirement to have a package listed on CRAN so they can contact the package author, it is not meant to imply I can/will provide endless, personalized support for free.</em></p>"
