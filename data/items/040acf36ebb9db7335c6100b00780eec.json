  "description": "<p>Today we head to The Rock, America's Devil Island - Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. So much prison-related info and history to go over today! I'll share the history of Alcatraz Island - how it was discovered by a Spanish explorer, then went from a lighthouse and US military fort, to a US military prison, to the end of the line for the most unruly prisoners in the United States federal penitentiary system, to a national park. I'll share brief bios on some of its most infamous inmates, like Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly, share what a day on The Rock was like, and go over some pretty incredible escape attempts. I personally think at least three inmates - maybe five - actually did escape from America's most inescapable prison. Curious if you'll agree with me. Enjoy and Hail Nimrod!  <br /><br />Thanks to Bad Magic Patreon supporters, we'll be donating somewhere around $15,400 this month (exact figure TBD) to RAINN - the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network - America's largest anti-sexual violence organization.
