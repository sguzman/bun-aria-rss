As practices such as astrology, tarot, crystals, and herbal medicine enter the mainstream, the use of witchcraft to sell stuff has increased dramatically. Jessa sits down with writer, artist, and witch, Katelan Foisy, to discuss what happens when a serious religious practice becomes commodified. Katelan Foisy is a multimedia artist, writer, and witch. Her fine art pieces have been displayed at The Worcester Art Museum, Ohio History Museum, MODA, WEAM, A&D Gallery, and Last Rights. She has graced the pages of the Grammy Award programs and the stage of Cynthia von Buhler's immersive historical plays \"Speakeasy Dollhouse\" and \"The Brothers Booth.\" Katelan has been featured in NY Times, Elle magazine, Paper Magazine, GQ Italy, Time Out NY, and many others—for her work both as an artist, curator and occultist. She has written for Motherboard/VICE, Electric Literature, Luna Luna, ERIS magazine, and COILHOUSE. She is co-owner of London Conjure with Sister Enable in the UK. She was called a “Female Jack Kerouac” by Taylor Mead and a “Modern Day Francesca Woodman” by Cynthia von Buhler.
