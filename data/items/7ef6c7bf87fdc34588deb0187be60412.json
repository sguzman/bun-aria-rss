  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a school in New York encourages its white students to be “white traitors” and “white abolitionists.” We’ll talk about how this is only one of the ways in which our culture instills self-loathing, especially in children. And in our Five Headlines, the media starts “updating” its reporting on the death of Officer Brian Sicknick. The update is that their original reporting was bunk. Also Bill Gates tells us plebes that we need to stop eating meat. For our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the story of the father who sent out a few bad tweets and had Child Protective Services show up at his house because of it.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
