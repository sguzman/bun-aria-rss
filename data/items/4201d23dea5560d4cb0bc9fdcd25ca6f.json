  "description": "<p>Justin & I give our thoughts on the Rey Rivera case that is covered on the first episode of the new Unsolved Mysteries show on Netflix. It concerns a missing man later found deceased and his wife's mission to uncover the truth of what happened. The latter half of this episode is an interview that Justin did with Terry Dunn Meurer, one of the executive producers of Unsolved Mysteries. They discuss the new season, some of the cases it covers,&nbsp;give some background information on how they launched the new series and more. I haven't watched beyond episode one myself yet, but be aware that they discuss the series and so if you want to watch it first, we encourage you to do so. If you don't have Netflix then just listen to this episode. Justin & I are longtime fans of Unsolved Mysteries and we were excited to discuss a case that currently has many people talking.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
