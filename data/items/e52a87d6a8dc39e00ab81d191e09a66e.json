  "description": "<p>Imagine two people with exactly the same innate abilities, but one is born into a wealthy family and the other is born into poverty. Or two people born into similar circumstances, but one is paralyzed in a freak accident in childhood while the other grows up in perfect health. Is this fair? We live in a society that values some kind of “equality” — “All men are created equal” — without ever quite specifying what we mean. Elizabeth Anderson is a leading philosopher of equality, and we talk about what really matters about this notion. This leads to down-to-earth issues about employment and the work ethic, and how it all ties into modern capitalism. We end up agreeing that a leisure society would be great, but at the moment there’s plenty of work to be done.</p><p><em>Support Mindscape on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/seanmcarroll\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Patreon</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Elizabeth Anderson received a Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard University.
