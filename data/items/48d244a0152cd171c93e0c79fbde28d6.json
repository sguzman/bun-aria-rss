  "description": "In this episode, Sharon talks with Mónica Guzmán, whose new book, <em>I Never Thought of It That Way: How to Have Fearlessly Curious Conversations in Dangerously Divided Times </em>helps us learn how to get more comfortable with the uncomfortable. Monica argues that we need to chase “I never thought of it that way” moments we have in order to grow in curiosity. When we manufacture certainty, we tend to see people and the world around us as one-dimensional. It’s important to understand the views of others because we’re not always happy in our echo chambers; we lose relationships, we feel anxiety about the future, and we pin the blame wherever we can. Once we begin to get curious and shine a light on what we perceive as a threat, that threat feels less insurmountable. It’s through curiosity that we can begin to see people from multiple dimensions–they aren’t monsters, they are people, just like us.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
