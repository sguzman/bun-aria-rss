First, we get a lesson on barbecue etiquette (who knew) with our favorite duo, Nick Leighton and Leah Bonnema, Hosts of the podcast <a href=\"https://www.wereyouraisedbywolves.com/\" class=\"default\">Were You Raised by Wolves?</a> We get all kinds of tips, from the right way to ask for a family recipe to taking a house tour only <em>if </em>offered by your host. Then, Chefs Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich share their techniques and ideas for cooking over live fire. Their latest book is <em>Chasing Smoke, Cooking Over Fire Around the Levant</em>, and they left us with their recipe for <a href=\"https://www.splendidtable.org/story/2022/07/29/grilled-peaches-with-almond-tahini-and-charred-endive\" class=\"default\">Grilled Peaches with Almond Tahini and Charred Endive</a>. Then, it’s pitmaster Pat Martin talking about the whole hog barbecue culture in West Tennessee and how that whole hog style and tradition of BBQ may be on the path to extinction. His latest book is <em>Life of Fire: Mastering the Arts of Pit Cooked Barbecue, the Grill, and the Smokehouse</em>. You can find his recipe for <a href=\"https://www.splendidtable.org/story/2022/07/29/grilled-green-beans-with-memphis-dry-rub\" class=\"default\">Grilled Green Beans with Memphis Dry Rub.</a></p>\n<p>Broadcast dates for this episode:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>July 29, 2022 (originally aired)</p></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n",
