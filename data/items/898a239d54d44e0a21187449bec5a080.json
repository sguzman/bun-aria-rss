  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin, Herman Cain was the American dream. Cain maintained his honor, loyalty, and courage throughout his career and his campaign. He was a beloved patriot that fought with a smile and he will be missed. While some Americans couldn't even have funerals during the pandemic due to strict social distancing guidelines imposed by Democrats, yet Congressman John Lewis was able to have a very well-attended funeral although it was politicized by former President Barack Obama using demagogic attacks while eulogizing the late civil rights icon. Obama used Lewis' funeral to advance the agenda of the Democratic Party instead of advancing the civil rights agenda. Then, Georgia State Representative Vernon Jones calls in to discuss the media's bigotry and dishonesty when it comes to independent or conservative-leaning African Americans. Jones says the left can keep their plantation and their bigoted agent provocateurs. Later, mail-in voting is problematic and CBS News conducted their own mail-in test with mock ballots. The minority voters interviewed by CBS preferred and felt more secure with in-person voting to mail-in voting. Afterward, HUD Secretary Ben Carson joins the show to explain the dangers of the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) regulations and how they're being twisted to enhance the size and power of the federal government. Secretary Carson says that it is up to the American people to protect their country against socialism because the media has been compromised and is no longer objective.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
