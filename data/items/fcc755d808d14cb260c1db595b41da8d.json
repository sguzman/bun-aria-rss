  "description": "<p>Three Gateways to Peace and Freedom - This talk explores the three archetypal refuges of truth, love and awareness. We look at the outer and inner aspects of each refuge, and then through guided reflections and a Refuge Ritual, deepen our commitment to the pathways that awaken our minds and free our hearts.</p> <p>NOTE: Includes a Refuge Ritual at the end of the talk - if you'd like to participate, you'll need some red string. We use \"Classic crochet thread, size 10 in red\" about 36 inches per person. Sing along - the Three Refuges chant sheet is available at <a href= \"https://www.tarabrach.com/three-gateways-peace-freedom/\">www.tarabrach.com/three-gateways-peace-freedom/</a>.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely.
