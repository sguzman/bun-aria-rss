    "media:description": "In this Lambda World 2019 presentation, software engineers Katie Levy and Shelby Cohen share their experience introducing Kotlin and Functional Programming at Intuit.\n\nPresentation description:\n\nWe, as two entry level engineers, took on the challenge of introducing Kotlin and Functional Programming to our company, Intuit. Even though you all know Kotlin is a great language, we overcame the obstacles associated with a large company structure of having a common tech stack. In addition, Kotlin provided a natural transition for OOP Java developers to use Functional Programming Paradigms.\n\nHear about how, in less than two years, we went from getting our diplomas to gaining influence and driving change at a major technology company, and how you can do it too.\n\n------\nFollow: \n-https://www.twitter.com/lambda_world \n-https://www.twitter.com/47deg\n-https://twitter.com/klevy110\n-https://twitter.com/srcohen\n\nVisit: \n-https://www.47deg.com/events for more details\n-http://www.lambda.world",
