  "description": "<p>ADDITION IS MORE POWERFUL THAN SUBTRACTION.<br />\nYou’ll hear from a lot of people that if you want to succeed at something you need to cut out all of the bad. This may be in your business, your personal life, or even in your health.<br />\nIn reality, that’s not always the easiest thing to do. How many time have you had your heart broken and find yourself going through your ex’s Instagram posts to see what they are doing?<br />\nSure, it would be nice to cut it out - but for some reason you just can’t.<br />\nThe key is not to subtract these things from your life, but to add more positive things. When you do this, you won’t have the time to let bad things into your life.<br />\nFor example, if you are at a restaurant and you sit down at the table you may be eyeing the dessert menu. Maybe that chocolate cheesecake sounds so good.<br />\nWhen you order your meal you start with a salad, then order a healthy plate with a lot of vegetables. When you’re finished eating, you’re so full you don’t even want that cheesecake anymore.<br />\nApply that same principle into your life. Fill it with positivity in every area of your life and the bad will weed itself out over time.<br />\nTo dive deeper into this subject, I wanted to bring you back an older episode from Natalie Jill.<br />\nNatalie is an inspiration to everyone. She wasn’t born with a silver spoon in her mouth, and at one point lost everything she had worked for. Since then she’s gained it all back and more.<br />\nShe sat down and gave insights on how she is able to continually build on her success, and how anyone can achieve their goals.<br />\nSo learn how you can make your dreams come true through abundance instead of deprivation, on Episode 666.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nWhat you should think about in fitness (00:54)<br />\nHow to improve your emotional health (1:39)<br />\nWhat feeds into negativity (2:53)<br />\nWhat Natalie wants to be known for (3:42)</p>\n",
