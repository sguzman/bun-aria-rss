  "description": "Who saw this coming? Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. As all of you know, the one and only Donald Trump will become our next President. Our economic environment has radically changed overnight - and I'm here to break-down what this means for every sector going forward. I'll try my best to avoid anymore political discussion. Instead, on today's segment, we'll be talking about whats important - your portfolio. My guest this week is Nick Hodge - founder and President of the Outsider Club, and investment director of Early Advantage. One thing is clear... the resource bear market is coming to a close. And as Nick explains, opportunities are arising \"across-the-board.\" Nick shares with us his strategy of buying some of the highest-yielding resources at dirt cheap prices. To end the episode, Nick gives listeners his favorite stock ideas. This includes four buy-recommendations every resource stock investor needs to be aware of.",
