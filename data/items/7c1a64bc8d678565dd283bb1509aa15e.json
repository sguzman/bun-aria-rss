  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane is a real American hero. Just ask the Minifans who have been sliding into Uncle Chaps' DMs. On today's episode, Minihane relishes in providing Barstool Radio with yet another day of wall-to-wall controversy and content. We revisit Dave Portnoy's assessment of the \"Minihane Situation\" and Chaps is a changed man after a few calls from the Minifans. Blind Mike is again on the ropes, some might say destitute. So now he's whoring himself out on Cameo like he's no better than Brian Scalabrine. At the end of the day, Minihane knows who are is friends and who are his enemies.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
