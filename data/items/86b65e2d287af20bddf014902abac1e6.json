A former NBA star opens up about his “trans” child. Parents sue Instagram for the damage it did to their daughter. And in our Daily Cancellation, Old Navy tries to virtue signal to the body positivity crowd and it backfires in a major way. \n\nWatch my new Daily Wire original documentary “What Is A Woman?” at whatisawoman.com. \n\nI am a beloved LGBTQ+ and children’s author.
