  "title": "TAK On Tour: Thirsty Toronto",
  "description": "It’s true that we have thirst-buckets all over the world, but Thirst Aid Kit went truly international for the first time — doing a live show at the Hot Docs Podcast Festival In Toronto! Yes, we took our unique brand of lusting out loud to the Great White North, and were met with all the warmth of our Canadian thirst team. We were ably aided by two fabulously thirsty guests: TK Matunda and Kyrell Grant, who shared with us their knowledge and appreciation for thirst objects as varied as Jemaine Clement, Richard Ayoade, Donald Glover, Ezra Miller, and Stanley ‘The Tooch’ Tucci. There were gasps of delight and impromptu dancing on stage, plus we played live Thirst Sommelier with our lovely audience, live drabble writing and reading in Fanfic Wars (with a twist), and of course, all the dirty auntie chuckles you could ever want. Happy Thirstgiving!\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line! Leave us a message at (765) 8-THIRST (765-884-4778) with your name and what kind of crush advice you're looking for, and maybe we'll answer your question in an upcoming Thirst Sommelier. \n<br>Follow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit.
