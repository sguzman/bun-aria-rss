  "description": "<p>In this episode of the Being Human is Good For Business Podcast, we learn about leaders who rely on their hearts to guide them. </p><p>This group includes Enneagram Types 2, 3 and 4, all of whom tend to have attention seeking motivations, according to Trilogy Effect Partner <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/mary-beth-sawicki\">Mary Beth Sawicki.</a></p><p>She explains, “Known as heart-centered or feeling-centered, these leaders want to be seen the way they want to be seen. In a business context these are the leaders who form strong personal connections and prioritize relationships. Their attention is often focused on human systems over business systems. They see the world through a lens that focuses on the personal.” </p><p>The Trilogy Effect team uses the <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/about-us#the-approach-section\">Enneagram framework</a> to help leaders grow through self-awareness and to surface untapped potential in their teams. The Enneagram comprises nine distinct personality Types in groups of three, based on core motivations, specific strengths and liabilities.
