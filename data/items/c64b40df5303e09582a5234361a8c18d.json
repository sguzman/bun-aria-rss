  "description": "In Episode #206, Drew Harrisberg joins me to debrief The Proof’s first debate and discuss blood tests, sleep, and the interaction between HIIT training and blood glucose.\n\nLast week, I released a special episode on YouTube: a debate on seed oils and heart disease between Tucker Goodrich and Dr Matthew Nagra. You can find it here. Regardless of whether you’ve watched the debate, you’ll gain insight from the reflections we share in this episode.\n\nOur discussion of this debate covers the interpretation of studies, consistency of arguments, and whether either argument was compelling enough to change our minds. Moving on from the debate, you’ll also learn about how sleep interacts with calorie consumption, blood glucose and HIIT training, and blood tests you may want to request. Drew and I also offer insights into our own diets, and I share some results from a recent blood test.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nTraining (3:40)\n\nThe Seed Oil Debate (12:03)\n\nUnderstanding Healthy ApoB Levels (55:25)\n\nThe Biohacking Trap (1:07:08)\n\nCGMs for People without Diabetes (1:17:30)\n\nHIIT for Diabetes (1:28:13)\n\nSleep Deprivation & Weight Gain (1:51:55)\n\nClarifying the Mediterranean diet (2:03:00)\n\nThe “Kale Buster” (2:08:32)\n\nGood News (2:16:11)\n\nBook/ Show Recommendations (2:25:44)\n\nAnswering Your Questions (2:33:36)\n\nOutro (2:36:40)\n\n\nTo connect with Drew, you can reach him via his Instagram or website, Drew’s Daily Dose. You can also listen to his previous appearances on the show on your favourite podcast app.\n\nThe Proof partner, Eimele Essential 8, made today’s episode possible.
