  "description": "<p>“And so we wouldn't be here without Natalie Portman, which isn't a sentence I was expecting to say this evening. But if you ever watched this, Natalie, thank you. Really thank you.” That’s novelist and screenwriter David Mitchell explaining the genesis of his friendships and working relationships with Lana Wachowski and Aleksandar Hemon—which includes screenplay credits on <em>Sense8 </em>and now, <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em>. David and Aleksandar join us on the show to talk about creativity and collaboration, their writing partnership, how language changes from page to screen, envisioning the future, and much more. Featured books: <em>Cloud Atlas</em>, <em>Utopia Avenue</em>, <em>The Bone Clocks</em> and <em>Black Swan Green</em> by David Mitchell and <em>My Parents: An Introduction/This Does Not Belong to You</em>, <em>Love & Obstacles</em> and <em>The Lazarus Man</em> by Aleksandar Hemon. Poured Over is produced and hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang. (P.S. We’re taking a little break for the rest of this year and returning with a new episode on 1/4/22.)</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>",
