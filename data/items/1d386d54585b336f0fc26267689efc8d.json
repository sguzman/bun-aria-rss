  "description": "In Episode #205, I sit down with Dr Andrew Huberman to discuss the nervous system and how lifestyle choices impact your brain. As a neuroscientist and tenured professor at Stanford University, Dr Huberman has made numerous significant contributions to the field of brain development, brain function, and neural plasticity.\n\nIn this episode, we break down the basics before moving on to the impact of specific lifestyle decisions and behaviours. We cover what neuroscience is and why it’s important, covering some significant discoveries in the past century. You’ll also learn how caffeine impacts the nervous system, how to improve learning, and the benefits of non-sleep deep rest (NSDR). We discuss tools you can use to wind down from intense alertness, supplements and brain health, and much more.\n\nSpecifically, we discuss:\n\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nWhat is Neuroscience (4:07)\n\nMilestones in Neuroscience (10:04)\n\nNeurons and Performance Enhancement (18:48)\n\nWhat Caffeine does to the Body (29:08)\n\nThe Ideal Exercise (32:40)\n\nAdrenal Burnout and Pineal Calcification (43:46)\n\nCaffeine Withdrawal (52:38)\n\nUsing Breath to Calm the Nervous System (1:02:10)\n\nYoga Nidra for Deep Rest (1:06:38)\n\nBalance of Rest and Work (1:15:00)\n\nTips for Better Sleep (1:32:28)\n\nBrain Fog & Focus (1:50:32)\n\nMotivation & Top Down Control (1:54:53)\n\nDopamine & Social media (2:07:30)\n\nCold & Heat Exposure (2:14:22)\n\nOutro (2:29:30)\n\n\nYou can learn more about Dr Huberman on his Stanford University page, and visit his website Huberman Lab.
