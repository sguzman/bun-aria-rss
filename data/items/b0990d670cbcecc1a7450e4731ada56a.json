  "description": "<div>Exactly 20 years ago, China acceded to the World Trade Organisation. In the decades since, the globalised world became what we know today, with hundreds of millions of Chinese and people around the world lifted out of poverty through free trade. But the promised liberalisation - both economic and political - doesn't seem to have happened.

So was it a mistake to allow China into the WTO, and has engagement failed?<br>\n<br>\nWith Stewart Paterson, author of <em>China, Trade and Power</em>, and Yu Jie, senior research fellow at Chatham House.</div>\n",
