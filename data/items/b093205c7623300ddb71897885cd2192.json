  "description": "In God’s Gravediggers: Why No Deity Exists (Ockham Publishing, 2016), Raymond D. Bradley takes a logical approach to examining the claim of most religions–Judeo-Christianity in particular–that there is a supernatural God of perfect wisdom and morality. Drawing on moral, logical, and scientific arguments, he not only demonstrates the impossibility of these claims, but also how they are in fact damaging. Revered for his work in logic and his meticulous approach to debate, this book brings together a career’s worth of work on this important subject. Robert Nola, Professor Emeritus of philosophy at the University of Auckland, who is a former student and later colleague of Bradley’s, joins me for the discussion.\n\nRaymond D. Bradley is a Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada, and was formerly the head of the Philosophy Department at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nRobert Nola holds graduate degrees in mathematics and philosophy and a PhD in the philosophy of science. He did his graduate work on changes in theories within the physical sciences, with an emphasis on reduction and replacement. His current work considers scientific accounts of religious belief that have developed in response to the theory of evolution and evolutionary psychology.\n\n\n\nCarrie Lynn Evans is a PhD student at Universite Laval in Quebec City.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
