  "description": "The two books featured in this episode focus on accessing feelings and mental health. First is a book of essays by spoken word artist, Bassey Ikpi. Ikpi tells Scott Simon that her book <em>I'm Telling the Truth but I'm Lying</em> chronicles the hard work it took to make a real life for herself after facing abuse at home. Then we hear from neurologist and physician Anna DeForest on her novel that questions a lot about existence and the inequities of the medical system. <em>A History of Present Illness</em> is DeForest's first novel, and she explains to Ayesha Roscoe why mental health is at the heart of her story.
