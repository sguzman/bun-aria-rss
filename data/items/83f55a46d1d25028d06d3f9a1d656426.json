  "description": "Today, I’m joined by first time guest Ken Fisher. Ken is founder, executive chairman, and co-chief investment officer at  [15:43]. He’s also a prize-winning researcher and bestselling author.  Ken breaks down his process for finding the best investing ideas… and why he believes this bull market will continue higher.  In my educational segment, I share a fantastic example of why boots-on-the-ground research is critical [51:17]. One company is down over 40% in the last few months… But thanks to my field work, I already warned you about it. Now management is making awful excuses regarding its recent earnings miss…  And be sure to listen to my rant—which was triggered by dinner plates, of all things. ---------------------- Editor’s note: Want first access to Frank’s boots-on-the-ground intel?
