  "description": "Are you a little curious about my audio course, “Breaking Barriers: Women Artists of Renaissance Europe”? You’re in luck! Here’s a little update and sneak-peek for those of you who want to know more— and a big thank you to those already registered!\nAbout Breaking Barriers: This is a 21-day course, broken up into daily episodes that are no longer than 10-15 minutes. And naturally, there are no pesky term papers or final exams to worry about-- just cool art history content that you won’t find anywhere else. \nI’ve no doubt that the names Michelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, and Leonardo already mean something major to you-- and not just as mutant reptiles with rad martial arts skills. You know these artists as some of the biggest names in Renaissance art who created some of the most iconic works of art of all time. Looking closer, though, and you’ll find another commonality: they are all male artists. What about the great female makers of the Renaissance -where, and who, are they? So I’ve created this 21-day course--and a course correction, really-- through Avid.FM, where you can explore the lives and works of 20 women artists, from the familiar (like the eye-opening stories Sofonisba Anguissola and Marietta Robusti), to the names you may have heard once or twice (like the highly-successful Levina Teerlinc and Properzia de’ Rossi), to the practically unknown-- who’s Anastasia, you may ask? \nLike the best episodes of ArtCurious, you’ll get the satisfaction of learning about the Renaissance in depth, and with a greater capacity for understanding the limits and barriers to women seeking to work professionally in one of the most colorful eras of western history. You’ll become familiar with artists you’ve probably never heard of, all of whom made an incredible mark on art history. \nAre you in? Sign up right now for “Breaking Barriers: Women Artists of Renaissance Europe” at avid.fm/jennifer for the low price of just $21.99.\n\nSponsors\nWondrium: Enjoy one month free with unlimited access\nUnidragon: Get 10% off a unique wooden puzzle with promo code \"ART10\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
