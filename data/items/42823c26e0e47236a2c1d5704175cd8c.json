  "description": "<p>*No spoilers contained* We’re not going to make it a habit of dissecting the nuggets of personal finance wisdom that we can glean from popular shows or movies, but that just depends on the show. And in the case of Squid Game, there were way too many money lessons calling out to us to ignore. Personal finance is a fundamental aspect of our lives but oftentimes it’s an area that gets shunted to the side when it comes to the entertainment we consume- that certainly wasn’t Squid Game’s approach. Money is front and center, and even though we’re not going to dive into the specifics of the show and give away any details, there are still a ton of different lessons that we can learn. And the best part if you’ve trimmed Netflix from your monthly budget- you don’t have to be a fan of the show in order to appreciate this episode!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed an Alpha Abstraction IPA Vol 18 by Wild Leap!
