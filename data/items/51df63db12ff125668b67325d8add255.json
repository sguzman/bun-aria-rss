  "description": "<p>As Alice gets back from two energising trips away we talk about where in life we find a balance to create the life we want. If we have ambitions and desires, sometimes we need to find that space and energy to face a stretchy goal. But we also need to make sure what you want is for you.... maybe there's a different way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's quite OK to want something, but as life is always shifting it comes down to being honest and finding your personal approach. We ask ourselves where we place limits on our dreams or whether we are led by a feeling of what we have to prove before we can make certain decisions. As creatives we have perhaps an endless capacity for looking out for the new. But in the bigger picture - now what? We have a few questions we ask which may help you, so grab a pen and take some time out with your journal!</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Join Louise's free Find Your Joy course here<a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e1i6qde/metadata/edit\"> https://www.louisefletchercourses.com/wait-list-fyj-2022</a></p>\n<p>Get the Time to Shine Early Bird rate here: <a href=\"https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/shine\"><u><strong>https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/shine</strong></u></a></p>\n<p>Find out about Alice's Connected Artist membership here: <a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/artists/\">https://alicesheridan.com/artists/</a></p>\n<p>Graham Norton novel 'Holding'<a href=\"\"> https://www.amazon.co.uk/Holding-Graham-Norton/dp/1444792008</a></p>\n<p>Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent Nicholas Cage film <a href=\"\">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11291274/</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
