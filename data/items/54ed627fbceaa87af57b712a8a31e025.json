  "title": "Cervidology (DEER) Part 1 with Rhiannons Kirton & Jakopak",
  "description": "<p>What IS a deer? And an elk? And a moose? And a Rhiannon? One thing they all have in common: cervidology. Buckle up for some spirited, laughy chatter with a duo of deer scientists. They dish all about Welsh mythology and their field trips into the remote, gorgeous wilderness. They’ll explain what to do if you find a fawn, if you should feed backyard deer, what deer population numbers are like, hunting, ungulates, being a first-generation scientist and more. This episode is a quick overview and then the real fireworks are next week: in Part 2 we answer some questions with BANANAS facts that will stay burned in your brain until the end of time.
