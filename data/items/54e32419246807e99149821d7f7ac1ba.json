  "description": "He was young, handsome, highly educated in the best English schools, a respected professional, and a first-class amateur athlete. He was also a serial killer, the Victorian equivalent of the modern-day Ted Bundy. His name was Montague Druitt—also known as “Jack the Ripper.”<br /><br />Druitt’s handiwork included the slaughter of at least five women of ill repute in the East End of London—an urban hell where women sold themselves for a stale crust of bread. But mysteries still remain about Druit – including his thinking behind the murders, the man behind the moniker, and the circumstances behind his demise. Exploring these questions are today’s guests Jonathan Hainsworth and researcher Christine Ward-Agius, authors of The Escape of Jack the Ripper: The Truth about the Cover-up and His Flight from Justice.<br /><br />We discuss:<br /><br />How a blood-stained Druitt was arrested yet bluffed his way to freedom by pretending to be a medical student helping the poor<br /><br />How Druitt confessed to his cousin, an Anglican priest<br /><br />How Druitt’s family placed him in a private, expensive asylum in France, only for him to flee when a nurse blew the whistle<br /><br />How Druitt’s identity was concealed by his well-connected friends and family, thus hatching the mystery of Jack the Ripper",
