  "description": "<p>If you spend any time on social media the odds are you’ve seen Wallace Peeples aka Wallo267. His videos and posts have served as inspiration for millions. To say his story is legendary would be an understatement. At 17 he was sentenced to 20 years in jail. He was released 34 months ago after being incarcerated for two decades. Upon his release, he hit the ground running on day one selling t-shirts hand to hand on the streets of North Philly and building his social media following with daily videos of motivation. In less than three years he has managed to leverage his social media brand into partnerships with the NFL Network, Global Citizen, Foot Locker, Puma, and Philly Union. He has also established himself as a lecturer speaking at Penn State University, The University of Maryland, St. John’s University and Yale University. He also was a guest speaker at the prestigious Ted Talk. He now has one of the top podcasts in the world called Million Dollaz Worth of Game with his cousin Gillie the Kid. The two just signed a lucrative multi-year deal with Bar Stool Sports to host their show on Bar Stool’s network. In EYL 57 Wallo reflected on his journey and gave the insight of what kept him going after being down for so long.
