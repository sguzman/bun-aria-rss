    "media:description": "A real lunar eclipse is DARK - the red moon is super faint, and it doesn't illuminate the clouds around it the way the regular sunlit moon does. Using two cameras, a tracker, and a bit of math. I created a video that's hopefully closer to what the human eye sees than what any single auto-exposing camera would be able to manage.\n\nThere's a lot more info about the process in the full video: https://youtu.be/6R-iMmcQ5aI\n\nMusic in this video:\nThe Empty Moons of Jupiter by DivKid\nI Dunno by grapes is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) http://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626",
