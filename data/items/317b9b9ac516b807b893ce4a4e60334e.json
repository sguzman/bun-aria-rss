  "title": "Spittin' Chiclets Episode 42: Final Show Of The Summer",
  "description": "<p>In the summer's final show, Episode 42, the fellas discuss the few NHL stories from the dog days of August (Lindros number retirement, Shane Doan retires), the McGregor/Mayweather fight, how RA became buddies with Jay Baruchel, and then they have a pretty free-wheeling conversation on just about anything that crosses their minds. They close things up with a XXL version of #AllRightHamilton. Hope you have a few laughs. Happy Labor Day Weekend.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
