  "itunes:summary": "Just a few short weeks ago Lebron James led the Los Angeles Lakers to a record-tying seventeenth NBA Championship. The victory capped off what may be the most unique NBA season in league history, not only because of the unprecedented ‘NBA Bubble’ in which the games took place due to COVID-19, but because of the central place the politics of race and justice held throughout the abbreviated season.\n\nThe murder of George Floyd at the hands Minneapolis police officers in May of this year catalyzed a protest movement felt across the world – and perhaps in no other public space was it more evident than on the court of the 2020 NBA Season. Players throughout the league wore jersey’s adorned in slogans deriding police brutality against Black Americans, while “Black Lives Matter” was sprawled along the court of every game. \n\nAnd while “King James” indeed led his team to a historic title win, James’ activism both on and off the court may be what he is best remembered for in the 2020 season, as he led the charge for athletes across leagues to engage in an unimaginable level of anti-racist and anti-oppression activism.\n\nFrom the multi-sport wildcat strike in the wake of the shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, to the ever-militant NFL allowing players to wear anti-oppression slogans as stickers during games, the year in sports of 2020 was simply one where politics and sports became intertwined in a way that has never happened before, and may never happen again.\n\nThis week on the Carleton University Political Science Podcast we’re proud to bring you a spiritual sequel to one of our favourite episodes from last year – The Politics of the Game. Joining me again is Professor Aaron Ettinger, a member of our faculty here at Carleton specializing in international relations and American foreign policy, as well as Alexandra Wishart – a PhD student and critical race scholar here at the Department of Political Science specializing in citizenship regimes in civil wars.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nFollow us on social media:\ninstagram.com/cu_poli.sci\nfacebook.com/carletonu.polisci\ntwitter.com/CarletonPoliSci\ncarleton.ca/polisci\nThanks so much for listening, and an extra thanks to Sappheiros for use of his music for our theme.\n\nLights by Sappheiros @sappheirosmusic\nCreative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: bit.ly/LightsSappheiros\nMusic promoted by Audio Library youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n🎵 Track Info:\nTitle: Lights by Sappheiros\nGenre and Mood: Dance & Electronic + Inspirational\n———\n🎧 Available on:\nSpotify: open.spotify.com/album/4KnoJn...\niTunes: music.apple.com/us/album/ligh...\nDeezer: deezer.com/us/album/88114572\nYouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=xq3_uCEtiJI\nSoundCloud: @sappheirosmusi...\n———\n😊 Contact the Artist:\nzachremick1@gmail.com\nsappheiros.bandcamp.com\ndeezer.com/us/artist/13811001\n@sappheirosmusic\nmusic.apple.com/us/artist/sap...\nyoutube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC...\nopen.spotify.com/artist/5ZVHX...\npaypal.com/paypalme2/sappheiros\ninstagram.com/sappheirosmusic\nfacebook.com/SappheirosMusic\ndiscordapp.com/invite/Pk87yN9\ntwitter.com/SappheirosMusic\npatreon.com/sappheiros",
