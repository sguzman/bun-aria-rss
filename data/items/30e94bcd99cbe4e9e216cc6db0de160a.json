  "description": "Have you ever wanted to get stranded on a beautiful island? Maybe at the end of a vacation when you think you <em>never</em> want to leave. Well, that's what happens to the protagonist in Jodi Picoult's new novel, <em>Wish You Were Here</em>. It's a little less glamorous than what you might be picturing. It's March of 2020 and the coronavirus pandemic traps Diana O'Toole in the Galapagos Islands with very little wifi or cell service. Picoult told NPR's Scott Simon that this extreme isolation forced her main character to reevaluate how she really wanted to live her life.",
