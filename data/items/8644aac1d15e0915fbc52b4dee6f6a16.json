ALIENS: MUTANT PUMPKINS FROM OUTER SPACE). The conversation begins with how Peter came up in the industry, his love of storyboarding and reading, and how his voracious appetite for knowledge lead him to opportunities in Hollywood. Having started out in live-action and transitioning to Animation, we discuss the differences in the two, and why someday soon he could be back on live sets. We also dive into his Oscar-winning efforts in directing Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse and the many challenges they faced to ensure this film was unlike anything ever seen! The conversation is one not to miss for any filmmakers!</p>",
