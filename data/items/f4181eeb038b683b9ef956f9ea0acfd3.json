  "description": "<p>Ari Shaffir's album. I decided to do a slightly in depth analysis of my CD, Revenge for the Holocaust. This is the kind of thing I want to see more of in comedy. Discussing a standup recording the way an actor or director would discuss a movie. How were the bits concieved? What were the struggles associated with their development? Maybe a funny anecdote or two about the process. So here it is. If you've never heard my album before, enjoy. If you have heard it, here are some facts about it you may find interesting.</p>",
