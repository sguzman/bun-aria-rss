  "itunes:summary": "‘In the future, scientists may be able to prolong life, but will it be worth living?’ wrote Nigel Hawkes in The Times.\nApparently, one Oxford professor claims it may soon be possible to prolong many people’s lives until the age of 115. But Hawkes rightly asks, ‘Will it be worth living?’ An increased lifespan is of little value unless it is for a life worth living.\nThe apostle Paul did not see the prolonging of life as a major objective: ‘For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain’ (Philippians 1:21). Indeed, he regarded death as something of even greater worth. Yet for him, Jesus had made his life profoundly worth living.",
