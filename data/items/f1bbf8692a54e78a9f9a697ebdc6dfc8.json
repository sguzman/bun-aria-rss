Dr. Lisa and Reena talk about when it's okay to talk about appearance, when it's best to say nothing, and how to handle it when teens present themselves in ways that are not appropriate. Reena asks for tips on how to talk to our kids about physical appearance in a world that is already so focused on good looks. \n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn @AskLisaPodcast, @LDamour, @ReenaNinan\n\nCheckout Dr. Lisa’s website for more resources: \nhttps://www.drlisadamour.com/\n\nAsk Lisa is produced by: \nWww.GoodTroubleProductions.com\n\nSee acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
