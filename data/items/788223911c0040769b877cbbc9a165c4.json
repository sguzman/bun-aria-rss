  "description": "Bubba departs for surgery to remove a spot on his liver. We wish him well, then take odds on how long it will take for him to return to the show. A federal appeals court upheld a Texas law that bars large social media companies from banning or censoring users based on “viewpoint,” and we celebrate the setback for big tech and their attempts to control the narrative. We watch Post Malone and Tim McGraw take a spill during recent concert performances. David Beaman with NASA gives us an update on the historic, but delayed Artemis launch. A candidate for Utah state senate makes an attempt at a rap campaign video. And lastly, a guy wielding a hatchet and destroying a NYC McDonalds is arrested and then immediately released.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
