  "description": "Civil War letters and the opposite of prejudice. A new online archive of Civil War letters offers a vivid portrait of the everyday lives of enlisted men. These soldiers lacked formal education, so they wrote and spelled \"by ear,\" and the letters show how ordinary people spoke back then. Plus, is there a single word that means \"the opposite of prejudice\"? How about \"unhate\"? Or maybe \"allophilia\"? Finally, there's an old joke that if you buy clothes at a flea market, they throw in the fleas for free. But the story behind the term \"flea market\" is a lot more complicated. Plus: go to grass, go up the spout, take the devil out of it, bobbery, and diabetes of the blow-hole.\n Read full show notes, hear hundreds of free episodes, send your thoughts and questions, and learn more on the A Way with Words website: https://waywordradio.org/.
