  "description": "Van Neistat is an artist, a filmmaker, a writer and now a YouTube Creator. Van's artistic career started when he began working with NYC contemporary artist, Tom Sachs. He and his brother Casey both worked for Sachs and soon after started creating films together that went viral before the term Viral even existed. They then developed a series of short films that they turned into a TV show that ended up getting picked up by HBO. When HBO didn't renew the series, Casey and Van split up, Casey turned to YouTube to start uploading videos and Van wanted to continue down the path of being a traditional filmmaker. Years later, Van has now turned to YouTube to distribute his work and launched a kickstarter which raised over $120,000 and helped bring his series, The Spirited Man, to life.",
