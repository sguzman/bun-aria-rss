  "description": "<p>For our 100th episode, we are delighted to welcome Seth Godin to the podcast. Seth is a bestselling author and all-round amazing guy and his new book \"The Practice\" is subtitled \"shipping creative work.\" With this book, Seth is on a mission to inspire everyone to make a powerful commitment to themselves and their art. In this lively conversation, he explains why the world doesn't need any more paintings (and what it actually needs instead); challenges us all to be artists not painters, explains why he never reads his reviews, and shares his thoughts on balancing art and commerce. We also discuss the importance of knowing your audience, and why &nbsp;picking that audience determines the course of your art career. As you will hear, Seth is a genuine art lover and has lots of interesting stories to tell. Grab a notebook and prepare to be inspired!</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>The Practice by Seth Godin <a href=\"//\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Practice-Seth-Godin/dp/0241470048/</a></p>\n<p>Seth's Blog <a href=\"//\">https://seths.blog/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Connect with us</strong></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
