  "description": "<p>In an age where endless streams of data, options, and information are available, it can feel like every choice -- from what TV show to watch to how to invest our money -- ought to be optimized, and yet making any choice, much less an ideal one, can seem completely overwhelming. How do we figure out what to do? Much of the time, we don't. Instead, we outsource our thinking to technology, experts, and set protocols. This, my guest today says, is where some real problems start.<br /><br />His name is <a href=\"http://www.mansharamani.com/\">Dr. Vikram Mansharamani</a> and he's a Harvard lecturer who studies future trends and risks, as well as the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XH27NTC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B07XH27NTC&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Think for Yourself: Restoring Common Sense in an Age of Experts and Artificial Intelligence</em></a>. Today on the show, Vikram explains how our increasingly complex lives have led us to increasingly rely on algorithms, specialists, and checklists to make decisions, even though experts are best suited to untangling complications rather than complexities. We then discuss the issues that can therefore arise in relying on expert advice, including the siloing of information and the application of misdirected focus. Once we diagnose the problem (and how the problem can, for one thing, muddy medical diagnoses), we turn to the solution, and how we can harness the good that technology and experts can provide, without undermining our ability to still think for ourselves, by doing things like asking experts about their incentives, knowing our own goals, triangulating opinions, and crossing silos. We end our conversation with how the serendipitous discovery of perspectives that can come from flipping through a magazine and browsing a bookstore can be part of restoring self-reliant thinking in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/thinkforyourself\">aom.is/thinkforyourself</a>.</p>\n",
