  "description": "1. Gabrielle shares—as rawly and honestly as we’ve ever heard—about the “emotional chaos” of her years experiencing miscarriage, infertility, and surrogacy.\n2. Gabrielle and Abby discuss the label and perception of “stepmom”—Gabrielle shares what she avoids at all costs in that role, and the most vital part of the role for her: consistency.\n3. How Gabrielle coached her NBA husband Dwyane before Zaya shared with him that she is gay, and how his reaction encouraged Zaya to tell the people on her “never-ever” list.\n4. Gabrielle’s insistence that home is a sanctuary where all are embraced with love, understanding, and joy—and how, if you can’t get behind all of her family members, you’re not welcome.\n\nAbout Gabrielle:\nGabrielle Union is an actress, executive producer, activist, best-selling author, and Time100 cover honoree. Union will next be seen in Disney’s remake of CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN developed by Kenya Barris for Disney+. She was last seen in “L.A.’s Finest,” the highly anticipated TV spinoff of the BAD BOYS movie franchise. She reprised her starring role as Syd Burnett opposite Jessica Alba in the series and served as an executive producer through her production shingle “I’ll Have Another.” Union formed “I’ll Have Another” in 2018 with the goal of telling stories that center marginalized communities with their specific point of views in an authentic manner. \n \nIn May of 2021, Gabrielle released – in partnership with her husband Dwyane Wade – her second children’s book, “Shady Baby,” which became a New York Times best seller the first week of release. Her first book, We’re Going To Need More Wine: Stories That Are Funny, Complicated and True, was released in 2017 and instantly became a New York Times best seller. The highly anticipated follow up “You Got Anything Stronger?” was released in September of this year and was a New York Times best seller as well. \n \nUnion has always had an eye for forward-thinking businesses centered around inclusion, accessibility, and affordability. In August of 2020, she relaunched her haircare brand “Flawless by Gabrielle Union” for women with textured hair. Prior to relaunching Flawless, Union co-founded Bitsy's with the goal of making healthy, allergen- friendly, school-safe snacks that are accessible and affordable for all families regardless of their socioeconomic or geographical status. Union serves as a leader and advocate for inclusion in the entertainment industry. She is also a champion of breast health and combating sexual violence.\n\nInstagram: @gabunion\nTwitter: @itsgabrielleu\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
