  "description": "<div>\n<strong>Wrinkles The Clown is a REAL-LIFE bogeyman. He’s here to haunt your nightmares. </strong><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>It started with a silent black and white surveillance video uploaded to YouTube which depicted a child sleeping peacefully.

Afterward, similar videos started appearing online—a terrifying looking clown pushing a cart in a parking lot, waving alongside a busy highway, holding balloons in front of a suburban home, and, most shocking of all, terrorizing a family who had gathered for a game night.
