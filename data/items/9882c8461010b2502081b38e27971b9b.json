Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away last Friday and President Trump reacts (19:00). Kirk shoots down Mattâ€™s terrible Top Gun take (35:00). Joe Rogan apologizes for blaming the Oregon fires on Antifa (47:00). Plus a new parody song and audience calls.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
