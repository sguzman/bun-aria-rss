  "description": "The Clemson-Alabama rematch was so entertaining and interesting that this might be our least joke-filled episode...ever? We got too caught up admiring Deshaun Watson, and Clemson's receivers, and how their defense played spectacularly for so long that the offensive line could pick itself off the mat when they needed to. We even have lots of positive things to say about Alabama! It's all very confusing and probably a sign that we need to sleep way more.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
