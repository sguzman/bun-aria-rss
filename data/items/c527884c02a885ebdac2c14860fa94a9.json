  "description": "<p>On today's show Pat and the boys recap last night's great Monday Night Football game between the Ravens and Browns and why both teams should feel pretty good about last night's performance. Joining Pat and AJ Hawk as he does every Tuesday, is Green Bay Packers Quarterback, Aaron Rodgers to chat about the season thus far, his thoughts on the offense as a whole, and a myriad of subjects in one of the best installments yet (14:39-56:42). Also joining the show is a man who has burst on the scene this year, Green Bay Packers TE, Big Bob Tonyan. Pat and Bob chat about his big season, what it's like playing with Aaron Rodgers, how meditation has helped with his game and what he wants to do in the league, Marcedes Lewis' influence on him, and if Matt LaFleur has asked him to calm down about so he doesn't accidentally knock him out (58:55-1:13:58). Later, Yahoo Sports NFL Insider and friend of the program, Charles Robinson joins the show to chat about where he's been, what he thinks is going to happen with the salary cap going into next year, how many coaching openings he thinks there will be, and why Jim Harbaugh is now a favorite to coach the Lions (1:14:00-1:35:55).
