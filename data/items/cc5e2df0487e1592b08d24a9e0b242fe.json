  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, former First Lady Michelle Obama addressed the delegates at last night's Democrat National Convention with a demagogic speech. Mrs. Obama harped on \"empathy\" as BLM rioters beat a man to a bloody pulp in the street. Then, Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to transform the government by taking over the entire federal leviathan. The left plans to stack the courts, and change America by fiat. Later, Governor Andrew Cuomo spoke at the DNC convention to promote himself and to continue the cover-up of his incompetent executive actions that may have killed 11 million New Yorkers living in Nursing homes. Afterward, a nationwide manhunt is underway for the BLM rioter that savagely attacked a man in Portland. This is what the leftwing Democrats refer to when they say they seek unity? Finally, Professor Paul Kengor calls in to explain how cultural Marxism is taking over large American cities. America now has Mayor that cite Marx and use Leninist tactics. Kengor also provides historical context through his new book \"The Devil and Karl Marx Communism's Long March of Death, Deception, and Infiltration.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
