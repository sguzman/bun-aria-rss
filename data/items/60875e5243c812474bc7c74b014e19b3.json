The bodies of Carole Spinks, Darlenia Johnson, Brenda Crockett, Nenomoshia Yates, Brenda Woodard and Diane Williams were all found alongside busy roads, with most showing evidence of strangulation and sexual assault. The unidentified perpetrator, thought to be Washingtonâ€™s first serial killer, became known as The Freeway Phantom.<br>\n<br>\n---<em><br>\n<br>\n</em>Episode researched and narrated by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/casefilehost\">Anonymous Host</a>\n</div>\n<div>Episode written by Elsha McGill<br>\n<br>\nMap:<br>\n<a href=\"https://casefilepodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Case-121-The-Freeway-Phantom-map.pdf\">https://casefilepodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Case-121-The-Freeway-Phantom-map.pdf</a>\n</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"https://casefilepodcast.com/case-121-the-freeway-phantom\">casefilepodcast.com/case-121-the-freeway-phantom</a>\n</div>\n",
