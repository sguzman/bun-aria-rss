  "description": "On today’s show, Pat and the boys break down the cryptic Instagram post that Tom Brady put up yesterday thanking the fans in New England for all of their support over the last decade. The guys decide whether or not this means that the dynasty is over and that Brady is out of New England and dive into a couple of Brady’s options moving forward that are being reported including potentially landing in powder blue to become the face of the Chargers in LA, pairing with Jon Gruden in Las Vegas for the Raiders with Derek Carr potentially on his way out, or perhaps coming to Indianapolis for a young team with a great line and formidable defense. Also joining the show is 5x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, Carolina Panthers Hall of Honor member, future Hall of Famer and current NFL Network analyst, Steve Smith Sr. He explains why he decided to leave social media, gives his thoughts on Matt Rhule being hired by the Panthers and whether or not he thinks Cam Newton will be apart of his plans moving forward, his thoughts on playing for John Harbaugh in Baltimore and if his hiring up there opened the door for a guy like Joe Judge in New York, as they are both experienced with coaching special teams units. Steve also dives into this weekend’s divisional round matchups in the NFL and explains what he thinks the keys will be and some other interesting nuggets to look into (1:48-19:01). To close out the show, the guys welcome standup comedian, stuntman, and Jackass icon, Steve-O into the studio. They discuss his career and all the different moments that have led him to where he’s at now, including enrolling in clown college, some of the craziest stunts he’s done throughout his career, what his standup shows are like, and he gives some exclusive, never before heard news about the new Jackass movie. Steve-O also opens up about his sobriety, and reflects on what his undoubtedly be a crazy life in an incredibly entertaining and honest conversation (52:57-1:13:00). Today’s episode is good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
