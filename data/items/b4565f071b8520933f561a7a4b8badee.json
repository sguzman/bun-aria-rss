  "description": "<p>Asking for a discount isn't something that most people enjoy doing, but we'd be willing to wager that you don't ask for discounts enough. It's your money after all- hang onto it! In this episode we discuss haggling, rejection, and some reasons why asking for a discount should be a healthy part of your financial life. We also go through some practical steps we take when asking for a discount and share a few stories of when we've gotten that sweet discount or when we've had to say 'thanks for considering!' and walk.</p><p>It's an overused maxim, but that doesn't make it any less true: If you never ask for a discount, the answer will always be no.</p><p>At the beginning of this episode we cracked open a couple beers that Joel brought back from Paris- we are so incredibly cultured y'all! Specifically we were a fan of the Blanc by Gallia Paris, which you can learn about on their website but good luck since it's in French!
