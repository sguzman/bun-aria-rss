  "description": "<p>How does a founding member of one of the biggest bands of the last few decades create such incredible music, enjoyed by hundreds of millions of people, while living a life that is privately falling apart? And what would make him do the work to start to put all the pieces back together, to produce not just iconic music, but also a grounded, fulfilling life?&nbsp;</p><br><p>That’s where we’re going in today’s Best Of conversation with the founding member, frontman and guitarist for iconic band, the Goo Goo Dolls, John Rzeznik. Born and raised in Buffalo, NY, John is a legend in the world of music, with 19 top-ten singles, including mega-hits like Iris (which spent 12 months on the Billboard charts), Name, Black Balloon and countless others. And, like so many who turned to music at a young age as both a way to cope with discord and a form of expression, he’s lived a life of extraordinary artistry and contribution, and along with that, a certain amount of darkness and struggle that for many years found him turning to alcohol as a way to get through each day. Until it all fell apart, and he had to make a decision. One he keeps making every day.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Now, sober, a devoted dad and husband, he's telling a new story with his life and music, and taking the giant, global community of Goo Goo Doll fans along for the journey. And, as you’ll hear, he’s headed into the studio to create something that is truly representative not just of this moment in time, but also of how his lens on life, music, and creativity have evolved.</p><br><p>You can find John at: <a href=\"https://www.googoodolls.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/johnrzeznikggd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode </strong>you’ll also love the conversations we had with <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/good-life-project/id647826736?i=1000556939194\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joan Osborne</a> about her incredible life in music and activism.</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My New Book </strong><a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a> | <strong>My New Podcast </strong><a href=\"https://pod.link/1610198312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SPARKED</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sponsors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Our Sponsor Page</a> For a Complete List of Vanity URLs & Discount Codes.</li><li><strong>Wealthfront:</strong> Diversify your investing with an automated portfolio that can help maximize your returns and minimize your taxes.
