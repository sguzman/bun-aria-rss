  "description": "9 months into his administration, Donald Trump has entered a political crisis unlike any other.  With the indictments of his campaign chairman and his deputy and the guilty plea of one of his campaign foreign policy advisors, Trump has not just sustained deep political wounds, he has also begun to see precisely how special counsel Robert Mueller intends to make his case against the president's team.  Russia, money, lies and yes, collusion, all seem to be part of the equation.
