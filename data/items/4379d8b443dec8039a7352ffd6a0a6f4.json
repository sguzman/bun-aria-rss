  "description": "<p>https://www.larchitect.org/</p> <p>A Low-Brow, Crass Approach to Plant Ecology & Evolution as muttered by a Misanthropic Chicago Italian. Amidst mild profanity and general irreverence, we examine plant life (the base of Earth's food chain) and the nature of the rocks and soil they grow on, as well as the evolutionary adaptations that enable them to do what they do. The goal of \"Crime Pays But Botany Doesn't\" is to both educate people as well as light the fire of curiosity on their ass, hopefully inspiring them to go outside and observe and question the living world around them. Thanks for reading. Have a great day and go fuck yourself.</p>",
