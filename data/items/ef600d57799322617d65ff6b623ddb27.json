    "media:description": "Title: Dialectica Constructions and Lenses\nSpeaker: Jonathan Weinberger\n\nAbstract: In the 1940s, Gödel devised the Dialectica interpretation, a so-called proof interpretation used for relative consistency proofs in constructive logic.\n\nIn her doctoral dissertation (late 1980s to early 1990s), de Paiva introduced the notion of so-called Dialectica categories supporting various versions of the Dialectica construction. This has since been generalized to fibrations in later work by Hyland and Hofstra, leading e.g. to Dialectica models of type theory (cf. the works by von Glehn and Moss).\n\nIn the talk, I will discuss work in progress concerning the connections of the (categorical or fibrational) Dialectica construction with so-called lenses.\n\nThe concept of a lens is known from database theory and it formalizes a kind of transition system that is able to receive inputs and internally convert them to a different form. Lenses can be seen as an instance of the general concept of a so-called optic. On the other hand, using (fibered) categorical language, lenses can also be seen as an instance of de Paiva's Dialectica construction.\n\nTopos Institute Berkeley Seminar\nSeptember 12, 2022",
