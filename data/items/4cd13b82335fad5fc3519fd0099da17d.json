  "description": "<p>21-year-old Megan Foglesong disappeared from Alden, Kansas, around the end of November 2015. When we first covered Megan’s story in 2016, nearly everyone pointed to Megan’s on-again, off-again boyfriend, David Madden. Megan attempted to leave him in the past and told others around Thanksgiving of 2015 that she was leaving him again. Several days later, Megan sent a message to a friend indicating that she was back at David’s, then she went silent. Around this time, David texted the local undersheriff to inform him that Megan had stolen from him and ran off. In hindsight, that story about Megan stealing seems rather convenient, possibly a way to explain her absence. But at that time, no one thought much of it. They figured Megan would pop up somewhere soon. Maybe she left David and was hiding? Time passed, and Megan’s loved ones became more concerned. David didn’t seem interested in finding Megan. Despite rumors and suspicions swirling around town about David’s involvement, Megan’s case went cold. As the years went by, David went on to commit a series of other crimes that left the community convinced that he was responsible for Megan’s disappearance. </p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Megan Foglesong, please contact KBI at 316-337-6100 or the Rice County Sheriff’s Office at (620) 257-7876.
