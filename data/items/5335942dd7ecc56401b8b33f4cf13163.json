  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 10/10/22",
  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, the media in America are more than corrupt and pathetic, they take the attention of the nation off things that matter. The best example is a young Youtuber who was beaten and killed in Iran for not wearing a hijab. Then her mother hung herself after seeing her daughter’s body. If you watch the mainstream media, they pay no attention to this. This is happening while Putin is killing and torturing Ukrainians and threatening America with nukes. How come the Squad doesn’t talk about the Palestinian tortured and killed after she was outed as gay? Instead, the media and Democrats tell us Herschel Walker is a threat to country. Then, Kanye West is under fire for tweets remarking on Jews. Evangelical Christians are the most respectful people you'll ever meet but making comments about going \"Defcon 3\" on Jews is unacceptable. This rhetoric was spouted by the eugenicists and then embraced by the Third Reich. Later, a judge agreed to adopt America First Legal’s election integrity measures as a result of video evidence showing malfeasance with ballot drop boxes. This is a win for election integrity. Meanwhile, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and his stooges like Sen. Lisa Murkowski must be defeated because all he does is destroy the conservative candidates that get in his way such as his latest attack on Alaska's Kelly Tshibaka. Afterward, Sen. Ron Johnson joins the show to explain that individuals like Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes who praised Rev. Jeremiah Wright who hates America's founding and principles and will vote that way if elected to the US Senate. Johnson reiterated fundamentally transforming America will fundamentally destroy it. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
