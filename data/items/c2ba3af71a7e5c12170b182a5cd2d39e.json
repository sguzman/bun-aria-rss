  "description": "*EAR MUFFS* For our more sensitive listeners, please be warned. Today  we discuss issues with porn, a theology of sexuality, and sexual reconciliation.  You might find it surprising that in this episode we are saying much much more than \"Stop looking at porn.\" Mike openly and tenderly shares his walk with this struggle with this issue. We sincerely hope that what is offered in this episode can help.  Like second hand smoke, everyone is effected by this issue.  Moreover, many of us in church are wrestling with a fallout of programming to simply stop the behavior, without addressing the deeper issue, what does God really think of sex?\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nMusic provided by Izzi Ray - http://www.soundcloud.com/izziray\nMusic available on iTunes - https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/izzi-ray/id386256769\n\nInvest in and support the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Twitter www.twitter.com/thevoxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nFollow Andy on Twitter www.twitter.com/Andy_lara\n\nMike Erre participates as VOX Team Leader at VOX Community, a church expression of the VOX Podcast.
