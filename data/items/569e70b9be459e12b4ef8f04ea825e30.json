  "description": "A widely followed analyst and trader says that the crypto market could copy its 2018 playbook.\n\n“2022 could very well look like 2018 given the amount of time we could chop around for. I do think that the market is more mature these days than before, though. Overall market structure for trading is better + dexes [decentralized exchanges] + NFTs [non-fungible tokens] + gaming + new usable chains.”\n\nSomething like this would make sense for me; more people getting bullish on the bearish retest of $35,000 – $40,000 and then price nuking lower.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
