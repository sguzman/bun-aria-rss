    "media:description": "The ATS Heat Pipe Bender is a precision engineering tool designed to give engineers and technicians accurate and thermally reliable heat pipe bends.\nThe tool gives the user the ability to apply the right amount of leverage and torque in order to get the right bend. The tool also stops a user from over bending and thus reducing the heat pipes thermal performance.\n\nDownload the datasheet here - https://www.qats.com/DataSheet/Bender-Heat-Pipes\n\nhttps://www.qats.com&#13;\nAdvanced Thermal Solutions, Inc.&#13;\nA leading-edge engineering and manufacturing company focused on the thermal management of electronics.&#13;\n&#13;\nService, Products and Training&#13;\n• Cooling Solutions – From Chip to System&#13;\n• Mechanical Packaging and Design&#13;\n• Design Services&#13;\n• Air and Liquid Cooling Solutions&#13;\n• Rapid Prototyping&#13;\n• Custom Heat Sink Design&#13;\n• Research Grade Thermal Instruments&#13;\n• Engineering Training&#13;\n• State-of-the-art Experimental Laboratories&#13;\n• Qpedia Thermal eMagazine",
