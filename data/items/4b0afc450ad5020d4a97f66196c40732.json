  "description": "<p>Over the history of this show, we’ve been incredibly blessed to not only have hundreds of guests in the physical and now virtual studio for conversation but also live performances from a wide variety of acclaimed artists, many of whom are icons in their chosen form of creation and expression. The performances have ranged from unaccompanied to fully sound-designed spoken word, to a capella or instrument-accompanied live music. Many of these performances represented moments of emotion and awakening, connection. It’s been a kind of magical ingredient for me, as a lover of spoken word and music, to be able to share these with you over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>So we decided to do something a little different as a sort of offering to you as we bring this year to a close. We culled through years of tape and pulled together today’s live performance super-cut for you, sharing a lineup of 11 artists, spread out over nearly 7 years of performances in the studio. Some, short and sweet, others longer-form and profound. All will make you feel, smile and, even just for a moment, transcend time and space and just be present in feelings. So excited to share these performances with you.</p><p>You can find the full episodes of each guest included in this montage:</p><p><strong>Andrea Gibson: </strong>https://tinyurl.com/y9nds2yc</p><p><strong>Amanda Palmer: </strong>https://tinyurl.com/ybl7wfgz</p><p><strong>Sekou Andrews: </strong>https://tinyurl.com/yco27duw</p><p><strong>Humble the Poet: </strong>https://tinyurl.com/y89pzjoh</p><p><strong>Kaki King: </strong>https://tinyurl.com/ycsldtc5</p><p><strong>Cleo Wade: </strong>https://tinyurl.com/yc8we3lu</p><p><strong>Mark Nepo: </strong>https://tinyurl.com/ybqu2crc</p><p><strong>Jimmie Vaughan: </strong>https://tinyurl.com/ya4svdu4</p><p><strong>Morgan Harper Nichols: </strong>https://tinyurl.com/y9m35fp9</p><p><strong>Ali Handal: </strong>https://tinyurl.com/yall7ltb</p><p><strong>IN-Q: </strong>https://tinyurl.com/ybpwqy6j</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>You Need a Budget: </strong><a href=\"http://youneedabudget.com/GOODLIFE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">youneedabudget.com/GOODLIFE</a> - free for 34-days (no credit card required)</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
