  "description": "<p>On The Literary Life podcast today, our hosts are bringing you another “Literary Life Of” interview episode. This week’s guest is Kay Pelham, a lifelong reader, veteran homeschooling mother, and accomplished pianist. After sharing their commonplace quotes, Angelina, Cindy and Kay dig into their conversation about the journey of Kay’s reading life. She shares a little about her family of story-tellers and readers, her personal reading versus school studies, and how her reading life changed as a young adult. Kay also talks about how she came to homeschool using Charlotte Mason’s philosophy. The discussion turns to Kay’s self-education journey as an older adult and she gives encouragement for anyone coming to this later in life. You can read Kay’s own thoughts on books and more at <a href=\"http://kaypelham.com\">KayPelham.com</a>.</p> <p>Join us this spring for our next Literary Life Conference “The Battle Over Children’s Literature” featuring special guest speaker Vigen Guroian. The live online conference will take place April 7-9, 2022, and you can go to <a href= \"https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/\">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> for more information.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>When children come to school, they can read and speak.

S. Lewis</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Mythology is the embryo of literature and the arts, not of science, and no form of art has anything to do with making direct statements about nature, mistaken or correct. Similarly, as science does not grow out of mythology, so it can never replace mythology.
