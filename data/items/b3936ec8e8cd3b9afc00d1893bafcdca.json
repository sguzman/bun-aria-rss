  "description": "<p>Round 1: New Zealand Goofin. Our Kiwi pals announce that they haven’t had any new cases \nof Covid-19 in 44 days. They acted like they’ve been there before and handed the ball off to the referee. \n\nRound 2: President Trump is taking shots at Colin Powell and his legacy over remarks that the general and former Secretary of State gave on CNN this weekend. We’ll get into that just a little bit. \n\nRound 3: The Marine Corps has banned all confederacy related images and flags from their bases. We asked the baby girls what should be banned next. \n\nRound 4: An attorney joins the show to talk about his job. Not litigation. He joins to talk about the 1632 hours he spent as an air forward observer where he earned 4 Distinguished Flying Crosses, one Bronze Star, a Purple Heart, and an Air Medal with combat V. Jim Dunn joins the show to talk about his combat experiences. \n\nRound 5: You can wear only one uniform, EXCEPT PT GEAR, for the rest of your life, which do you choose???</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
