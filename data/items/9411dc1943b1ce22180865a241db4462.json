  "description": "Teeka Tiwari, editor of the  newsletter for Palm Beach Research, talks about some of the biggest technology trends that will impact the world over the next 10 years.  Teeka was an early investor in Apple (before the first iPhone was created) and also in 3-D printing companies.  He will show you how to spot huge trends before they are mentioned in mainstream media. \nFrank then breaks down his recent call to buy General Electric.  The company made a major announcement to sell off its finance division and return $90 billion to investors over the next four years.  The stock responded with its biggest percentage gain in six years.  \n \nFrank's subscribers are already up more than 10% on GE - just a few days after he recommended it in his newsletter. He will tell you why GE has much more upside ahead and how this company is a much better long-term stock for retirees - instead of McDonald's and Proctor & Gamble.",
