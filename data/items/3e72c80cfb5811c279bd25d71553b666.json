  "description": "Well, you asked. And here she is. Domenica Calarco, the breakout star from the latest season of Married At First Sight Australia, is one of my most requested guests. On screen, we fell in love with her feisty Italian character, her brutal honesty and her friendship with fellow contestant Ella May Ding. Off screen, Domenica is an absolute treasure: hilarious, talkative and with plenty to say about the whole MAFS experience. Yes, we talk about Olivia. Yes, we talk about Jack. Yes, we talk about Mitch. But if you've never watched MAFS and you don't know what I'm on about, fear not - this is also a beautiful conversation about the shame she felt as a young divorcee and how her quest for love led her into a life-changing decision that ultimately brought her happiness (but not in the way you'd expect). Domenica talks openly about her struggles with anxiety, panic attacks, her feelings of failure and her experiences with internet trolling and becoming a public figure overnight. Listen to be moved and entertained (and to hear a surprise guest).<br />--<br /><br />If you would like to attend one of the first ever LIVE How To Fail recordings on 5th-8th October, you can book tickets here: <a href=\"https://www.fane.co.uk/how-to-fail\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.fane.co.uk/how-to-fail</a><br /><br />--<br /><br />How To Fail With Elizabeth Day is hosted and produced by Elizabeth Day.
