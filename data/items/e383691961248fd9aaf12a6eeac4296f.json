  "description": "We've reached the point in 'All 32' where we get to talk about the world champion Kansas City Chiefs. To do that, Matt Derrick of Chiefs Digest joins Will Brinson to discuss the team's somewhat surprising first-round selection of Clyde Edwards-Helaire (2:15) and other help for Patrick Mahomes (not that he necessarily needs it). Matt breaks down how the Super Bowl MVP has perfected Andy Reid's offense and what more to expect from KC's star QB in 2020 (8:00). More analysis follows on wideouts Tyreek Hill and Mecole Hardman (9:30), if the defense can replicate their last-season success (13:45), the contracts of Chris Jones (16:15) and Mahomes (18:30) AND how many Super Bowls the organization can win in the next 5 years.\nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @mattderrick\nSubscribe to our Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7ZUfHFsuQcW7BkTHnXJtqw\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
