  "description": "<p>Different application scenarios will cause IMU to exhibit different error\ncharacteristics which will cause trouble to robot application. However, most\ndata processing methods need to be designed for specific scenario. To solve\nthis problem, we propose a few-shot domain adaptation method. In this work, a\ndomain adaptation framework is considered for denoising the IMU, a\nreconstitution loss is designed to improve domain adaptability. In addition, in\norder to further improve the adaptability in the case of limited data, a\nfew-shot training strategy is adopted. In the experiment, we quantify our\nmethod on two datasets (EuRoC and TUM-VI) and two real robots (car and\nquadruped robot) with three different precision IMUs. According to the\nexperimental results, the adaptability of our framework is verified by t-SNE.\nIn orientation results, our proposed method shows the great denoising\nperformance.\n</p>",
