  "description": "Bitcoin Maximalist Max Keiser says that Bitcoin (BTC) will reach $220,000 at some point this year.\n\nIn a new interview with Daniela Cambone of Stansberry Research, Keiser explains why his six-digit forecast for the flagship cryptocurrency did not happen in 2021.\n\n“As far as 2021 goes, I said we’re going to get to $220,000 per coin, which is a typical four-year cycle. What we had in 2021 was that massive China collapse in mining, in hash power. The mining and the hash power collapsed 50%. We have since recovered that now, and we’re about to hit new all-time high in hash rate. That’s why I’m pushing my $220,000 target from 2021 to 2022.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
