  "description": "<p><a href=\"http://craphound.com/\">Cory Doctorow</a> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/doctorow\">@doctorow</a>) is a essayist, novelist, blogger, and co-editor of BoingBoing, and he is exhausting. The man is a production machine, churning out excellent book after excellent book as if writing were a job instead of something to agonize and procrastinate over. As of this writing, his latest books are <a href=\"http://isbn.nu/9780765333698\">Homeland</a> and <a href=\"http://isbn.nu/work/pirate_cinema\">Pirate Cinema</a>, and, with Charlie Stross, he wrote <a href=\"http://isbn.nu/9780765329103\">Rapture of the Nerds</a>. Cory has also long been an advocate for the personal ownership of culture, demanding corporations and governments keep their hands off what we make and their noses out of our individual use and modification of media and hardware. To that end, he has fought endless wars against restrictive legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsored by</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pixelmator.com/\">Pixelmator</a>: Beautifully designed, powerful image editing for Mac OS X</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/newdisruptors\">Squarespace</a>: Everything you need to build exceptional websites!</p>\n\n\n",
