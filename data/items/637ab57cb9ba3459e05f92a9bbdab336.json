  "description": "Friday the 18th August 2000. Two weeks after Mark Van Krevel was sentenced, police were called to a home in Albion Park. It was a home that they had visited before. The scene that greeted them there, inside the master bedroom, seemed reminiscent of the horror inflicted by Mark Van Krevel. In the room a man was discovered kneeling beside the bed. He was slumped over with his head and chest resting on the mattress with arms hanging alongside his torso. He was covered in blood and naked. His back and head had received extensive wounds. Twenty five chop wounds in total to the neck and head had left his neck partially severed. There were also multiple stab wounds and lacerations inflicted to the torso blood covered the bedding and curtains. At the foot of the bed close to the victim’s body lying side by side were a hatchet a large kitchen knife and a fire poker. All of which were covered in blood. &#13;\nSponsor: Dollar Shave Club&#13;\nDollarshaveclub.com/FELON",
