  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden aims to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions. However, plants, via photosynthesis, have eliminated the threat that was once claimed to have existed to the Amazon. Now that Democrats are in power there are no more images of polar ice caps melting because they are now on phase two of their de-growth agenda - to unleash a war on free-market capitalism. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, John Kerry, and Biden will do to the economy what they've done with gas prices. This was never about climate change, it was always about Marxism. Then, as a result of the industrial revolution, more people are alive today because of the wondrous machines, highways, and technology created by America. The climate change movement has joined with other Marxist movements like environmental racism, LATCRIT, and Critical Race Theory, all of which are toxic to the human spirit and expect mankind to bow to them. Later, Biden and the Democrats are trying to make aspects of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus package permanent. The democrats want the child tax credit to become permanent and be delivered by direct deposit monthly. This will only encourage dependence on the welfare state. Afterward, Julie Kelly from American Greatness calls in to discuss how January 6th detainees are being held in prison without showers, and other basic needs. Kelly added that the DC Circuit kicked back a case for pre-trial detention and is slowly letting the non-violent offenders out of solitary confinement after months of incarceration. Finally, Rep. Mo Brooks joins the program to discuss his run for the US Senate.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
