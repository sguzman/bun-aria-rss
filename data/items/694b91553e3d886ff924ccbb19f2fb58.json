  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, the Democrats and their unions have destroyed the public school system in many communities. The great civil rights issue of our time is whether children from poor areas, many of them ethnic minorities, should receive the best quality education available. When it comes to our daily lives we want as much competition as possible to ensure we get the best value. Sadly, when it comes to educating children in failing public school districts, the militant teachers' unions prevent kids from getting the best education available in order to maintain the power and profit of their public school positions. Joe Biden is an anti-school choice and fervently oppose charter operated public schools. Then, the china virus vaccine spearheaded by President Trump's Operation Warp Speed may be available sooner than expected. AstraZeneca and nine other pharmaceutical companies have penned a letter ensuring that the vaccine will be safe. Later, AG Bill Barr says that America is at a fork in the road between liberty and socialism. Barr added that mob violence is a disconcerting development effectively heading toward sedition. Barr has instructed federal law enforcement to charge individuals attempting a violent insurrection with sedition. Afterward, don’t Hispanic lives matter? Hispanics are the largest voting minority in the US and Biden has ignored them. Finally, Congressional candidate Dan Rodimer calls in to discuss his race.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
