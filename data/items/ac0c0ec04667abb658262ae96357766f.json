He’s a good friend of mine from us working together when I was at Century Media Records. He also manages a ton of bands including Black Veil Brides and hosts his own podcast called MANAGEMETAL that I urge you to check out. In any event, we discuss surreal “rock” moments, playing as a hired fun and determination. He’s got a great attitude and I loved having this discussion. Enjoy!
