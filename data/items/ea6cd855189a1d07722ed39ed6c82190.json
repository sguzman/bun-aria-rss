With Slate Plus you can binge the whole season of Decoder Ring right now, plus ad free podcasts, bonus episodes, and much more.\nOn this episode, we explore the misunderstood history of Muzak, formerly the world’s foremost producers of elevator music. Out of the technological innovations of World War I, Muzak emerged as one of the most significant musical institutions of the 20th century, only to become a punching bag as the 1960’s began to turn public perceptions of popular music on its head.

This is the story of how different ideas about pop music butted heads throughout the 20th century, including inside Muzak’s offices. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
