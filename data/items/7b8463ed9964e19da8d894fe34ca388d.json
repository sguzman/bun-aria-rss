  "description": "Sean McElwee has one of those jobs you certainly know about, but probably can't pinpoint what it is he does all day. Sean runs a think tank called Data for Progress that he started with Colin McAuliffe. As for what they do as an organization, the name says it all, they collect data to help push liberal political policies and ideas forward. But the way they do it may not be what you expect. Data for Progress is a part of new wave of smaller think tanks running on more of a startup model. Which means a lot of Sean's job is about figuring out ways to affect political change without the resources of much bigger institutions in their field.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
