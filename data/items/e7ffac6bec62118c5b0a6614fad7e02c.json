  "description": "<p>Tyson is a former world heavy weight champion of the world and was once the baddest man on the planet. Still to this day holds the greatest heavyweight knockout highlights of all time in boxing. His conversation with Joe was nothing less than amazing. To hear what it’s like to have the level of fame and fortune he did when he was only 19 years old and what that does to a person. He’s now in a really good place and quite a humble man. This was a fantastic conversation.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
