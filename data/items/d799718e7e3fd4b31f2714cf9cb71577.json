  "description": "<p>Guinness World Records has named Pluckley Village as the most haunted village in England. Pluckley dates back to the 11th century and was owned by the Archbishop of Canterbury. It is located on a hill in Kent and through the decades, it had expanded down the hill until the Black Death decimated the population in the 14th century and sent survivors back up the hill. One of the more well known areas is the Dering Wood named for one of the more well known families to live in the area. Dering Wood is also known as Screaming Wood. There are reports of as many as sixteen ghosts in this village. Listener and UK resident Alana Ashby joins us as we share the history and hauntings of Pluckley Village. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Timothy Rich and features Life-like Eyes in Spring Grove Cemetery Statue and This Day in History is by Richard Schaffer and features the French joining the Irish Rebellion.
