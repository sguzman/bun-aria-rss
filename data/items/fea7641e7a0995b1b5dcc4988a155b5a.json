  "description": "The past two weeks have revealed that the Israel-Palestine conflict remains far from a solution. Indeed, of the two most likely solutions discussed--a two-state \"solution\" or a one-state \"solution\"--both seem impossible. But the problem is a real one with profound human consequences in Israel and Palestine and great resonance in the US (often for the wrong reasons). We discuss the situation and our options with one of the most thoughtful observers and voices on these issues in the U.S., Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J-Street. Don't miss this thoughtful conversation on a complex and confounding problem.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
