  "description": "<p>We present a new method for scaling automatic configuration of computer\nnetworks. The key idea is to relax the computationally hard search problem of\nfinding a configuration that satisfies a given specification into an\napproximate objective amenable to learning-based techniques. Based on this\nidea, we train a neural algorithmic model which learns to generate\nconfigurations likely to (fully or partially) satisfy a given specification\nunder existing routing protocols. By relaxing the rigid satisfaction\nguarantees, our approach (i) enables greater flexibility: it is\nprotocol-agnostic, enables cross-protocol reasoning, and does not depend on\nhardcoded rules; and (ii) finds configurations for much larger computer\nnetworks than previously possible. Our learned synthesizer is up to 490x faster\nthan state-of-the-art SMT-based methods, while producing configurations which\non average satisfy more than 93% of the provided requirements.\n</p>",
