  "description": "<p>Most people are aware of the basic physical contributors to health, like a well-rounded diet, a good night’s rest, and regular exercise. But we also have psychological needs that play a significant role in our overall wellness—and having a sense of purpose is at the top of the list. Emerging science shows that having a life purpose is associated with better health and a longer lifespan.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>But there’s a huge misconception about what it means to have a life purpose. Having meaning in your life isn’t necessarily the result of divine intervention or some sort of lifelong cosmic mission. No one assigns you a purpose—you choose it. You get to take the initiative and decide where you plan to place your intention. Another misconception about purpose is that it only gets one overall defining purpose. The truth is, your purpose can and will change over your lifetime. At certain stages of life, your purpose can be as simple as being kind to every person you meet or committing to being more present in your relationships.</p> <p>Today we’re going to dig into the science behind how having a purpose improves your health. I’ll also share my personal experience with finding and changing my own life mission, and you’ll hear a compilation of some of the best advice we’ve had on the Model Health Show surrounding uncovering your purpose and creating meaning in your life. This particular topic has been on my heart recently. I sincerely hope something in this episode will resonate with you so that you can tap into your unique life purpose and create change in your life.
