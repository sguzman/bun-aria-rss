  "description": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fourth episode of <em>Lawfare</em>’s narrative audio documentary, <a href=\"https://shows.pippa.io/the-report\">The Report</a>, which tells the story Robert S. Mueller lays out in his famous 448-page document. </p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the story of two Trump Towers, one in Moscow and one in New York. While Donald Trump was assuring Americans that he had no business in Russia, Mueller describes how he was simultaneously endeavoring to build a skyscraper with his name on it in Russia’s capital. And he describes as well the now infamous Trump Tower meeting in Manhattan, where Russians offered to give the candidate “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.</p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.lawfareblog.com/introducing-report-podcast-series-lawfare\"> Episode 1</a> covers the Russian social media campaign and the activities of the Internet Research Agency. <a href= \"https://www.lawfareblog.com/report-episode-2-hack-dump-divide\">Episode 2</a> focuses on the Russian hacking operation; the stealing of documents and emails from the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and figures associated with the Clinton campaign; and the leaks of the stolen materials timed to affect the U.S. election. The second episode tells the story of the GRU operations, the Russian attempts to cover their tracks, and the involvement of Wikileaks and Julian Assange. <a href= \"https://www.lawfareblog.com/report-episode-three-campaign-and-leaks\">Episode 3</a> covers the Trump campaign’s involvement in the distribution of hacked materials. </p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the fourth episode, we take on two aspects of Volume I of the Mueller report that both involve Trump Towers. The first is the ill-starred effort to build a Trump Tower Moscow, which began long before the campaign and continued—notwithstanding repeated statements to the contrary by the candidate, his family, and hist campaign—through the spring of 2016. The second is the so-called Trump Tower meeting in July 2016, when a group of Russians met with Trump campaign officials offering “dirt” on Hillary Clinton—and the campaign welcomed them.</p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode features Anthony Cormier, Jason Leopold, Julia Ioffe and Quinta Jurecic.</p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We continue to be delighted by the reception to this podcast series.
