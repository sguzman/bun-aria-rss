  "description": "<p>As a special treat on this D-Day, I am making public one of the Stones and Bones BonusCasts that are usually only available to the Executive Producers of History Goes Bump. Enjoy as we commemorate this very important day in history! The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial is located in Colleville-sur-Mer, France. The original cemetery here was called the American St. Laurent Cemetery, which was established by the U.S. First Army on June 8, 1944. The Americans needed a place to bury their dead during World War II and this was the first American cemetery established on European soil during that war. There are over 9,000 soldiers buried here and it is one of the most visited graveyards in the world. For those that visit, it is a truly moving experience. Join me as I explore the stones and bones found here.</p>",
