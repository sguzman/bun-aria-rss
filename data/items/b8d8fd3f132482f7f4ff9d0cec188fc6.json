Mission accomplished, Stephen! </p><p>But it's not all good; the book is longer than it probably needs to be and it lingers on certain aspects of pre-teen sexuality just a BIT more than seems advisable. </p><p>Anyway, come on down and enjoy this week's episode! We all float down here. </p><p>And you'll float, too.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
