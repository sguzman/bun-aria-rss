Speaker George Tannenbaum delivered his humanifesto and reminded us that “humans have the power and the privilege to not be machines, to not do as we’re told!” George has spent half his life in the advertising business yet he still manages to be a nice guy. Currently makes his advertising living working directly for clients and agencies.\nBefore that, George spent five years at Ogilvy helping run his dream account: IBM. Also worked at Ogilvy on IBM. Before Ogilvy, George worked for five years as executive creative director at R/GA—running the Ameriprise business, R/GA’s first traditional-advertising account. George has also worked for some of America's most storied agencies, including Hal Riney and Partners and Ally & Gargano. \nGeorge has won major awards for both creativity and effectiveness in four media channels: traditional, direct, interactive, and experiential. He's won a total of 15 Effies, including the Grand Effie and the 5/50 Sustaining Effie. He might be the only person on earth to have done that. \nGeorge also writes a popular advertising blog, Ad Aged, that was called “A Most Influential Marketing Blog” by “Business Insider.
