  "description": "<p>Knowledge is not enough. We can know what we’re doing isn’t good for us in the long run. We can know that we have weaknesses in certain areas. We can know that we have stored up pain and anxiety. But what do we do with that knowledge? You have to work through your past issues and trauma so that you stop repeating harmful patterns. It’s not easy, but it’s worth it. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Neil Strauss where he shared how he went from being a “pick up artist” to someone capable of having a fulfilling romantic relationship. Neil Strauss is a seven-time New York Times best-selling author. In his latest book, The Truth: An Uncomfortable Book About Relationships, Strauss dives deep into the worlds of sex addiction, non-monogamy, infidelity, and intimacy, and explores the hidden forces that cause people to choose each other, stay together, and break up. Neil says that learning humility was key to helping him grow as a person. He had to admit to himself that he was smart but didn’t know everything. Learn how to heal from your past trauma and keep evolving in Episode 801.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nWhat was driving Neil to become a pickup artist (2:00)<br />\nThe three things Neil learn in therapy (3:00 )<br />\nAbout Somatic Experiencing (4:00 )<br />\nFollow me on:<br />\nInstagram @LewisHowes<br />\nTwitter @LewisHowes<br />\nFacebook @Lewis Howes</p>\n",
