  "description": "Unlike modernist poetry or Shakespearean drama, when it comes to children's literature, everyone has an opinion. Most of us are exposed to kids' books in some shape or form and, crucially, 100% of us have been children. \n\nFor an academic working with children's literature, this can have its rewards and its frustrations. \"Yes! I love that classic childhood book too!\". But also: \"Sorry, I don't know why your child doesn't like this one particular book\"\n\n\n\nThis week I'm joined by Dr Jane Carroll to chat about the children's picture book. How do text and image work together to create books that can spark wonder and imagination, that young children can completely lose themselves in? What's happening in children's fiction today, and what's the best children's picture book of all time?\n\nFind out how you can support the show and get bonus episodes at patreon.com/wtte \n\nFor full show notes head to wttepodcast.com",
