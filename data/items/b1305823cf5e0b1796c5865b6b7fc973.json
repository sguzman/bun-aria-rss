Following the US election, the designer, who is also known as Denim Tears, spoke to BoF’s Imran Amed about negotiating with big brands, leading with purpose and the work still ahead. “It’s been an incredible week and there’s a lot more work to do,” said Emory. “I hope this is the start.”   <ul> <li>For Emory, principles come first when it comes to working with big brands, especially if they are using corporate activism in their marketing.
