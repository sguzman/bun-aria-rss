  "description": "<p>We construct a formally self-adjoint Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues correspond\nto the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. We consider a\ntwo-dimensional Hamiltonian which couples the Berry-Keating Hamiltonian to the\nnumber operator on the half-line via a unitary transformation. We demonstrate\nthat the unitary operator, which is composed of squeeze (dilation) operators\nand an exponential of the number operator, confines the eigenfunction of the\nHamiltonian to one dimension as the squeezing parameter tends towards infinity.\nThe Riemann zeta function appears at the boundary of the resulting confined\nwave function and vanishes as a result of the imposed boundary condition. If\nthe formal argument presented here can be made more rigorous, particularly if\nit can be shown rigorously that the Hamiltonian remains self-adjoint under the\nimposed boundary condition, then our approach has the potential to imply that\nthe Riemann hypothesis is true.\n</p>",
