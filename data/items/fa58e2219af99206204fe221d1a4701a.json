  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, America is back to the mask debate, mainly because public health bureaucrats enjoy flip-flopping on issues as much as they love the publicity. Now, President Biden says children need to wear masks in school and that people can't get the virus if they're vaccinated - which is inaccurate. Biden went on to say that more spending will reduce inflation. Biden is an extraordinarily stupid man that shouldn't be anywhere near the nuclear button. Then, crime in urban (Democrat-run) cities should be labeled a pandemic yet the Democrats in charge ignore the issue. This is why the American Marxist must be stopped. If Thomas Paine could reach 10% of Americans with a short pamphlet back in the early days of America, we can surely use that same strategy to reach our like-minded neighbors to become activists too. Later, was the FBI involved in the alleged kidnapping plot of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer? BuzzFeed is reporting that the FBI had an integral part from the inception of the plot itself. Setting up meetings and paying to facilitate meetings and activity leading to the culmination of the FBI's case. The Bill of rights and civil liberties of these defendants may have been egregiously violated. Afterward, Sen. Ron Johnson calls in to discuss big tech censorship and becoming engaged at every level to fight back against the Democrat Party.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
