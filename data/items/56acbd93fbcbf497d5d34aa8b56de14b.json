  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, following the two acts of domestic terrorism this weekend our nation is worn out, worn down, and we already knew that following these horrific slaughters that the media would blame President Trump, the NRA, and the second amendment.  However, the one word we're not hearing is — virtue.  Virtue has been pushed off of television, out of the movie theaters, and even out of the public square because of the Supreme Court. As such, morality is up for grabs, this is the breakdown of our civil society.  Virtue, morality, and faith cannot be legislated.  We should celebrate morality and virtue for only faith and a commitment to law and order that stop terrorist acts such as these, not more government. Later, this media has become sick and vicious; never once does the media pause for a moment of introspection or self-reflection. perhaps dialing back their own inflammatory rhetoric. Self-reflecting on whether they should get back to reporting the news based on facts, not social opinions. In the same way that Elizabeth Warren is not responsible for one of the shooters that supported her, nor Bernie Sanders for the shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise; we must stop blaming others, blaming video games, social media, or even mental illness without knowing the facts. Better yet, maybe we should get back to tried and true morals and values that reinforce our society as a whole.  Lastly, China has devalued its currency in an attempt to defend itself against US tariffs on their goods; a devalued Yuan is worth less so less can be bought and traded unless more dollars are used. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
