  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, when it comes to vaccines, this program urges you to speak with your doctor about your health and follow the appropriate guidance. Yet, in a frightening speech, President Biden is calling for vaccine mandates on private companies with more than 100 employees. Something Biden didn't say was how he was going to prevent the virus from coming in on unvetted migrants at the border. He also didn’t mention how many of the unvaccinated have natural immunity. Why is that? Then, the Supreme Court's 1904 Jacobson v. Massachusetts decision called for fines to be levied on the unvaccinated. Jacobson was a pastor that was vaccinated in Sweden as a child and refused the vaccination so he was fined and fought back. Jacobson argued that the government was forcing himself to accept illness into his otherwise healthy body was a violation of his 14th amendment rights and limited his liberty and the Supreme Court struck it down creating the \"reasonableness test\" for the government taking away one's liberty. In 1922 the Court heard the Zuck case and rejected that case as well. In 1927 the Supreme Court used these precedents in the Bell case that upheld forced sterilization on people deemed less viable.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
