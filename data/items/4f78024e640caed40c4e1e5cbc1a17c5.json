  "description": "<p>We are coming now toward the end of the book of Revelation, which means toward the end of the entire Biblical story.

There is something like that going on in the Bible. God has no intention of giving up on his creation or simply destroying it. The divorce that happened in the garden of Eden is overcome; and now the bride is ready for the Bridegroom.</p>\n",
