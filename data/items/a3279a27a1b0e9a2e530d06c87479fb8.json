  "description": "<p class=\"\">Sarah has the flu! She wants you to know it’s absolutely terrible and you should all get your flu shots even though she got one and still got the flu but vaccines are good for you. Also, we all want you washing your hands and air high-fiving your friends because it’s wild out there. But you are IN FOR A TREAT this week — as our fave Kate Clayborn is pinch hitting for Sarah, and we’re talking romance sickbed scenes this week! If we have to be hyper focused on sickness, shouldn’t there be yearning and vigiling and a veiled death threat against a doctor (don’t threaten doctors)?</p><p class=\"\">We love having you with us! — subscribe on your favorite podcasting platform and like/review the podcast, please!</p><p class=\"\">Next week, we’re reading Stephanie Laurens's Devil's Bride, starring Devil Cynster, who also happens to be the only romance hero Sarah's husband can name (yes, even now).

She joined Jen this week since Sarah was down and out with the flu.</p><p class=\"\">Kate loves <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kateclayborn/status/958079383679459330\">a sick bed scene</a>. When we talk about <a href=\"https://www.verywellhealth.com/chronic-definition-3157059\">acute vs chronic illness</a>, the sick bed scene is acute rather than chronic. And, as Jen points out, these are almost always about physical rather than mental illness.</p><p class=\"\">Some of Jen's favorite sickbed scenes are in <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/12/9/s0214-indigo\">Indigo by Beverly Jenkins</a> and <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2020/1/20/s0220-managed-by-kristen-callihan\">Managed by Kristen Callihan</a> -- but we've talked about those books already!
