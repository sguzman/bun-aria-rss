  "description": "<p>USModernist Radio goes to Palm Springs each February for the incredibly popular Modernism Week.  It’s a fascinating array of sunshine, architecture, lectures, parties, tours, exhibits, and you can even order martinis for breakfast. <span class= \"auto-style11\">Yes, you can do that anywhere but you'll feel glamorous in Palm Springs. USModernist Radio's </span><strong>George Smart</strong> was there with keynote speakers and other special guests who make Modernism Week a blast.</p> <p>The Kaufmann House is one of the most famous residences in Palm Springs.  Designed by <strong>Richard Neutra,</strong> it passed through a succession of owners and unfortunate renovations until <strong>Brent and Beth Harris</strong> brought it back to its original glory.  George talks about the house and it's journey from the past into the future with <strong>Brent Harris</strong> in a rare visit, poolside at the Kaufmann House.</p> <p><strong>Hugh Kaptur</strong> is the last living major mid-century modern architect in Palm Springs. He's the Obiwan of Modernism, the last of the Jedi. Alongside other celebrated Palm Springs architects, such as <strong>E. Stewart Williams, Donald Wexler, Bill Cody, John Porter Clark, and Albert Frey</strong>, Kaptur created the Modernist vibe that Palm Springs is famous for, from hotels to fire stations to apartment complexes to houses. From the 1950's through today, he's been turning out head-turning award-winning architecture. Kaptur has a star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars. He was featured in the documentary Quiet Elegance.</p>",
