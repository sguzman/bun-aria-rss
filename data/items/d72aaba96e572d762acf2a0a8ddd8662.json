  "description": "Unpopular opinion: It’s okay for our kids to like some kids better than others. After all, we want them to grow up into adults who can build meaningful relationships, which requires recognizing why they connect with certain people over others! Of course, we also want them to be kind, inclusive people. So, what’s a parent’s role in helping kids navigate tricky social situations? In this week’s episode, Dr. Becky talks to three parents about challenging peer dynamics—from leaving someone out on the playground to disliking a family friend’s daughter. She explains why curiosity is the most valuable social skill, and shares practical strategies on how to model it. Remember: We want to teach our kids how to think, not what to think. \n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A  <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
