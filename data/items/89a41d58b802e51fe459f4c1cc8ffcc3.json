  "description": "You wouldn't expect someone called Pokey LaFarge to grow up in fancy boarding schools, so it's not a huge surprise to learn that he came of age as an all-around rural wanderer who found his voice in roving packs of fellow buskers. Naturally, he keeps one eye on tradition, but -- true to form for an adventure- seeking free spirit -- he's always looking forward, too. LaFarge's newest album, recorded with his South City Three, is titled 'Riverboat Soul.' Here, LaFarge and his band perform live at the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, R.I.",
