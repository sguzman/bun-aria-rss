  "description": "<p>Get the Free Course here:<br /> <a href= \"https://phit.click/freecourse\">https://phit.click/freecourse</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Today I give you a lesson in the difference between self-confidence and confidence. Self-confidence is a mindset that you're born with. It begins with believing that you can figure things out. Think about a baby learning to walk. They just keep trying because they know they'll get it eventually.</p> <p>Confidence builds from doing the things you want to learn and acting as if you already know them. It's the byproduct of showing up every day with your 24 hour plan taking a stab stopping eating before you get full. It's repeatedly getting back on plan when you make a mistake.</p> <p>In today's podcast I show you how to develop self-confidence while gain confidence by repeated doing what you need to do to lose weight.</p> <p> </p>",
