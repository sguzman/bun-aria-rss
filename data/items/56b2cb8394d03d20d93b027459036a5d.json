    "media:description": "The book is called `Categories and Toposes: Visualized and Explained' and is available at \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0948LKZXX\n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0948LKZXX\n\nA description of the book is as follows: \n\nCategory theory is close to the perfect language. It can be used to describe many mathematical ideas, and see the relations between them, and their deeper structure. This book introduces category theory and topos theory from first principles without requiring any prerequisites. Over 250 full colour diagrams make the subject clear. Care has been taken to fully define and explain all the relevant topics and notation, making this book accessible to people without a background in mathematics. The early chapters outline category theory in an intuitive way, and the later chapters describe more advanced ideas like limits, adjunctions and topos theory in a rigorous way with many careful illustrated proofs.",
