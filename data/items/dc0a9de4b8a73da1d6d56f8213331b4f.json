  "description": "<p>Effective Monday, September 27, 2021, it's time for an all out assault on the WEEI phone lines (00:23:35). Justin has Minifans covered with a scoring system that will make this barrage during Bucs-Pats week fun and interactive. Lou Merloni goes on a strange rant about fans not supporting the Red Sox because Kirk, Gerry or 98.5 The Sports Hub tells them not to watch, listen or attend games (00:30;06). Greg Hill tries to pretend he wasn't referencing Kirk and Gerry early in his show when a Minifan gives him a call (00:06:00). A surprisingly normal Milton's trip culminates with a classic KMS Team photo (00:46:32). Julie DiCaro tries to claim porn was all over her sports radio experience in Chicago (01:03:49).  Quantum Week Chris brings an exercise this time... \"Kirk Soprano\" (01:08:12).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
