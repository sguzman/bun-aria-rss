As you read, you realize the clippings are about you… and discover you were kidnapped the day after you were born. Thus begins The Lost Sons, and the story only gets crazier from there. Paul Joseph Fronczak was kidnapped from the hospital just a day after he was born, and for decades he and his family thought he was found 15 months later halfway across the country.
