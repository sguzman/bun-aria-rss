  "description": "<p><p>Someone with a thirst for revenge has released embarrassing material on Blind Mike. Or as he was known during his college radio days, Dirty Mike. Kirk Minihane listens to old tape of his sidekick's glorious reign as host of Dirty Mike and The Boys (7:40). Minihane is less than impressed with the rollout of his friend Gerry Callahan's podcast, so he ruins the big Callahan Podcast tease and reads the alleged Tom Brady letter on his own show (16:28). The KMS crew gets to the bottom of a Sportshub mystery thanks to a very kind producer (36:30). A few new parody songs (46:00). The winner of the KMS auction lets us know we'll be doing a show in his living room over a nice winter weekend on the Cape. The crew is headed to NYC next week for the Barstool Sports companywide meeting and Christmas Party (56:30). We condemn the revenge porn attack on Barstool founder Dave Portnoy (1:09:32). </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
