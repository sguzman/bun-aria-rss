  "description": "Globalization is one of those words we hear on an almost daily basis. The world today is interconnected in ways that would have been unimaginable even twenty years ago. It seems as if everyone knows what globalization is, but what does it really consist of, and does it even really exist? Is the world really all that different? In Sociology of Globalization: Globalizing Cultures, Economies and Politics (Westview Press, 2012), Keri E. Iyall Smith gathers the writing of a variety of scholars, journalists and researchers and their views on this complex phenomenon. Each chapter contains resources for further research and study, and in each of the three sections – Culture, Economy and Politics – Smith also shares her own thoughts and research into globalization, covering both positive and negative aspects of our new world order.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
