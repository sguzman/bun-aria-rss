  "description": "<p>\n    There's a fascinating link between minimization of quadratic functions and polynomials. A link\n    that goes\n    deep and allows to phrase optimization problems in the language of polynomials and vice versa.\n    Using this connection, we can tap into centuries of research in the theory of polynomials and\n    shed new light on â€¦</p>",
