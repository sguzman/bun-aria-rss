  "description": "What is the experience of young homeless people? What does this experience tell us about space, place and society? In Young Homeless People and Urban Space: Fixed in Mobility (Routledge, 2015), Dr. Emma Jackson, a lecturer in the Sociology Department of Goldsmith’s College, University of London, employs an ethnographic approach to understand young people’s experience of homelessness in contemporary London. The book is rich with the stories and experiences of young people, based around a day centre offering support as they navigate the complexities of both London’s super-diverse city and the bureaucracies of the British state. Offering important theoretical and methodological contributions, along with the ethnographic insights, the narratives within the book are essential and important reading for all those seeking to understand what it is to be young in a housing crisis within a highly unequal global city.\n\n\n\nDave O’Brien is the host of New Books In Critical Theory and is a Senior Lecturer in Cultural Policy at the Institute for Cultural and Creative Entrepreneurship, Goldsmiths’ College, University of London. His research covers a range of areas between sociology and political science, including work on the British Civil Service, British Cultural Policy, cultural labour, and urban regeneration.
