  "title": "Did racism motivate Trump's voters? (Stephen Dubner, co-author, 'Freakonomics')",
  "description": "Journalist and \"Freakonomics\" co-author Stephen Dubner talks with Recode's Peter Kafka about how behavioral economics can explain Donald Trump's victory, arguing that racism and xenophobia are symptoms of a deeper-felt economic resentment. He also discusses widespread misunderstandings about probability and offers a partial defense of poll aggregators like FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver. Later in the show, Dubner explains how \"Freakonomics\" became a mini media empire, why he's now almost all-in on podcasting and how Bruce Springsteen convinced him to quit rock and roll.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
