  "description": "One of the SNP's biggest stars returns to the show ahead of his bid to stand for Holyrood in 2021. In his time away from elected politics, Angus founded the 'Progress Scotland' thinktank and he shares some of the fascinating research about changing attitudes in Scotland. He also talks about his defeat in 2017, whether he saw it coming and what it's like to be away from Westminster. Angus and Matt look ahead to a potential second referendum and how it may differ from the first. Plus, it wouldn't be a Zoom call without an interruption and Angus is joined by his daughter Saiorse who wanders in halfway through. Plus inevitable whisky chat!
