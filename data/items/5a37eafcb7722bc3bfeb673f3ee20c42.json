  "description": "<p>We propose to test the viability of the recently introduced $f(\\mathcal{R})$\ngravity model in the galactic scales. For this purpose we consider test\nparticles moving in stable circular orbits around the galactic center. We study\nthe Palatini approach of $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity via Weyl transformation,\nwhich is the frame transformation from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame.\nWe derive the expression of rotational velocities of test particles in the new\n$f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity model. For the observational data of samples of high\nsurface brightness and low surface brightness galaxies, we show that the\npredicted rotation curves are well fitted with observations, thus implying that\nthis model can explain flat rotation curves of galaxies. We also study an ultra\ndiffuse galaxy, AGC $242019$ which has been claimed in literature to be a dark\nmatter dominated galaxy similar to low surface brightness galaxies with a\nslowly rising rotation curve. The rotation curve of this galaxy also fits well\nwith the model prediction in our study. Furthermore, we studied the\nTully-Fisher relation for the entire sample of galaxies and found that the\nmodel prediction shows the consistency with the data.\n</p>",
