  "description": "Jason Mayden, co-founder of Super Heroic, was the lead designer for the Air Jordan, the highest grossing Nike shoe in history. In his relentless pursuit to be the greatest sneaker designer, he did 1,000 sketches a day and became the first African American to land a design internship with Nike. And in just five years, he familiarized himself with other disciplines to earn his role as Senior Designer — a feat that normally takes around 15 years to achieve— and ultimately designed the Nike shoe of his hometown hero, Michael Jordan. Jason went on to obtain his Master’s degree from Stanford and worked his way all the way to Senior Global Design Director for the Jordan brand. Join Tom Bilyeu as he sits down with the co-founder of Super Heroic, Inc. as he shares his strategies for improving introspection and harnessing child-like curiosity in this episode of Impact Theory.
