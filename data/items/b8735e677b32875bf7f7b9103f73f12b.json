  "description": "<p>Steve Simeone and I sat on the balcony of his new apartment and broke down his new album, Jabba. We talked about the origins of the bits, the messages he had in them, what his theories are on the delivery styles, and much more.</p> <p>You should all go buy a copy of Jabba from iTunes or ApplePlay. It's a really funny album that would make a GREAT Fathers Day present. Buy it today and send it to your dad. This really was made for him. Unless your dad is dead. Then I guess SUCKS TO BE YOU!!!</p> <p><a href= \"https://music.apple.com/us/album/jabba/1465387916\">https://music.apple.com/us/album/jabba/1465387916</a></p>",
