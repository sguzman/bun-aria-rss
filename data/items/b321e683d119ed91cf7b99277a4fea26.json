She agreed to keep this a secret from her nephew because his parents want him to work to earn scholarships, rather than just lazily expecting money. Well, it turns out that the nephew has been stealing money from her purse for years, and OP finally finds out about it. She changes her mind about giving him the $40,000, which of course causes the thief to flip out and start apologizing. Is OP the butthole here?</p>\n",
