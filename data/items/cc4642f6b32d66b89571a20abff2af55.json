These conversations will deal with theoretical questions that pertain to landscape architecture and other spatial disciplines -- engaging with large, complex issues of ethics and justice, along with the specificity that these terms assume in various cultural contexts. Our panelists bring a wealth of relevant experience and knowledge, stemming from their practices in architecture, landscape architecture, planning, activism, and academia. Additionally, these spatial practitioners work in three regions that are traditionally underrepresented and under-engaged in landscape architectural curriculums. Following the panelists’ presentations, we will convene for a discussion moderated by our two organizers: Jihany Hassun and Vanessa Dikuyama.</span></em></p>",
