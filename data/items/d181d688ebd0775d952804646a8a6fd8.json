  "description": "<p>Sometimes you just need to go back to the classics and this is one of them. Back in 2011 I went on Piers' show to discuss my book, 'The Thank You Economy,' which is quietly my best book yet ;) PLEASE give this a listen because the things we discuss still hold SO true today.

LOVE this one. </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5038172.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
