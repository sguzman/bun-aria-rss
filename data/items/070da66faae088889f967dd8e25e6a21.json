  "description": "In this episode, Sharon talks with Zoe Chance, author of Influence is Your Superpower and Yale professor (who teaches the most popular course at the university: Mastering Influence and Persuasion). Zoe argues that the goal of mastering the path of influence is personal development and becoming someone people want to say yes to. An effective influencer respects the freedom, autonomy, and humanity of others. The goal of influencing the behavior of others takes a more nuanced approach than simply giving people information; increasing awareness is not enough to change minds. Sharon and Zoe use the example of voting, and the ways in which we can have an effective influence on increasing voter turnout.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
