According to Dorothy’s husband, Kevan, he saw her that day at their home, and then he left to look at a job. When he returned a couple of hours later, he couldn’t find Dorothy. However, he found a strange scene inside the house, a television remote control partially melted on the woodstove. Upon further inspection, he noticed plastic and other material burning inside the stove. There were clothes scattered around, and it looked as though perhaps someone had left in a hurry. More than a year and a half later, her family feels like they are no closer to finding out what happened and are hoping that someone will come forward with a new lead.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Dorothy Yates-McCathran, please call the Caddo Parish Sheriff’s Office at (318) 675-2170.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://moinkbox.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moink</a>- Go to <a href=\"http://moinkbox.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moinkbox.com/vanished</a>&nbsp;to get a free year of bacon and then pick the meats you want delivered with your first box.</p><p><a href=\"http://headspace.com/THEVANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Headspace</a>- Head to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://headspace.com/THEVANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Headspace.com/THEVANISHED</a>&nbsp;for a free month trial.</p><p><a href=\"http://sleepnumber.com/VANISH\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sleep Number</a>- Proven quality sleep is life-changing sleep.
