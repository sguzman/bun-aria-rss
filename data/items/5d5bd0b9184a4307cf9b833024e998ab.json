  "title": "#134: A Field Manual For Life After Combat With David Danelo",
  "description": "<p>Since 9/11 and before, American warriors have faced combat in difficult and adverse theaters with dedication, courage, and remarkable inner fortitude. Our nation supports them during their time in the fight, and \"thank you for your service\" has become a common civilian affirmation.<br />But what happens when these men and women return from the battlefield? What is waiting for them at home? How does our society prepare these indispensable citizens for the confusion, absurdity, and trauma of their transition back to everyday life?<br />Marine combat veteran David J. Danelo's message is simple--those who return to peace after war possess a power that must be discovered, honored, and treasured. The Return: A Field Manual for Life After Combat tells how our military and civilian cultures can protect and nurture this potent gift.<br />Today on the podcast, we discuss how warriors can make the return to civilian life and what civilians can do to help.</p>\n",
