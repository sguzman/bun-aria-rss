  "description": "<p>Covid has impacted lots of areas of our lives - including our summer travel plans. So now is a great time to get a little creative if you are hoping for any sort of vacation. Many of us have had our getaways cancelled, or even if not, there’s a chance you may not feel great about being cooped up in an airplane for hours on end. Even if it’s relatively safe, it still isn’t something many of us want to do these days. But if you already have planned for a week off from work it’s important to still take that time off, even if your plans end up looking a lot different than you had originally planned. Don’t abandon that vacation altogether - listen as we explore some creative options for summer travel that will be affordable as well as fun.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Phinizy Swamp Thing by Savannah River Brewing- thanks to Jeff for donating this one to the show!
