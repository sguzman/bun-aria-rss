  "description": "<p>Our approach to sustainability is simple. We all want to leave the planet a better place than we found it. At Trader Joe's, we're working hard to do just that, in part by reimagining how we approach packaging in our stores. We've eliminated certain types of packaging, we're reducing other types of packaging, and we're taking steps to remove more than a million pounds of plastic over the next year alone! We're going to the store, to a recycling plant, and to a next-generation manufacturing facility dedicated to making a positive impact, one plastic bottle at a time.</p> <p> </p> <p><a href= \"https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/pdfs/transcript-pdfs/InsideTJs-Episode11-Transcript.pdf\"> Episode 11 Transcript (PDF)</a></p>",
