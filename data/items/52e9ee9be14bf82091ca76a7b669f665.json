  "description": "Glenn and the “notorious” former NYU professor, Michael Rectenwald, both believe that Big Tech, China, and the Left share similar - authoritarian - goals. Rectenwald’s newest book, “The Google Archipelago,” explores just that. In it, he imagines a world that’s sounding more familiar each day: 5G, AI, transhumanism, constant connection to the internet, and all the possibilities that opens up – digital erasing, book burning, Revelation-style marking, and the creation of what he calls “digital gulags.” In this interview, Glenn and Rectenwald discuss the power we give to Big Tech companies, why they’re helping China control its people, and what’s in store for us. Because, as they note, evil comes dressed fashionably, saying it’s for our own good.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
