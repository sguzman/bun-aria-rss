It’s the biggest challenge people face at work, and it comes from not knowing how to truly find your spark. On this episode of the You Turn podcast, author and founder of The Good Life Jonathan Fields teaches you how to find that spark, and how to discover your purpose and what drives you. There is a pretty small set of fundamental drivers that are universal to most people, and they can be found by looking deeper, asking bigger questions, and getting more connected to yourself through awareness. Jonathan and Ashley dive deep into this awareness, and how to regain it. As always, don’t forget to stay tuned for Ashley’s post episode thoughts!</p>",
