  "description": "SAY MY NAME SAY MY NAME…\nSeriously. How proud is your partner to be with you? Are you their dirty little secret (shout out All American Rejects) or do they scream your name from the rooftops? Sloots, today Sofia is helping you figure out whether or not you are being POCKETED. You probably already know the answer to this, but sometimes you need someone to lay it all out for you - and that’s what Sloot University is for. Heading into this holiday weekend Sofia is doing A LOT. In light of her going on yet another tropical vacation (because her life is so hard), she vents about her gripes with the OVERLY organized community, specifically the ones on TikTok. You know the ones who are fully packed 3 days in advance for their trip with every moment of their itinerary planned out before they even arrive at the airport? Those people. Naturally, because she’s making fun of a group of people, it’s only right she made fun of herself. Sofia decided to find some of the best negative reviews about herself and read them for you all to enjoy. Staying humble is key! Finally, Sofia gives us the lowdown on EVERYTHING that went down during the recent Nelk Boys prank featuring Sofia (and the Sloot Media team). If you haven’t seen it yet, RUN don’t walk to Youtube. It’s some real wedding crasher shit people. Sloots, sit back and relax - because there’s nothing more relaxing than listening to someone whose life is more of a train wreck than yours. \n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n\nMerit: http://www.meritbeauty.com/SOFIA to get their free reusable makeup bag with your purchase\nSkinSolutions.MD: https://sofia.skinsolutions.md for a discounted price\nFitOn: Join over 10 million people getting their FitOn.
