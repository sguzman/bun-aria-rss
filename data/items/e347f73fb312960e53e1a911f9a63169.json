  "title": "PMS 2.0 183 - MASSIVE SHOW. Triple H, Joe Buck, & Legend, AJ Hawk Stop By For Some Good Conversation. Let's Have A Quarantine Thursday.",
  "description": "Today's show features a couple of incredible interviews. First, calling in via FaceTime is The King of Kings, The Game, one of the greatest wrestlers in history, the brain behind WWE's NXT, Triple H joins the show. Pat and HHH chat about the WWE's response to the coronavirus pandemic and how they decided to still do shows in the performance center, how Trips and WWE talent handle social media in a world that is very critical of everything they do, what the WWE has planned for future NXT and PPV events, and how the current situation in the world has given the WWE difficulties dealing with international business (3:00-27:52). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk, Sports Talk (27:54-2:00:23). Pat and AJ discuss rumors that the Dolphins are going to try to trade up for the #1 pick, and AJ sheds a little bit of light into what it is like playing for the Bengals, and if they are realistically considering trading their pick, and what they would need in return. Pat and AJ also welcome on NFL, MLB, and USGA play-by-play king, Joe Buck. Joe chats about commentating regular videos being sent to him for charity and how it has started to pick up steam, his apprehensive relationship with the internet as he takes a lot of heat from several different fan bases, whether or not Roger Goodell has ever told him to stop saying something or reprimanded him, what he would consider his biggest mistake broadcasting is, his relationship with Troy Aikman, and how the quarantine has allowed Joe to go back and listen to some of his previous calls and actually enjoy them for the first time in a long time (59:23-1:29:11). Today's show is a fun one. Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch, and as always, stay safe out there. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
