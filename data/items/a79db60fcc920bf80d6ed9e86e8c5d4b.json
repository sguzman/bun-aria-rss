We chat Micheal's excitment and tantrums on his big day, Angela's work with a stunt skater, and we get the scoop from Kentapedia (Kent Zbornak) about all the locations they shot at for this episode. Then, baby, we get some OG PPC moments, Jenna describes a wild present she received from her mom, and we break down some Dwangela sass. Finally, we get some good Jim and Pam flirtation, Angela explains how hard it was to film the scene with Kevin on the ice, and we end the episode with a hilarious deleted scene. Enjoy, babe. </p>\n",
