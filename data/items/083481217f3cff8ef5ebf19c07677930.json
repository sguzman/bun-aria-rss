  "description": "<p>Today we welcome Todd Rose, the co-founder and president of Populace, a nonprofit think tank that works to find solutions to redistribute opportunity, so all people have the chance to live fulfilling lives in a thriving society. Prior to Populace, he was a faculty member at Harvard University where he founded the Laboratory for the Science of Individuality and directed the Mind, Brain, and Education program. Todd is the best-selling author of Dark Horse and The End of Average. and his most recent book is called Collective Illusions.</p><p>For part two of our interview, I talk to Todd Rose about collective illusions. Humans are a tribal species, prone to conformity. In a lot of instances, we will act according to what our in-group wants rather than what we want as individuals. Ironically, Todd's research shows that we make poor inferences about the majority consensus. Failing to recognize collective illusions can have negative consequences on our identities, relationships, values, and society. To avoid falling into conformity traps, Todd encourages us to live congruent private and public lives that adhere to our personal convictions.</p><p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.toddrose.com/\">www.toddrose.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ltoddrose?lang=en\">@ltoddrose</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>03:10 What is a collective illusion?</p><p>06:16 Social media and perceived consensus</p><p>13:38 Self-fulfilling political polarization</p><p>19:10 Socializing the concept of collective illusions</p><p>20:49 Gender bias in politics</p><p>22:59 Conformity traps in groups and relationships</p><p>28:15 Do republicans think the 2020 elections were rigged?</p><p>31:32 Preference falsification and manipulation</p><p>36:22 The need for belonging and self-expression</p><p>38:26 False expectations distort relationships</p><p>39:48 Congruence, positive deviance, and authentic responsibility</p><p>46:54 Norms as checking mechanisms</p>\n",
