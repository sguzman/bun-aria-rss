  "description": "<p>Gravitational-wave (GW) astrophysics is a field in full blossom. Since the\nlandmark detection of GWs from a binary black hole on September 14th 2015,\nseveral compact-object binaries have been reported by the LIGO-Virgo\ncollaboration. Such events carry astrophysical and cosmological information\nranging from an understanding of how black holes and neutron stars are formed,\nwhat neutron stars are composed of, how the Universe expands, and allow testing\ngeneral relativity in the highly-dynamical strong-field regime. It is the goal\nof GW astrophysics to extract such information as accurately as possible. Yet,\nthis is only possible if the tools and technology used to detect and analyze\nGWs are advanced enough. A key aspect of GW searches are waveform models, which\nencapsulate our best predictions for the gravitational radiation under a\ncertain set of parameters, and that need to be cross-correlated with data to\nextract GW signals. Waveforms must be very accurate to avoid missing important\nphysics in the data, which might be the key to answer the fundamental questions\nof GW astrophysics. The continuous improvements of the current LIGO-Virgo\ndetectors, the development of next-generation ground-based detectors such as\nthe Einstein Telescope or the Cosmic Explorer, as well as the development of\nthe Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), demand accurate waveform models.\n[Abridged.]\n</p>",
