Connor took it upon himself to do some extracurricular studying this week and came over-prepared for the drinking portion of the podcast. Luckily, Dan is there to sour his mood with some truly pessimistic philosophy. They're talking about John Gray's 2002 book Straw Dogs, which takes a big crap on humanism and basically tells everyone to give up. Oh also, these two drunk dummies solve all the problems in the Middle East. You're welcome, World!</strong></p>",
