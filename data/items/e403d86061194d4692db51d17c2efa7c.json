  "description": "<p>Rachel Platten is a singer and songwriter who’s released four albums, including her 2016 album <em>Wildfire</em>, which went Gold. The lead single from that album, “Fight Song,” was used prominently by Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. For a normally apolitical artist, the sudden proximity to the election had profound effects, both positive and negative. In this episode, Rachel breaks down her song “Broken Glass,\" which was inspired by that experience, and written just days before the 2016 election.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://songexploder.net/rachel-platten\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">songexploder.net/rachel-platten</a></p>",
