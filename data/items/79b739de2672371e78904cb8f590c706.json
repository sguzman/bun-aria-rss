  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, the DOJ has issued an opinion that the President is not required to release his taxes and neither is anyone else, with the exception of the Secretary of the Treasury at the request of the House Ways and Means Committee. This rock solid Constitutional response clarifies that without a serious legislative use for these tax returns, requesting them is an abuse, since Congress does not have that type of plenary power. The Department determined that the Committee's request was pretextual and was doing so in order to make said returns public. Then, the media just keeps at it and Speaker Nancy Pelosi just doesn't let up with her fascistic tactics. President Trump takes to the media to pushback on criticism from his interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos and cites Mark Levin comments on Pelosi. Afterward, the media is obsessed with claiming that Kellyanne Conway violated the Hatch Act meanwhile Stephanopoulos and so many others have violated this very same act and gotten no criticism for it. Finally, Iran is on the move blowing up oil tankers. Iran is the enemy of the United States, and if they continue to threaten us we need to hit back. At times turning the other cheek leads to more casualties than not.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
