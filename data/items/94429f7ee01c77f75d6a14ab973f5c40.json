  "description": "<p>We consider Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations with real quadratic Hamiltonians, for\nwhich the Wigner distribution of the solution at a given time equals, up to a\nlinear coordinate transformation, the Wigner distribution of the initial\ncondition. Based on Hardy's uncertainty principle for the joint time-frequency\nrepresentation, we prove a uniqueness result for such Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequations, where the solution cannot have strong decay at two distinct times.\nThis approach reproduces known, sharp results for the free Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation and the harmonic oscillator, and we also present an explicit scheme\nfor quadratic systems based on positive definite matrices.\n</p>",
