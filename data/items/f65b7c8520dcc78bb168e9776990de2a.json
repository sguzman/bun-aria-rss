Charlotte also has an incredible fabric and wallpaper line called House of Harris. We talk about Charlotte’s love of color and patterns, how she balances funky and traditional, using layers, and more!\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nTrials & Triumphs with nursery completion, organizing kid clothes, basement flooding, house updates, and caretaker insight.\n\nCharlotte’s approach to choosing bold upholstery.\n\nHow Charlotte helps her clients visualize their spaces with artist renderings.\n\nWhat is Charlotte’s process for getting to know the client and their tastes?\n\nWhen, where, and how does Charlotte use a contrast wall?\n\nHow does Charlotte balance traditional and daring styles?\n\nMore about Charlotte’s fabric & wallpaper line House of Harris.\n\nCharlotte leans towards funky MCM pieces, but mixes them in with other styles.\n\nCharlotte loves using layers and telling a story in a space.\n\nWhat are Charlotte’s g0-to accessories and where do her clients usually struggle?\n\nWhat unusual pieces does Charlotte like to put on bookshelves?\n\nWhat is Charlotte’s approach to gallery walls?\n\nImportant questions about designing Taryn’s door!\n\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Shari,\nWe just did this for a client! A beach house is all about embracing where you are. So this is a place to restrain from color, as hard as it is, and go for texture, layers, and warmth. I like to do this with materials like caning, bamboo, rattan, and anything woven. There are so many vintage dealers both in local coastal outlets and online for wonderful pieces like this. I would definitely keep the furniture neutral but maybe add soft color with a lamp/lampshade or other accessory; your pillows would be a great place to add some. You could even paint one of those woven pieces. Try to grab color inspiration from your natural, outdoor surroundings (i.e. sky, sunset, sands, plants, etc) at different times of day. Another great thing for a beach house is grasscloth wallpaper. It’s not terribly expensive and it provides incredible texture; there are a lot of brands out there. You could even do it in the back of the bookshelves! We think your rug is too small, so think you should either size it up, or layer it with another bigger rug. With an open floor plan, it is important to create defined and separate spaces. Light fixtures in the kitchen or dining area could definitely help accomplish this.\nYou already have a great base, so no drastic suggestions! You can message me on Instagram at @charlottelucas if you have more questions or want to send me after photos!\nMentioned in This Episode:\nCharlotte Lucas Interior Design\nCharlotte Lucas on Instagram\nHouse of Harris\nBlinds.com",
