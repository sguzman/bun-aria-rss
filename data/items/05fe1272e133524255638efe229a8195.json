  "description": "Shady or Not: you tell us what's going on in your life, and we'll tell you whether or not it's shady...or totally legit.\nThis time around, our LISTENER is the one who might just be shady. The holidays are coming up and she wants to take a guy home for Thanksgiving because she's tired of being the only single one at her aunt's house. All of her siblings and cousins have boyfriends or spouses and she feels like she's always being judged or pitied. Normally, by the end of the night, there has been enough alcohol consumed that people stop biting their tongues and conversation around the table includes \"when is Heather going to find a guy...\" or \"will Heather be single forever.\" That said, she doesn't want to bring home just anyone.  \nShe's been dating 2 guys and she likes them both, but she's not at a serious or exclusive point in my relationship with either of them. She definitely wants to invite one of them to join me for Thanksgiving. Since it involves a\ndecent amount of travel, she doesn't feel like this is something that can be a last minute decision. She also wants to ask whichever guy she picks in enough time for him to have not decided on his own Thanksgiving plans.   \nAll that said, her real question is... is it wrong or shady of her to basically be auditioning these guys for her Thanksgiving date?\nLearn more about your ad choices.
