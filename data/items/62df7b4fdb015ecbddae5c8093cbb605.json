  "description": "Match Group is a dating conglomerate, owners of OKCupid, Match, a majority share of Hinge, PlentyofFish, OurTime, Meetic, and most of all, Tinder. The company is also a favorite pitch of investors. Is it just because there are a lot of 20 and 30-something investors out there or people who like to make jokes about dating, or is there a deeper story? We look at a Detroit Bear long idea on the company to understand the stickiness of the Tinder experience and what that means for the stock.",
