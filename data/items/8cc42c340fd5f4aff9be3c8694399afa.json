We hope that 2016 is a happy, healthy and successful year for you, and that you have many opportunities to put your language skills to use over the coming months.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re delighted to bring you this update from Radio Lingua at the beginning of 2016. We&#8217;ve had a very busy holiday period with the launch of our new Coffee Break Academy website and the Coffee Break French and Spanish Masterclass programmes, but more about that a bit later.</p>\n<h3>Looking back at 2015</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s begin by taking a look back at 2015 and what it meant for Coffee Break language learners. We completed our <a href=\"/tag/cbf-season-4/\">fourth season of Coffee Break French</a> and we launched our <a href=\"/tag/cbs-season-4/\">fourth season of Coffee Break Spanish</a> last year. We also introduced a brand new language with <a href=\"/tag/cbi-season-1/\">Coffee Break Italian</a>, along with our children&#8217;s show <a href=\"/highfivefrench/\">High Five French</a>.</p>\n<p>Over the year we delivered over 21 million free language lessons and this means that on average over 59,000 lessons were downloaded every day. In other words, language learners around the world downloaded 41 of our lessons every minute of 2015.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s coming in 2016</h3>\n<p>We spent much of last year producing new content for this coming year: we&#8217;ve been filming and recording in Spain, France and Germany for new and existing projects. We can&#8217;t say too much about some of these projects just yet, but you can look forward to exciting, new content and we&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ll enjoy continuing your learning journey with us.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/tag/cbs-season-4/\">Coffee Break Spanish Season 4</a> continues with episode 21 released on 27th January.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ll be launching the second of our <a href=\"/2015/08/introducing-the-coffee-break-french-season-4-companion/\">Coffee Break French Season 4 Companion</a> ebooks in the next few weeks.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;re excited to be releasing our <a href=\"http://radiolinguaschools.com/highfivespanish/\">brand new video course High Five Spanish</a> for younger learners in the summer.</li>\n<li>We had planned to record the final section of <a href=\"/tag/cbi-season-1/\">Coffee Break Italian Season 1</a> in Italy earlier this month but unfortunately this visit had to be postponed. We&#8217;ll be publishing some top-up episodes to help our Italian learners keep up their skills until we can rearrange the visit to Francesca&#8217;s homeland.</li>\n<li>And finally, we can confirm that there will be new <a href=\"/coffeebreakgerman/\">Coffee Break German</a> content in 2016!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Masterclass</h3>\n<p>Our biggest news is the launch of our special 12-month course for intermediate learners of Spanish and French, the Coffee Break Masterclass. We&#8217;ve built a brand new website, the <a href=\"https://coffeebreakacademy.com\">Coffee Break Academy</a>, where you can join the Masterclass and become a master of the language. We&#8217;ve been listening very carefully to your feedback and have put together this innovative course which combines our regular, structured audio lessons with challenges, tasks and a discussion area. There are already many members interacting every day <a href=\"https://coffeebreakacademy.com/forums/\">in the Masterclass forums</a>, practising what they&#8217;re learning in the audio lessons and completing our challenges and exercises.</p>\n<p>Each month there&#8217;s a new module, and you&#8217;ll receive lessons every 3 or 4 days. We&#8217;ll deliver everything straight to your inbox and the best thing about the Masterclass is that it starts when you&#8217;re ready for it. So if you join today you will receive your orientation module and lesson 1, then lesson 2 will follow in a few days&#8217; time. The feedback so far on the Masterclass has been fantastic and we&#8217;re very excited to be supporting our intermediate learners in this way.</p>\n<p>We firmly believe that learning a language can be done effectively in your 20-minute coffee break, or indeed on a run, on your commute to work, or while you&#8217;re doing the household chores. The secret is in making your downtime your &#8220;do&#8221; time, so if you&#8217;d like to take your French or Spanish to the next level, head over to the <a href=\"https://coffeebreakacademy.com\">coffeebreakacademy.com</a>.</p>\n<h3>Los geht&#8217;s &#8211; c&#8217;est parti &#8211; empecemos ya &#8211; cominciamo!</h3>\n<p>We hope you&#8217;re as excited as we are as we begin a new year of language learning!</p>\n",
