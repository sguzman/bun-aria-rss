  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It’s  getting colder out there, so we’re getting hot in here! We’ve got the  fabulous Katee Robert with us to talk about ménage romance and why she  writes them so well. We get to the bottom of why it always gets shoved  into the taboo corner of romance, the fantasy of the trope, and why we  like it so very much. Also, we topple the TBR (as usual)!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thank you, as always, for listening!

This  is an imperfect shorthand, but at this point in our understanding of  sex and gender, it seems like the most respectful way to acknowledge  that there is a huge range of sexual identities that exist for people of  all genders. For example, if we call a book with two women “a lesbian  romance” it might not take into account that one character is bisexual,  which adds to bi-erasure. So if a romance is labeled M/F, we know there  is a man and a woman in a romantic relationship, but that leaves room  for the sexual identity of the characters to be fully explored in the  book. In romance with more than two people, the order of the letters  matters. A book that is MFM would mean that the two men do not have a  sexual relationship with each other, while FMM or MMF means that they  do. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There is nothing taboo about <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/polyamorous#key-values\">polyamory</a>. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Jen liked the progression of menage in Elle Kennedy’s Out of Uniform  series. The series starts with a non-swords crossing threesome, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3f61DZe\">Hot and Bothered</a>. The observing one was <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3kGuip1\">Heat of the Night</a>  (available in the Hot and Heavy anthology), where Ryan watches  Annabelle have sex with his roommate. But as the series progresses,  there is contact between the SEALs in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/35FIBFP\">Feeling Hot</a> and a fully formed menage relationship in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36Lupuj\">Hotter Than Ever</a>. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://thesteamyreader.com/what-the-heck-happened-to-elloras-cave\">Ellora’s Cave</a> and <a href=\"https://goodereader.com/blog/indie-author-news/samhain-closes-is-amazon-to-blame\">Samhain</a> were two of the original (and now shuttered) indie publishers that specialized in erotic romance and/or taboo romance. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a27259689/toxic-masculinity-male-friendships-emotional-labor-men-rely-on-women/\">That article in Harpers about how men don’t have friends</a>. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://ew.com/books/2018/08/07/laurell-k-hamiltons-anita-blake-25th-anniversary/\">The Anita Blake series</a> went through a lot of changes, so just go with Katee’s method and start with #9, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/35FrkN5\">Obsidian Butterfly</a>.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Katee will be back to talk about <a href=\"https://allthetropes.fandom.com/wiki/Morality_Chain\">morality chain</a> in 2021. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Next week, we’ll be airing our Best of 2020 episode, and then the first week of December, we’ll be discussing <a href=\"https://amzn.to/35FqEaw\">The Hating Game</a>. </p>",
