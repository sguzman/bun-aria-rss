  "description": "<p>The crime scene was described as looking more like the set of a horror movie, than real life. It is one of the most horrific crimes ever committed.</p>\n\n\n<p>Not only did it shock the small town of Aberdeen in country NSW, where the crime occurred, it shocked the entire nation of Australia and parts of the world. What could possibly drive somebody to do this? A psychiatric illness? Or premeditated, pre-planned, pure evil?</p>\n\n\n<p>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-12-katherine-knight/\"><strong><a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-12-katherine-knight\">casefilepodcast.com/case-12-katherine-knight</a></strong></a></p>\n",
