  "description": "<p>Tim Dillon got together with me to help me understand wealthy people. They're not like you and I. Sometimes I hate them and sometimes I am in awe of them. Tim broke down all the reasons they suck, and also all the reasons the poor aren't much better. Tim Dillon always has great insights into stuff like this. And he's been obsessed with the super wealthy since I've met him.</p> <p>Joe List joined me for the introduction and outro to speak a little on the same subject and then we took some calls from people who left messages about what it means to be rich or to be poor. </p>",
