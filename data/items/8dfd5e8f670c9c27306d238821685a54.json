  "title": "284: How To Handle A Narcissist (Including, Maybe...Yourself) | Keith Campbell",
  "description": "“Narcissist” is a word that gets thrown quite a bit, including by me -- often, semi-facetiously, about myself. But until this conversation, I didn’t actually know what the word meant. My guest today is Keith Campbell, who’s been researching narcissism for more than 30 years. He’s got a new book called The New Science of Narcissism. In this episode, we talk about the difference between garden variety narcissism and the diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder, the difference between grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism, what to do with if you’re married to a narcissist, how to identify your own narcissism, and what he calls the CPR method for narcissism control.\nWhere to find Keith Campbell online: \nWebsite: https://wkeithcampbell.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/wkeithcampbell\nBook Mentioned:\nThe Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age of Entitlement by Jean M.
