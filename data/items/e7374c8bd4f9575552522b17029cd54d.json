This podcast is a coproduction of the Joe Rogan Experience and the Skeptic Tank. We talked about marijuana edibles, coming out of the closet (neither of us had the guts to do it ourselves on this podcast), the caveman diet, Bobcat Goldthwait, and our stewardess. Pretend like you're the oil refinery guy sitting next to me and listen in on our whole conversation. It's like you're there with us in coach.</span></p>",
