  "description": "<p>Pooja Bavishi knew she wanted to be in the dessert business, but she never envisioned herself as an ice cream entrepreneur. Then one year, during her annual Friendsgiving celebration, she broke out an ice cream maker her parents had given her and made two ice creams: ginger and star anise. Her friends raved and Pooja knew it was her a-ha moment. Fast forward: Pooja’s Malai ice cream is a growing brand with national distribution through Goldbelly and its own scoop shop in Brooklyn. Malai specializes in global flavors with a twist, many of which celebrate Pooja’s Indian heritage, such as Pumpkin Garam Masala Crumble, Jaggery with Tamarind Caramel, and Sweet Roti & Ghee. Tune in to hear all about Pooja’s cool journey. </p><p>Thank you to Sonos for supporting Radio Cherry Bombe. </p>\n",
