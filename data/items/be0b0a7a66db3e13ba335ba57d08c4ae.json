  "description": "<p>I'M IN MY LAST WEEK OF MY 20'S. This week feels particularly special to me, as I say goodbye to my 20s and hello to my 30s, and I wanted to honor that here on the podcast. So what did I do? I sat down and wrote out every single thing that I could remember about my 20s, broken down into years 20-29. And WHOA. What incredible exercise that was! It felt so healing and so reflective to look back at my 20's and to be present with all of the lessons I learned that I'll be taking with me into my thirties. I'M PUMPED!</p>",
