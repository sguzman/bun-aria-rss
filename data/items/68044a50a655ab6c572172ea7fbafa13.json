It&#8217;s obvious that negative emotions probably won&#8217;t work, but many think being super emotionally positive might work best. But the data science says a more even keel is most effective</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can make better life decisions. Big Data can help you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Marriage</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Marriage might be the most important life decision a person makes</li>\n<li>People have been trying to figure out how to make a good match for thousands of years</li>\n<li>There are now massive datasets to use in answering this question</li>\n<li>Common attributes looked at include demographics, attractiveness, sexual tastes, interests and hobbies, mental health, values, etc.</li>\n<li>Analysis of all this data turned out to say that you couldn&#8217;t much from it; there weren&#8217;t any big factors that predicted romantic success</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s easy to predict what people will like, but not what will be a good match</li>\n<li>They looked a lot at dating data and found that certain things were true on dating sites</li>\n<li>Attractive people got more responses</li>\n<li>Tall men, but not tall women</li>\n<li>Race was unfortunately a major factor in who responded to who</li>\n<li>Black females responded least to Black males of all races</li>\n<li>Income had the biggest response effect for males</li>\n<li>After income the occupation mattered a lot as well</li>\n<li>Sexy names mattered a lot</li>\n<li><strong>The biggest predictor for success with a given person was the answer to:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Were you satisfied with your life before you met Sally?</li>\n<li>Were you free from depression before you met Sally?</li>\n<li>Did you have a positive affect before you met Sally?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>These mattered more than anything about Sally. The effect was four times stronger than all the traits of the partner combined.</strong></li>\n<li>His summary of the analysis:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the dating market, people compete ferociously for mates with qualities that do not increase one&#8217;s chances of romantic happiness.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>REMARKABLE!</li>\n<li>Most likely best mates: someone satisfied with life, secure in themselves, who constantly tries to better themselves</li>\n<li>WOW</li>\n<li>After looking at all the data the best thing they could say was that if you&#8217;re happy now you&#8217;re more likely to be happy later</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Parenting</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>TLDR: Parenting matters way less than people think</li>\n<li>Genetics matter most, and way more than parenting</li>\n<li>When you raise biological kids apart, they tend to reach the same levels of success</li>\n<li>When you raise adopted kids together they tend to have different levels of success based on their genes</li>\n<li>Breastfeeding, TV exposure, and lots of other popsci factors didn&#8217;t have much impact</li>\n<li>Including being bilingual</li>\n<li>But there is one thing that has a massive impact! NEIGHBORHOOD!</li>\n<li>A major study looked at siblings who moved as kids to see how much neighborhoods mattered for good outcomes</li>\n<li>By looking at kids that moved you could control for things outside of the neighborhood</li>\n<li>The best places for increases in adult income were: Seattle, Minneappolis, Salt Lake City, Reading, and Madison</li>\n<li>But it wasn&#8217;t just city; it was neighborhood</li>\n<li>They found three major predictors for neighborhoods doing well (the people raised there do well)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Percent of residents who graduated college</li>\n<li>Percent of two-parent households</li>\n<li>The percent of people who return their census forms</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>So, educated parents who are in a stable family who care about being good citizens</strong></li>\n<li>Role models also mattered, e.g., seeing female inventors and Black fathers in the neighborhood</li>\n<li>So the adults you expose your kids to really matter</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Athletic success</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Many sports come down to mostly genes, but some more than others</li>\n<li>Every inch of height nearly doubles one&#8217;s chances of being in the NBA</li>\n<li>So a man under 6 feet tall has a 1 in 1.2 million chance while someone over 7 feet has a 1/7 chance</li>\n<li>There are also body types for sports. Phelps has freakishly long arms and freakishly short legs, for example</li>\n<li>Twin studies help differentiate this as well, by how many twins are in a given sport</li>\n<li>He found that NBA ability was 75% nature</li>\n<li>He found that football and baseball were 25% nature</li>\n<li>Highest were Olympic Track and Field, Olympic Wrestlers, Olympic Rowers, and NBA</li>\n<li>Lowest were Baseball, Football, Shooters, Cyclists, Fencers, etc</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Who&#8217;s Rich in America?</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rich people own stuff</li>\n<li>Only 20% of the top .1% of earners make most of their money from wages; the rest own businesses</li>\n<li>The top businesses with the most millionaires:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Lessors of real estate</li>\n<li>Activities related to real estate</li>\n<li>Other financial investments</li>\n<li>Independent artists, writers, and performers</li>\n<li>Durable goods wholesalers</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get rich checklist:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Do I have a business</li>\n<li>How do I avoid ruthless price competition?</li>\n<li>How do I avoid getting dominated by a behemoth?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Grinding to success</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A 60-year-old startup founder has a 3x higher chance of creating a valuable business than a 30-year-old</li>\n<li>Average age of successful tech startup founder is 42.3 years</li>\n<li>Outsiders are said to have an advantage from unique perspective, but it&#8217;s the insiders that normally win</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Counter-counterintuitive Ideas</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There&#8217;s a lot of wisdom that was considered accepted, then got turned on its head, and has again been shown to be true</li>\n<li>The most successful employees actually found the most successful firms</li>\n<li>NBA players are most likely to come from middle-class, two-parent backgrounds</li>\n<li>Jokes are most looked for when people are happy, not sad</li>\n<li>IQ advantage doesn&#8217;t level off at a certain point</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Hacking luck</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Everyone gets opportunities, and luck</li>\n<li>The question is how you manage and maximize that luck</li>\n<li>The art world is a great example, where you can be X good at art but you will basically have no chance of being seen unless you&#8217;re hustling to get your stuff in galleries and shows</li>\n<li>The Mona Lisa become popular due to a fluke, not because it was special</li>\n<li>Once the artist becomes successful, it magnifies the value of all their art</li>\n<li>People like Dylan and Springsteen and Picasso have something in common: they produced a massive amount of content</li>\n<li>More content is more chances to get lucky</li>\n<li>More chances to start a snowball</li>\n<li>You can use the Picasso dynamic for dating as well</li>\n<li>Unattractive men going after attractive women have low odds, but if you simply make lots of attempts you will get responses. Same as Picasso</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Nerd Makeovers</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pictures of people and how competent they look is a powerful predictor of who wins elections</li>\n<li>The more competent picture person won in 72% of elections by one analysis</li>\n<li>Same with military careers and faces that appeared more &#8220;dominant&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Change your life by leaving your couch</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We misjudge what makes us happy</li>\n<li>There&#8217;s a difference between how bad pain is during a prolonged event vs. how we remember it</li>\n<li>An app called Mapiness pinged users throughout the day and asked them:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What are you doing (different activities)</li>\n<li>How are you with?</li>\n<li>HOw do you feel from 1 to 100?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They collected this for multiple years and had over 3 million measurements from over 60,000 people for 40 activities</li>\n<li>Sex made people happiness</li>\n<li>Theater/Dance/Concert was next</li>\n<li>Exhibition/Museum/Library</li>\n<li>Sports/Running/Exercise</li>\n<li>Gardening</li>\n<li>Singing/Performing</li>\n<li>Talking/Chatting/Socializing</li>\n<li>Bird/NatureWatching</li>\n<li>Walking/Hiking</li>\n<li>Hunting/Fishing</li>\n<li>Drinking</li>\n<li>Hobbies/Arts/Crafts</li>\n<li>Meditation/Relaxation</li>\n<li>Watching sports</li>\n<li>Playing with kids</li>\n<li><p>Playing with pets</p></li>\n<li><p>From the bottom</p></li>\n<li>Sick in bed</li>\n<li>Work/Study</li>\n<li>Queueing</li>\n<li>Finances/Organization</li>\n<li>Meetings/Seminars/Classes</li>\n<li>Commuting</li>\n<li>Housework/Chores</li>\n<li>Texting/Social Media</li>\n<li><p>Browsing the Internet</p></li>\n<li><p>Notably, reading was only 26.
