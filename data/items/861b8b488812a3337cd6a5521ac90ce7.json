  "description": "It’s a Thanksgiving miracle when longtime DDFP pal, Panthers WR Steve Smith, calls into Studio 66 to talk about his place among the game’s best receivers, what he talks about with cornerbacks who cover him, the Panthers’ rise, the best QBs he’s ever played with, Cam Newton’s new maturity & Kobe’s new deal. Adam Rank, Handsome Hank, ‘Around The League’s Dan Hanzus & producer Black Tie all pay a visit to make picks for Week 13 and to throw their pies in the ring for the second annual #DDFP Pie-Off. A delicious time was had by all.
