  "description": "<p>What if greatness isn't about what you accomplish, but how you serve? Some 50 years ago, in February 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a sermon entitled <a href=\"http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_the_drum_major_instinct/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Drum Major Instinct</a>. It invites people to redefine greatness as service, while at the same time recognizing the very human instinct for attention and praise and inviting it to harness it for something bigger. That's what we're talking about in today's riff.</p><p>And, in our Good Life Science Update, we dive into a fascinating analysis of studies that reveal something stunning about over-the-counter pain medicine like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Turns out, they don't just dull physical pain, they also may well dull emotions and thinking, too.&nbsp;And, as always, here's a direct citation - [<em>Ratner et al.</em>&nbsp;Can Over-the-Counter Pain Medications Influence Our Thoughts and Emotions?&nbsp;<em>Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences</em>, 2018].</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;<strong>Sparketype</strong>&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sparketype.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
