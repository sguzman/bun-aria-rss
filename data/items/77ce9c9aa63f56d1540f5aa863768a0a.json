  "description": "<p>This month showed how much inflation concerns and an uptick in bond yields can mess with a portfolio. It showed the vulnerability of high flying investments such as bitcoin and ARK as well as how a 60/40 portfolio can have both the 60 and the 40 go down together. So yeah, inflation is a big deal. But is it real or just another head fake?</p><p>On this week's episode of Trillions we speak with Jim Bianco, president and founder of Bianco Research LLC, on why he's taking inflation more seriously this time and what a 60/40 investor can do. He also talks ARK ETFs and its haters, bitcoin's potential and why the retail day trader is here to stay even post-pandemic. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
