  "description": "<p>It was an honor to sit down with one of the greatest rappers of all time and a hometown hero from our area, Styles P of the iconic LOX. We also had the pleasure of speaking with the business mind behind the Styles family, booming health business, author, and entrepreneur Adjua Styles. The couple are owners of the Jucies for Life juice bar chains which has four locations in New York, and Farmacy for Life, which is an online market for plant-based health remedies. Our conversation with the power couple focused around health, entrepreneurship, mental health, being business partners with your spouse, the music business, gentrification, politics, and more. #health #stylesp #thelox EYL University: https://www.eyluniversity.com EYL University 40% Off Annual Tuition Code: EYL Guest IG: @stylesp @adjuastyles --- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a> Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support\">https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
