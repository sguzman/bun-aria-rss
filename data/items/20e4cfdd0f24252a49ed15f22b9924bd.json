He’s attempting some damage control, but in between meetings with his staff, Nixon signs a new&nbsp;bill&nbsp;into law – the Educational Amendments of 1972. He isn’t aware of it at the time, but Title IX of this law will change women’s sports forever. The&nbsp;bill’s passage comes after years of campaigning, and the most prominent face of this movement is one of the great athletes of her era:&nbsp;Billie Jean King. Today,&nbsp;Billie Jean King sits down with&nbsp;<em>Sports History This Week</em>&nbsp;to unpack her role in this monumental legislation. How did she use her platform to fight for gender equality in athletics? And after the passage of Title IX, how did she literally battle for women everywhere?</p><br><p> Special thanks to our guests: Billie Jean King, a champion of tennis and of equality, and Susan Ware, historian and author of <em>Game, Set, Match: Billie Jean King and the Revolution in Women's Sports</em>.</p><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
