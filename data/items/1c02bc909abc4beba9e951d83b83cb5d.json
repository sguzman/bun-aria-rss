  "description": "The God of the Bible is infinitely demanding and infinitely merciful. Jesus said, \"Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect,\" and he taught us to think of that Father as a good shepherd willing to lay down his life for his sheep. Our spiritual lives get off the rails when we exclusively emphasize one or the other of these dimensions. God hates sin--but he relentlessly, passionately runs after us sinners, eager to draw us back into friendship with him.",
