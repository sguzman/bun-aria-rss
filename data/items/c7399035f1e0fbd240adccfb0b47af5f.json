  "description": "<p>The CDC definition of a parasite is: an organism that lives on or in a host and gets its food from or at the expense of its host. They&rsquo;re not necessarily out there to completely destroy you- at least not immediately. Instead they want you to go on living your life, so that they can leach as much as they can while they get fat and happy, hopefully without you even noticing. And that&rsquo;s exactly how we feel about crappy financial products except they&rsquo;re not feasting on your blood, they&rsquo;re feasting on your dollars. Their ability to thrive comes at your expense and it&rsquo;s abundantly clear that these crappy financial products don&rsquo;t have your best interest in mind. So today we&rsquo;re going to run through a number of the worst culprits out there, why they&rsquo;re the worst, and then what you can do in order to make sure that you avoid getting fleeced.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Wrigley Fields Forever by Good Word Brewing!
