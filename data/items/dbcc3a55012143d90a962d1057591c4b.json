  "description": "<p><p>The Kirk Minihane Show today announces the First Annual Kirk Minihane Ice Fishing Expedition. That's right, we're going to Madawaska, Maine, and all the Minifans and Mincels are invited. Now that Minihane wants to do a show about movies, we sample some of the other movie podcasts so he can get a sense of the competition. The parody songwriters were inspired by tales of Steve Robinson animal murdering exploits. Minihane shakes out some beef with Blind Mike. Violence at the Browns game and cheating with the Astros. WEEI puts out a video that none of us can explain. Plus, Minihane's interview with Adrienne, the mother of a trans child. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
