  "description": "Did you know that the tool you may be missing in your parenting toolbox is … singing? Don’t worry, no musical training or ability necessary! Music is one of the most powerful parenting tools for tricky moments. Why? When we sing, we not only help our child's body regulate, but we help ourselves stay grounded, too. Plus when we sing a song to our kids … our kids start to repeat it to themselves. This is how kids learn to self-soothe. Total game changer. In this week's episode, Dr. Becky talks with actors, singers, and producers Kristen Bell and Jackie Tohn about using music to diffuse all kinds of challenging situations—from moments of hesitation to hurtful words. Listen to learn a few tunes anyone can sing and get a sneak preview of Do, Re & Mi, a new musical series on Amazon Prime Video from Bell and Tohn.\n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
