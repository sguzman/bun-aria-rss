We all face adversity in many different ways; challenging events and circumstances are as much a part of modern existence as they were a part of human history.&nbsp;In this session, I discuss how this&nbsp;pain, which is very&nbsp;real, is a sign that there’s something going on in your life that needs to be addressed: you are in a state of disequilibrium. It’s not a sign of a defective brain. The brain is going through a process of reordering and reorganization in response to an experience because the brain responds to the mind. I will teach you how to identify these warning signs, how to address them, and how to begin healing.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>SPECIAL OFFERS FROM OUR SPONSORS:</p>\n<p>-<strong>Blinkist (One of my favorite ways to build my brain and read more):&nbsp;</strong>To get your free week on&nbsp;Blinkist<strong> </strong>AND 25% off your subscription, see: <a href=\"http://trk.klclick2.com/ls/click?upn=MmY-2FnptVtHRyKtjJtU1ebYGB2b0MH6ZDAiQvYe2VFPVDier3c20njxeoBjFALPivAHf0VRiaLg6kMH6sgTVImFoIVg-2BS6smq09RqS6ae0ojyWPPa6Gy5NOT0jUBBVXCaUe8w0it0dy4JgvYYDBLdc4Nzb7jnS8TP7mUKCBDXZPHkQeosb-2FdAOmEDif9DY2oUzZ6XFDD-2Bi3Md-2Bw4XJuh8pWHd3dy3wOcxaw2F7DH4mkg-3DkTEh_Ax-2FA2qB5XxIif0IVCV8oUyjHrcnlzjXWS7Y2GCv6POzseLtuqe0H-2FcSpDYs3C97YgpAAdPDsMI0A-2B6-2F8TslxOvq9jFwij60hLTpTGj92k-2B3uoe-2FJkQoT-2BfP3nqOKIy3PVrNqQeHI2yMtebygL7ReXD1-2BDBiDGSuR9ATDWl4K0RXTC8LRY-2BYayW1YQBcwQtuZFvgAJfF0M9LVSUNVonqQ-2B-2FHI-2BzrxmwcsfIGnD7Re1d6LslplYx2gt4jjUE3ak9rbZduFA0B1E9ifbwlzxgn-2F7dOoQjHVld9B5af3RT-2FcycnyEhmfc3W52rRfcR72DzhIa-2FOf7xwPTAIn2qnzTM1X5JrKY1MNIJ0fZk1iaiZ94-2BX38FIe2QHUPQK-2FQiftQhBkjUh5qHTAoDbL4lDkH9X9jg-3D-3D\">&nbsp;https://www.blinkist.com/nc/partners/cleaning-up-the-mental-mess</a></p>\n<p>-<strong>Kettle & Fire (My favorite organic bone broths, which are full of nutrients that can improve brain and mental health!):&nbsp;</strong>To get up to 25% off your&nbsp;Kettle & Fire&nbsp;bone broth order and free shipping see: <a href=\"https://offers.kettleandfire.com/drleaf-q42020/?utm_campaign=drleaf-q42020&utm_medium=paid_sponsor&utm_source=podcast&utm_content=all-skus\">kettleandfire.com/drleaf</a> or use code DRLEAF at checkout.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:</p>\n<p>-Get my new brain detox app SWITCH on sale now!
