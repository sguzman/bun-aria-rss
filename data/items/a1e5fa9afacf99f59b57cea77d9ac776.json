  "description": "<p>“Tracy never went away. So yes, you can say I'm bringing her back, but the culture kept her in circulation in a way that was really interesting to me, and at times a little alienating. It’s like you create a character and, suddenly, she's played brilliantly by Reese Witherspoon, and in a sense, that becomes the public's image of the character — and I love that performance as much as anybody. But then Tracy got picked up by political journalists and by the internet as a kind of shorthand for an overly ambitious woman… In a sense she became a kind of touchstone and a shorthand and sometimes a bit of a stereotype, caricature, whatever.”</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/tracy-flick-cant-win-tom-perrotta/1140156313?ean=9781501144066\"> <em>Tracy Flick Can’t Win</em></a> is the first time Tom Perrotta (<em>Election</em>, <em>Little Children, The Leftovers, Mrs. Fletcher</em>) has revisited a character from one of his bestselling novels, and his timing couldn’t be better.
