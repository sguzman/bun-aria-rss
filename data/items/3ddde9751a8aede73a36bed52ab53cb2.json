So it makes sense to turn our focus toward how those natural language queries can be used by Wolfram&#8217;s expanding technology stack. </p>\n<p>Going forward, as the official voice of Wolfram, the <a href=\"http://blog.wolfram.com\">Wolfram Blog</a> will be the go-to place for timely news and information, introductions to new features, Q&#038;As with users, and much more. </p>\n<p>You will still have the opportunity to browse archived posts here, but for new content, be sure to <a href=\"http://blog.wolfram.com/feed/\">subscribe to the Wolfram Blog</a>. </p>\n"
