  "description": "<p>The THERAPY EPISODE! We ain't goin nowhere! As many of you know, there has been quite some drama between the duo of Whoreible Decisions. This episode they decide to sit with a certified therapist to work out their issues. Communication is so big and can be the downfall of any relationship and from this session, Weezy and Mandii both face their biggest downfalls when it comes to effectively communicating with each other. Coming from two sides of the same coin, Weezy and Mandii go on an emotional roller coaster to see if Whoreible Decisions can keep going. We want to thank Chris Morrow, A-King, the Loudspeakers Network, and Dr. Maya Pettiford for taking the time to help Weezy and I solve our differences. Again, this episode may be hard to get through, but as many minorities, we don't take our mental health into consideration nor have we considered seeking therapy. This episode could change the way you look at therapy and possibly how you choose to communicate with loved ones.
