  "description": "Blow It Up\nEach one of us has a mission in life and we spend time meticulously constructing a plan to fulfill this mission. However, did you know that it's highly likely for our plans to fail? In this episode, the guys talk about the importance of focusing on the mission and never losing sight of it even if our plans fail.\n“There is the mission and then there’s the plan. Many of us get paralyzed because we focus on the plan. The plan paralyzes you. The mission moves you. The mission has momentum. As long as you are about the mission, you will keep moving forward whether or not the plans change.”\n\nListener Perks \n\nORGANIFI is giving our listeners up to 20% off of their order!
