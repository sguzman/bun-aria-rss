  "description": "<p>My guest this week is Tim Dillon. Tim is a great comedian with an incredible story. This is from his Twitter: \"I'll be honest about my shit. I spent time in crack houses and I got into drugs; I started doing blow at 13 and was a closet homosexual; my mom is schizophrenic. That's why I'm like this. Now I want to know why everyone else is like that.\" What else needs to be said? Tim has plenty more! He's a ripe HoneyDew. I really enjoyed talking with him.</p> <p><a href=\"http://TheHoneyDewPodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">http://TheHoneyDewPodcast.com</a></p>",
