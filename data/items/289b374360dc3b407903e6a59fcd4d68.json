Representing hundreds of sports and activity organisations, including the FA, ECB & RFU, many are now fighting for their own survival following a series of lockdowns and tiered restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Millions of pounds worth of funding has been allocated to help the sports and recreation sector, but for many it's not enough while some grassroots and community sports clubs might not even know it's available to access.</p><br><p>It's Lisa Wainwright's job as CEO to work with and lobby government and then spread the word. And she's doing all this, months after shielding in her own home during lockdown, following months of treatment for cancer.</p><br><p>In an informative and inspirational episode, Lisa talks about everything  - from cash to coming out and from discrimination to distributing cash. This is Great British Bosses from Anything but Footy - the series where we hear from the men and women running British sport and the key roles they have in many of our lives.
