  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Federal Judge Timothy Kelly, has ruled, from the bench, a 14 day temporary restraining order that the White House give back Jim Acosta's hard press pass until due process can be afforded to him. The Court did not discuss the validity of CNN's first amendment claims, however the court does not allow media in the courtroom and we the American people have no idea exactly what took place in that courtroom. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia would not release a public transcript of today’s ruling on Acosta’s press pass unless we paid for each page of the document, filled out an extensive application, and got the approval of the court’s office. Freedom of the press, except when it comes to the federal judiciary. Also, there is no requirement for the President to even hold a press conference or much less to call on certain reporter. We don't need a jerk in a black robe to tell us that this isn't constitutional, we know that because this is a clear violation of the separation of powers. What we're witnessing here is judicial tyranny and all they care about is themselves. Later, Robert Mueller has submitted written questions to President Trump and he has easily answered them reiterating that there was no collusion and there should never have been an investigation or witch hunt as he calls it. Then, election recounts in Georgia and Florida seem to be unchanged despite the effort of the Democrats to change the results. Meddling by the press, posting election projections before all precincts are counted is irresponsible; the press has a responsibility to report news for the people not for their own evil maniacal interests.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
