  "description": "<p>Christa is a PhD student at UC Santa Cruz, researching endangered species and the stressors on ecosystems that lead to extinction events. She schools me on everything from evolutionary theory to the fascinating worlds of viruses and bacteria to what it's like to hang from tall trees in Madagascar.
