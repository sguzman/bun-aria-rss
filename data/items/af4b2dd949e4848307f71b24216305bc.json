  "title": "Johnny Depp & Amber Heard Defamation Lawsuits",
  "description": "<p>Johnny Depp and Amber Heard married in 2015 but just a year later, Amber filed for divorce and got a temporary restraining order against him, accusing him of being physically and verbally abusive. Luckily, they reached a divorce settlement but the harmony didn’t last long. Just two years later in 2018, Amber wrote an Op-Ed for the Washington Post about her experience as a victim of abuse. Though Amber never mentioned Johnny specifically, many thought the article was about him and just a year later, Johnny sued Amber for defamation for $50M. Amber then countersued Johnny for $100M. Now, the details of their personal lives are being exposed to the entire world. But what are these lawsuits really about and who is likely to win? Tune in to hear Alexa and Nicole break it all down.<br/><br/>Patreon: <a href='https://www.patreon.com/legallyjudgy'>https://www.patreon.com/legallyjudgy</a><br/>LinkTree: <a href='https://linktr.ee/legallyjudgy'>https://linktr.ee/legallyjudgy<br/></a>Instagram: <a href='https://www.instagram.com/legallyjudgy/?hl=en'>https://www.instagram.com/legallyjudgy/?hl=en</a><br/>Twitter: <a href='https://twitter.com/LegallyJudgy'>https://twitter.com/LegallyJudgy</a><br/><br/>Intro Song:<br/>Trick or Treat (instrumental) by RYYZN <a href='https://soundcloud.com/ryyzn'>https://soundcloud.com/ryyzn</a><br/>Creative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0<br/>Free Download / Stream: <a href='https://bit.ly/l_trick-or-treat'>https://bit.ly/l_trick-or-treat</a><br/>Music promoted by Audio Library <a href='https://youtu.be/uNPXJ9CDzbc'>https://youtu.be/uNPXJ9CDzbc</a><br/><br/>Outro Song:<br/>Sundown Drive by Ghostrifter Official<br/><a href='https://soundcloud.com/ghostrifter-official'>https://soundcloud.com/ghostrifter-official</a><br/>Creative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported — CC BY-SA 3.0<br/>Free Download / Stream: <a href='https://bit.ly/-sundown-drive'>https://bit.ly/-sundown-drive</a><br/>Music promoted by Audio Library <a href='https://youtu.be/2H-uKkyJzSs'>https://youtu.be/2H-uKkyJzSs</a></p>\n",
