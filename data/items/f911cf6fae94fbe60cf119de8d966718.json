  "description": "Joanna and David didn't want to talk about Facebook, but they had to: Facebook launched a new digital currency, Libra, that could upend the way we pay for things. With the help of WSJ reporter AnnaMaria Andriotis, Joanna and David pick apart what that means for normal people. Next they chat with WSJ reporter Sarah Needleman, who recently wrote a profile of Tim Sweeney, chief executive at Epic Games, the company that created \"Fortnite\" and changed gaming forever. In this week's Today I Learned, David explains the strange world of waterproofing standards. Last, David interviews Kyle Wiens, the CEO of iFixit, about the so-called \"Right to Repair\" movement, and why there's a war over who gets to fix your gadgets.",
