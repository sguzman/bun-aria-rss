  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, many people are very upset after Obama flouted every COVID safety guidelines to throw himself a giant birthday party. But I think there are some important lessons we can take from this, which go beyond simple outrage. I’ll explain today.

And the media claims that children’s hospitals are filling up with COVID patients. Is that even remotely true? Plus, a prison inmate gets 25 years for beating a child rapist to death. If you already feel like that sentence is grossly unfair, wait until you hear the rest of the story.
