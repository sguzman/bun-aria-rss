  "description": "<p>In Part 1 of Abortion: The Body Politic, we explore the current state of abortion access. Katie Couric visits who abortion clinics that straddle the Missouri-Illinois border. They are only 15 minutes but &mdash; because of Missouri&rsquo;s state-imposed restrictions &mdash;&nbsp;worlds apart. We also find out what types of abortion are available today, how people access them, and what it is like to&nbsp; get an abortion in today&rsquo;s charged climate. We hear from abortion fund organizers, doctors in restrictive and progressive states, and people from all over the country, many of whom are already living in a post-<em>Roe</em> world. We also find out what is at stake for the upcoming Supreme Court decision that is expected to reverse the landmark 1973 decision that guaranteed the right to a safe and legal abortion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>More information on this episode&rsquo;s guests and resources:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Organizations:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/\">Guttmacher Institute</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arc-southeast.org/\">ARC Southeast</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://prh.org/\">Physicians for Reproductive Health</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wetestify.org/\">We Testify</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.advocatesforyouth.org/\">Advocates for Youth</a></p>\n<p><strong>Books and more:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Youre-Only-One-Ive-Told/dp/1641603631\">You&rsquo;re the Only One I&rsquo;ve Told: The Stories Behind Abortion</a>, by Dr. Meera Shah&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Abortion-Law-America-Wade-Present/dp/1108498280\">Abortion and the Law in America: Roe v.
