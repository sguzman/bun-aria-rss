  "description": "<p>r/Idontworkherelady OP works at a pizza delivery place, and one day he gets a rather unusual call from a customer who ordered a large cheese pizza. He shows up at the customers house with the pie, but for some bizarre reason they refuse to pay for it, so he just leaves. A week later 2 cops show up and drag him to the police station where they interrogate him over his involvement in a massive criminal conspiracy. They keep accusing OP of trafficking drug money, but OP is like, \"Dude, I was just there to deliver a pizza.\"</p>\n",
