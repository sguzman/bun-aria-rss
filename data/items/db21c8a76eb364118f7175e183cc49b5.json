  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the progressive movement is the application of Marxism to American society. Progressive intellectual John Dewey once wrote at great length about how well Stalin was doing with government-run education. Dewy felt that teaching subjects without a social purpose uniting children in support of their government. Dewey enjoyed the support of Democrats and Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt. The goal of the progressives has always been to control what is taught in the classroom and this is why small children are being indoctrinated against capitalism and success and to reject the family structure they come from. This is precisely what is taking place in our country today. Then, President Biden says that when your kids are in the classroom they're no longer your kids, in effect, suggesting that they now belong to the government and the teacher's union. Millions from the American Rescue plan went to schools for Critical Race Theory training in the name of the COVID pandemic. Kudos to all the parents and other citizens standing up against tyranny. Later, Sec. Mayorkas has proposed a 'disinformation governance board' at the Dept. of Homeland Security. All members of the free press should object to the creation of a government ministry of truth that decides what is true and what is false. All of this while the border remains open, and the economy shrinks by 1.4%. Afterward, filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza joins the show to discuss his latest film 2000 Mules which chronicles the actions of ballot mules delivering harvested ballots to COVID ballot boxes during the 2020 election. D'Souza explained how vote stash-houses work within leftwing democrat districts.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
