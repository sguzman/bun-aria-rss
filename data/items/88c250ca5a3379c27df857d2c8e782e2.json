  "title": "Celebrating Netflix’s High On The Hog with Dr. Jessica B. Harris, Karis Jagger, and Fabienne Toback",
  "description": "Today marks the debut of a groundbreaking Netflix series based on Dr. Jessica B. Harris’s book, 'High on the Hog: A Culinary Journey from Africa to America.' Published 10 years ago, the book was optioned by Karis Jagger and Fabienne Toback, two friends who could see Dr. Harris’s story about African American food culture, traditions, and ingredients living beyond the printed page. The result is the four-part 'High on the Hog,' which takes viewers on an emotional and lushly visual journey from Benin in West Africa to cities and counties across the United States. Dr. Harris, a historian, retired professor, and author of more than a dozen books joins us to talk about 'High on the Hog' and what it means to see her work both transformed and celebrated. In the second half of the show, we’re joined by the executive producers of the show, Karis Jagger and Fabienne Toback of Hey Sistah. ",
