  "description": "The Wild West Hackin’ Fest is a unique security conference. Not only because it&#039;s held in South Dakota and not only because of the Wild West visual vibe - but also because of the emphasis it puts on diversity and lowering the entry barriers for people who wish to join the world of information security. Eliad Kimhy talks to John Stand, one of the conference&#039;s founders.",
