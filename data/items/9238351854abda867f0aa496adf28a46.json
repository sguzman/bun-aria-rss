  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Mick Mulvaney is now being accused of confirming a quid pro quo in today's press conference. Mulvaney made it clear that what the President did was completely legitimate. Mulvaney's \"admission\" that the United States requested the cooperation of other nations to root-out corruption was perfectly legal. There was no demand for an investigation because there was already an ongoing public investigation about the 2016 server and other foreign governments that assisted the Democrats and Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. However, Jon Karl from ABC News describes this as a quid pro quo despite the lack of a \"this for that\" exchange. There was no digging up of \"dirt\" it was a request to find out what happened. The Democrats will stop at nothing to drive their own narrative to protect Biden and smear Trump as a villain. The reality is that there is no need to run for the hills, face the bullies because Trump and Mulvaney have done nothing wrong. Getting to the bottom of the 2016 election is important because corrupt Ukrainians tried to help to elect Hillary Clinton by making false claims about Trump's fitness in 2016 and maligning his advisors, according to Politico's report on January 11th of 2017. Then, a message must be sent that we will not allow this abuse of power by the House of Representatives to become a precedent. Leader Mitch McConnell must address the nuclear option and demand the integrity of the impeachment process and any subsequent trial, the integrity of the Senate, and of the United States. Later, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposal for healthcare would cost 34 Trillion dollars according to the Congressional Budget Office. Afterward, there is a new undercover audio of CNN's Jeff Zucker from Project Veritas.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
