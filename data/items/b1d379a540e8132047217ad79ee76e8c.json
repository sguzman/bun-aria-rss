  "description": "<p>Legal practitioners often face a vast amount of documents. Lawyers, for\ninstance, search for appropriate precedents favorable to their clients, while\nthe number of legal precedents is ever-growing. Although legal search engines\ncan assist finding individual target documents and narrowing down the number of\ncandidates, retrieved information is often presented as unstructured text and\nusers have to examine each document thoroughly which could lead to information\noverloading. This also makes their statistical analysis challenging. Here, we\npresent an end-to-end information extraction (IE) system for legal documents.\nBy formulating IE as a generation task, our system can be easily applied to\nvarious tasks without domain-specific engineering effort. The experimental\nresults of four IE tasks on Korean precedents shows that our IE system can\nachieve competent scores (-2.3 on average) compared to the rule-based baseline\nwith as few as 50 training examples per task and higher score (+5.4 on average)\nwith 200 examples. Finally, our statistical analysis on two case\ncategories--drunk driving and fraud--with 35k precedents reveals the resulting\nstructured information from our IE system faithfully reflects the macroscopic\nfeatures of Korean legal system.\n</p>",
