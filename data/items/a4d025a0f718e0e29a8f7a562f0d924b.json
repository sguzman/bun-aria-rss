Bill also orchestrates a Pokemon card opening for perhaps the last time ever. The Pod FOD covers various subjects like the preeminent candy bracket, what actor they would each want to have the career of in the last twenty years, Mitt expands on his theory that ghosts don't haunt drunk people, and a Montana man claims his son found a bullet in a bag of Flaming Hot Cheetos, plus much more.
