  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, WPHT Oost Rich Zeoli fills in for Mark. Smash and grab looters are robbing stores with impunity in big liberal cities across the US. Some professors have suggested that calling this activity \"looting\" is somehow racist, arguing that these crimes are being committed as an act of social justice (organized robbery) because the system failed urban communities of color. Then, Chris Cuomo has been suspended by CNN for new revelations from the New York State Attorney General that he used his influence as a TV host to gather information on the accusers of his brother, then-Governor Andrew Cuomo. This is just another example of how the media covers for Democrats. Later, Omicron hasn't even arrived in the U.S and the Governor of New York has already suspended elective surgeries. Anthony Fauci, the megalomaniac hero of the left, doubles down on the Omicron variant and claims that he represents \"science\" as he attacks Sen. Ted Cruz and Republicans in the process. Afterward, it could be the end of Roe v. Wade as the Supreme Court of the United States weighs a case that might seriously limit abortions. Finally, Miranda Devine joins the show to discuss her new book \"Laptop from Hell: Hunter Biden, Big Tech, and the Dirty Secrets the President Tried to Hide.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
