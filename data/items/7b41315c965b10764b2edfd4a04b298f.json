  "description": "We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.\nWe loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.\nShe married a man six months after meeting him. She loves him and his kids, BUT she's worried he may be starting to stray. So she wants our help testing him.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
