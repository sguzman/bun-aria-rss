  "description": "<p>Born and raised in Buffalo, NY, John Rzeznik is the founding-member, frontman and guitarist for iconic band, the Goo Goo Dolls. He's a legend in the world of music, with 19 top-ten singles, including mega-hits like Iris (which spent 12-months on the Billboard charts), Name, Black Balloon and countless others. And, like so many who turned to music at a young age as both a way to cope with discord and a form of expression, he’s lived a life of extraordinary artistry and contribution, and along with that, a certain amount of darkness and struggle that for many years found him turning to alcohol as a way to get through each day. Until it all fell apart, and he had to make a decision. One he keeps making every day.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, sober, a devoted dad and husband, he's telling a new story with his life and music, and taking the giant, global community of Goo Goo Doll fans along for the journey. And, as you’ll hear, he’s headed into the studio to create something that is truly representative not just of this moment in time, but also of how his lens on life, music, and creativity have evolved.</p><p>You can find John at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.googoodolls.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> : https://www.googoodolls.com/</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/johnrzeznikggd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> : https://www.instagram.com/johnrzeznikggd/</p><br><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
