  "description": "This week, the gals buckle down to discuss some grisly (and highly personal) murders and the unique motivations behind them. Topics include a family man who really should've counted his blessings, a piece of sh*t with one too many versions of events, and the many, many, many ways in which toxic masculinity affects everyone. Pour a massive glass of  Chop Shop Cabernet, check in on your neighbors, and tune in for Familicide. Â ",
