  "description": "<p>The Red Sox eliminated the Yankees from the postseason and it would appear that Kirk Minihane is actually upset (00:01:00). John Sterling, Yankees play by play announcer, has a tremendous call early in the game broadcast. Ozy Media has been exposed as a fraudulent media company and the story behind it is absolutely insane (00:13:20). Kirk and Mike think about death a lot (00:24:45). Sage Steele is taken off ESPN, which leads to a meaningless argument about her talent (00:28:40). Craig Carton is number one but hasn't created any buzz in radio (00:45:00). We catch up with Billboard Charts guy & much more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
