  "description": "<p>Roland writes “I live on Northern Ute tribe here in Utah. I have seen a lot of things being an outfitter and guide here for about 20 years I have had run-ins with Bigfoot and we did see one that we almost shot But I didn’t realize what it was until now. I have seen some strange things, I grew up 2 miles from Skin Walker Ranch”</p> <p>Roland returns to the show and shares strange events from his life. I was speaking to Roland last night and he said “As a kid I was playing next to Skinwalker Ranch and I think something followed me home.” The story that he shared next was disturbing. Roland will be sharing some of the more scary accounts living next to the ranch.</p>",
