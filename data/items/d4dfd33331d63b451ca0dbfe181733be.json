  "description": "<p>Route 66 was once known as the \"Main Street of America\" and is still affectionately referred to as the Mother Road. It's hard to believe this highway was once thriving with a host of businesses because now many of those businesses are closed and abandoned. One of these locations was The Diamonds, which started as a fruit stand, then became a restaurant and eventually a truck stop named the Tri-County Truck Stop that also had rooms to rent. The location is now closed and abandoned except for on certain nights when ghost hunts are offered. Many claim that this is the most haunted truck stop in the Midwest and perhaps even in the country. Join us as we explore the history and haunts of The Diamonds! The Moment in Oddity features two kings eating themselves to death and This Month in History features beer flowing again.</p> <p>Our sponsor for this episode is Wooga's June's Journey: The Lost Diaries Podcast.
