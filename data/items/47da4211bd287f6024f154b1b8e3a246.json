  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, NRA TV host Dan Bongino fills in for Mark. For decades Presidents on both sides of the aisle have kissed up to foreign leaders and nothing ever really changed. But today President Trump sat at the table and called out our NATO allies for supporting Russian aggression. Trump definitely plays by his own rules. He cares about results, not the structured rules of diplomacy and the media can’t accept this. He’s always under attack because of his Queens, NY bravado. New Yorkers from Queens don’t get the same respect as kids from Brooklyn and the Bronx, so you have to puff your chest a bit and prove that you're tough to earn respect. This is why his personality is always focused on the superlative tense. Then, liberalism sucks for liberals too. There is no popular mandate for liberal idiocy and their ignorance is what allows liberal ideology to thrive. There is no public mandate for liberalism so all they need to do is convince one judge, or politician in a black robe, and they get their legislation from the court. If Dems believed that Roe v. Wade was actually settled law they wouldn't be scared. If there was a popular mandate for any of their ideas they wouldn't use fear tactics. To think that any Supreme Court justice would reverse that decision is absurd. That's because there is a popular mandate for this unlike abortion which scares the Democrats.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
