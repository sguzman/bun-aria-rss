  "description": "<p>While we love our Basic Bitch Quickies, we've been a little \"Kardashianed\" and \"Amber Hearded\" out so this week our good friend Josh Lee (product and UX designer) joins us to turn the tables around and interview the basic and the brain! Since our inception we've shared loads about our thoughts on all things pop culture, but do ya'll really know us? Josh didn't think so, so he's getting on the mic and asking the hard questions in order to get us to share more about our lives and give our listeners and viewers a sneak peak into our day to day. Ever wonder where we're from, the origin of our names, our religious traumas, how we code switch and what our retirement plans are?
