  "description": "<p>Rodney Alcala - the Dating Game Killer.  Not as well known, but just as vicious as any other killer we've ever covered here. Between 1968 and 1979, Rodney brutally raped, tortured, and killed at least nine girls and women -  possibly over a hundred. His victims would literally be sexually tortured to death by the man they generally just thought wanted to take artsy pictures of them. Instead, he'd beat them, bite them, rape them, and strangle them until they were unconscious, and then bring them back for round after round of more sexual torture. And in the middle of his sadistic spree, he appeared on the popular TV show The Dating Game... and beat two other bachelors to win the episode's prize - a date with a single woman. She chose him. And almost immediately regretted it. The strange true crime tale of Rodney Alcala today, on Timesuck. </p><p><strong>Bad Magic Productions Monthly Patreon Donation</strong>:  The Bad Magic Charity for May is the HALO Dental Network.
