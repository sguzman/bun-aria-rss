  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, more people are now calling for the assassination of war criminal Vladimir Putin and perhaps one of his countrymen will rise to the challenge. There is still opposition to providing the Ukrainians with MIG-29 fighter jets. Air cover is important because it provides the necessary speed to back up troops on the ground. But, until President Biden does more, the Ukrainians will continue to get slaughtered. Then, the blame game is on, and fuel companies are the targets. Reducing the price of oil is as simple as increasing the supply. The federal government has taken trillions of dollars in wealth from the people as they have spent drunkenly and leveraged the future of our children and future generations. Yet they always focus their criticism on big oil and never on big government, the big teacher's unions, or the big climate industry (electric cars). Later, Biden hasn't united NATO, he's following them. His focus should be on deterrence, peace through strength. Biden should be arming Taiwan now, not waiting until China makes their inevitable next move. Biden sending \"defensive weapons\" like handguns and grenade launchers won't stop tanks and airplanes. Afterward, Biden says that everyone knows someone who's had their nude photographs posted online and moved to include this in the Violence against Women Act (VAWA). Congress is also focused on domestic issues like spending billions more on coronavirus. Finally, Congressman Michael Waltz calls in to discuss the latest from Capitol Hill where the Administration is willing to give billions to the Iranian regime but is holding back on Ukraine. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
