And then on Thursday, October 17, her husband Robert Desmond called in sick for her and told Amy’s employer that she would not be returning to work. He called back on Friday to ask for Amy’s supervisor’s email address, stating that she was not able to send an email herself. Later, when asked by police where his wife had gone, Robert Desmond told them that he had dropped her off at a train station and that he had not seen her since but this wasn’t the first time Amy had disappeared. She fell out of sight long before that fateful October day, when her abusive husband forced her to refuse contact with her family and friends. Now Amy was actually missing, and there is no evidence Amy chose to leave.</p><p>If you have any information about Amy’s disappearance, you can call the Billerca, Massachusetts Police Department at 978-671-0900.</p><p>If you would like to listen to more from Laura Richards, please check out <a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/real-crime-profile/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Real Crime Profile</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
