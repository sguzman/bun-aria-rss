Supporters of austerity claim the last decade of cuts is what enabled the government to put money into these schemes now. But is this true?\n\nSome of our public services were barely able to cope, even before the virus struck. And so what effect did austerity have on our pandemic preparedness? And now that we’re entering another recession, will the government turn to austerity once again?\n\nOn this episode Ayeisha looks at Covid-19, austerity, and how we can respond to this crisis differently with NEF senior economist, Frank van Lerven.\n\nIf you’re craving more chat about this, we’ll be following up this discussion in an online briefing over Zoom on Thursday 7 May.
