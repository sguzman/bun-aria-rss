  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, for over 100 years the democrats have controlled the bureaucracy, aggressively using progressivism to gain control inside of the government and the media. Today the corporations that own these newspapers and cable TV networks are to blame for not policing their industry to protect it. That’s how ridiculous propagandistic op-ed’s make the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post who suggest that America, our protests, and everything else are racist. This is a grave injustice. Despite not having a chance of ever winning states like New York, New Jersey, and California, President Trump has spent the majority of his time during the pandemic to ensure that these states had ventilators, field hospitals, beds, and other supplies — regardless of the failures of those governors. Meanwhile, in a swipe at Trump, former President George W. Bush called for national unity. Bush never called for unity when President Obama, James Comey, and other rouge FBI leaders tried to set up Trump. Then, the media continues to destroy Joe Biden's accuser and give him cover.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
