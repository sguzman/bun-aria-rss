  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss John Wesley (1703 - 1791) and the movement he was to lead and inspire.  As a student, he was mocked for approaching religion too methodically  and this jibe gave a name to the movement: Methodism.   Wesley took his ideas out across Britain wherever there was an appetite for Christian revival, preaching in the open, especially the new industrial areas.  Others spread Methodism too, such as George Whitefield, and the sheer energy of the movement led to splits within it, but it soon became a major force. \n\nWith \n\nStephen Plant\nDean and Runcie Fellow at Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge\n\nEryn White\nReader in Early Modern History at Aberystwyth University\n\nAnd \n\nWilliam Gibson\nProfessor of Ecclesiastical History at Oxford Brookes University and Director of the Oxford Centre for Methodism and Church History\n\nProduced by Simon Tillotson and Julia Johnson",
