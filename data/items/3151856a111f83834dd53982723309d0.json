  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Barack Obama gave a speech where he attacked President Trump and his supporters. Obama was very angry that Trump has reversed about 75 percent of the eight years of his presidency. Obama's anti-semitic policies have been reversed by Trump. Obama was weak on ISIS, China, and the border yet Trump has been strong on these issues. Obama is probably jealous that Putin is getting all the credit for interfering in the 2016 election that Obama was responsible for. Also, Obama says that “we went from great progressive change to periods of retrenchment\" suggesting that the target of progressivism is the US Constitution and our individual liberties. What the former president fails to understand is that the Constitution was designed to protect our liberties so that we can choose to grow, prosper, and evolve as we please because we are free to do so - not as the state decides. His ideas of collectivism are an attack on our individualism. We must not abandon American sovereignty. Later, Ted Cruz calls in to discuss the Supreme court nomination and his race against Beto O’Rourke, who’s running hard left. Finally, John Heubusch, executive director of the Reagan library, discusses his great new book - The Second Coming: A Thriller (The Shroud Series).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
