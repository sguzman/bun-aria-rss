Hunt. Eileen Hunt is a professor of political science and a political theorist whose scholarly interests cover modern political thought, feminism, the family, rights, ethics of technology, and philosophy and literature, from feminist, comparative, and international perspectives. She has taught at Notre Dame since 2001. Her first book  (2006) inspired her further research into Mary Wollstonecraft, and in-depth research into her daughter Mary Shelley’s political philosophy.",
