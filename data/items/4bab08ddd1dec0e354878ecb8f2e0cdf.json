  "description": "<p><b>For the second week of our Proverbs series, Raechel and Amanda talk with author, SRT devotional writer, and upstate New York’s newest resident, Lore Ferguson Wilbert. While studying proverbs focusing on the inner life, they talk about everything from Proverbs’ unique ability to be equally convicting, painful, and sweet, to the ideal temperature for a dark chocolate peanut butter cup. Together, they celebrate the truth that these proverbs repeatedly reveal: we serve a God whose work and power are far beyond our ability or understanding. When we recognize this, we too can live out the Wilbert family mantra—“fidelity to the Word of God and not to an outcome.” </b></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Read with Us: </b></p><p><b>This episode corresponds to Week 2 of the She Reads Truth Proverbs: Walking in Wisdom reading plan found on the </b><a href='http://t.ly/1JyqM'><b>She Reads Truth app</b></a><b> and </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/proverbs-3/'><b>SheReadsTruth.com.</b></a><b> </b></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Shop the Proverbs: Walking in Wisdom Reading Plan collection at </b><a href='https://www.shopshereadstruth.com/collections/proverbs'><b>ShopSheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b><br/>Show notes can be found at </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/podcast/proverbs-week-2-with-lore-wilbert/'><b>shereadstruth.com/podcast/proverbs-week-2-with-lore-wilbert/</b></a></p>",
