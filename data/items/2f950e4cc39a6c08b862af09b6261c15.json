  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, Mick Mulvaney's comments Thursday were perfectly fine, it’s a public fact that William Barr and John Durham are investigating the origins of Spygate as the Ukrainians helped Hillary Clinton allies research information against Trump. It doesn't matter if the President asked his counterparts in other governments to look into corruption, it's perfectly fine. The President's lawyers, Mulvaney, and the GOP do not need to man up. They need to stand up and use the truth that the Democrats also sent a letter signed by three Senators requesting the support of Ukraine in a DOJ investigation. Then, Hillary Clinton who was involved in both Russian collusion and Ukranian collusion is now claiming that one of the Presidential Democratic candidates running is a Russian asset. If Tulsi Gabbard is an asset of the Russians and if she is enamored with Bashar al Asad then so is Speaker Nancy Pelosi! Finally, Anthony Davenport calls in to discuss his book: Your Score: An Insider's Secrets to Understanding, Controlling, and Protecting Your Credit Score.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
