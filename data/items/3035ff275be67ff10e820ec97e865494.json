Watch The Full Performance: https://youtu.be/3VB24LYsE60\n\nLyrics\n\nBlood of my blood\nSkin of my skin\nYou're in roundelay water again\nI want to face the condition you're in\nThe old wrenches hardly turn me\nCan you catch a thrown line?\nTied around neat\nCircle once about, please allow me\nI see the pall coming off of our cheeks\nWe're weak but a leaf is turning\n\nAnd I move lightly in the dawn\nTry to, lightly ever on the lee\n\nThough I liked summer light on you\nIf we ride a winter-long wind\nWell time's not what I belong to\nAnd I'm not the season I'm in\n\nHolding on close\nHolding on to\nAny kind of ring I can bring you\nAnd at the beachwood pyre good news\nIt's wet but it's catching easy\n\nAnd I move slightly in the dawn\nTry to, gently ever on the lee\n\nThough I liked summer light on you\nIf we ride a winter-long wind\nWell time's not what I belong to\nAnd you're not the season you're in\n\n▶ Official Site: https://fleetfoxes.co\n▶ Facebook: https://facebook.com/FleetFoxes\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/fleetfoxes\n▶ Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3IEvCpy\n▶ Apple: https://apple.co/3dAI4s0\n▶ Store: https://fleetfoxes.ffm.to/officialstore\n\n#fleetfoxes #averylonelysolstice #antirecords",
