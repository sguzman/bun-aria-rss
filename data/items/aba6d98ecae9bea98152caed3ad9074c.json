But as sons are wont to do, Icarus ignored his father’s advice.</p><p>The rest is history. The heat indeed melted Icarus' wings, sending him into a deathly free fall collision with&nbsp;the sea which today bears his name, the&nbsp;Ikarian Sea&nbsp;near&nbsp;Ikaria — ironically one of the Blue Zones as described in <a href=\"http://www.richroll.com/podcast/danbuettner/\" target=\"_blank\">my recent podcast conversation with Dan Buettner.</a></p><p>As most know, this is an age-old remonstration about ambition. A tragic allegory about the perils of hubris, particularly when fueled by a sense of entitlement, and perhaps sprinkled with a light dusting of denial.</p><p>These are all very human traits of course. And if today's guest is anything, he is quite human indeed.</p><p>Tom Hardin was a highly motivated young guy with a big bright future and Wall Street aspirations. After graduating from the prestigious Wharton School of Business, he was on track to achieve his dream when he landed in the fast paced hedge fund world and&nbsp;quickly rose through the ranks.</p><p>But it wasn’t long before Tom felt he was falling behind – lacking that mysterious competitive ‘edge’ so many others seemed to freely enjoy (without repercussion) to their reward in untold millions.</p><p>What was that edge? If you ask Tom, he will tell you the not so secret to success within the insular hedge fund world meant having a network of inside&nbsp;sources willing to share reliable confidential information about companies they worked for or with.</p><p>Everybody's doing it. Nobody's getting caught. I'm falling behind.</p><p>Then one day Tom got a call from an investor colleague named <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/magazine/can-a-stock-trader-turned-convict-start-a-new-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">Roomy Khan</a> – a&nbsp;woman with&nbsp;some pretty juicy insider tips.</p><p>The timing was right. Tom was primed. And that fateful moment arose. That moment when you make a decision to take a very small step over a very important line. A decision you simply cannot undo.
