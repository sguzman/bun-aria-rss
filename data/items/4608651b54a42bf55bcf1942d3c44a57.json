  "description": "Jalen & Jacoby tackle a host of serious topics on an unusually newsy Thursday: Robert Sarver is selling the Suns, Ime Udoka is set to be suspended by the Celtics violations of organizational guidelines, and Brett Favre appears to have helped steal money from the most vulnerable people Mississippi, and funneled it to... his daughter's volleyball arena? And that's just the first 12 minutes of the show! We haven't even gotten to Waffle Wings, a recounting of 36 torrid hours in Buffalo, or proper soap/shower gel and wash cloth etiquette, yet! \nLearn more about your ad choices.
