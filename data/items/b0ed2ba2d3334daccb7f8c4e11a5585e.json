  "description": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is fighting the coronavirus – and the free market – with taxpayer-funded, prisoner-made hand sanitizer. But Rep. Ayanna Pressley isn’t cool with it. President Trump’s relief plan may be his best idea ever: pause the payroll tax! Michigan is up for grabs in the 2020 race, and Bernie Sanders may lose badly to Joe Biden. But while Tulsi Gabbard is the opposite of an old white man, Democrats still ignore her. In today’s coronavirus update, deaths are way lower than the swine flu and the CDC recommends that people 60 years or older stay home – or DOES it? And today’s profile in courage celebrates Steve Jobs’ billionaire widow, Laurene Powell, who dared to say it’s wrong to accumulate too much wealth.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
