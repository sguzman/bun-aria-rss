  "description": "<p>This past (very long) year, Dr. Sanjay Gupta has been immersed in all things COVID-19, as CNN’s Chief Medical Correspondent reporting on the front lines of this novel virus. “All I think about is COVID,” he told Katie, “Viral transmission, how people evaluate risk, social behavior. There’s no part of our society that hasn’t been touched in some way.” But Sanjay is also a neuroscientist and in addition to his on-air work and a daily podcast (Coronavirus: Fact vs Fiction), Sanjay has somehow found the time to write a new book called “Keep Sharp: Building a Better Brain at Any Age,” which is out now. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie and Sanjay talk about how to keep the brain healthy with tips you can use right now to protect and improve your brain. But Katie starts the conversation by asking the COVID about the status of the pandemic and if we’re truly out of the woods. </p><p><strong>Find out more from this episode</strong></p><p><strong>Read:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Keep-Sharp/Sanjay-Gupta/9781501166730\">Keep Sharp: Building a Better Brain at Any Age</a>, by Dr. Sanjay Gupta</p><p><a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780805073690\">Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers, The Acclaimed Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping</a>, by Robert M.
