  "description": "<p>Have you ever been to a Broadway show? It&rsquo;s amazing- whether you&rsquo;re drawn to the storyline, the music, the costumes- but of course the cast is pivotal. And for any major theatrical production, not only are there the performers you see on stage, but there are also countless understudies. The backup cast members who learn all the lines, and know exactly what to do in case one of the performers gets sick or can&rsquo;t perform. They&rsquo;re preparing for the worst. We think of prepping for a recession in a similar way. We don&rsquo;t know exactly when it&rsquo;s going to happen. In fact, we hope that we don&rsquo;t experience one anytime soon! But when it does, you&rsquo;re going to be able to weather that storm much better if you take the proper precautions ahead of time. And with more talk of a recession on the horizon, we figured now was a great time to discuss what you should be doing. We&rsquo;re going to get granular on this one and give specific steps that you should take in order to be prepared whether we enter recession territory later this year, or if it takes an entire decade! Either way, you&rsquo;re going to be ready.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed an Altbairisch Dunkel by Ayinger!
