Wildfires have swept across the grasslands and farmers are worried about how they’ll make it through the growing season. Randy Uhrmacher is in his tractor, planting corn and soybeans in central Nebraska. But it’s hard to see his work. The soil is so dry that clouds of dust hang in the air as he drives through his fields. “Not sure how I’m supposed to see what I’m doing tonight,” Uhrmacher said on a recent night of planting.</p>\n<p>Even turning on the windshield wipers didn’t help him see through the dust storm. If he didn’t use soil conservation practices like reduced tillage and cover crops, he said his fields could look like something out of the 1930s Dust Bowl. It’s the driest spring Uhrmacher can remember in his 38 years of farming. Drought is a challenge many farmers and ranchers are facing in the middle of the country.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/great-plains-drought-farmers/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=scifri\" target=\"_blank\">Read the rest on sciencefriday.com.<br><br></a></p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>When Climate Change Reaches Your Plate</h2>\n<p>No matter how you slice it, climate change will alter what we eat in the future. Today, just 13 crops provide 80% of people’s energy intake worldwide, and about half of our calories come from wheat, maize and rice. Yet some of these crops may not grow well in the higher temperatures, unpredictable rainfall and extreme weather events caused by climate change. Already, drought, heat waves and flash floods are damaging crops around the world.</p>\n<p>“We must diversify our food basket,” says Festo Massawe. He’s executive director of Future Food Beacon Malaysia, a group at the University of Nottingham Malaysia campus in Semenyih that studies the impact of climate change on food security.</p>\n<p>That goes beyond what we eat to how we grow it. The trick will be investing in every possible solution: breeding crops so they’re more climate resilient, genetically engineering foods in the lab and studying crops that we just don’t know enough about, says ecologist Samuel Pironon of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London. To feed a growing population in a rapidly changing world, food scientists are exploring many possible avenues, while thinking about how to be environmentally friendly.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/climate-change-food-diet/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=scifri\" target=\"_blank\">Read the rest on sciencefriday.com.<br><br></a></em></p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Transcripts for each segment will be available the week after the show airs on </em><a href=\"https://www.sciencefriday.com/episodes/may-20-2022/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=scifri\" target=\"_blank\"><span><em>sciencefriday.com</em></span></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p> </p>",
