  "description": "Episode 20 I sat down with Osher Gunsberg (@osher_gunsberg), celebrity Australian TV host, who shares his story and in particular his battle with mental illness & addiction. You may also know him as Andy G or Andrew G which he previously went by.\n\nWith the gift of the gab, blonde locks and contagious smile it would seem Osher was always destined to entertain or find his way into the world of television but just how did a kid with anxiety end up hosting live TV in front of millions of viewers? What toll did that take on his mental and physical health and what learnings does he have to share? Well, that's exactly what this episode is all about. Osher came over to my place in Bondi and we had a really open and honest conversation over a Turmeric Latte (haha) about what he went through behind the scenes including some terrible lows as well as some hugely positive learnings and life-changing experiences. The timing of this episode is absolutely perfect with Osher's book 'Back after the Break' launching next week. If you are an Australian and know Osher I think this episode will give you insight into the actual man behind the man the microphone that you have seen on TV for so many years. If you are from overseas, I'm sure you will still find this episode tremendously interesting with many take-home messages.\n\nIn this episode we cover:\n\nWhere Osher grew up & what his childhood was like\n\nWhat drew him towards a career in Television & radio which ultimately saw him hosting some of the most viewed shows ever in Australia (Australian Idol, The Bachelor)\n\nWhen alcohol crept into his life & how it became a problem\n\nHow he has learned to deal with Mental illness (paranoia, OCD, anxiety etc)\n\nHow he has handled alcohol addiction\n\nHis battle with weight, why he went vegan & how he ended up on the cover of Men's Health\n\nmuch much more\n\n\nOh, I forgot to mention Osher is vegan and has been for essentially over a decade...and he's hugely entertaining, so naturally, so as a good host should I let him do a lot of the talking! Also, Osher kindly had me on his show a little while back - if you haven't listened to that episode you can here.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
