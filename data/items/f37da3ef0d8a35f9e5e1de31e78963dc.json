  "description": "In this episode, I describe the science of how and why pain arises in the body and brain, and how we can actively control our experience of pain. I discuss inflammation, stress, acupuncture, limb damage and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). I review protocols that leverage the lymphatic and nervous system to accelerate pain relief and healing in a variety of situations. Other topics discussed include how heat versus cold impacts neurons and wounds, red-light, sunlight, stem cells and more. \nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction/Avenues for Support\n(00:04:58) Deliberate Unlearning\n(00:06:43) Pain, Injury and Regeneration\n(00:09:17) A System of Touch (Somatosensation)\n(00:11:42) Pain and Injury are Dissociable\n(00:15:19) Objective versus Subjective Control of Experience\n(00:16:15) Plasticity of Perception\n(00:16:41) Lack of Pain Is Self-Destructive; So Is Excessive Pain\n(00:18:42) Homoculous, Ratonculous, Dogunculus\n(00:19:05) “Sensitivity” explained\n(00:21:30) Inflammation\n(00:22:24) Phantom Limb Pain\n(00:24:00) Top-down Relief of Pain by Vision\n(00:26:41) From Deaf to Hearing Sounds\n(00:28:10) Pain Is In The Mind & Body\n(00:29:44) Recovering Movement Faster After Injury\n(00:35:00) Don’t Over Compensate\n(00:37:34) Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing\n(00:40:49) The Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance\n(00:43:05) Body Position & Angle During Sleep\n(00:44:30) Types of Exercise For Restoring & Maintaining Brain Health\n(00:47:33) Ambulance Cells in The Brain\n(00:49:20) True Pain Control by Belief and Context\n(00:51:45) Romantic Love and Pain\n(00:55:05) Dopaminergic Control of Pain\n(00:57:15) Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment\n(01:07:32) Vagus Activation and Autonomic Control of Pain\n(01:08:30) Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead and DHT\n(01:11:40) Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing\n(01:14:53) Protocols For Accelerating Tissue Repair & Managing Pain\n(01:17:55) Ice Is Not Always Nice (For Pain and Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.\n(01:22:02) Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight\n(01:26:10) Glymphatics and Sleep\n(01:26:29) Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP: Shams, Shoulds and Should Nots\n(01:31:38) Young Blood: Actual Science\n(01:35:44) Synthesis, Support & Resources\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
