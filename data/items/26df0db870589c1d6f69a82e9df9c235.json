  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 4/22/22",
  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, in Ohio, a group of billionaire investors backing a former partner of theirs, JD Vance, is trying to smear Josh Mandel who has been a mainstay in Ohio's conservative Tea Party movement. Mandel, a combat veteran, and former State Treasurer is now unfairly being trashed as a RINO by his opposition. This is a smear campaign against a rock-solid patriotic American supported by Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, General Flynn, and Mark Levin. Then, even a thug with a low IQ can understand that the free market is not a free market if one business receives advantages that others do not. Therefore, Disney's special status should never have been in perpetuity even if it was an incentive when they were first enacted in 1967. Colorado governor Jared Polis supports the war on children, opposes the protection of parents and children's rights in Florida, the ending of Disney's special status, and supports late-term abortion. Later, the radical far-left climate activists told us we'd die if we didn't change our climate. Well, now President Biden announced that the U.S military vehicles will become 100% climate-friendly sustainable vehicles. This is from the president who has destroyed women's sports, devalued our currency, and killed millennials through unchecked Fentanyl at our southern border. Vladimir Putin is negotiating our energy policy with Iran. America's enemies could not have asked for a better ally in the Oval Office. Afterward, Peter Schweizer joins the show to discuss new information regarding how Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo's husband's company has a majority investment, and hence their fortune, from a Chinese firm linked to the Chinese government. Schweizer speculates that Hunter Biden will be indicted on tax evasion and possibly money laundering charges and be given a sentence of less than one year if found guilty. Finally, former McDonald's CEO Ed Rensi joins the show to explain how the Job Creators Network and his group fight woke corporatism. Rensi explains how the founders warned of the tyranny of the minority and how we've arrived there today. Rensi is advocating removing social issues from corporate governance and restoring the commitment to the investors.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
