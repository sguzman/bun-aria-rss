  "title": "Top 5 Backfield Battles and a Heated RB Strategy Debate! (06/30 Fantasy Football Podcast)",
  "description": "The rookie RB class has given us a lot of intriguing backfield battles. Today we'll put the spotlight on five of them as we see which way our listeners are leaning and which way our analysts are leaning in each backfield, starting with KC (4:26). Does Damien Williams have better value than Clyde Edwards-Helaire? ... We move on to the Rams (16:00) and Bucs (23:30) backfields. Are we going with the veterans or the rookies? Do we even want anything to do with TB? And then on to the Lions (30:00) and Bills (36:30). Kerryon Johnson's ADP is pretty appealing. Is Devin Singletary underrated? Why does Jamey love Zack Moss' value? ... An unexpected strategy debate breaks out (45:30)! How should you value a RB who you don't expect to contribute much early in the season, but could be a league-winner late in the season? We'll give some different perspectives on this topic ...
