  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin show, the media freak out over Sean Hannity’s relationship with Michael Cohen is a sideshow. It’s a distraction from the real news of the day - the James Comey, Hillary Clinton collusion. Comey executed a coverup for Hillary during the 2016 election. Why did Comey have his news conference in July 2016? Because Comey thought he was protecting Hillary. Without the help from Comey she could have easily been indicted. The Democrat Party nominated a candidate who was under investigation by the FBI, and Comey wanted to clear her of anything before she won. Also, Comey’s interview with ABC gave remarkable insight into his relationship with Barack Obama. It’s clear that Comey supported Obama and opposed Trump, when the FBI director is supposed to stay out of politics. He was always in the tank for the Obama administration and what he hoped was going to be a Hillary administration. James Kallstrom, former FBI Assistant Director, calls in to explain why Comey should have never been FBI director. Later, preventing the spread of chemical weapons is in our best national interest. The Democrats keep saying that Trump going into Syria is unconstitutional because he never went to Congress for approval. Congress can’t even meet deadlines for a budget. Trump needs to hit Syria and time is of the essence and he can’t go to Congress for them to take days to debate it. The media and democrat judges should take note - this president sent American missiles into Syria to protect Muslims. So far, Trump has handled foreign policy beautifully.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
