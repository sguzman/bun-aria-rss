  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! Special thanks to Brain, Jeff, Kenny, Craig, and Steve for all the great questions. On today's show, I open up by breaking down the small-cap biotech sector. Jeff provides listeners with a perfect example of a biotech stock fighting for FDA approval. I've seen this happen too many times... From the pre-clinical stages... all the way through the approval process... these companies undertake extreme volatility. Step-by-step, I explain the lengthy process every small-cap biotech company must endure. In addition, I tell listeners exactly when it's the best time to place their bets on these types of investments. Then, after revisiting my position on Northern Dynasty (NAK), I dive into a very important lesson... Stop-loss orders. This is an investment tool every investor must use in order to prevent large portfolio deficits. I often warn investors to not \"show their hand\"... Tune in to hear what I mean. Finally, to end the episode, I dive into another sector that has just about topped-out. With interest rates going higher, I tell listeners why I'm avoiding this market going forward. Other stocks mentioned include: Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK), Amgen (AMGN), & TherapeuticsMD (TXMD) Thanks for listening, Frank Curzio",
