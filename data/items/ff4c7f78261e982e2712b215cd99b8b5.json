  "description": "<p>WHERE MY MOMS AT!? It's the show by the Moms for the Moms. Hosted by everybody's favorite \"cool mom\" Christina P! Not only the most REAL show for moms, but the most interactive. An open place to admit no one really knows what they're doing.</p><p>Pinky Patel is a mom, comedian, and content creator with over 5 million followers on TikTok. Today, she joins Christina P in her goth room to talk about what it’s like being all of these things. She also explains code switching, her experience with dirty chat rooms, and how she met her husband (did you know Napster had a chat function?). Christina and Pinky bond over getting suspended on TikTok and discuss the problem with the Kardashians while offering up some bits of mom wisdom along the way. Focus with a “P” and enjoy the conversation.</p><p>Christina P. wants to hear from you since she is seriously lacking in cool mom friends. If you want to share a \"Pazsitzky Effect\" or \"Mom Hack\" please call into our voicemail (213)375-5184 and let Christina know! We want to talk to as many moms across America as we can.</p><p><a href=\"mailto:WhereMyMomsAt@gmail.com\">WhereMyMomsAt@gmail.com</a><br />(213) 375-5184</p><p><a href=\"https://christinaponline.com/tour-dates\">https://christinaponline.com/tour-dates</a><br /><a href=\"https://store.ymhstudios.com/\">https://store.ymhstudios.com/</a></p>\n",
