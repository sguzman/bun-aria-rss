  "description": "<p>My first guest tonight is Jay. As you listen to tonight’s show take note of the apparent tool use that was reported by the witness. Jay who reported seeing a Sasquatch for almost 45min from his hunting blind, witnessed Sasquatch using a rock to bang on trees and listening for small animals. He also watched the creature use a stick to dig for grubs or smaller insects to eat. Jay’s encounter like others you hear on the show are a major contrast to people who will tell you that Sasquatch has special powers like cloaking and mind speaking. He witnessed what he thought was a bear that ended up being a Sasquatch. The animal got up from sleeping, grabbed a rock and banged on a tree then pushed the tree over to retrieve either a possum or a raccoon. It then smashed the small animal into the tree in order to kill it. The Sasquatch took a bite of the small animal and tore the skin off before consuming it. Jay says “I thought it was an escaped ape from the zoo but as I sat and watched it from my hunting blind, I realized this was no escaped ape from the zoo this was something different…it was man-like but it wasn’t a man…I have never seen anything like this before…”</p> <p>My second guest tonight is Kim who is from Washington State. Imagine moving into a property and while out enjoying the country air, sitting on your porch you see a large ape-like creature running on two legs, crossing right in front of you. The area where the encounter took place has a long history of sightings. I am planning to visit the property to take a look around. When I do I will report back.</p>",
