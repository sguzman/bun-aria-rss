  "title": "How MSCHF went viral with Lil Nas X Satan Shoes",
  "description": "MSCHF, the company behind the infamous Lil Nas X Satan Shoes (you know, the ones that incited a lawsuit from Nike) knows a thing or two about going viral. MSCHF is a counterculture art collective that releases its products exclusively via drops, almost all of which go viral instantly. From Birkenstock shoes made out of cut up Birkin bags, to a laptop loaded with malware programs, MSCHF knows no bounds.\nGoing viral might be the cheapest, most effective marketing tool...but it usually happens by accident, and sometimes not for good reason. Today, Daniel Greenberg, founding team member and CRO of MSCHF, joins us to explain how MSCHF has mastered going viral on purpose and why it embraces the bad publicity as much as the good. He'll break down the importance of evoking a reaction, why there's a story behind each drop, and how MSCHF engages with its competitors.",
