  "description": "<p><p>Chaps and Kate join Cons and Bren at Barstool HQ for a good' ol platoon room pow-wow. The show starts out with an important discussion about the Navy Chaplain who got fired for slanging some dick outside of a New Orleans bar. Chaps tells a story about his grandfather that will make your jaw drop. We take questions from the mailbag about things you wish you brought with you overseas, doin duty, and getting caught not knowing how to reassemble your weapon!Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
