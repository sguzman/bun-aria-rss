  "description": "We are honored to have Brit Barron with us on the podcast this week! Brit Barron is an author, anti-racism activist, pastor and public speaker who is dedicated to having honest conversations.  As a person of color, Brit grew up in predominately white spaces, and as a part of the American Evangelical church.  On today’s podcast we got the opportunity to reflect with Brit on the events of the past few weeks including George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter Movement.  Brit gives a poignant view of racism in America, the racial blindspot of the Evangelical church, practical steps for those who want to know more about historical context of racism in America and the truth that unless it’s personal to each of us, real change will not happen.  \n\nIn addition to her thoughtful and wise comments., Brit released an “Understanding Racism 101 Guide” to help us all become anti-racist.
