  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys debut a new theme song, and try to start a year in review, but don't get very far. Todd also explains how he ruined Christmas for his family, and he rereads his IMDB review for Holmes and Watson which found itself on the front page of Reddit. They also cover some news stories including Baba Vanga making some of her yearly predictions, a Kentucky man being arrested for throwing ham at a relative during a Christmas dispute, and a Wisconsin man being arrested for throwing a beer at a bartender for changing out Black Sabbath for Christmas music. Todd wants to know what everyone would choose if they got to pick New Years resolutions for all of the United States that were punishable by death if people didn't follow. The guys also answer some listener questions including what their top 3 drinking holidays outside of New Years are, and what game shows they would like to be on. As is tradition, they each send in some Friday Bangerz to help catapult you into the weekend. It's good to be back. Come have a good time with us.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode includes @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @VivalaZito, @evanfoxy, and @baileymccomas.</p>\n",
