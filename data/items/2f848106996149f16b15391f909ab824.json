  "description": "Radar visualizations for technological choices have been pioneered by ThoughtWorks. In the meantime, many organizations have created their own tech radars to map out which technologies should be considered for use by members of the organization.\nThe German online fashion retailer Zalando has even made the source code of their tech radar publicly available. Since technological decisions for data science and AI projects are distinct from conventional applications, I decided to adapt Zalando&rsquo;s tech radar."
