  "description": "Mental Health issues are not on the rise- rather it is the mismanagement of mental health that is increasing. \nIn this episode I discuss why the current mental health system is failing to help people, and what we can do about this. I also discuss psychotropic medication, and how fo find healing if you struggle with mental ill-health. This is the second podcast in my Perfect You series. \n**This is informative and NOT individual medical advice.\n**DRUG WITHDRAWAL should ALWAYS be done under the supervision of a qualified professional. These drugs alter your brain chemistry, and withdrawal can be a difficult process. There are thousands of patient-run sites on withdrawal from psychoactive substances on the Internet, and many books available in stores and online. We suggest you begin looking at the resources page on Mad in America. Dr. Peter Breggin also has a brilliant book on withdrawal: https://breggin.com/a-guide-for-prescribers-therapists-patients-and-their-families/\n**For general information on the current state of psychiatry please visit http://www.madinamerica.com. \n**To report any adverse psychotropic drug effects you have experienced, and for more detailed individual drug information, please visit https://rxisk.org/\nAdditional Resources:\nhttps://drleaf.com/blog/\nhttp://podcast.drleaf.com/e/episode-37-the-dangers-of-psychotropic-medications-with-dr-peter-breggin/  \nhttps://breggin.com\nThe SWITCH app is coming to iTunes and Google Play early 2019!!\nFor more info on my new app SWITCH go to: https://theswitch.app. get 30% off a year subscription when you pre-order today: http://theswitch.app/promo/\n**Sign up for my weekly newsletter to get even more tips, updates, specials, and more: https://drleaf.com\n \n About the Mental Health Initiative and January Perfect You Book Club:\nI am making 2019 the year of mental health!
