She talked about putting together that piece, and her own experiences in the fashion world with Molly Fischer, the host of Gimlet's newest podcast The Cut on Tuesdays. In this extended cut of their conversation, Wagner talks to Fischer about who has all the power in fashion, how hard it is to get your foot in the door, and the time one of her bosses asked her if her parents had been in slavery.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
