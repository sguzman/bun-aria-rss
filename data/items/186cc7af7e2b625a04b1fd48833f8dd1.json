  "description": "One of the most influential self-development books written, Carnegie explains principles that can make you more influential. The book is broken down into sections detailing how to be a better leader and how to make you more likeable. The book also includes examples from historical figures as well as examples from its application in business as well as life in general. There is a reason why this book is so revered. The book has a simple message that is laid on in a way that makes it easy for the reader to read and comprehend. I found myself continually highlighting and taking notes while reading and I suggest potential readers do the same. It is a book that you can regularly revisit to refresh the ideas in the book and serve as some personal inspiration. This book has the potential to help a lot of people. I rate this book five stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
