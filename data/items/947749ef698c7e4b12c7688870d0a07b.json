  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Vladimir Putin is a thuggish, Klansman-like, KGB operative that destroys his opponents, and anti-Jewish American Marxist 'neo-con' critics are his lapdogs. President Biden has created a disaster in Afghanistan, a disaster at our southern border, and a disaster in Ukraine. There are many ignoramuses saying that this is not Russia's fault. They claim that we shouldn't send our sons and daughters to die, of course, that argument can be made for any conflict our voluntary military faces. If that were the case, then why did we form NATO and why do we have such a big military spread throughout the world in the first place? Then, leaders must make tough choices, especially during wartime. Lincoln always opposed slavery and eventually gained the support of Frederick Douglass, but he had to suspend habeas corpus to keep this country together. George Washington fought the British and lost many battles before winning them. Yet, tyrants like Justin Trudeau and Putin are not leaders like these, they abuse authority for political power. Later, New York district attorneys pursuing a case against Donald Trump have resigned and this might derail their weak witch hunt of Trump's former CFO. Meanwhile, Sen. Mitch McConnell thinks that Biden's call to appoint a Black woman to SCOTUS was appropriate. Afterward, Adam Laxalt, candidate for the US Senate from Nevada, joins the show to discuss his campaign.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
