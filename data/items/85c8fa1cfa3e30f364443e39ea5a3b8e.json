  "description": "<p>Robert Smalls! He was born a slave in Beaufort, South Carolina  in 1839. Then he'd pull off a daring sea-faring escape to the Union during the Civil War, then become the first black captain for the Union, then becoming a member of the US House of Representatives. He would die in the house he was born in - his former slave master's - a house he bought after the Civil War. His story is one of perseverance and grit - of refusing to quit no mater how the odds are stacked against you. After his story, I share my current state of mind as I reflect back on the kind of year 2021 was, and then look forward to 2022. Thanks for the ride, meatsacks! <br /><br />Hail Nimrod! <br /><br />Thanks one last time for allowing the 2021 Bad Magic Giving Tree to be such a success! We raised $49,000 through a combination of Patreon, fan, and personal donation. And now 198 children are going to receive the presents they would have otherwise never received. Nimrod is very fucking pleased. :)</p><p><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube:  </strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/wHlI9_qiQgE\"><strong>https://youtu.be/wHlI9_qiQgE</strong></a><br /><br /><strong>Merch - </strong><a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\"><strong>https://badmagicmerch.com/</strong></a><strong>  </strong><br /><br /><strong>Discord! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p><p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
