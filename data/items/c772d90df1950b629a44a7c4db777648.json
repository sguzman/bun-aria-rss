  "description": "<p>üí¨ Have you read this book?</p>\n<p>The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy</p>\n<p>Overall I enjoyed reading this book. I had many people recommending it to me and I also wanted to know more about the subject. The book starts off with explaining the differences between the conscious and the subconscious mind. From there the author explains across multiple chapters how we can explore the full potential of our subconscious mind. It was a bit repetitive but still holds some value. üëçüìö</p>\n<p>Thank you for listening.
