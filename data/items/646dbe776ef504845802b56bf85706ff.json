Everyone dies.</p><p>We accept these statements as fact.</p><p>But what if they're just stories based on history and our current understanding of biology?</p><p>What if everything we think we know about aging is about to change?</p><p>Across the globe, scientists are working on treatments and therapies that are designed to extend healthy human lifespans well beyond what we know today.</p><p>At the bleeding edge of such breakthroughs you will find&nbsp;<strong>David Sinclair, PhD</strong>,&nbsp;one of the world’s leading scientific authorities on longevity, aging and how to slow its effects.</p><p>Returning for his second appearance on the podcast, David is a professor in the Department of Genetics and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School. He obtained his Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics at the University of New South Wales, Sydney in 1995 and worked as a postdoctoral researcher&nbsp;at M.I.T. where, among other things, he co-discovered the cause of aging for yeast.</p><p>The co-founder of several biotechnology companies, David is also co-founder and co-chief editor of the journal&nbsp;Aging. His work has been featured in a variety of books, documentaries, and media, including&nbsp;<em>60 Minutes, Nightline</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>NOVA</em>. He is an inventor on 35 patents, has been lauded as one of the&nbsp;<em>Top 100 Australian Innovators</em>, and made&nbsp;<em>TIME</em>&nbsp;magazine’s list of the&nbsp;<em>100 most influential people in&nbsp;the world.</em></p><p>In addition, David is the author of&nbsp;<em>Lifespan: The Revolutionary Science of Why We Age -- and Why We Don't Have To</em>&nbsp;-- a&nbsp;<em>New York Times bestseller that</em>&nbsp;proposes a radical new theory of aging. As he writes: “Aging is a disease, and that disease is treatable.”</p><p>Last year I convened my first conversation with David (<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/david-sinclair-436/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RRP #436</a>), a scintillating and science-heavy primer on all things human lifespan, aging and longevity. It was a runaway hit with the listeners -- and left me wanting to know more.</p><p>So today we pick up where we last left off, diving deeper into the physiological mechanisms that contribute to biological degeneration. And we&nbsp;go further into the current state of research to better understand what contributes to aging and what can be done to counteract it.</p><p>Call him a dreamer, but David believes living to 200+ is a plausible reality. If you could double your lifespan, how would this impact how you choose to live? What would it mean for the future of humanity? And for the ecological stability of the planet? The implications are profound.</p><p>Equal parts philosophic and scientific, this conversation will forever change&nbsp;the way you think about why you age and what you can do about it. And it will leave you armed simple lifestyle practices you can deploy -- intermittent fasting, cold exposure, exercising with the right intensity, and eating less meat -- that will help you live younger and healthier for longer.</p><p>Brilliant and lovely, it’s an honor to once again share this man's wisdom with you today.
