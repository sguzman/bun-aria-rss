  "description": "<p>Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the health of the National Football League's business heading into the Feb. 2 Super Bowl between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs. Ratings are up this year and some of the major headwinds from two years ago (concussion concerns and the fight over political protests) have receded from the narrative. That comes at a perfect time for the league, which is currently re-negotiating its major TV contracts, which bring it more than $6.5 billion per year. Also talked about is the American Gaming Association's estimate that a record 26 million Americans will gamble on the Super Bowl, with a total of $6.8 billion wagered, both legally and illegally. Also discussed is Penn National's investment in Barstool Sports, which values the controversial digital media company at $450 million.  </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
