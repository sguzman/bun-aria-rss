  "description": "What is the future for the museum? In The Museum as a Space of Social Care (Routledge, 2020), Nuala Morse, a Lecturer in Museum Studies at the University of Leicester, rethinks the museum by foregrounding the importance of care, and though the framework of care thinking. Using a detailed ethnographic case study, the book explores participatory practice and community engagement, thinking through the rise of key professions within the museum, along with the auditing and management regimes shaping care by and in the museum. As cultural organisations re-emerge following the impact of the global pandemic, the book provides a starting point to reassess and reimagine the museum, and will be essential reading across arts, humanities, social sciences, and for cultural sector professionals.\nDave O'Brien is Chancellor's Fellow, Cultural and Creative Industries, at the University of Edinburgh's College of Art.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
