  "description": "<p>In times of uncertainty, our tendency is to hold tightly to everything we have. We want to feel safe and in control of the things we can control. But what if instead, we choose to let go, open our hands and pray prayers of surrender? What if God is calling us to trust Him more with everything?<br> <br> In this episode of the Proverbs 31 Ministries Podcast, author and pastor Craig Groeschel sits down with Kendra Schwarz and discusses a two-word prayer that can change everything: <em>Send me</em>. You'll find that praying \"send me\" might not mean you'll be sent to another physical location, but it always means you'll be nudged out of your comfort zone. <br> <br> You'll learn why when you pray dangerously, you can't live life the same.
