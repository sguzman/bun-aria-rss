  "title": "222 - General Butt Naked",
  "description": "<p>General Butt Naked aka Joshua Blahyi is a complicated figure. He is now a Liberian Christian missionary helping victims or Liberia's first civil war rebuild their lives. In the early 90s, he was one of Liberia's most brutal warlords. While literally naked, and often while wielding a machete, he led an army of coked-up, brainwashed child soldiers into committing almost unimaginable atrocities. He committed child sacrifices and regularly engaged in cannibalism. And there were others nearly as brutal as he was. Liberia in the 90s was basically hell on earth. It was a nation of sexual abuse and murder and corruption and chaos. How did things get so bad? Today we learn how Liberia was formed and how decades of oppression led to two incredible bloody civil wars. <br /><br />For our donation this month, <strong>we raised/donated over $41,000 for the Bad Magic Productions Giving Tree,</strong> and have bought eighty Cult of the Curious families presents for Christmas.
