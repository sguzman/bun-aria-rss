Black Chick Lit is a podcast Dani hosts with her friend Mollie, and the focus is books by and about Black women. Ice Planet Pod has different guests every week, and <a href=\"https://iceplanetpod.com/podcast/episode-12-barbarians-redemption-w-jen/\">Jen has been</a> on and Sarah will be on!</p><p class=\"\">Some of the specific Ice Planet Podcast episodes that Dani mentioned: she did one with <a href=\"http://iceplanetpod.com/podcast/episode-6-barbarians-mate-w-mollie-from-black-chick-lit/\">her friend Mollie from Black Chick Lit</a>, Jen talked about what would happen <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1257690693813886977?s=20\">if Wedding Magazines existed</a> on that world, and the <a href=\"http://iceplanetpod.com/podcast/episode-15-barbarians-tease-with-katrina-jackson/\">latest release was with author Katrina Jackson</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://techboomers.com/t/what-is-hoopla?scrlybrkr=3e58f160\">All about Hoopla</a> and the difference between <a href=\"https://create.piktochart.com/output/21155188-hoopla-vs-overdrive\">Hoopla vs Libby</a> (Overdrive). If your public library doesn't have Hoopla, it's probably becasue <a href=\"https://www.flls.org/ending-use-of-hoopla-faq/\">they can't afford it</a>.</p><p class=\"\">You, too, can have <a href=\"https://bananaphone.io/\">a banana phone</a>. Don't tell Sophie, but Sarah's definitely getting her one of these.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://ipb-universe.fandom.com/wiki/Sa-khui_Tribe\">In the Ice Planet books, the khui</a> is the magic thing that “resonates” to tell the two people that they are a destined to be together--it also allows these shipwrecked humans to survive the ice planet, and also to speak the same language.</p><p class=\"\">A couple of times, Dani mentioned “Harlow’s book, and the title of that one is <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dJ55br\">Barbarian Mine.</a></p><p class=\"\">Jen's friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/julieannablock\">Julie</a> was a little worried about Chuck Tingle being sad when he released <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34cAbFa\">Chuck Tingle Pounded in The Butt by a Knockoff Book that Glorifies a Deadly Tragedy and Doesn't Prove Love is Real Then Accepting This as a Sad Side Effect of Making Wider Positive Impact as an Author</a>, but the following week it was <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jdtxmA\">Mike Pence Pounded in the Butt by His Handsome Werefly</a>, so he’s probably fine.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jdtxmA\">Magic Mike XXL</a> is a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/07/magic-mike-gender-sex-politics-roundtable/397385/\">pure, beautiful movie about men and their feelings</a>. We highly recommend it.</p><p class=\"\">If you’re a fan of the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dK9zi6\">Stage Dive series</a>, there was a new novella that was released yesterday called <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dHAPOd\">Love Song</a>. It’s the book about Adam Dillon, a character that the band mentored in later books in the series.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://gen.medium.com/aita-reveals-americas-sexist-underbelly-4609aa56658d\">How the Reddit forum AITA (Am I the Asshole) reveals the sexism of everyday life.</a></p><p class=\"\">The two audiobook companies are <a href=\"https://tantor.com/\">Tantor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.brilliancepublishing.com/\">Brilliance</a>, but with the<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200104-audiobooks-the-rise-and-rise-of-the-books-you-dont-read\"> huge rise of popularity in audiobooks</a>, lots of audio in now <a href=\"https://authornews.penguinrandomhouse.com/behind-the-scenes-a-tour-of-penguin-random-houses-audio-studios/\">produced in house</a>.</p><p class=\"\">When it comes to the Ice Planet audio, Dani loves the two narrators <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/author/Holly-Jackson/B00E6KAK7I\">Hollie Jackson</a> and <a href=\"https://tantor.com/narrator/mason-lloyd.html\">Mason Lloyd</a>. The Ice Home series, a spin-off of the Ice Planet Barbarians Series, has two new narrators <a href=\"http://seancrisden.com/\">Sean Crisden</a>and <a href=\"https://www.erinmoonactor.com/about\">Felicity Munroe</a>. But Jen recently listened to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1314356368900583424?s=20\">a book narrated by Sean Crisden and it was awesome</a>. So we think you should give the Ice Home audio a try, Dani!</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.welcometonightvale.com/\">Welcome to Night Vale is a podcast</a> and also <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3keq9sY\">a book</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Books and Series We Mentioned: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/35g46f3\">Ice Planet Barbarians</a> by Ruby Dixon | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3o9H3v8\">Barbarian’s Mate</a> by Ruby Dixon | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3oc4iVe\">The Boyfriend Project</a> by Farrah Rochon | Grace Goodwin's <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IJQz7P\">Interstellar Bride Series</a> | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FOzF76\">Barbarian Mine</a> by Ruby Dixon | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3m6HioK\">A Heart of Blood and Ashes</a> by Milla Vane | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dJWa9H\">Sweet Ruin</a> by Kresley Cole | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3o7Gcel\">Lead </a>by Kylie Scott | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/37oFLq1\">Dreaming of You</a> by Lisa Kleypas | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ocZsHe\">Again the Magic</a> by Lisa Kleypas | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2HiV4G3\">Forbidden</a> by Beverly Jenkins | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ISHji5\">A Chance at Love</a> by Beverly Jenkins | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2HkbIF1\">The AI Who Loved Me</a> by Alyssa Cole | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3kbNFGV\">Brothers Sinster Series</a> by Courtney Milan | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2T8Uzkk\">Her Halloween Treat</a> by Tiffany Reisz | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dJ9w5Y\">Love All Year</a> a holiday anthology |<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FOAcWE\">Halloween Boo</a> by Sarah Spade | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FLAmxT\">A Winning Season</a> by Rochelle Alers | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dV8Wm5\">Hidden Legacy Series</a> by Ilona Andrews | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/31qA5bw\">Jack Reacher Series</a> by Lee Child | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dHtqyt\">Welcome to Night Vale</a> is a book <a href=\"http://www.welcometonightvale.com/\">based on the podcast</a> |</p>",
