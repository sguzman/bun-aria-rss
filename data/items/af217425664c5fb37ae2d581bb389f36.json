  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, the constitutional case for the 2020 election in Pennsylvania that was brought by Greg Teufel and Julie Levin scored a victory today in the state's Commonwealth Court. The court ruled that the practice of no-excuse mail-in ballots, put in place by Democrats right before the 2020 election was unconstitutional. This case was initially dismissed outright by the U.S Supreme Court despite being meritorious. Attorney Greg Teufel joins the show to discuss his big win for liberty. This is a real David versus Goliath story. The law Teufel challenged (Act 77) included expanded mail-in voting and absentee voting in a manner that was unconstitutional. Teufel argued that the doctrine of latches did not apply in this case and won. The case now heads to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for appeal. Then, as more and more officers are shot at by criminals, the widow of slain NYPD Officer Jason Rivera spoke at his funeral and called out the pro-crime progressive prosecutors that fail to keep people safe. Cops are human and they come in every race across this country. Later, George Soros is pumping more money into a new Political Action Committee that will be led by his son Alexander Soros. They will be supporting congressional Democrats and Democrat secretaries of state. While they fight to reverse gerrymandering the practice was created to ensure representation for African American voters, yet the Democrats use gerrymandering to ensure victories for Democrats who are usually White. Afterward, President Biden should be impeached from the office of President of the United States. The House must look into impeachment and/or the use of the 25th Amendment. The border crisis alone is enough for impeachment, but there are so many other issues.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
