  "description": "<p>Cemeteries have always carried a mystique about them and many people expect them to be haunted. For the most part, cemeteries are very peaceful places. After all, why would the dead want to hang out with the dead? Most haunted cemetery stories consist of an apparition returning to their plot or a hitchhiking ghost being dropped off outside of a cemetery. But Maltby Cemetery is different. Rumors of Satanism and thirteen steps to Hell have given this cemetery quite the reputation. Is it just a place where teenagers go to hang out and drink and act stupid or is there truth to the legends? Join us as we explore Maltby Cemetery! The Moment in Oddity features Crying Mary and This Day in History features the escape of Winnie Ruth Judd!</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p>",
