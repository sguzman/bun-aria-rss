We talk about the functions these books serve, both for the writer and the reader, and whether this book's recounting of Obama's early presidency squares with our experience with and memory of it a decade later (apologies to our listeners without a working knowledge of US politics, this one might be a little inaccessible). </p><p>Our theme music was composed by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://instagram.com/nicklerangis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Lerangis</a>.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
