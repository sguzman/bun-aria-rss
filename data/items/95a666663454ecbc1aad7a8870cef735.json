Brandon and his wife had recently separated, and Brandon was navigating this new territory. Brandon wanted to make his marriage work. He loved his wife and adored their daughters. On December 14th, Brandon’s wife called his parents to ask if they had seen or heard from him, but they had not. Brandon’s friend said Brandon was there when he left the house that day, but when he returned, Brandon was nowhere to be found. Brandon’s truck, phone, cigarettes, and jacket were left behind. Search and rescue responded and searched the area, but they never found any trace of Brandon Helms. The case went cold for several years until law enforcement decided to take a second look.
