  "description": "Our ears are sensitive, but we often don’t treat them that way. We are born with the ability to hear up to 20,000 Hz. As we age, our hearing range diminishes. On top of that, the more exposure we have to loud sounds, the greater the impact it has on our ability to hear. Find out what happens once we start to lose our hearing. Featuring Lindsay Prusick and Shaheem Sanchez (Instagram). \n20K is hosted by Dallas Taylor and made out of the studios of Defacto Sound. \nConsider supporting the show at donate.20k.org \nEpisode transcript, music, and credits can be found here: https://www.20k.org/episodes/hearingloss\nLearn more about your ad choices.
