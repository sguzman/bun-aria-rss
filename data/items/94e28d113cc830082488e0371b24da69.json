  "title": "Ep. 387 - Actress Insists She's Happy After Abortion, Nobody Is Fooled",
  "description": "An actress sent a series of tweets bragging about her abortion and claiming she's wonderfully happy now that her child is dead. But she's lying to herself, of course. Speaking of lying to yourself, the singer Lizzo went to an NBA game wearing a dress with a huge hole cut out at the butt. This is supposed to show her \"self-confidence,\" but it actually shows the opposite. And I respond to a few of the many, many emails I received from my show yesterday.\n\nCan't get enough of The Matt Walsh Show?
