  "description": "On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Dana Stevens is joined by Forrest Wickman, Sam Adams and Marissa Martinelli to discuss Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Director J.J. Abrams seemed committed to fan service; even if it made the final episode of the Skywalker saga worthy of some eyerolls. Well, committed to fans - except those shipping Poe and Finn - despite the film touting the franchise's first same-sex kiss. With the final battle looming, will Rey discover who she really is? Will she be persuaded by Kylo Ren to join the dark side? Or will they join forces? And how does ‘forcetiming’ play into all of this?   \n\nYou can read Sam Adams’ review here. \n\nYou can also check out past Spoiler Specials, and you can subscribe to the podcast on Apple Podcasts. Note: As the title indicates, spoilers galore.\n\nEmail us at spoilers@slate.com.\n\n\nHosts\nDana Stevens is Slate’s movie critic.\nForrest Wickman is Slate’s culture editor.\nSam Adams is a Slate senior editor and the editor of Slate’s culture blog, Brow Beat.\nMarissa Martinelli is a Slate assistant editor.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
