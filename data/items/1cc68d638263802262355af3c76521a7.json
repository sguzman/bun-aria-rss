OP's fiance asks to borrow OP's car so he can blow her off and hang out with his friends on New Years. She shuts him down because she needs to go to work nightshift that evening. Her fiance then secretly steals her car to go party with his friends, and when she calls him out on it, he basically says \"Too bad! Just call into work sick.\" So, she calls the cops on him to get her car back. Is she the butthole here?</p>\n",
