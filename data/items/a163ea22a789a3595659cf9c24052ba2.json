  "content": "<p>A person&#8217;s happiness does not depend only on their current lot in life, but\nalso on the rate of change of their lot.  This is because a person&#8217;s prior\nhistory informs their expectations.  Here, we build a model that highlights\nthis emotional &#8220;path-dependence&#8221; quality of utility.  Interestingly, we find\nthat it can be gamed: One can increase net happiness via a process of gradual\nincreased deprivation, followed by sudden jolts in increased consumption, as\nshown in the cartoon below &#8212; this is the best approach.  In particular, it\nbeats the steady consumption rate&nbsp;strategy.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n         <img src=\"images/engine.png\">\n</p>\n\n<h3>The utility function&nbsp;model</h3>\n<p>In this post, we assume that the utility realized by a person over a time <span class=\"math\">\\(T\\)</span>\nis given&nbsp;by\n</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\\begin{eqnarray} \\tag{1} \\label{1}  U(t) = \\int_0^T \\left (a \\vert\nx^{\\prime}(t) \\vert + b \\vert x^{\\prime}(t) \\vert^2 \\right)\n\\text{sign}(x^{\\prime}(t)) dt.\n\\end{eqnarray}</div>\n<p>\nHere, <span class=\"math\">\\(x(t)\\)</span> is a measure of consumption (one&#8217;s &#8220;lot in life&#8221;) at time <span class=\"math\">\\(t\\)</span>.\nOur model here is a natural Taylor expansion, relevant for small changes in\n<span class=\"math\">\\(x(t)\\)</span>.  It is positive when consumption is going up and negative when\nconsumption is going down. We&#8217;ll be interested to learn whether varying <span class=\"math\">\\(x(t)\\)</span>\nsubject to a fixed average constraint can result in increased net happiness,\nrelative to the steady state consumption solution.  The answer is yes, and this\ncan be understood qualitatively by considering the two terms&nbsp;above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>First term,  <span class=\"math\">\\(a \\vert x^{\\prime}(t) \\vert \\text{sign}(x^{\\prime}(t))\\)</span>:  This\n  term is proportional to the rate of change of consumption.\n  We assume that <span class=\"math\">\\(a &gt; 0\\)</span>, so that as we start to consume less, it is negative,\nas we go back up it is positive.  We will be interested in cycles that repeat\nhere, so will assume that our <span class=\"math\">\\(x(t)\\)</span> is periodic with period <span class=\"math\">\\(T\\)</span>.   In this\ncase, the linear term &#8212; while possibly acutely felt at each moment &#8212; will\nintegrate to an average of zero over the long&nbsp;term.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Second term, <span class=\"math\">\\(b \\vert x^{\\prime}(t) \\vert^2 \\text{sign}(x^{\\prime}(t))\\)</span>: This\n  term is non-linear.  It is very weak for small rates of change but kicks in\nstrongly whenever we have an abrupt change.  We again assume that <span class=\"math\">\\(b&gt;0\\)</span> so that\nbig drops in consumption are very painful,&nbsp;etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the above comments in place, we can now see how our figure gives a net\ngain in utility:  On average, only the quadratic term matters and this will\neffectively only contribute during sudden jumps.  The declines in our figure\nare gradual, and so contribute only weakly in this term.  However, the\nincreases are sudden and each give a significant utility &#8220;fix&#8221; as a&nbsp;consequence.</p>\n<p>For those interested, we walk through the simple mathematics needed to exactly\noptimize our utility function in an appendix.  Concluding comments on the\npractical application of these ideas are covered&nbsp;next.</p>\n<h3>Practical&nbsp;considerations</h3>\n<p>A few&nbsp;comments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Many people treat themselves on occasion &#8212; with chocolates, vacations, etc.\n  &#8212; perhaps empirically realizing that varying things improves their long\n  term happiness.  It is interesting to consider the possibility of optimizing\n  this effect, which we do with our toy model here:  In this model, we do not\n  want to live in a steady state salted with occasional treats:  Instead, we\n  want the saw-tooth shape of consumption shown in our&nbsp;figure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A sad fact of life is that progress tends to be gradual, while set backs tend\n  to occur suddenly &#8212; e.g., stocks tend to move in patterns like this.  This\n  is the worst way things could go, according to our&nbsp;model.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>True, human utility functions are certainly more complex than what we have\n  considered&nbsp;here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is interesting to contrast models of utility with conservative physical\n  systems, where the energy of a state is not path dependent, but depends only\non the current state.  Path dependence means that two identical people in the\nsame current situation can have very different valuations of their lot in&nbsp;life.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The appendix below discusses the mathematical optimization of&nbsp;(\\ref{1}).</p>\n<h3>Appendix &#8212; optimizing&nbsp;(\\ref{1})</h3>\n<p>For simplicity, we consider a path that goes down from <span class=\"math\">\\(t=0\\)</span> to <span class=\"math\">\\(t_0\\)</span> &#8212; making\nits way down by <span class=\"math\">\\(\\Delta x\\)</span>, then goes back up to where it started from <span class=\"math\">\\(t_0\\)</span> to\n<span class=\"math\">\\(T\\)</span>.  It is easy to see that the first term integrates to zero in this case,\nprovided we start and end at the same value of <span class=\"math\">\\(x\\)</span>.  Now, consider the second\nterm.  On the way down, we&nbsp;have\n</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\\begin{eqnarray} \n\\int_0^{t_0} \\vert x^{\\prime} \\vert^2 dt &amp;\\equiv &amp; t_0 \\langle \\vert x^{\\prime}\n\\vert^2 \\rangle_{t_0}\n\\\\ &amp;\\geq &amp; t_0 \\langle \\vert x^{\\prime} \\vert \\rangle^2_{t_0}\n\\\\\n&amp;=&amp; t_0 \\left( \\frac{\\Delta x}{t_0} \\right)^2\n\\tag{2}\n\\end{eqnarray}</div>\n<p>\nThe inequality here is equivalent to the statement that the variance of the\nrate of change of our consumption is positive.  We get equality &#8212; and minimal\nloss from the quadratic term on the way down &#8212; if the slope is constant\nthroughout.  That is, we want a linear drop in <span class=\"math\">\\(x(t)\\)</span> from <span class=\"math\">\\(0\\)</span> to <span class=\"math\">\\(t_0\\)</span>.  With\nthis choice, we&nbsp;get\n</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\int_0^{t_0} \\vert x^{\\prime} \\vert^2 dt = \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{t_0}.  \\tag{3}\n\\end{eqnarray}</div>\n<p>\nOn the way back up, we&#8217;d like to max out the inequality analogous to above.\nThis is achieved by having the recovery occur as quickly as possible, say over\na window of time <span class=\"math\">\\(t_{r}\\)</span> with <span class=\"math\">\\(r\\)</span> standing for recovery.  We can decrease our\nloss by increasing <span class=\"math\">\\(t_0\\)</span> up to <span class=\"math\">\\(t_0 \\to T\\)</span>.  In this case, our integral of\nthe quadratic over all time goes&nbsp;to\n</p>\n<div class=\"math\">\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\text{gain} = b \\Delta x^2 \\left (\\frac{1}{t_r} - \\frac{1}{T} \\right)\n\\tag{4}.\n\\end{eqnarray}</div>\n<p>\nThis gives the optimal lift possible &#8212; that realized by the saw-tooth approach\nshown in our first figure&nbsp;above. </p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">if (!document.getElementById('mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#')) {\n    var align = \"center\",\n        indent = \"0em\",\n        linebreak = \"false\";\n\n    if (false) {\n        align = (screen.width < 768) ? \"left\" : align;\n        indent = (screen.width < 768) ? \"0em\" : indent;\n        linebreak = (screen.width < 768) ?
