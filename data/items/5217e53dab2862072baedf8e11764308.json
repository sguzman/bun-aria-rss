He plays in a band called <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/2qAgcJvHLC06soAmks23aE?si=Jgj-qOO2Q_6_RxqKpx_LtA&dl_branch=1\">Iceburn</a> (and many more) and is a staple in the SLC heavy music scene and I couldn't have been more excited to pick his brain about the band and scene in general. We also discuss Iceburn's tour with The Offspring (yep, that happened) as well as his continual quest to push boundaries within heavy music. He's a warm hearted dude and love to bring this chat to you all.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
