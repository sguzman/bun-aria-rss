  "description": "<p>Tonight Ed Brown joins the show to talk to myself and Woody about the International Bigfoot Conference.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Delvis who is from Texas. Delvis writes, \"Hey there, Wes! Big fan of the show, I'm a new fan and have been listening for 2 months straight, everyday. I have an encounter of sorts. It happened back in the summer of 1995. I was 15 years old at the time, I'm 36 now and remember it like it was yesterday. Well, this one night I had a buddy of mine come over, we wanted to rent some video games and movies so I asked my mom if I could borrow the car and head out. She said no and I had a fit, blew a gasket teenage style. I stormed out of the house and walked down the street to cool down. I didn't even bother telling my friend either, I just left. I walked down to the end of the street to where the street lamps didn't shine. I took a seat right at the middle of the street and put my head down. At that time my old neighborhood was right next to a corn field, and the rest of the lots were filled with overgrown dry, tall grass and an abundance of mesquite trees. We also had an old meat market that had closed down some years before and was now just an empty vandalized building. The meat market was located on the opposite side of the block and therefore my street was on the backside of the property.\"</p>",
