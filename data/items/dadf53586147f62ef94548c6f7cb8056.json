  "description": "<p>In the opening lines of his <em>New York Times</em> bestselling memoir, <a href=\"https://static.macmillan.com/static/holt/lenny-kravitz/\"><em>Let Love Rule,</em></a><em> </em>Lenny Kravitz writes that he is deeply two-sided. His young life was all about opposites and extremes—black and white. He grew up between his West Indian grandparent’s home in Brooklyn, and his parent’s home on the Upper East Side where he was surrounded by his family’s famous friends like Miles Davis and Duke Ellington. When Lenny was 11, his mother, Roxie Roker, landed a starring role on the iconic sitcom, <em>The Jeffersons</em>. The family picked up and moved to L.A where Lenny fell in love with classic rock, funk, and skate culture. It’s also where Lenny and Rick Rubin eventually became friends in the late ‘80s. In this conversation, Lenny tells candid stories about his relationship with Lisa Bonet and talks about how writing his memoir helped him finally find peace with his overbearing father. They also talk about the time Lenny, Rick and Johnny Cash were <em>all </em>roommates and the day Lenny received the most devastating news of his life. And, at the end, Lenny performs a beautiful acoustic version of his song, “Johnny Cash,\" from his album <em>Raise Vibration</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record's YouTube channel to hear old and new interviews, often with bonus content: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\">https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here: <a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\">https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/</a></p><p>You can find some of our favorite Lenny Kravitz songs, including rarities, by clicking <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6AVOzPXMnlMPDoLeNxXXtk?si=z9IZI5bzRn-7ygj2nQW1KA\">HERE — enjoy!</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
