  "description": "<p>Stablecoins are no longer what they used to be in 2017, as they have changed a lot from then till today in 2021. To understand how stablecoins are created and to compare different stablecoins, we must know 3 important characteristics: collaterals, mechanisms, and pegs — explained in this episode.</p>\n<p>Why do we care about stablecoins? Because finding a mechanism to maintain its peg is the first step towards creating a global currency instrument that is decoupled from the country-based economy.</p>\n<p>So, to figure out and experiment this mechanism, we explore the toolkit in #stablecoins. Think of them as the ingredients to the stablecoin recipe, in which you can tweak and play around with. The goal is to find a mechanism to create a stable asset as an output, so we can use this asset to trade and transact with economic agents in other ecosystems.
