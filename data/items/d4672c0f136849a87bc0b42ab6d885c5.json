    "media:description": "Canada is building a $6.3BN new railway network across the Montreal metro area. Called REM, the network will dramatically improve Montreal’s commuter rail infrastructure by establishing a new, 67 kilometer long light-rail line across the city. It will feature autonomous, spacious and ventilated train carriages from the Alstom Metropolis family of rolling stock. It will also have 26 stations with a modern and green design, featuring platform screen doors that will open only when trains arrive. The new system will provide jobs, cut commute times across Montreal and contribute billions of dollars to the local economy. While delayed and over budget, it is planned to fully open in 2024. When opened, it will serve as a 21st century evolution to Montreal’s expansive transport network.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider subscribing to Futurology for more similar content!\n\nThank you to the following sources!\n\nInformation\nhttps://rem.info/en/work-schedule\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9seau_express_m%C3%A9tropolitain\nhttps://rem.info/en/news/6-maps-help-understand-rem\nhttps://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/caisse-to-oversee-and-fund-train-to-airport-and-other-transit-projects\nhttps://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/rem-delay-cdpq-infra-mount-royal-tunnel\nhttps://montreal.ctvnews.ca/delivery-of-most-rem-stations-delayed-until-late-2024-1.5954365\nhttps://montreal.ctvnews.ca/century-old-explosives-in-mount-royal-tunnel-helped-push-rem-a-year-behind-schedule-1.5184998\n\nAudio\nStoryblocks\nYouTube Audio Library\n\nGraphics\nGoogle Earth\nStoryblocks\nRéseau express métropolitain - REM\n\nVideo Chapters\n00:00 - Intro\n01:33 - Project Details\n04:05 - Project Benefits\n05:39 - Construction",
