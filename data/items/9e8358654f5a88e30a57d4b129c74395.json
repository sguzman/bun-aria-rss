  "description": "<p>While my garden is in a bit of a lull at the moment, I know in the back of my mind that harvest time is just around the corner.  Perhaps this year more than ever, I’m focused on preserving everything I possibly can.  In today’s episode, I cover the four primary methods that I use to make sure our family takes full advantage of our harvest:  canning, freezing, dehydrating, and fermenting.  Discover why a method of preservation could be great for one type of food but not good for another.  I also reveal my all-time favorite way to store foods for the winter (hint:  this should be pretty easy to guess for my long time listeners).</p><p>A big thanks to our August sponsor— Union Wireless!
