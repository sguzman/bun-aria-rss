  "description": "Imagine it: Your doctor tells you, “Take a magic mushroom and call me in the morning.”\nIt’s...probably not all that realistic. But the promise of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy? Definitely realistic. And definitely an intriguing business prospect.\nThat’s why this week on Business Casual, we’re talking to the preeminent expert in the controlled use of psychedelic drugs: Dr. Rick Doblin, founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (aka MAPS).\nRick has spent nearly four decades at MAPS championing the uses of psychedelics and marijuana in clinical settings. The treatment possibilities, as he sees them, range from post-traumatic stress disorder to depression to addiction.\nSounds promising—but there’s always a but. The larger pharmaceuticals, biotech, and insurance industries aren’t quite ready to wholly buy into psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. Or psychotherapy of any kind, for that matter.\nAlong with earning a spot in the regulatory good graces of U.S. officials, educating business decision makers presents a challenge for Rick and his peers in the psychedelics space. But if the trend of microdosing (ahem, Silicon Valley) is any indication, interest is growing from both venture capital and consumer POVs.\n\nMoney, though, is harder to come by—in the episode, Rick shares the experience of fundraising as a nonprofit.\n\nThe tl;dr? It’s really, really hard.\n\nListen now to expand your mind.\nRick generously offered to answer other business-related questions. Get in touch with him at rick@maps.org.",
