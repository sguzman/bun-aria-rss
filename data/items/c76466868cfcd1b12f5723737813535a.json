  "description": "Mina and ESPN's Joel Anderson go back and forth to create a mock draft of who NFL teams should select later this month in Nashville. Joel tells us which prospect looks like Meek Mill, the player that doesn't have a face for greatness, and why a prospect's last name is giving him a boost.
