  "description": "<p>On this episode, the crew discusses the recent podcast on Warner Glenn. But first, Daniel Rupp and Brent Reaves open up about getting whoopins in kindergarten. The crews talks in depth about the Newcomb Family & Friends bear camp, and tell the stories of three bear hunts. Sadly, Daniel Rupp wasn't invited to the camp. Clay's uncle, Mike Schultz, is this week's mystery guest. He traveled to Arizona with Clay to interview Warner Glenn and was impacted by the trip to the Malpai Ranch. Lastly, they talk about the ins and outs of the interview with Warner Glenn and give some \"behind the scenes\" info on being down on the border. </p><p><br></p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p><p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p><p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p><p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/products/bear-grease-hat\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
