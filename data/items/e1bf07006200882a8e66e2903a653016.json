  "description": "<p>This week we’re starting a new series called A Winner’s Daily Mindset. In this episode, John Maxwell talks through the first three of six habits. There are many habits that can lead you to success, but the six John shares in this series have helped him in his own 40-year leadership journey.</p> <p>Then Mark Cole and Richard Chancy discuss why continual learning is key to great leadership. As John points out, the moment you stop learning, you stop leading. That’s because leadership is developed, not discovered.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is A Winner’s Daily Mindset Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/mindset and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href=\"http://leadershiftbook.com/\"><em>Leadershift</em> by John C.
