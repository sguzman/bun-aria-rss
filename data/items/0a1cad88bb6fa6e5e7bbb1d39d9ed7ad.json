  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Senator Josh Hawley provokes mockery and jeers from the media for suggesting that there is an attack on masculinity in our culture. But he’s completely correct, of course. In fact, the situation is even worse than he describes. Masculinity is in its death throes in the West. And if masculinity dies, the West will go down with it. Also, another day, another prosecution witness in the Kyle Rittenhouse case accidentally destroys the prosecution’s case. Plus, Snopes does a fact check on the claim that Joe Biden let one rip in front of a member of the Royal Family. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the Republican Party’s embrace of sexual identity politics with the newly christened RNC Pride Coalition. \nRead the Daily Wire’s bombshell Loudoun County exposé here: https://www.dailywire.com/news/loudoun-county-schools-tried-to-conceal-sexual-assault-against-daughter-in-bathroom-father-says | Support the Daily Wire’s investigative journalism for only $4/month — use discount code REALNEWS for 25% off your membership: https://utm.io/udQ0u\nYou petitioned, and we heard you.
