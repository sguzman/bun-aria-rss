  "description": "<p>You’ve probably read or heard about the benefits of meditation, but you’ve never given it a try because it all seems a bit too woo-woo. You’re not alone. My guest used to be a skeptic himself, but after falling into drug use and suffering a nervous breakdown on national television, he gave meditation a try and found that it made him calmer and more resilient. He’s now on a mission to make meditation approachable for the masses — no meditation pillow required. His name is <a href=\"http://10percenthappier.com\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Harris</a>. He’s a news reporter at ABC who you can see on <em>Nightline</em>. He’s also the author of the books <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FJ376CS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00FJ376CS&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>10% Happier</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y58KF6P/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B06Y58KF6P&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Today on show, Dan shares the story of his nervous breakdown in front of millions of people and how that led him to meditation. He then takes us through the latest research on the benefits of meditation, including the way it reduces depression and anxiety. Dan and I then discuss some of the myths that people have about meditation, such as the idea that it takes a lot of time, requires you to sit on a pillow, and will cause you to lose your edge.
