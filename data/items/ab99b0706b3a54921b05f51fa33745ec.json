  "title": "René V. Arcilla, \"Wim Wenders's Road Movie Philosophy: Education Without Learning\" (Bloomsbury, 2020)",
  "description": "What is education? Most of the time, we have little patience for this question because we take the answer to be obvious: we identify education with school learning. This book focuses on education outside of the school context as a basis for criticizing and improving school learning. Following the examples of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Dewey, Arcilla seeks to harmonize schooling with a more pervasive education we are all naturally undergoing. He develops a philosophical theory of education that stresses the experience of being led out —a theory latent in the Latin term, “educere”— by examining the road movies of Wim Wenders.\nWim Wenders's Road Movie Philosophy: Education Without Learning (Bloomsbury, 2020) contributes both to our understanding of another crucial kind of education our schooling could better serve, and to our appreciation of what unifies and distinguishes Wenders's achievements in cinema.\nRené V. Arcilla is Professor of Philosophy of Education in the Steinhardt School of Education, at New York University\nGustavo E. Gutiérrez Suárez is PhD candidate in Social Anthropology, and BA in Social Communication. His areas of interest include Andean and Amazonian Anthropology, Film theory and aesthetics.
