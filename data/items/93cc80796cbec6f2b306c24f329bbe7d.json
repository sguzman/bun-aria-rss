The deep tentacles of caste and class power embodied as the state reach into the Bhil everyday, not tethered to single issues of \"development\" induced displacement or the disappearing commons, but as an all-encompassing structural violence manifested in the realities of malnutrition, agricultural debt and seasonal migration.\nAlf Gunvald Nilsen is Professor of Sociology at the University of Pretoria.\nMadhuri Karak holds a Ph.D. in cultural anthropology from The Graduate Center, City University of New York.
