  "description": "Why do we call a frankfurter a \"hot dog\"? It seems an unsettling 19th-century rumor is to blame. Also, if someone quits something abruptly, why do we say they quit \"cold turkey\"? This term's roots may lie in the history of boxing. Plus, a transgender listener with nieces and nephews is looking for a gender-neutral term for the sibling of one's parent. Finally, the words \"barber\" and \"doctor\" don't necessarily mean what you think. They can both be weather words, referring to very different types of wind.\n Listen to all episodes for free: https://waywordradio.org/ Â Support the show to keep episodes coming: https://waywordradio.org/donate Â Your responses, questions, and comments are welcomed at any time!Â Â https://waywordradio.org/contact Â words@waywordradio.org Â Listener line 1 (877) 929-9673 toll-free in the US and Canada Â Text/SMS +1 (619) 567-9673 Â Copyright Wayword, Inc., a 501(c)(3) corporation.
