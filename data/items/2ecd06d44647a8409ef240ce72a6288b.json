  "title": "Mock Draft Monday 8.0: Renewed focus on the Top 12, Pro Day Evaluations for Kyle Pitts, Ja'Marr Chase, Justin Fields, Mac Jones & more (Football 4/5)",
  "description": "Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson for another Mock Draft Monday. With last week's shakeup to the draft order in the form of 2 blockbuster trades, there is now a renewed focus and new outlook on the Top 12 picks. Before diving into those mock selections, Ryan breaks down recent Pro Day performances and whether we should be buying all these crazy numbers (1:35). One thing we know for certain is that Florida \"TE\" Kyle Pitts is off-the-charts athletic. How high can his pre-draft workouts place him? Ja'Marr Chase is another offensive weapon that wowed. Is he a lock to be the first WR off the board? Of course, there's a ton of buzz on the quarterbacks, especially Justin Fields and Mac Jones following their Pro Days. What's the current stance on those guys? Then, we go pick 1-12 in Wilson's latest mock (23:00). \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
