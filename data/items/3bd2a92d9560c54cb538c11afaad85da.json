  "description": "COVID. Wildfires in the west. Hurricanes in the Gulf and storms in the East. A women's right to choose under siege. A corrupted justice system. Economic inequality. Racial division. Democracy in the ICU. Any one of these crises would be a challenge for a generation. We face them all at once. The result is something like \"the 2000 yard stare,\" the sign of a battle worn soldier unable to fight. But we must fight. The question is how. We discuss all this on a vitally important special edition of the podcast with guests Norm Ornstein of AEI, best-selling author and therapist Mary L. Trump, co-host former Obama White House senior official Dr. Kavita Patel and co-host David Rothkopf. Join us. It's time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
