When the discouragement bears down, we wonder, “Does this even matter? Would another investment be more worthwhile?” In this episode, Ruth Chou Simons, author, artist and founder of Gracelaced, pours out gospel-rich wisdom from her years of parenting six boys. She discusses how she manages her dreams and motherhood, how she keeps her priorities straight with a blooming business, and offers practical wisdom for a busy mom to grow in her relationship with God. Through years of humble faithfulness, a mom can hope in Christ, even when she can’t see the outcome of her story.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1505829088195_71490\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <h3 class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"> <strong> <a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/transcriptions/ep-73-ruth-chou-simons-faithfulness-work-in-the-season-of-young-children\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VIEW TRANSCRIPT</a></strong></h3> <p><strong>Articles, Resources and Related Content:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2xjzcmj\">Gracelaced Book</a> – Ruth’s new book including beautiful artwork & devotionals*</li> <li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2xdLc7a\">Gracelaced Journal</a> – Includes 8 pieces of art by Ruth & inviting journal to use*</li> <li><a href=\"https://gracelaced.com/\">Gracelaced.com</a> - Ruth Chou Simons’ website</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gracelaced/\">Gracelaced on Instagram</a> – Follow Ruth on Instagram</li> <li><a href= \"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/56509-child-said-the-lion-i-am-telling-you-your-story\"> Each Person Has Their Own Story Quote</a> - The Horse and His Boy by C.S.
