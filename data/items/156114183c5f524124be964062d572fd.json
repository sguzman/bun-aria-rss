  "description": "<p>In the midst of vote counting, we're all on the edge of our seats. So to pass the time, here's another Battle & Banter Special featuring our very own Codie Eash. From this past spring of 2020, Codie presents a lecture on the Presidential Election of 1864 that pitted incumbent President Abraham Lincoln against his former General-in-Chief, George McClellan. It's a darn good way to help pass the time as well as remain relevant to current events. Enjoy!</p>",
