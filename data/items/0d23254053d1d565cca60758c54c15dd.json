  "description": "To what degree did each of The Beatles exhibit emotional intelligence in the band’s final year?\nYou'll find out in the discussion I had with Kenneth Womack about his new book Solid State: The Story of Abbey Road and The End of The Beatles (Cornell University Press, 2019).\nWomack is the author of a two-volume biography of the life and work of Beatles producer George Martin. His forthcoming book, John Lennon, 1980: The Last Days in the Life, will be available in October 2020.\nTopics covered in this episode include:\n--Womack explains what Solid State refers to and where Abbey Road might rank in the band’s legacy. (Fortunately, the Magical Mystery Tour album wasn’t a top-three choice of his!)\n--Using the Big 5 model for personality traits, what might be the dominant traits of The Beatles given the options of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.\n--Why the band had reached a point where, like a bad marriage, it couldn’t survive any longer.\nFor a transcript of this episode, click here.\nDan Hill, PhD, is the author of eight books and leads Sensory Logic, Inc.
