  "title": "Episode 47: Nikola Vučević (feat. PFT Commenter and Arian Foster)",
  "description": "Well, to use a quote from JJ himself, this is one action packed episode of the Old Man and the Three. To begin, JJ and Tommy sit down with Nikola Vučević, the Orlando magic's all star center and mainstay on and off the court. After coming into the league in 2011, Vučević has steadily improved his game to become a highly respected player around the league, as well as an all star. But inexplicably, his game has also been highly underrated by the casual NBA fan. He talks about using that underrated tag as a motivational tool, as well as his experience in Orlando over the years, his college days at USC, and more. Then, the atmosphere changes juuuust a bit as the OM3 crew is joined by PFT Commenter and Arian Foster for a TOP 5/Draft you have to hear to believe: The top presidents you would want to play on your football team. Before they get started on that though, the guys talk about PFT and Arian's new podcast called \"Macrodosing\", where they explore conspiracies, conundrums, and the dark corners of the deep web. Definitely a pod you want to check out.\nRUNDOWN\nHow different was this year’s all star experience\nOn the concern about the long layoff and quality of play\nDid he worry about being the last pick on the all-star squad\nReflecting on the bombs that Dame and Steph were launching from 30+ feet\nOn being an “under the radar” type of player despite all his talent\nIs there still a chip on his shoulder to drive him to be better\nDoes he feel he snuck up on people in the beginning of his career\nDid he ever expect to go this long without being on a contender\nOn how the makeup of an NBA squad have changed over the years \nOn his experience in Philly\nTalks about playing at USC with the star talent they had at the time\nTOP 5/Draft with PFT Commenter and Arian Foster\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
