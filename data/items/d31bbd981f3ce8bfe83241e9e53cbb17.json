  "description": "<p>EPISODE 80 - MARY ZOPHRES - Costume Designer</p> <p>Team Deakins sits down with Costume Designer, Mary Zophres (FIRST MAN, LA LA LAND, TRUE GRIT). She shares how she works with actors, large amounts of extras, the production designer, and the DP. She describes the thrill of seeing the actor become the character in the fitting room. Camera tests are important since “your eye tells you different things than the lens does” and she tells some of the things she has discovered through camera tests. She also describes dressing Jeff Bridges on The Big Lebowski, researching First Man and her experience on La La Land. We learn a lot about how the costumes can add so much to the storytelling.</p>",
