Believing in the 'Eat What You Kill\" philosophy, Channing talks about how compensation is a direct result of broadcast deals and fan engagement. If a sport or event is bringing in high dollars then that's what gets paid out, if it isn't, where else would the money come from to close the monetary gap? </p><p>Being an avid soccer fan and player, Chad disagrees and believes the ladies' sport is highly competitive and entertaining to watch and wants to know what it will take to level the playing field between women and men's soccer.  Leaving Brandon, Fred and Channing stunned, Toni and Ali disclose that most women playing in the league make below minimum wage with salaries of $22,000 for 25 games including the offseason. </p><p>As girl dads, Channing asks Toni and Ali what's the motivation to pour resources into his daughter playing sports and give her the best odds to make it knowing that even at the highest level of success, it doesn't reflect monetary success or accolades.
