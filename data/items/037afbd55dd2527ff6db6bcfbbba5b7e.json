  "description": "<p>Today on The Literary Life, Cindy, Angelina and Thomas dig into chapters 11-17 of Jane Austen’s <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/35LzDEn\">Northanger Abbey</a></em>. Today’s conversation gets into the subtext surrounding what was expected of young ladies to be acceptable in society. A major theme in this book, and particularly in these chapters, is Catherine’s learning to discern between what is simply appearance and what is reality. We learn even more in these chapters how inconstant and deceptive the Thorpes are, especially in contrast to the Tilneys.</p> <p>Angelina highlights some of the scenes Austen uses to illustrate when it is right for Catherine to buck the rules of propriety as opposed to Isabella’s impropriety at the wrong time. Thomas brings up the question of what reasons we have thus far to like Henry Tilney even though we do not know overly much about him yet. Cindy points out some of Austen’s ideas on education and the similarities to Charlotte Mason’s principles.</p> <h3>Thanks to Our Sponsor:</h3> <p>Located in beautiful Franklin Tennessee, <a href= \"https://newcollegefranklin.org/\">New College Franklin</a> is a four year Christian Liberal Arts college dedicated to excellent academics and discipling relationships among students and faculty.
