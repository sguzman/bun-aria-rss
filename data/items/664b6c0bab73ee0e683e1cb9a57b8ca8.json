  "description": "How did de-colonialization impact the United Kingdom itself? That is a topic that Professor of Imperial & Commonwealth History at King’s College, London, Sarah Stockwell aims to tackle in her latest book: The British End of the British Empire (Cambridge University Press, 2018). Looking at the process of de-colonialization and its domestic impact via four sets of institutions: Oxbridge, The Bank of England, The Royal Mint and the Royal military academy at Sandhurst, Stockwell aims to show how in each instance, the institution in question was affected by the end of Empire. Stockwell’s approach is a novel and revisionist one, in contradiction to Bernard Porter’s more wildly held thesis on the subject. And, while Stockwell’s argument both well researched and well written, will not convince everyone; it is certainly a highly interesting and imaginative one, which everyone interested in the topic should peruse and read.\n Charles Coutinho Ph. D. of the Royal Historical Society, received his doctorate from New York University. His area of specialization is 19th and 20th-century European, American diplomatic and political history. He has written recently for Chatham House’s International Affairs.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
