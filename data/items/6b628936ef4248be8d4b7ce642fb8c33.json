  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was recently posed a question by one of my listeners regarding the issue of the conflict between supporting local farmers and trying to get the most for your money when it comes to our food. This is a topic of discussion that's getting louder each year as inflation continues to increase the cost of food. The supply-chain issues have also made many of us reconsider where we're sourcing our food and other supplies.
