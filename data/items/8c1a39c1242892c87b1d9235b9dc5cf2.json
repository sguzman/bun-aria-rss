  "description": "<p>23-year-old Chris Turner disappeared from Las Vegas, Nevada, in early August of 2016. We first covered Chris Turner’s case on July 5, 2017. Shortly after we aired his story, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department closed his case, stating that he had been seen alive. We brought you an update about Chris on September 1, 2017, to discuss the developments. Unfortunately, it took two years to get the case reopened. After his family submitted their DNA, they got a shocking phone call. They learned there was no possible way Chris could have been seen alive during the summer of 2017.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://betterhelp.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BetterHelp</a>- Visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://betterhelp.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BetterHelp.com/VANISHED</a>&nbsp;for 10% off your first mont</p><p><a href=\"http://VionicShoes.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vionic Shoes</a>- Visit <a href=\"http://VionicShoes.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VionicShoes.com</a> and use promo code VANISHED for free shipping.</p><p><a href=\"http://getquip.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">QUIP</a>- Go to <a href=\"http://getquip.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GetQuip.com/VANISHED</a>&nbsp;to get a free plastic dispenser with any refill plan.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.
