  "description": "<p>Traditionally, Euclidean geometry is treated by scientists as a priori and\nobjective. However, when we take the position of an agent, the problem of\nselecting a best route should also factor in the abilities of the agent, its\nembodiment and particularly its cognitive effort. In this paper we consider\ngeometry in terms of travel between states within a world by incorporating\ninformation processing costs with the appropriate spatial distances. This\ninduces a geometry that increasingly differs from the original geometry of the\ngiven world as information costs become increasingly important. We visualise\nthis \"cognitive geometry\" by projecting it onto 2- and 3-dimensional spaces\nshowing distinct distortions reflecting the emergence of epistemic and\ninformation-saving strategies as well as pivot states. The analogies between\ntraditional cost-based geometries and those induced by additional informational\ncosts invite a generalisation of the notion of geodesics as cheapest routes\ntowards the notion of infodesics. In this perspective, the concept of\ninfodesics is inspired by the property of geodesics that, travelling from a\ngiven start location to a given goal location along a geodesic, not only the\ngoal, but all points along the way are visited at optimal cost from the start.\n</p>",
