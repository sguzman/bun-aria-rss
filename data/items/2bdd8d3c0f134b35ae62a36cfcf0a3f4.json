Yep, we're talking about anxiety. We all deal with it and struggle with managing anxiety. So what do you do? How do you handle it? Can you overcome your anxiety?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Today's episode is our signature segment, 'Real Woman, Real Story,' where Zuri is joined by podcast host&nbsp;Latoya D. Newton of The Analog Girl, who shares her powerful story with anxiety & chronic depersonalization and her journey through recovery to emotional wellness. This 'Real Woman, Real Story' spotlight is guaranteed to leave you LYAO + simultaneously ready to wipe away a thug tear.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>LaToya shares her hilarious story of being fired from her corporate job. She shares her candid advice on how Black women + WOC should navigate mental health discussions in the workplace. The boundaries she's had to set with her family + friends (and why she's chosen to remain single throughout her journey).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Latoya also opens up to Z about the different anxiety treatments she's tried &mdash; from cannabis to transcendental meditation to therapy -- and hints at her trippy experience with weed. LaToya also shares her moving testimony on how she copes with anxiety as a Christian and the stigma of dealing with mental health in the Black community. LaToya also shares why she created her amazing support network for POC struggling with anxiety.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stay tuned till the end, as LaToya takes us through a guided breathing meditation to help us slay our anxiety today, tomorrow, and in the future!!!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Share this episode with a friend NOW + let us know your favorite part of the convo: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/zurihall/?hl=en\">@ZuriHall</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hothappymess/?hl=en\">@HotHappyMess</a></li>\n<li>Head over to <a href=\"https://www.hothappymess.com/post/hhm-35-reclaim-your-life-from-anxiety\">hothappymess.com</a> for all the show notes mentioned in this episode and for ALL the deets on how to join our exclusive Facebook group!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Recent episodes: if ya feel like bingeing:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ICYMI: Listen to <a href=\"https://www.hothappymess.com/post/hhm-ep-34-are-you-ready-to-slay-your-anxiety-how-to-manage-it-stay-grounded-start-living-for-today\">Episode 34: How To Slay Your Anxiety</a></li>\n<li>ICYMI: Listen to <a href=\"https://www.hothappymess.com/post/33-zuri-hall-on-protecting-your-peace-the-best-dating-apps-and-why-you-need-to-do-a-year-of-yes\">Episode 33: Zuri Hall on Protecting Your Peace + Doing a Year of Yes</a></li>\n<li>ICYMI: Listen to <a href=\"https://www.hothappymess.com/post/hhm-ep-32-the-keys-to-conquer-corporate-america\">Episode 32: Get Your Boss On - The Keys to Corporate America</a></li>\n<li>ICYMI: Listen to <a href=\"https://www.hothappymess.com/post/hhm-ep-31-how-to-network-without-being-a-stalker\">Episode 31: How To Network Without Being a Stalker</a></li>\n<li>ICYMI: Listen to<a href=\"https://www.hothappymess.com/post/hhm-27-screw-finding-your-dream-job-its-time-for-your-dream-life-and-purpose\"> Episode 27: Screw Finding Your Dream Job!
