  "description": "<p>A listener writes “Hi Wes, The things I encountered were in 1984 and 1988 when I was 12 and 16.</p> <p>I’m from Fresno California. I’m a long haul truck driver now, and I’ve been listening to you on and off since your episodes were in the 30s but I went back to the beginning.</p> <p>I come from a hunting family, and my father cut firewood on the weekend’s to make extra money. So we spent a lot of time in the Sierra’s.</p> <p>When I was 12 we went deer hunting somewhere in the Kings Canyon National Forrest. I don’t remember exactly where. It was my father 2 of his younger brothers and I.</p> <p>My uncle John had an old camping trailer. It had 4 bunks and nothing else. After hunting all day we went to sleep. It was probably 2 or 3 AM.</p> <p>Something picked up the back end of the trailer, and guessing dropped it from at least a foot or 2 off the ground. It was a really big drop. It jolted us all out of bed.</p> <p>It was a small trailer but with all of us in it, it must have weighed close to 2 000 lbs. It wasn’t made of the lightweight material they use today.</p> <p>I heard something moving around outside, and it knocking over stuff. My uncle Bobby grabbed his rifle and started to go out the door and my dad grabbed him by the arm. And my dad was dead serious. He wasn’t letting him go outside. My uncle started to argue with my dad and my dad just shut him down. He just said we’re going back to bed.</p> <p>My dad wasn’t a nice person. He did some time in jail and prison. He was mean guy and I never saw him scared of anything. He told me it was a bear and don’t worry about it.</p> <p>There’s no bear that did that. Only men or a sasquatch could have done that. If my dad thought men did it I know all 3 of them would have been out the door guns in hand.</p> <p>I always thought that was really strange.</p> <p>When I was 16 we were cutting some pine wood near mammoth pools near Yosemite National Park. I believe that’s Sierra national Forrest where we were. Not far from a little town named Oak Hurst, where we lived for a year when I was 6 years old.</p> <p>We had been in the habit of going up and cutting enough wood to fill the truck. We’d camp that night and get up the next morning and we’d fish for a while and go home.</p> <p>So the sun had just come up and we started trout fishing in this little stream. It was really cold, they had barely opened up all the small roads after the spring thaw. There was still ice on the banks of the stream. I was half asleep. It was really quiet. There wasn’t anyone around. I was just thinking how I wanted to go home and eat.</p> <p>I was just kind of looking around slow dragging my bait in when something caught my eye. There was a big dead log laying on the other side of the stream, about 50 feet away.</p> <p>That’s when I saw it. There was a sasquatch laying down on his stomach, propping himself up on his fore arms.</p> <p>He was hidden behind the log looking through the end of the log that had hollowed out. He was perfectly still his head tilted up just watching us.</p> <p>The look in his eyes was so hateful. The guy in your intro talking about that really hit home with me. He just looked so disgusted we were there. His eyes were like a chocolate brown.</p> <p>I reached over and tugged on my dad’s arm. He was just a couple of feet from me. He had just caught a fish and was re baiting.</p> <p>I was so scared. I could barely get words out. I said, 1:00 on the ground by the big log. I basically whispered it and he was all annoyed, what??? And then the words sunk in and he looked and saw it. He just said, don’t move. He looked over at his 30 ott 6 leaning against the tree next to him, but he didn’t pick it up. We just froze for what was seconds but if seemed so long. And suddenly we heard what I guess was a tree knock over across the road behind us. It sounded like a really sharply hit line drive off a baseball bat.</p> <p>As we looked back he jumped up from behind the log and ran across the stream. It was probably 25 feet wide, and he cleared it in 3 steps.</p> <p>He didn’t look like the patty gorilla type at all. He was very tall, I would estimate between 7 and 8 feet. I went to wrestling and watched Andre the giant walk in and he’s the only thing I’ve ever seen comparable in height. Where it looked like someone was carrying him in until you saw his legs.</p> <p>But this sasquatch was very thin. His shoulders were wide but he wasn’t heavily muscled like you normally hear about. His hair was either gray or dirty white, I’m not sure. The hair wasn’t very thick either. It was probably about 3 or 4 inches long, but was more thin. He might have been old I don’t know?</p> <p>He had super big hands with long fingers. I saw him plant one hand on the log as he lept over it. I’ve never seen anything like it.</p>",
