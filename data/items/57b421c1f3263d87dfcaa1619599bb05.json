  "description": "In today's podcast we hear about catphishing in Berlin and Tel Aviv: whether you're offering payment for a white paper or up-to-date futbol scores, it pays to know the right bait. Android apps may be permission hogs, but it's surprising how often the hogs hoard like misers, never really using them. The US Army pushes cyber into the brigades. How Facebook checks facts. The Thermanator knows which keys you've typed from the heat your hot hand leaves behind. Emily Wilson from Terbium Labs on their recently released white paper on fraud as a supply chain. Guest is Brian Wells from Merlin International discussing how high-performing health care organizations are addressing cyber threats.",
