  "description": "Michael Schmidt's new book \"Donald Trump v. The United States: Inside the Struggle to Stop a President\" is one of the required reads of this moment in our history. It gets deep inside the effort to protect the president as the Russia investigation closed in around him. But it also underscores what that investigation did not uncover. Indeed the central question remains: What explains Trump's behavior toward Russia during the campaign in 2016 and ever since. We discuss the book and this question with Michael in a riveting one-on-one that you will not want to miss. Join us.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
