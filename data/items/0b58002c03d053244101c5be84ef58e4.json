  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, January 6th, 2020 wasn't the best day in the history of our republic, but it sure wasn't the worst. Democrats can't make the case that there was a violent terrorist attack on January 6th because it would lead back to Nancy Pelosi. The media is pushing this narrative, along with Critical Race Theory, the unceasing attacks on all things Donald Trump, and the unequal justice that we saw in the Russian collusion hoax. It's the left that uses phony TV experts to repeatedly paint Trump as an evil dictator despite having any proof. It is the Democrats that celebrate the attacks on police officers while supporting lawlessness in minority neighborhoods, promote the censorship of parents in public education and advance transgender policies in public schools rather than focus on educating children academically. Then, for those that have visited the battlefields of the U.S Civil War and in Arlington National Cemetery, they know that the vast majority of those that died are White Christian men. White Christian men that died defending the Union to end slavery. White Christian men, that died in service to their country, does that sound like White privilege to you? Afterward, Julie Kelly joins the show to discuss her new book \"January 6: How Democrats Used the Capitol Protest to Launch a War on Terror Against the Political Right.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
