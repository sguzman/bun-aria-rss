If the web is a massive database of documents then the semantic web is a way of identifying and connecting \"entities\" within those documents (<a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WolframAlpha</a> is an example of a basic version of the semantic web). Susan says that this is a significant ontological task of identifying what kinds of things do and do not exist in this space. For the semantic web to develop&nbsp; huge amounts of data on all kinds of topics would need to be gathered and analysed which would also require decisions to be made about what kinds of data to include and exclude.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also discuss about the benefits and challenges of working working across the social sciences and computer sciences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I ask Susan about a paper she wrote with Mike Savage in which they outline a fascinating reading of the work of Thomas Piketty, Robert Putnam and Richard Wilkinson & Kate Pickett.
