  "description": "<p class=\"\">We’re so excited to have Kennedy Ryan with us this week — someone who was blooded not once, but <em>twice</em> by old school historicals! Listen to us talk powerful heroines, her brilliant Queen Move, how so much romance is political and why those old romances are still worth reading — problematic and all. </p><p class=\"\">Summer is here, and next week is the final episode of Season Two, with a few others to come while we take a few weeks off. To read romance novels. Obviously. Season Three begins in August!</p><p class=\"\">While we’re apart, if you are up for leaving a rating or review for the podcast on your podcasting app, we would be very grateful!</p><p class=\"\">Oh, and did you know Sarah<em> </em>had a book out last week? <em>Daring & the Duke</em> is officially here! Get it at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36enOHt\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/DukeKobo\">Kobo</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/DukeBN\">Barnes & Noble</a>, <a href=\"https://apple.co/394AXnZ\">Apple Books</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/DukeBAM\">Books-a-Million</a> or from <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3foEa5a\">your local indie</a>, or order it signed from the wonderful independent bookstore, <a href=\"https://www.banksquarebooks.com/sarahmaclean\">Savoy Bookshop in RI</a>, where she is for the. month of July!</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\">Welcome <a href=\"https://kennedyryanwrites.com/\">Kennedy Ryan</a>! You know what they say about <a href=\"https://thegrio.com/2014/04/10/are-all-preachers-kids-wild-and-rebellious/\">pastors' kids</a>. Just kidding, she was a <a href=\"https://www.scarleteen.com/article/sexuality\">late bloomer</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Teacher Jen would like a moment to talk about vocabulary acquisition: <a href=\"https://www.readingrockets.org/article/building-your-childs-vocabulary\">Parents can help kids learn new words by modeling</a>, but reading is really the X factor. You can <a href=\"http://testyourvocab.com/\">take this vocabulary test</a> to see the rough size of your own vocabulary, but this information about how kids acquire new words is actually pretty simple: <a href=\"http://testyourvocab.com/blog/2013-05-09-Reading-habits\">read lots of fiction when you're young.</a></p><p class=\"\">Believe it or not, there was never a Carole Mortimer book titled Frustration.

Ava DuVernay was slated to direct a documentary on Prince for Netflix, but <a href=\"https://ultimateprince.com/prince-netflix-documentary-director/\">stepped down over \"creative differences.\"</a> And if you can ever travel again, Jen highly recommends going on the tour of <a href=\"https://www.paisleypark.com/\">Paisley Park</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Jen mentioned that Iris Johansen, Fayrene Preston, and Kay Hooper wrote several series about a family called the Delaneys, and <a href=\"http://www.kayhooper.com/classic/delaneys.html\">Kay Hooper tells the story of how it happened on her website</a>. PS. the <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31q2ATIQ-7L._AC_UL600_SR375,600_.jpg\">original covers</a> for <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/917yZ4k0FVL.jpg\">The Delaneys</a>: <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516blMo0kvL._SX309_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\">The Untamed Years</a> are amazing.

Harris) and Penelope Williamson <a href=\"https://csharris.net/author_formative.php\">are sisters</a>?</p><p class=\"\">So, in romances, being a wet nurse is just a plot device. <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/lifesaving-horrifying-history-wet-nurses/\">But the history of wet nurses is, to no one's surprise, rather grim.</a> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3fbvler\">Sunset Embrace</a> is the Sandra Brown book with the wet nurse. In Vanessa Riley's newest-- <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3f8OYE8\">A Duke, The Lady, and a Baby</a> -- the heroine has to sneak in to feed her own son and manages to get herself hired as his wet nurse. In Romeo and Juliet <a href=\"https://educationblog.oup.com/secondary/english/insights-the-nurse\">the nurse</a> said that Juliet was \"The prettiest babe that e’er I nursed.\" <a href=\"https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/why-its-so-hard-to-make-a-better-baby-formula\">In a pinch, Enfamil is the way to go</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mary-queen-of-scots-beheaded\">Mary Queen of Scots didn't come to a good end</a>. So maybe just read <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ebXe4I\">Shadowheart</a>?</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/mulatto/\">The Tragic Mulatto is a harmful anti-Black trope</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130609111712/http://www.wwltv.com/news/Garden-District-novelist-sentenced-in-FEMA-fraud-116964553.html\">Meagan McKinney defrauded the government during Katrina and landed in jail</a>, which is why we are never going to read one of her books for Fated Mates.</p>",
