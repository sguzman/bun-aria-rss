It’s also the home of trillions of microorganisms that aid in these processes and do so much more, like manage inflammation and produce neurotransmitters.</p><br><p>I was excited to talk to Dr. Emeran Mayer on this episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, all about nurturing the microbiome to support whole-body health and fight the epidemic of chronic disease. Dr. Emeran Mayer is the author of the recently released book <em>The Gut-Immune Connection</em> as well as <em>The Mind-Gut Connection</em>. He has studied brain-body interactions for the last forty years and is the executive director of the G. Oppenheimer Center for Neurobiology of Stress and Resilience, and the founding director of the UCLA Brain Gut Microbiome Center at the University of California at Los Angeles.
