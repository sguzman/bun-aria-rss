  "description": "<p>Joe Deros and Louis Katz met me in a park on the outskirts of Chinatown just to shoot the crap. Derosa and I drank Natty Lights. Katz kept his mask on the whole time. We got stared at by old Chinese people. A black dude named Freedom talked to us for far too long. It was a fun episode in the record-anywhere spirit of the Skeptic Tank. The mailbag part of it is something I do on my patreon. <a href=\"patreon.com/skeptictank\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Patreon.com/SkepticTank</a>.</p> <p>The Skanks table read live Pay Per View is Sunday, October 18 at 8pm Eastern time. You can <a href=\"https://ymhvirtual.com/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get tickets here</a>.</p> <p>The Sunday show at Stress Factory is What's Your F**king Deal. Big Jay hosts it. I'm either doing audience mic or doing the last set. The Friday and Saturday shows are just regular standup headline sets by me. Sunday is the only weird one. Come to both if you want, they'll be completely different. <a href= \"https://newbrunswick.stressfactory.com/events/40950\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get tickets here</a>. </p> <p>On my patreon, I do solo versions of mailbag questions from fans, sex/dating advice, arrest stories, and travel tales that I call Plogs. Also, I often put out ahead-of-time releases of podcasts before they go out to the public. Please join up to support me at <a href=\"patreon.com/skeptictank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">patreon.com/arishaffir</a></p> <p>This episode is literally brought to <a href= \"http://www.manscaped.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">manscaped.com</a>. Use promo code \"Skeptic\" to get 20% off your first order and FREE shipping. For real, I would not have done this episode if they weren't paying me. I would have just taken the week off. So thank them for making it happen.
