    "media:description": "In 2019, five Indian seafarers were #kidnapped in the Gulf of Guinea by Nigerian #pirates and held #hostage for more than two months. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è  \n\nIt all happened so fast. The moment I realized that all I was wearing was my underwear that I had gone to sleep in, was the same moment one of the pirates fired at the floor and a bullet fragment struck me in my left shin, lodging itself just an inch from the bone.\n\nPirate: \"GET UP NOW!!\" üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è\n\nThey marched us outside and onto the deck and then into a speedboat that was waiting for us next to the ship. We were now their hostages - 5 Indian Sailors and 1 Nigerian Captain - and they were taking us deep into the forest to await our fate. They tied us together on a platform the size of a car that was floating on a mangrove swamp and left us there as they celebrated their capture by firing shots in the air for nearly half an hour.\n\n#pirates #kidnapped #pirate",
