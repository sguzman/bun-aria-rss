By turning our homes into film sets, we’ve been able to keep creating content to help you get the most out of the web. </p><p>We're really looking forward to continuing to bring you information and best practices on policy topics this year, and hope you enjoy this series as much as we’ve enjoyed making it from my very own home studio.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image h-c-grid__col-l--2 h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-5 h-c-grid__col--offset-4\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"home office studio\" class=\"article-image--small\" data-loading='{\n                \"mobile\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screen_Shot_2021-03-24_at_14.12.20.max-500x500.png\",\n                \"desktop\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screen_Shot_2021-03-24_at_14.12.20.max-1000x1000.png\"\n              }' loading=\"lazy\" src=\" https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screen_Shot_2021-03-24_at_14.12.20.max-100x100.png \" tabindex=\"0\"/></a></div></div></div></body></html>",
