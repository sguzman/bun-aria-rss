  "description": "We tried something a little different this week—instead of reading a novel<br>or play, Andrew read Kio Stark's crowdfunded handbook Don't Go Back to<br>School. Stark interviews artists, writers, and entrepreneurs of various<br>stripes who all have one thing in common: they've found success despite not<br>having the credentials conferred by traditional educational institutions.<br>What followed was a discussion not just of the book, but of our own<br>personal experiences building careers without graduate degrees. This is a<br>fascinating topic, and if you have any of your own stories to share we'd<br>love to include them in future shows.<br><br>See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.<p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
