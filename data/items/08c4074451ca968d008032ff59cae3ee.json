  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, regarding election evidence and those ignorant of civil litigation, expedited discovery can be ordered by the court as an immediate remedy. Discovery has not even occurred in this case. Affidavits from credible individuals that raise a reasonable question are enough to establish a need for expedited discovery per the rules of civil procedure. Concerning the Constitutional challenges, per Article II Section II Clause II, each state's legislature has the power over election laws. State courts, County officials, Governors, or their appointees do not. Moreover, all voters must be treated the same under the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. How will history remember us during this time? Will history say that we are judicious and wise or that we abdicated our responsibility to protect our republic? Also, it's not easy to take on the government, but Sidney Powell has done it before and she's doing it again. It's bad enough when the usual enemies try to destroy someone like Powell, but it's unconscionable when others do the same thing. We need to let her do her job and let the chips fall where they may. She deserves our thanks, not our disdain. Then, even the ancient philosophers like John Stuart Mill never imagined communism or anything like it ever succeeding. Forcing the will of the government on the people is only supported by the worst parts of human nature. Later, Joe Biden will not support any funding for government-run schools like charter-operated public schools or school choice. Teachers' unions support these limitations on parents and students. Afterward, former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker calls in to discuss election results and irregularities in Wisconsin.. Walker added that absentee ballots must be requested, not handed out as they were in certain counties.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
