Business owners have told us the familiarity of our tools helps them get more done. And today, we’re offering even more features for Workspace Individual users. We’re announcing an increase to storage capacity and advances in email personalization for all customers. We’re also expanding our regional availability to bring Google Workspace Individual to even more business owners around the world.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"88d6j\">Grow your business — and the number of files you can store<br/></h3><p data-block-key=\"57f0q\">Soon every Google Workspace Individual account will come with 1 TB of secure cloud storage. You don’t have to lift a finger to get the upgraded storage: Every account will be automatically upgraded from their existing 15 GB of storage to 1 TB as we roll this out.</p><p data-block-key=\"5beef\">As you grow your business, it’s only natural that you’ll have more docs, data and digital assets to manage and store, and Google Drive allows you to do so securely from any device. You can store over 100 file types in Drive, including PDFs, CAD files and images, and you can easily collaborate on and edit Microsoft Office files without converting them. Plus, Drive comes with built-in protections against malware, spam and ransomware so you don’t need to worry about accidentally opening the door to malware just by opening a doc.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 h-c-grid__col--offset-2\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"A laptop and mobile device showing a variety of file types in Google Drive.\" class=\"article-image--large\" data-loading='{\n                \"mobile\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/drive_mockup.max-500x500.png\",\n                \"desktop\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/drive_mockup.max-1000x1000.png\"\n              }' loading=\"lazy\" src=\" https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/drive_mockup.max-100x100.png \" tabindex=\"0\"/></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"gxyfv\">Store over 100 file types in Google Drive</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"6fpx1\">Personalize emails with built-in mail merge</h3><p data-block-key=\"ee3mq\">We previously launched <a href=\"https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/07/new-integrated-marketing-tools-for-gmail.html\">multi-send mode</a>, which allows you to easily email many recipients while maintaining their privacy, making it great for sending newsletters and announcements.
