Also, after Shaq opened up about the time his credit card got declined at walmart, we opened up the phone lines to see if any of listeners had any similar situations with their credit card. Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to Taylor Swift for performing an Earth, Wind, and Fire song without some soul in her voice. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
