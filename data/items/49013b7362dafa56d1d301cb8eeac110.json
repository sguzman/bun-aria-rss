  "title": "#105: Lessons from a Navy SEAL on Resilience With Eric Greitens",
  "description": "<p>Eric Greitens is a Rhodes Scholar that started out his career as a humanitarian but then became a Navy SEAL. His book The Heart and the Fist makes that case that in order to be a good man, you have to be strong enough to fight for those you’re trying to do good for. His book Resilience is based around a series of letters between him and a SEAL buddy that was going through a rough time in his life with alcoholism, job loss, and PTSD. Greitens calls upon his background in philosophy to provide insights and advice for his struggling friend on how to develop resilience in the face of adversity. Eric and discuss what resilience is and how one develops it. We also talk about \"uneven courage\" the \"morality of intentions\" and how action proceeds feeling. An illuminating conversation. One of my favorites.</p>\n",
