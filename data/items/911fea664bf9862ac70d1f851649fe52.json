  "description": "MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor talked about why bitcoin is the best store of value in a new interview, soon after vowing to stick with buying the digital asset even as it comes under pressure.\n\n“There’s a $500 trillion monetary planet and the outer layer is currency, then you’ve got stocks, bonds, real estate. There’s $10 trillion worth of gold in there, $1 trillion of bitcoin in there. Bitcoin is going to flip gold, and it’s going to subsume the entire gold market cap...\n\n“Then it’s going to subsume negative-yielding sovereign debt and other monetary indexes until it grows to $100 trillion. Once it gets to $10 trillion, its volatility will be dramatically less,” Saylor said. “As it marches toward $100 trillion, you’re going to see the growth rates fall, the volatility fall, and it’s going to be a stabilizing influence in the entire financial system of the 21st century.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
