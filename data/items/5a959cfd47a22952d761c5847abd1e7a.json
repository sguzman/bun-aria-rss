  "description": "<div>The Stiff Socks crew get another shocking piece of information about 2fineblaustein: he doesn't know how to pee correctly? We take a deep dive not only into HOW Michael goes to the bathroom, but more importantly WHY he is this way. Plus the boys discuss why ladies have an impossible time holding their pee,  whether or not there are girl gorillas, the whole internet getting mad at Trevor about toilet paper, and why snorkeling is the least sexy thing in the world.  <br>\n<br>\n Want the full episode?
