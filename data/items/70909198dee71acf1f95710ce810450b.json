Topped with a splash of Ginger Ale or Tonic, Seedlip makes crafting adult, non-alcoholic cocktails easy at home. Made from the finest globally sourced botanical ingredients, Seedlip comes in  three varieties: The aromatic Spice 94, herbal Garden 108, and the citrus-forward Grove 42. All without alcohol, calories or sugar. As simple as adding a splash of premium mixer or 2 oz. of your preferred expression or challenging your bartending skills to create a more elevated serve. Seedlip enables you to have that evening drink – any night of the week. Delivered direct to your door via https://seedlipdrinks.com. And for a limited time, get 15% off your order by using the code FriendZone15 at checkout.  \n\nFollow us online:\nTwitter - https://www.twitter.com/friendzonepod\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/thefriendzonepodcast\n\nHave a GREAT day!",
