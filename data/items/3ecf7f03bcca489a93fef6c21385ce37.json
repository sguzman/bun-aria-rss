Globally, there is about $200 trillion of debt on the books.

So when a country borrows money, who or what is the “economic agent” responsible for taking on the debt?

Or do we need a new economic model that dispels some of the myths of the traditional model and offers a more ethical solution to the global debt crisis? John and Ken are held to account with Julie Nelson from the University of Massachusetts Boston, author of \"Economics For Humans.\"",
