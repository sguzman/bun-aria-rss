  "description": "<p>The trends of open science have enabled several open scholarly datasets which\ninclude millions of papers and authors. Managing, exploring, and utilizing such\nlarge and complicated datasets effectively are challenging. In recent years,\nthe knowledge graph has emerged as a universal data format for representing\nknowledge about heterogeneous entities and their relationships. The knowledge\ngraph can be modeled by knowledge graph embedding methods, which represent\nentities and relations as embedding vectors in semantic space, then model the\ninteractions between these embedding vectors. However, the semantic structures\nin the knowledge graph embedding space are not well-studied, thus knowledge\ngraph embedding methods are usually only used for knowledge graph completion\nbut not data representation and analysis. In this paper, we propose to analyze\nthese semantic structures based on the well-studied word embedding space and\nuse them to support data exploration. We also define the semantic queries,\nwhich are algebraic operations between the embedding vectors in the knowledge\ngraph embedding space, to solve queries such as similarity and analogy between\nthe entities on the original datasets. We then design a general framework for\ndata exploration by semantic queries and discuss the solution to some\ntraditional scholarly data exploration tasks. We also propose some new\ninteresting tasks that can be solved based on the uncanny semantic structures\nof the embedding space.\n</p>",
