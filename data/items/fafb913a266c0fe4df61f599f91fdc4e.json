Chicago; compelled Bill Gates to cram for economics courses at Harvard; lured Larry and Sergey to pursue computer science Ph.D.s at Stanford.  </p>\n<p>Impatience is what drove them all to drop out and start Apple, Oracle, Microsoft, and Google.</p>\n<p>Silicon Valley&rsquo;s cult of the drop-out pays homage to impatience &ndash; who has time for school when you&rsquo;re building a billion-dollar business? &ndash; but gives short shrift to curiosity which is the heart of innovation.</p>\n<p>Nothing fires a healthy impatience more than the desire to see a big idea, born of deep curiosity, brought to life.  As <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Jobs said</a>, \"remembering that you are going to die&rdquo; is a great motivator. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://medriscoll.com/2013/01/07/the-fuel-of-founders-curiosity-impatience/\">the fuel of founders: curiosity & impatience</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://medriscoll.com\">m. e. driscoll</a>.</p>\n",
