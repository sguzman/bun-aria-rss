  "description": "Today's podcast is on the book Six Impossible Things: The ‘Quanta of Solace’ and the Mysteries of the Subatomic World (Icon Book, 2019) by the noted author John Gribbin. Although there have been a number of good books on quantum mechanics, this short book is my favorite, and I recommend it highly.  The book details the central mystery of quantum mechanics, and outlines several interpretations that have been proposed.  I’ve never seen these interpretations so clearly and succinctly stated, and I’d recommend it to anyone who wants to understand how physicists have tried to come to grips with one of the Universe’s most perplexing mysteries.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
