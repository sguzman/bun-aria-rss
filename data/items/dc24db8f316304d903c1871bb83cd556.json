  "description": "Today's guest is David Bainbridge, author of \"Fur War 1765-1840,\" which focuses on the catastrophic - and previously overlooked - elements of the Western fur trade in North America.<br /><br />We discuss how the many First Nations fought to maintain their communities and local ecology while Russia, Great Britain, America, France, Spain, Mexico, and Hawaii contested for furs and power.
