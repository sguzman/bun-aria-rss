In the case of the latter, the internet has in recent years emerged as a new space for conflict with the rise of cyberwarfare and cybersecurity as domains of politics, creating an entirely new horizon of possibility for conflict and war.\n\n\nFrom ransomware and monitoring to the undermining of elections and the hollowing out of democracy, issues of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare have become existential political concerns â€“ and yet, governments around the world have struggled to respond to the new threats the world of the cyber has presented to the state.\n\n\nTo help make sense of the politics of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare Iâ€™m joined this week by Alex Rudolph.
