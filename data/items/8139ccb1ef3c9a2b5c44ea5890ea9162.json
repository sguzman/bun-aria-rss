  "description": "Both our first reading and Gospel for this week speak of the importance of keeping our attention riveted on God. The three angels visit Abraham, and he drops everything in order to receive them with hospitality; Jesus comes to her home, and Mary sits at his feet, listening to his words. When God is the absolute priority in our lives, everything else that we are worried about about falls into place. Augustine said, \"love God and do what you want.\" This implies that once God is the unambiguous center of our lives, we can confidently arrange and respond to all of our particular concerns.",
