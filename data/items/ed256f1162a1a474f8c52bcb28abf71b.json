  "description": "<p>The Indian agricultural sector being in a constant phase of upgradation, has\nbeen on the road to modernization for the last couple of years. The fundamental\nsource of livelihood for over 70 percent of the population living in rural\nparts of the country is still agriculture. The average Indian farmer, although\nhas access to raw and trend data pertaining to crop prices, yield and demand\nfrom Indian government and private websites, still struggles to make the right\nchoices. They are constantly faced with the dilemma of choosing the right crop\nto address market demand and fetch them a decent profit. Since the process of\nshortlisting crops amongst the many suitable ones isn't completely scientific\nand usually dictated by area tradition, this project has aimed to address that\nissue by forecasting the price of those crops and uses that to create an\noptimal portfolio that the farmers can obtain to arrive at a data-driven\ndecision for crop selection with optimal estimated ROI.\n</p>",
