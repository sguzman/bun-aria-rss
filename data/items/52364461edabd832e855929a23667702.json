  "description": "<p>For Western audiences, the past few weeks have been a torrent of information about what’s happening in Russia and Ukraine. Daily updates of Russian military advances. Horrifying videos of buildings exploding and innocent civilians being killed. Announcements of increasingly severe economic sanctions and major corporate pullouts.

This week, the Russian government <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/world/europe/russia-censorship-media-crackdown.html\" target=\"_blank\">made it a crime</a> for journalists to spread what it considers false information about the “special military operation” in Ukraine — information that would include calling the war a war. As a result, many Western news organizations, including The Times, have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/business/media/new-york-times-russia-press-freedom.html\" target=\"_blank\">pulled their employees out of Russia</a>.
