  "description": "<p>We forgot to mention the announcement of Pikmin 4 on last week's Besties, maybe because we've been so content with Tinykin, which blends Nintendo's real-time strategy game with chunks of 3D Mario and a heaping cup of Dreamcast magic. After explaining why this colorful indie is worth a download (especially if you have Game Pass) we return to Immortality, this time without fear of spoilers. Plante finally gets to make use of all that time spent on the Criterion Channel. We also chat about Delicatessan and Disney Dreamlight Valley, the latter of which will get the full Besties treatment next week. [Ed. note: A small correction for the episode. True Lies is back on a streaming service! You can currently watch the James Cameron action-comedy on Hulu.]</p>\n",
