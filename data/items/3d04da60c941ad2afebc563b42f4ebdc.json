  "description": "<div>At 10:44pm on May 31, 1995, a woman named Jennifer Fairgate checked into the Plaza Hotel in Oslo, Norway. It was the most exclusive hotel in Norway at the time. Two days into her stay, a security officer at the hotel knocked on the door to her room. Within seconds a gunshot rang out. When the police arrived, they found the woman dead on the bed. It turned out that she'd given a false name at check in. So who was this woman? Did she die by suicide or was she the victim of a murder? Was she a secret agent who had been assimilated on the job?
