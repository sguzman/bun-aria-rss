  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking. This week's breakdown is starting with Alibaba (BABA). Originally, the Chinese e-commerce company received loads of skepticism in regards to their deliverability and figures. Basically, analysts didn't believe the financials. But that was two years ago... Recently, the stock has been delivering some solid numbers that you can't ignore. The company is seeing its highest growth in revenues since their IPO... mobile use is stretching past 500 million monthly users... and not mention, Chinese e-commerce is skyrocketing. This company is no longer a momentum play. And to start off today's stream of Q&A's, I explain why. Switching gears, I then turn my focus to General Electric (GE). I completely understand the concerns for the short-term investors... The stock has sold off a bit... Deutsche Bank recently placed a sell rating on the stock... and cash concerns continue to push analysts away. But as I explain, there are still plenty of over-looked, long-term catalysts. Other topics talked about: BlackBird Energy's (BBI.V) recent drilling troubles, and just a little more politics. No personal hard feelings here. My concerns have very much to do with the financial markets. Special thanks to Larry, Howard, Faye, John, and Derek for all the questions. Keep em' coming at Frank@curzioresearch.com Good Investing, Frank Curzio",
