  "description": "Today Jana Byars talks to Jean Halley, Professor of Sociology at the College of Staten Island and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York about her new book Horse Crazy: Girls and the Lives of Horses (University of Georgia Press, 2019).\nPart memoir, part heavy-hitting theoretical exploration, this delightfully readable book explores the relationship between horses and humans, and how girls develop relationships with horses and subvert dominant narratives about gender roles and heteronormativity.\nProfessor Halley works on the intersection of affective relationships, identity construction, and power, often as these intersections interact with horses. She is the author of The Parallel Lives of Women and Cows: Meat Markets (Palgrave 2012) and Boundaries of Touch: Parenting and Adult-Child Intimacy (Illinois, 2007) as well as the editor of Seeing Straight, Seeing White, and The Affective Turn.\nAs well as her academic and hybrid academic/memoir work, Halley writes creative non-fiction. Killing Deer, a beautifully written and slightly devastating short, was published in Harper’s Magazine.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
