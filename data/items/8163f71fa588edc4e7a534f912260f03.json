  "description": "This week, the gals sharpen their skates and jump into some icy incidents. Topics include a quasi-Nazi with a questionable business plan, some incredible mid-90s fashion, and a Minnesotan coach's f*cked-up fixation. Crack open a bottle of Gorgeous Pinot Noir Chardonnay, practice your death spiral (check), and tune in for Figure Skating Crimes.",
