  "description": "<p>Tonight we speak with Norm who is a retired California Highway Patrolman. Norm goes into great detail about what he saw back in 1958 on his father's property. He said “We were doing work for my father on the property when this thing showed up. Keep in mind this is the late 50’s and no one talked about Bigfoot or Sasquatch like they do today.</p> <p>I got a great look at it, we tried to keep up with it in this 1941 pickup. I would be happy to come on and share what I saw many years ago. I eventually became a police officer and never spoke about what I saw. There was other strange things going on that property but it was always blamed on something else.\"</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Visit our website</strong> <a href= \"https://sasquatchchronicles.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><strong>HERE</strong></a> <strong>for additional weekly shows and exclusive content.</strong></p>",
