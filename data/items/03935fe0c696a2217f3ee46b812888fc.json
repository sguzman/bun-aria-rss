  "description": "<p class=\"\">We are very pro health care workers these days — we love all of you…doctors, nurses, EMTs, home health aides…if you know how to work a stethoscope, we’re into you.

We’re all just doing our best.</p><p class=\"\">We love having you with us! — subscribe on your favorite podcasting platform and like/review the podcast, please!</p><p class=\"\">Next week, we’re reading Susan Elizabeth Phillips’s <em>Nobody’s Baby But Mine</em>, and we cannot WAIT. We know it’s tough to get it in print, but find it in e at your local library or at: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WiAESV\">Amazon</a> (free in Kindle Unlimited!), <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nobodys-baby-but-mine-susan-elizabeth-phillips/1100615871?ean=9780061793219\">Barnes & Noble</a>, <a href=\"https://books.apple.com/us/book/nobodys-baby-but-mine/id360604617?mt=11&app=itunes&at=1l3vpAR\">Apple Books</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/nobody-s-baby-but-mine\">Kobo</a>, or in print, mailed from <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780380782345\">your local indie</a> (which is probably still shipping!).</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\">As we all shelter in place, romance twitter has been very entertaining. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/The_Julia_Kelly/status/1240306369355530248\">Julia Kelly posted a thread where she posed her pets as romance novel covers</a>, and everyone had fun with it. Sarah also loved this one about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pete_schultz/status/1240472553136754688\">a dog who howls along with the Law and Order theme song</a>.</p><p class=\"\">We forgot to tell you last week when we talked about Devil's Bride that Stephanie Laurens has a new book out, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/39jP4ou\">The Inevitable Fall of Christopher Cynster</a>. We also have added information about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blackbirdnflght/status/1240398527425130502\">how to pronounce Honoria</a> and details about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeroJourdan/status/1242358738847227908\">peach silk</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Now is the time to get the BookBub <a href=\"https://www.bookbub.com/ebook-deals/contemporary-romance-ebooks\">daily romance email</a>. Here's <a href=\"https://www.bookbub.com/authors/sarah-maclean\">Sarah's Bookbub page</a>.</p><p class=\"\">The nurse and doctor books were the backbone of early Mills and Boon romances, and the forerunner of the modern <a href=\"https://www.harlequin.com/shop/brand/harlequin-medical-romance.html\">Harlequin Medical Romance</a>; whereas Americans often find <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/01/24/tv-medical-dramas-trend-life-death/1058523001/\">big, soapy hospital dramas on TV</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budleigh_Salterton\">Budleigh Salterton</a> looks like a very nice place to hang out unless you are a bored American 12 year old.</p><p class=\"\">The roots of American and British romance are different, as proven by <a href=\"https://lithub.com/the-unexpectedly-subversive-world-of-romance-novels/\">this absolutely WRONG LitHub romance essay</a>. (They're <a href=\"https://lithub.com/thank-god-for-the-sex-i-found-in-my-mothers-romance-novels/\">wrong about romance</a> a lot.)</p><p class=\"\">Sarah has talked about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radclyffe\">Radclyffe</a> and the origin of Bold Strokes Books, but many of her romances are about doctors or set in hospitals.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1175892103727128580\">Jen doesn't really care too much about job details</a>. Sorry not sorry.</p><p class=\"\">No one likes a <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/a-brief-history-of-bloodletting\">Bloodletter</a>. We want our historical doctors to be foreward thinking. Or as Eloisa James does in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2vLNm1w\">When Beauty Tamed the Beast</a>, use a modern <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/g20265405/house-tv-show-facts-trivia/\">TV character like House</a> as model for a hero.</p><p class=\"\">In Tempest, Jen spoke out inequities in acess to medical care for black patients, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/upshot/doctors-and-racial-bias-still-a-long-way-to-go.html\">that's still true today.</a></p><p class=\"\">If you're looking to see some \"don't fuck your doctor\" romances that definitely fall somewhere on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1142410957467148289\">the Simone Scale</a>. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2wCjDsd\">Wrong by Jana Aston</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/33I5GFm\">Medicine Man by Saffron Kent</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Jurgen Klopp wants you to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brfootball/status/1237830182674878471\">put your hands away</a>, and this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lauralexx/status/1238601779773952005\">amazing thread by comedian Laura Lexx</a> and support all the Liverpool fans out there (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1242266684368412673\">especially Jen's brother</a>).</p><p class=\"\">Jen's cool TikTok project is up and running, she's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1242253055749431297\">interviewing YA authors</a> and hoping to get kids to read while they are sheltering in place.</p><p class=\"\">You can order <a href=\"https://www.jenreadsromance.com/shop\">buttons from Kelly</a> and <a href=\"https://jordandene.com/collections/romance-sarah-maclean\">t-shirts from Jordandene</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Next time, we'll be reading <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dtKxmU\">Nobody's Baby But Mine</a> by Susan Elizabeth Phillips.</p>",
