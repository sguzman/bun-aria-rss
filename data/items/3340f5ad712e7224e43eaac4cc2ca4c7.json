  "description": "Contrary to what those outside the Deep State may think, the U.S. government has recently undergone an explosion of creativity.  Recently we have seen a National Security Strategy, a National Defense Strategy and a Nuclear Posture Review.  Some think these are just empty academic exercises. But others, like our guests the Atlantic Council’s Christine Wormuth, Georgetown’s Rosa Brooks and Kori Schake, soon to be of the IISS, see more.   They see divisions between senior officials.  They see a president who doesn’t know what any of these documents say or mean.  And, with a special eye on nukes, they see plenty of good reason to invest now in a used missile silo.
