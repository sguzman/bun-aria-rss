Nikole Hannah Jones, working with Renee Watson, turned the <em>1619 Project</em> into a picture book called <em>Born On The Water</em>. They told NPR their goal was \"to say to young people - to young Black Americans, you belong here.\" Next, Adam Rubin has on his collection of short stories that are all different but share the same title: <em>The Ice Cream Machine</em>. Rubin told NPR's Rachel Martin that there are so many ways to tell a story. This is an encore episode from March 2022. ",
