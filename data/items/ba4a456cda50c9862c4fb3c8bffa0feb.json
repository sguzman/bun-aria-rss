  "description": "First up is a VC Sunday school where Jason discusses what investors mean when they say \"we are interested in investing, but come back when you found a lead\" (1:51). Then, we tease Molly&#039;s EV review of the Audi e-tron Sportback (20:42). To wrap, Molly does a This Week in Climate Startups segment with Seth Bannon (recorded on 2/9/22), a founding Partner of Fifty Years, a Venture capital firm investing in climate solutions (34:12). You will learn:\n\n1. The convictions that unpin Fifty Years&#039; investment thesis\n2. Why Seth thinks VC has lost his way\n3. Why increasing longevity could be a net-positive for climate\n4. How Fifty Years measures impact of their investments\n5. How Seth evaluates the potential negative externalities of his investments\n6. How his PhD to VC program works",
