  "description": "Nickel &#038; Kiela had a great paper on embedding graphs in hyperbolic space at NIPS 2017. They work with the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space. This is just the interior of the unit ball, equipped with an appropriate Riemannian metric. This metric is conformal, meaning that the inner product on the tangent spaces on &#8230; <p class=\"link-more\"><a href=\"https://building-babylon.net/2018/04/10/gradient-optimisation-on-the-poincare-disc/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> \"Gradient optimisation on the Poincaré disc\"</span></a></p>",
