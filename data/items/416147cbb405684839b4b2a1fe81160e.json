  "description": "<div>George and Kathy Lutz knew that the experience they endured, that would later me known as The Amityville Horror was real. Their drive to be believed and understood led them to an array of paranormal experts, religious figures and media personalities. On the night of March 6, 1976, reporter Laura Didio would help to put together a massive team of these personalities to investigate and understand exactly what, was happening at 112 Ocean Avenue. This would be a night none of them would ever forget. Members of the Channel 5 camera crew would get violently ill and have visions they couldn’t explain. Sensitives would become overwhelmed and be forced to leave. And the spirit of what appears to be a ghost boy was caught on camera. This night would later be dubbed the Amityville Horror “psychic sleepover”.<br>\n<br>\nGet all of our bonus interviews and episodes at <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks\">http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks</a><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
