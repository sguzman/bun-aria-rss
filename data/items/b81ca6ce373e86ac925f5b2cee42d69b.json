  "title": "Ryan Coogler: Bay Area Bae",
  "description": "Ryan Coogler is not your average Hollywood auteur, seeing as he is a) incredibly talented; b) apparently generous and gracious; c) fine as hell and d) fresh out of the Bay. All those things — and more — are what make him so very special. In this episode we take a closer look at Mr Coogler's back catalogue and back story, how he interacts with the women in his casts and crews, and what that accent of his does to our [REDACTED]. And in this week's Fanfic Wars, there are audible gasps, scandalised laughs and uncomfortable gulps of air.\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line! Leave us a message at (765) 8-THIRST (765-884-4778) with your name and what kind of crush advice you're looking for, and maybe we'll answer your question in an upcoming Thirst Sommelier. \nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit.
