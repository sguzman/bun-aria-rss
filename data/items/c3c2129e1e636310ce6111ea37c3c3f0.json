  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing how some movements that started well intentioned are now being somewhat abandoned by people who were previously all in on the message but have started to see some cracks in the foundation. They also explore someone that Adam heard on Dennis Prager's show who has written a piece about how young people are starting to see the societal value in being a member of a protected group which may be leading to more young people transitioning or identifying as something they may not be. They also turn to the phones and speak to a few callers on topics from forgiving student loan debt, and another with a question about abandonment issues.\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nGetRoman.com/ADS\nBonafide.com/ADS\nGuruNanda.com/Win",
