  "description": "Amy Lynn Bradley. March 24, 1998. A family trip aboard a Caribbean cruise ship seemed like a great idea. Ron & Iva Bradley, along with their two grown children, Amy & Brad, were not able to enjoy the trip for long. Just a few days into their vacation, around 6am, Amy went missing. A frantic search by the family found no trace of her. The cruise line would offer little assistance. Adding to their worries was the discovery that photos of Amy taken by the ship's photo service went missing hours before she did. Had she been kidnapped? Was she thrown overboard? Where is Amy Lynn Bradley?\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
