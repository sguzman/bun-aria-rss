  "description": "<p>Buying new stuff makes us happy, right? Yeah for a minute, but you may have noticed how quickly you get used to all that new stuff! Hedonic adaptation, or the hedonic treadmill, helps us understand the effect of consumption. Coming to grips with that can help us end unhealthy cycles of mindless consumerism and set us on a path to a healthier way of thinking about money, spending, and saving for the future. Listen to the full episode to learn how hedonic adaptation can be terrible, how it can actually be a good thing, and then finally to learn how to hack it and truly control how happy you really are.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Mangifera Flux by Marz Community Brewing which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. A huge thanks to our buddy Andrew for bringing this beer all the way back from Chicago.
