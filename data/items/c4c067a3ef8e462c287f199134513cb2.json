After years of working on conventional farms for some big names, she moved to <a href= \"https://www.veramonte.cl/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Veramonte</a>. She helped transition the over 500 ha/1,235 acres to 100% ECOCERT certified organic vineyards. Veramonte represents 15% of all organic vineyards in Chile.</p> <p> </p> <p>Sofía is now the head winemaker and oversees the organic Veramonte and Ritual and the organic and biodynamic properties of Neyen and Primus.  All are under the umbrella of Sherry-based Gonzalez Byass.</p> <p> </p> <p>Although this may seem like a mega-brand because of its excellent distribution, it actually turns out that <a href= \"https://www.veramonte.cl/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Veramonte</a> and its sister brands – <a href= \"https://www.ritualwines.cl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Ritual</a>, <a href=\"https://primuswines.cl/en/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Primus</a>, and <a href= \"https://www.neyen.cl/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Neyen</a> – make just 200,000 cases of wine a year (2.4 million bottles) combined. That’s the size of a medium brand at a big hulking winery!</p> <p> </p> <p>Two things that are important:</p> <p>1. Sofía and I jump right in on the geography.
