  "description": "<p>Batteries for electric vehicles and stationary storage are increasingly in demand. But while ever-cheaper batteries were expected only a couple of years ago, supply turbulence for the key metals needed has increased prices in 2022 and made future costs uncertain. Depending on the chemistry selected, battery metals can make up 60-80% of a battery’s total cost. Alongside human rights concerns, metals prices have led battery manufacturers to take a closer look at their chemistries. </p>\n<p>In today’s episode of Switched On, we speak with Kwasi Ampofo, head of metals and mining at BNEF, about the outlook for battery metals – specifically, lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and graphite. This episode draws upon the research found in BNEF’s 1H 2022 Battery Metals Outlook: Supply Turbulence Ahead, which can be found at BNEF on the Bloomberg Terminal, at bnef.com, or via our mobile app.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
