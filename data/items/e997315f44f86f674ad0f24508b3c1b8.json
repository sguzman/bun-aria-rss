  "description": "David Schmalz is a staff writer at the Monterey County Weekly, where his longform pieces have won numerous awards from the California News Publishers Association, including a first place for enterprise reporting in 2014 for an expose he wrote about a local church's attempt to evict residents from 98 federally subsidized apartments from a property it managed. Those residents were able to keep their homes, and the property remains the largest affordable housing complex on the Monterey Peninsula.\nHis reporting also helped lead to the closure of the last remaining coastal sand mine in America, as well as overturning the approvals for one of the largest proposed developments in Monterey County history, which would have razed tens of thousands of coast live oaks to build single family homes and a horse-racing track.\nOther than the four years he's spent working or traveling abroad, Schmalz has lived and worked his entire life in California.\nAgata Popeda is a Polish-American journalist. Interested in everything, with a particular weakness for literature and foreign relations.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
