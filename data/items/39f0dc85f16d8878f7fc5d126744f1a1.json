  "description": "We have on the show this week, Shane Durgee who was the vocalist for the pre-Earth Crisis band called Framework. Often overlooked in the lore of Syracuse hardcore, I wanted to have Shane on to discuss what the early days of that scene was like. The episode also serves as a compendium to a previous episode that we did a few weeks ago with Scott Crouse from Earth Crisis about each of their full lengths. Shane and I get in depth with some fun EC stories and more.
