  "title": "Russia's new internet firewall",
  "description": "A law is coming into effect in Russia that will redefine the way internet is governed in the country. Russia says the law will allow internet providers to filter content to ‘protect’ its citizens. It wants Russian data to remain within its border and prevent outside forces from disrupting its internal internet infrastructure. Critics say, the law virtually allows the government to disconnect from the outside world and impose total control over the flow of information. They say it will stifle dissent and free speech. It is also argued that the law will put at risk sensitive information of foreign companies doing business there. So is Russia taking a step back from an integrated global internet system? Will its attempt to raise a digital wall inspire other nations to follow suit? How will the changes affect Russian economy, society, and freedom of expression? Will people find a way to undermine that system? And what are the lessons Moscow has learned from China’s ‘great firewall’? James Coomarasamy and guests discuss Russia and its internet.",
