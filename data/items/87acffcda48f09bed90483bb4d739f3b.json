  "description": "<p>Meet Cecily. She is a 525 lb. father of three and the star and producer of the incredible new musical comedy series Schmigadoon! on Apple TV+. She's also CECILY STRONG, baby!!! Matt and Bowen are joined by one of the best to ever do it who is a recent Emmy nominee for SNL and truly a dream guest for Las Cultch. Cecily shares what it was like to stage and perform the numbers in her new show, work with the fully insane cast (Chenoweth, Dove, hot Aaron Tveit) and sing live, \"Les Miz style\". Also, RHONY (Cecily does a Ramona and you....must hear it) and RHOBH (Cecily does a Dorit and you......MUST hear it), the impact of Strangers with Candy and true clown Amy Sedaris, Bottle Rocket and Owen Wilson culture, thoughts on All Stars 6 and memories from favorite SNL sketches (AKA the Terrazano's sketch with Ryan Gosling. Seriously, look it up). Do you like shitting in a public restroom? Don't you think Cici's Pizza should stay open as marijuana legalizes nationwide? Big questions. Cecily (obviously a full star on this ep) has a book coming out: This Will All Be Over Soon. Pre-order that!!! And stream Schmigadoon!....you baroque bitch ;-)</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
