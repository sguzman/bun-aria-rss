It's about making the choice to either stay in your comfort zone, locked down by self-imposed stories, or to step outside of that and shine the light onto what you are capable of.</p><p>Here's an excerpt from the blog post where I tell Barry's story:</p><p><em>I love Barry’s story.</em></p><p><em>Not just because he’s part of our GLP family. Not just because he’s bringing a wonderful story into the world and stepping into his craft as a writer.</em></p><p><em>But because his journey has been a beautiful example of what can happen when you commit to a process of discovery and openness and vulnerability. When you allow all the assumptions about what you should be to fall away and step into what you&nbsp;are. When you’re willing to share your voice with the world, hold yourself out to be on the one hand, judged, but on the other, embraced and lifted.</em></p><p>If you'd like to read this full story, it's written on Jonathan's blog at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jonathanfields.com/courting-monster/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jonathanfields.com/courting-monster/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
