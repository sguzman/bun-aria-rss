  "description": "<div>On 15-16 October the European Council will take stock of the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and review the state of the negotiations on the future EU-UK partnership. Leaders will discuss preparatory work for all scenarios after 1 January 2021. The timetable is very tight, with October seen as the last deadline for reaching an agreement that could then be ratified in time for entry into force by the end of the current transition period.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>In this live recording session of The Sound of Economics, Bruegel’s scholars took a step back and provided the background, as well as outline the key issues at stake necessary to follow the discussions at the Council and understand the ongoing negotiations. We also engaged in an informed debate with the audience on the post-Brexit scenarios.<br>\n<br>\n The podcast host, Giuseppe Porcaro, was joined by Maria Demertzis, André Sapir, and Guntram Wolff.<br>\n<br>\nTo read more about Bruegel's research on Brexit, please check: <a href=\"https://www.bruegel.org/tag/brexit/\">https://www.bruegel.org/tag/brexit/</a>.</div>\n",
