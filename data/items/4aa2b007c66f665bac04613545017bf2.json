  "description": "<p><strong>Andy Stanley wants us to rethink how we read the Bible.</strong> In his new book, <em>Irresistible</em>, he addresses questions like: What do we do with the Old Testament commands? Are Christians obligated to follow the 10 Commandments? What did Jesus think of the Old Covenant? </p> <p>In this episode, Tony Morgan asks Andy to weigh in on why a \"Mix & Match Theology\" is so prevalent in our churches, why Jesus' one command makes our faith generationally transferrable, and how we go back to where our faith began to better understand how to connect with the next generation.</p> <p>Check out the show notes for more resources on this topic, links from this episode and to join the conversation at <strong><a href= \"https://theunstuckgroup.com/episode60\">theunstuckgroup.com/episode60.</a></strong></p>",
