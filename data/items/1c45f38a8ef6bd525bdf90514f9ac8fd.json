  "description": "<p>Tonight the show starts off with my brother Woody who somehow got on the 200th show (Just joking he was invited) and he wanted to ask me some questions.</p> <p>Next up is Bob Garrett who shares with us his first encounter when he was 16 years old. Bob has never shared this before on my show and it is a very interesting encounter. I also announce that Bob and his group will be bringing back their radio show The Big Thicket Watch right here on Sasquatch Chronicles. Look for their upcoming show.</p> <p>Tomorrow night I welcome Bear, Coonbo and Matt from Bigfoot Outlaw Radio as well as many other guests. I also want to thank the listeners and past guest for making Sasquatch Chronicles what it is. Thank you guys!</p>",
