If these topics are triggering to you, I suggest skipping this episode.</div> <div class=\"ql-block\" data-block-id= \"block-c5ff9baf-6e93-407f-9df1-efd939919b07\"> </div> <div class=\"ql-block\" data-block-id= \"block-88358817-0c96-45a0-a96d-9e82c8adf8ff\">This isn't an easy topic for me to talk about. It's still very fresh in my mind, and I get really emotional trying to talk about it, but I'm doing it anyway. I'm doing it because I know someone needs to hear it—someone needs to know that they're not alone and they don't have to be ashamed. Or someone needs to realize that they're heading toward a bad situation, and they can still stop it before it's too late.</div> <div class=\"ql-block\" data-block-id= \"block-89170fd6-3d73-4489-93bd-55104721c83e\"> </div> <div class=\"ql-block\" data-block-id= \"block-2b85e18e-f3fb-46c3-9593-65a1d4205718\">I'm coming on today to talk about my experience with severe burnout, and how it led to anxiety, depression, lost sleep, and ultimately a hospitalization. Now, rest assured, I'm fine now—I got through it, and I want you to know that you can, too. But I'm hoping that by sharing my story, I can help you all avoid falling into the same situation I found myself in.</div> <div class=\"ql-block\" data-block-id= \"block-ac7e7c47-cfcf-4a37-b73a-b963d54212d2\"> </div> <div class=\"ql-block\" data-block-id= \"block-0dbde0b6-19d7-48ea-be95-b9ba3876438b\">Just because it isn't easy doesn't mean it doesn't need to be done.
