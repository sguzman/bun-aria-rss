  "description": "<p>EPISODE 162- Roberto Schaefer - Cinematographer</p> <p>Team Deakins is joined by cinematographer Roberto Schaefer (THE KITE RUNNER, QUANTUM OF SOLACE, MONSTER’S BALL) for a great conversation. In this episode, we discuss Roberto’s journey into the industry (a serendipitous one). Roberto talks about his experiences working with directors Christopher Guest and Marc Forster, both of whom he has collaborated with many times. We learn what Roberto’s approach was to lighting the film Best In Show and how he will not take a job if his initial reaction is clouded with doubt – he believes in following your instincts! We discuss the lighting cameraman, preserving a single vision while shooting multiple cameras, the rise of sky panels, shooting for television, and much more!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>",
