  "description": "More women are putting off having kids, which means the egg freezing business is booming. But with the process costing thousands and thousands of dollars, egg freezing is mostly a luxury good at this point. Unless you're willing to donate your eggs to someone else at the same time you freeze them for yourself. The Cut’s B.A. Parker talks to journalist Anna Louie Sussman about the logistics and ethics of egg freeze and share programs, and how different women feel about giving away their eggs in order to gain a shot at becoming parents later in life.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
