  "description": "Ska was born in Jamaica in the 1950's. It was declared over at least twice. The first wave pettered out in the 1960's as Reggae took hold. Then in the early 1980's, post-punk Ska was suddenly deemed passe. \n\nBut on both occasions, Ska rose from the dead and came back even stronger. \n\nSka is not onto its 3rd wave...and that's where we are going.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
