  "description": "<p>In the Gospel accounts of the life of Jesus, we often see people responding to what Jesus has claimed about who he is. John the Baptist asks Jesus: “Are you the one?” This sermon explores why that question is so important, and what Jesus’s answer is. We will see: 1) John’s condition; 2) John’s question; 3) Jesus’ credentials; and 4) Jesus’ challenge.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 7, 2014. Series: Matthew 11 - The One Who Gives You Rest. Scripture: Matthew 11:1-6.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
