Multi-label ramen eatery <a href=\"https://ramenchampion.com.sg/\">Ramen Champion</a> has launched the <strong>Tori Paitan Stamina Shio Ramen </strong>(S$18.80), its in-house creation that features a soup made wholly with chicken. This ramen features a collagen-rich soup base that takes over 12 hours of painstaking preparation, during which chicken, vegetables, three kinds of sea salt and garlic are simmered to bring out their essential flavours. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31451\" style=\"width: 1810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-31451 size-full\" src=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_3807-e1665461877994.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1219\" srcset=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_3807-e1665461877994.jpg 1800w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_3807-e1665461877994-300x203.jpg 300w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_3807-e1665461877994-1024x693.jpg 1024w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_3807-e1665461877994-768x520.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Tori Paitan Stamina Shio Ramen comes with a heap of vegetables.

This results in a fall-off-the-bone and deeply flavoured meat. For those with hearty appetites, you will be glad to note that this ramen is Jiro-style, which evolved from the need to feed hungry blue-collar workers and students during Tokyo’s redevelopment from the 1960s-70s with flavourful and reasonably-priced ramen that came in large portions. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thick and chewy flat noodles are used in the Tori Paitan Stamina Shio Ramen, which is topped with a huge heap of beansprouts and cabbage that makes the bowl look mountainous. A flowy Ajitama (ramen egg) and ninniku (garlic) round out the dish.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31452\" style=\"width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_3817.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-31452\" src=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_3817.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" srcset=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_3817.jpg 1920w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_3817-300x200.jpg 300w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_3817-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_3817-300x200@2x.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Mr Koichi Horikawa, general manager and chef behind the new ramen version.
