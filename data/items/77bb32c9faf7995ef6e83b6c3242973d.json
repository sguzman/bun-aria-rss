  "description": "TW: Violence towards Black people is discussed in the last 30 minutes of this episode.<br>The Broads spend the first half of the episode discussing some of Bachelor Nation happenings, specially those coupled with Black Lives Matter - they chat about Chris Harrison, Ben Higgins, Hannah Brown’s “second” apology, Bekah and Garrett Y’s Instagram confrontation, the other Garret’s post, and Jess’ battle with “being” performative. They are then joined by the amazing TAYLOR NOLAN (host of podcast “Let’s Talk About It”) to discuss being performative, being antiracist, and much more! And lastly, our special front lines protest reporter, comedian Craig Conant, stops by and comes in HOT talking about the numerous protests he has attended, what he has seen of looting and police brutality at the protests, some history lessons, and more! <br>*Chatty Broads will only have ONE episode a week until the week of July 6th to give Bekah a little more down time in her final days of pregnancy and post birth.
