  "description": "The left's crazy closing argument: Vote Democrat or we're Nazi Germany. Buck says, \"The Democrats who are bringing up comparisons to Nazi Germany are emotionally unwell. There's something wrong with them.\" Clay says it's odd because some of those speaking out are highly educated people who make sense on other issues, like historian Michael Beschloss. MSNBC analysts say, like Beschloss also has, if Republicans win the midterms, democracy may be over. Georgia Senate candidate and football great Herschel Walker joins Clay and Buck to discuss the state of his race. Fetterman goes on The View.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
