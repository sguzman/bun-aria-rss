    "media:description": "Throughout the ages, people have debated whether Judaism is a religion, a culture, or a nationality…and where Israel fits into the mix.  In fact, the Jewish experience encompasses all of these. \nWhile different denominations such as Reform, Modern Orthodox, or Haredi Jews may focus on different elements to define how they relate to their Judaism,  there is a shared understanding that despite these differences, Jews still make up one Peoplehood based on so much more than just religion.\n\nThis series is part of a partnership with the Z3 Project.
