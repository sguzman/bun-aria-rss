  "description": "<p>YOUR SUCCESS IS IN YOUR OWN HANDS.<br />\nWhat does it take to be a champion?<br />\nYou have to love what you do.<br />\nYou have to care about the little details that other people let slide. And you have to have deep, unshakable confidence. A lot of what separates a player from a champion is mental. We can’t ignore the importance of keeping our mind away from the negative and focused on the end goal. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I’m sharing the most inspirational clips of interviews with the world’s greatest female athletes: Maria Sharapova, Katrin Tanja Davíðsdóttir, Michelle Waterson, Sasha Digiulian, Brooke Ence, The Bella twins, Emily Skye, and Danica Patrick.

We can all get distracted by self-doubt, comparing ourselves to others, and focusing on the wrong things. But we can train ourselves to have the mindset of a champion. It feels good to be great at what you do. Get ready to learn step into your greatness on Episode 803.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhy are you so driven to be the best?
