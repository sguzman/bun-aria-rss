  "description": "<p>We extend our earlier work on the compositional structure of cybernetic\nsystems in order to account for the embodiment of such systems. All their\ninteractions proceed through their bodies' boundaries: sensations impinge on\ntheir surfaces, and actions correspond to changes in their configurations. We\nformalize this morphological perspective using polynomial functors. The\n'internal universes' of systems are shown to constitute an indexed category of\nstatistical games over polynomials; their dynamics form an indexed category of\nbehaviours. We characterize 'active inference doctrines' as indexed functors\nbetween such categories, resolving a number of open problems in our earlier\nwork, and pointing to a formalization of the 'free energy principle' as adjoint\nto such doctrines. We illustrate our framework through fundamental examples\nfrom biology, including homeostasis, morphogenesis, and autopoiesis, and\nsuggest a formal connection between spatial navigation and the process of\nproof.\n</p>",
