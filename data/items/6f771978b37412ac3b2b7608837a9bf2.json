This can only mean one thing, which is that we must hem and haw about whether to shift our clocks or not. Aaron Steckelberg and Lindsey Bever, for The Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/permanent-standard-time-body-health-benefits/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWJpZCI6IjIwMDAxMTk4IiwicmVhc29uIjoiZ2lmdCIsIm5iZiI6MTY2NzQxMDc0MCwiaXNzIjoic3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ucyIsImV4cCI6MTY2ODYyMDM0MCwiaWF0IjoxNjY3NDEwNzQwLCJqdGkiOiJjOTE2ZTk0Ni00OWQ3LTQyOWYtYjJhMi0xOTk0N2MxN2U2MjUiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vd2VsbG5lc3MvaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAyMi9wZXJtYW5lbnQtc3RhbmRhcmQtdGltZS1ib2R5LWhlYWx0aC1iZW5lZml0cy8ifQ.EoINTGg_HJfl24V2utkLjKr5QH0U-1W33J6kOiCfy10&#038;itid=gfta\">illustrated the sleep challenges that arise</a> when we have to change measured time, which is easy to shift with button presses, against our less malleable internal time, which is more in tune with sunlight.</p>\n<p>Scrolling through, it started to feel like too many layers on top of that clock, but my main takeaway, and I think we can all agree on this, is that we should all get to sleep and wake whenever we want. Boom, problem solved.</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://flowingdata.com/tag/daylight-saving/\" rel=\"tag\">daylight saving</a>, <a href=\"https://flowingdata.com/tag/illustration/\" rel=\"tag\">illustration</a>, <a href=\"https://flowingdata.com/tag/sleep/\" rel=\"tag\">sleep</a>, <a href=\"https://flowingdata.com/tag/washington-post/\" rel=\"tag\">Washington Post</a></p>",
