  "description": "<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re listening to or have already listened to the beginning of this episode, you probably noticed that the voice introducing Kimberly Adams sounded a bit off, right? That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s an audio &#8220;deepfake,&#8221; and it was created by Yisroel Mirsky at the Offensive AI Research Lab through a process called voice cloning. It uses software to study a short sample of someone&#8217;s voice and create a deepfake, which in this case took only 15 seconds to generate, according to Mirsky. It&#8217;s far from a perfect replica, but it turns out that scammers recently started to use deepfake audio for phone scams and in some cases have even succeeded. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams spoke with Kyle Alspach, a cybersecurity reporter with Protocol, about how the tech behind audio deepfakes works and how they&#8217;re being used in phone scams.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n",
