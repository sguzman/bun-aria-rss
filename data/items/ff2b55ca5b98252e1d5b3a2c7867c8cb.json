  "description": "<p>Of the many grapes that we have covered in this series, possibly the hardest to define is the one in this show -- Pinot Gris. It's so complex in part because it goes by many names and can taste neutral and boring to oily, powerful, and bold with notes of smoke, ginger, and spice. It can be bone dry to amazingly sweet and can be powderpuff or very serious in quality.</p> <p> </p> <p>Whatever the incarnation, wine drinkers lap it up! In the U.S., Pinot Grigio (the Italian style) is the second most-consumed wine behind Chardonnay, according to Impact Databank (the sister publication to Wine Spectator). But it's not just the US that loves this wine, it's growing like mad in Australia too. </p> <p> </p> <p>In this show, we discuss the many sides of Pinot Gris, or Pinot Grigio, or Grauburgunder or whatever you want to call it! Here are the show notes:</p> <p> </p> <p>We first discuss the grape itself:</p> <ul> <li>Pinot Gris, Pinot Grigio, Grauburgunder, or Rulander are all the same grape and all are mutations of Pinot Noir, so similar to their parent that the only thing that is different is the color of the grape after veraision</li> <li>Pinot Gris is one of the darkest skinned grapes that makes white. It's fruit is gray-blue fruit but can be brown- pink,  white or deep purple. As a result, the finished wine can have a copper tinge or be light pink </li> <li>The adjective <em>gris </em>is French for \"gray\" and the grape is named so because it has a grayish look to it. The gray name is used everywhere and has been adapted to local culture: Italian (<em>grigio</em>), German (<em>grauer</em>), Slovenian (<em>sivi</em>) and Czech (<em>sede</em>)</li> <li>Pinot Gris is thin skinned and does well in cool to moderate climates with very long growing seasons.</li> <li>Picking decision is essential to the wine's character for every wine but with Pinot Gris, it will determine whether it is insipid and neutral (picked early) or rich with higher alcohol, lower acidity and rich, full flavors like pears, apples, apricot, tropical fruit, ginger, spices, smoke, and mineral</li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/7008238467_609e3a441e_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"322\" height=\"486\" /><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><a href= \"https://www.flickr.com/photos/50979249@N06/7008238467\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\"Pinot Grigio prior to harvest, vintage 2012\" by stefano lubiana wines </a><br /> is licensed under <a href= \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">CC BY 2.0</a></span></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"> </p> <p>We discuss some general ideas about winemaking</p> <ul> <li>There is a sharp distinction between early picked Pinot Grigio (the Italian style) and full bodied, rich and flavorful Pinot Gris (the Alsace, France style)</li> <li>Most cheap Pinot Grigio, in particular, is picked, fermented and brought to market quickly -- it is a cash cow</li> <li>Pinot Grigio styles rarely use oak, but Pinot Gris (French style) often use older, neutral barrels for fermentation to give the wines texture.
