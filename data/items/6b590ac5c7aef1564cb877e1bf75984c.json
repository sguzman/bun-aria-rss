  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys overreact to everything that happened week 1 in the NFL including the thriller between the Steelers and Bengals, TJ Watt's potential season ending pec injury, Dak Prescott being out for potentially the next 8 weeks for the Cowboys, the Chiefs looking unbelievable in the post-Tyreek Hill era, Tyreek still having all the juice in Miami, the Packers dismal performance against a very scary looking Vikings team, all the new Head Coaches debuts, Justin Herbert and the Chargers looking scary, they go around the internet and go through some of the biggest overreactions, and everything else around happening in the league after an incredible week 1 of the NFL season. Joining the progrum fresh off a pick 6, a blocked PAT to send the game to Overtime, and 14 tackles, is 2x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, freshly paid Safety for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Minkah Fitzpatrick. Pat, Minkah, and AJ chat about the high's and low's of that roller coaster game against the Bengals, what Tomlin was like in the locker room, how difficult it is losing a guy like TJ Watt, the expectations of the Steelers defense, and much more (1:33:00-1:40:35). Later, NFL Network Insider, Ian Rapoport, joins the show to chat about the significant injury updates from week 1 including Dak Prescott, Mac Jones, David Bakhtiari and Elgton Jenkins, Chris Godwin, if Jimmy G could potentially be a Cowboy, and everything else we should know going into Monday Night Football (1:57:06-2:15:38). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show. We appreciate the hell out of all you. See you tomorrow for the season 3 premiere of Aaron Rodgers Tuesday. Cheers.</p>\n",
