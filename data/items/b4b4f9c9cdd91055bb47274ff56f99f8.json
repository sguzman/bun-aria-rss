  "description": "<p>One of the reasons Functional Medicine is so transformative is that it recognizes disease does not occur in isolation. If one part of the body is compromised the entire body is thrown out of balance. SIBO, or small intestine bacterial overgrowth, is a great example of this. It rarely occurs on its own, and is often paired with a number of other issues, from neurological symptoms to migraines, arthritis, and more. When we focus on healing the gut in these instances, the entire body shifts for the better. This week on<em> The Doctor’s Farmacy</em> I’m joined by Dr. George Papanicolaou to talk about the Functional Medicine matrix as a framework for healing, as well as his own journey in overcoming a traumatic brain injury.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Papanicolaou is a graduate of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and is Board Certified in Family Medicine from Abington Memorial Hospital. Over time as the healthcare system made it harder for patients to receive personal care, Dr. Papanicolaou decided a change was needed. He began training in Functional Medicine through the Institute of Functional Medicine. In 2015, he established Cornerstone Personal Health—a practice dedicated entirely to Functional Medicine. In August 2017, I invited Dr. Papanicolaou to join The UltraWellness Center and we’ve been successfully helping people together ever since.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy is brought to you by ButcherBox.
