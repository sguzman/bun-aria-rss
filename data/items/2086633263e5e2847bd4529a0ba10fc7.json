  "description": "<p>Want to be successful? You gotta fail first. </p><p>If you want to accomplish anything great in life, it's most likely not going to be an easy path to get there.</p><p>Sometimes, things fall into place for us. But more often than not, things fall out of place, and we find ourselves sitting in failure. Sometimes it's our fault, sometimes it's not, but whatever the case, failures are hard to handle.</p><p>I myself understand failure. I used to live on my sister's coach. My injury immobilized me, and for months, I wallowed in self-pity. Finally, I realized that my failures and hardships didn't hinder me from greatness. My sister kicked me out, and I learned to fight for myself again.</p><p>My guest today knows all about failure and how it can set you up for success.</p><p>In addition to having incredible hair, James Altucher is an American hedge fund manager, entrepreneur, author, venture capitalist, and podcaster. He has published 20 books, and he is a contributor to publications including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Financial_Times\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Financial Times</em></a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Huffington_Post\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Huffington Post</em></a>. He is also the host of <em>The James Altucher Show</em> in which he interviews innovators, creators, and just all around amazing people. James has founded or cofounded more than 20 companies, 17 of which have failed, but he hasn't let this slow him down.</p><p>Failure is a big part of James' story. In fact, I believe that anyone who is remotely successful has probably experienced an extraordinary amount of failure in their life. Why? Because overcoming failure is a step towards success.</p><p>At one point, James lost almost all his money. He was completely broke. He had less than two hundred dollars in his bank account. But somehow, he was able to build his business back up, and change that two hundred dollars into fifteen million.</p><p>Want to learn his secret?
