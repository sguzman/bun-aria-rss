Lisa explains how she and Al got together, what their relationship was like when she just thought she was a Christian, and how she told Al the truth about her affair. This sets the stage for a candid discussion of the ways we justify sin, living a double life, and the desperate moments that lead to healing when we cry out for God.\n\nDesperate Forgiveness: https://www.amazon.com/Desperate-Forgiveness-Al-Robertson/dp/1589970314\n\nHappy, Happy, Happy: https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Life-Legacy-Duck-Commander/dp/1476726108\nLearn more about your ad choices.
