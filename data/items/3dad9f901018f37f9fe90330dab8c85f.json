  "description": "<p><p>On Thursday's episode of Spittin' Chiclets the guys are joined by Adrian Aucoin. The last time the boys heard from Adrian was in Chicago at the failed live show, so we got Adrian's take on that plus a bunch more. The guys also go around the league and touch on some news and trades while also discussing the Blackhawks and Patrick Kane. Can Chicago make the playoffs? Is Kane the greatest US born player ever? The guys discussed. The boys also dove into the topic of player tracking technology and what the means for the players. The guys wrap up with the story of Biz's first twitter handle and why it was deleted.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
