  "description": "An ornithologist says there's a growing movement to change the name of a pink-footed bird currently called the flesh-footed shearwater. The movement reflects a growing understanding that using flesh-colored for \"pink\" fails to acknowledge the full range of human skin color. Plus, is hooligan an anti-Irish slur?

Finally, book recommendations to keep our minds and hearts full: Joan Didion essays and a novel by Affrilachian poet Crystal Wilkinson.
