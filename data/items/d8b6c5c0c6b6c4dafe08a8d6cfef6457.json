  "description": "<p>In part two of The Incomplete Leader, John Maxwell describes how leaders are visionaries and inventors. He teaches how to create compelling images of the future, how to cultivate inventiveness, and asks the key questions necessary to do so.</p> <p>During the application portion of the episode, Mark Cole and Chris Goede discuss the importance of getting buy-in from your team by offering context and clarity. They also remind us of the heart of this lesson––no leader is perfect, and the best leaders don’t try to be.
