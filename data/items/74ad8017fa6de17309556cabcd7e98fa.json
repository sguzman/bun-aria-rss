  "description": "<p>How would you respond if someone simply straight up told you, ‘You’re not good enough’? Is your initial reaction to hide with embarrassment? Or cry from hurt? Both would be completely valid from these hurtful words – as long as those words didn’t cause you to give up on yourself. If you’ve ever received destructive and damaging feedback on the journey to your dreams, and could use a bit of fierce determination and fiery passion, you’re in for a treat with this episode. Listen in as Jordan brings on Broadway singer, solo artist, and Taylor Swift back up vocalist, Kamilah Marshall, as she shares her story of hope deferred, overcoming limiting beliefs, and how she responded when she was told ‘you’re just not good enough.’ Kamilah has one amazing story of remaining on the path where her internal drive outweighs the fear of trying something new. If you’re ready to cultivate internal confidence before you receive outside affirmation, this episode is for you.</p>  <p>Learn more about Kamilah here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://kamilahmarshall.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://kamilahmarshall.com</a></p> <p>and</p> <p>IG <a href=\"instagram.com/gypsymoonshine\" target=\"_blank\">@gypsymoonshine</a></p>  <p> <p>Pre-order the book:<a href=\"jordanleedooley.com/book\" target=\"_blank\"> jordanleedooley.com/book</a></p> <p>Grab your preorder bonuses! <a href=\"jordanleedooley.com/oye-freebies\" target=\"_blank\">jordanleedooley.com/oye-freebies</a></p> <p>Book tour info: <a href=\"https://jordanleedooley.com/oye-tour\" target=\"_blank\">https://jordanleedooley.com/oye-tour</a></p>  <p>Say hi on social!</p> <p><a href=\"instagram.com/jordanleedooley\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jordanleedooley/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p></p>\n",
