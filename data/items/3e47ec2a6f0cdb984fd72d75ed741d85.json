Our conversation today is between John C. Maxwell, Mark Cole, and Jeff Henderson, author of the book, <em>Know What You’re FOR: A Growth Strategy for Work, an Even Better Strategy for Life</em>.</p> <p>As John says in the episode, there’s never been a time when division has been so prevalent amongst leaders and organizations. That’s why the message of FOR is so important right now. In this discussion, you’ll learn how your organization or business can serve people­­, and how leaders and teams can come together to make a true difference in the culture and the world.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the “Know What You’re FOR Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
