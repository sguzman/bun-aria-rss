There were a bunch of cool topics and speakers, and it was great to see what other great tech is being built in my part of the world!</p>\n<p>I said I&#8217;d share my slides on my &#8220;SQL for Data Science&#8221; talk, so <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qOtT2M-rjYa9JzKNz6_CxvfbihmqcmG9Ax6LgIriz0Y/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here they are</a>!</p>\n<p>I only had 40 minutes, so this wasn&#8217;t a full tutorial, and I couldn&#8217;t really teach many different concepts, but my main goal was to point out a bunch of different stuff you could do with SQL, and how to think about creating an analytical dataset, so attendees would be aware of what was possible and what they should look up if they wanted to start learning about SQL.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n"
