  "description": "Our audiobook this week is HIS DEADLY DARLING by MINK\n\nLuke Knight thinks he can own me, can hurry me into a wedding and then into his bed. He seems to know everything about me. But he’s missed the most important point—I’m dastardly. But I like his estate and all his money, so I’ll bide my time. I don’t obsess over his good looks and the way he makes me feel. Not a bit. Once he’s dead, I’ll be more than happy to be the grieving widow … on a yacht … in the Seychelles … drenched in diamonds.\n\nCassandra truly believes I’m the bad guy in her world. She’s wrong. I can show her how much she means to me. It will take time and coaxing, but I’ll prove to her our love is deep and true. If she tries to knife me a few times along the way, what of it? After all, a spirited woman is exactly what I need, and Cassandra Carlisle was made for me.\n\nGet the eBook Now - https://amzn.to/3tuAiFE\nGet the Audio Now - https://amzn.to/33qKZ1y\nGet More MINK: https://amzn.to/3xYahSo\n\nMore Free MINK Audiobooks on the RMR Podcast\nHIS VIRGIN QUEEN - https://bit.ly/3f1peKP\nANGEL by MINK - https://bit.ly/3nWsds0\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\n\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
