  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys dive into everything that's been happening as we gear up for the start of the NFL season, and also welcome in some great guests. First, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, NFL rushing leader in 2011, former Jacksonville Jaguars great, Maurice Jones-Drew joins the program to chat about what the hell is going on in Duval. Pat and MJD break down Leonard Fournette getting released, and what MJD thinks is going on in Jacksonville, if it can be fixed, and how exactly he would do that. He also chats about what it was like going back home to Oakland to play for a little bit, his thoughts on some of the new NFL stadiums, and what he realistically thinks the Jaguars record will be this year (:23-20:59). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ chat about everything going on in NFL training camp as we close in on the start of the regular season. They discuss Alvin Kamara missing three days of practice in a row in search for a contract, how that will impact the Saints this year, Derwin James needing knee surgery and how the Chargers will respond to that, some of the new pieces arriving in Tampa, whatever is going on in Jacksonville, along with everything else in training camp (22:23-1:28:20). Also joining Pat and AJ to chat about his distaste with Madden 21 and what needs to be done to fix the franchise after people were burning it down on social media, is friend of the program, Pat's former teammate, 9 year NFL veteran at DB, co-host of the Man-To-Man Pod, Darius Butler. (50:37-57:40). To close out the show, 3x Super Bowl Champion, former GM of the Cleveland Browns and Assistant to the Coaching Staff in New England is friend of the show, Michael Lombardi. Pat and Michael discuss all the videos coming out of Patriots camp and why Cam and Bill Belichick is such a perfect marriage, why he is beside himself with everything going on in Jacksonville, his thoughts on the Bears not naming a starting quarterback yet, and his philosophy as a GM. Mike also looks ahead to some of the lines for week 1 and gives everyone a few smart tips on how to handle all the different gambling numbers being thrown out there (1:31:30-1:57:17).
