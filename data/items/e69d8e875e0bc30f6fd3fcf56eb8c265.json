  "description": "<p>Roman Alonso of Los Angeles design firm Commune got his start in the world of fashion, working for Barney’s and Isaac Mizrahi. Seeking a change of pace, he and three friends started a truly unique company, one that did a little bit of everything: interiors, products, branding, graphic design and more. Today, Commune is known as one of the country’s most influential interior design firms, but Roman has kept the company true to its multidisciplinary roots, and he still likes to take on projects that stretch the definition of what design can do. On this episode of the podcast, he speaks with host Dennis Scully about how he carried on after a split with his original partners; why he craves more input from clients, not less; and how Commune creates <i>feelings</i>, not looks. <i>This episode is sponsored by Chairish and Universal Furniture.</i></p>\n",
