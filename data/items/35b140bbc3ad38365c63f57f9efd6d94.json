  "title": "Ep 374 | Jase Won’t Stop Interrupting HIMSELF & the Misery of Zuck's Creepy, Dystopian Metaverse",
  "description": "Jase, Al, and Zach find Mark Zuckerberg and his \"metaverse\" creepy and disturbing, and Al suspects we'll be even more disturbed when we find out who \"the android\" running Facebook really is. Jase is so rude he interrupts himself — repeatedly. Phil offers up a little philosophy inspired by Chicago lyrics. Zach points out that today's disconnected, superficial culture presents a prime opportunity for the Gospel to flourish. Al dubs Jase the \"world’s greatest garbage man.\" Phil explains why many people are called to do things for God but few are chosen. And Zach argues that technology isn't the real problem — it's the isolation of living your life virtually and worshipping created things instead of the Creator.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
