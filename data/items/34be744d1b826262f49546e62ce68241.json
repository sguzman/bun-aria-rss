  "description": "<p>Long before America was America, there was Salem. The town was a successful and busy port city, but it would become an infamous location that still causes a chill to run down our spines at the mere mention of its name. Based on my research, I would say that Salem has two main streets in its historic district that are the most haunted in the city. One is Essex Street and the other is Derby Street. On this episode, we are going to focus on the history and hauntings of Derby Street. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by John Michaels and features Fredric Baur buried in a Pringles can and This Month in History features Levi Weeks acquitted in Manhattan Well Mystery.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/04/ep-295-haunted-derby-street-in-salem.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/04/ep-295-haunted-derby-street-in-salem.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p> <p>Party Crowd sound effect by Daniel Simon</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Eulogies by Mort music is Long Time Gone by 5 Alarm Music on Drones & Beyond album.</p> <p>Witch Cave Full with Cello by ALIBI Music on Mysterious True Crime Tension 3<br /> Lurking Shadow by 5Alarm Music on Danger & Drama - Disc 2 album<br /> Horror - That Weird Tape_Full by ALIBI Music</p>",
