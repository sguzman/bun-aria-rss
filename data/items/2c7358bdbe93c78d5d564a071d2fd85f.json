  "description": "Happy Holidays and welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! You don’t have to be tech savvy to understand my next bet… And with the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show just around the corner, I couldn’t have timed this podcast any better. In fact, this is the rant I’ve been waiting for… Every January the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) presents the world with the latest and greatest tech trends. It’s considered the largest consumer expo in the world. And for good reason… The CES is the host of nearly 4,000 technology companies… The space covers 2.2M square feet… And it takes me about half the day to walk through the entire event. From an investor stand point – this is the opportunity to witness these trends on the launch pad, firsthand. And investing in the right stocks within these megatrends can result in massive gains. But here’s the thing. The trick to investing in this sector is all about knowing which trends to avoid… There’s one vital question we all must ask ourselves before we place our bets. “Do these tech-trends actually serve a consumer need?” If consumer adaptability is far out of reach. And if earnings are already dropping – As investors, why aren’t we looking elsewhere? To start off today’s episode, I’ll be diving in on 3 tech trends every investor must avoid. I have the numbers to back it up. Then, tune in to hear the ideas I actually do believe in. These new technologies are already implemented by the biggest names in the industry. Listeners will hear examples of each trend and how they can directly impact the consumer. Get your pens ready. To end the episode, I’ll be sharing the best plays in the sector – A list of stocks that have already secured their seat for the future.",
