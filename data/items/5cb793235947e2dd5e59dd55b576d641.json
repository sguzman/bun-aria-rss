  "description": "<p>In this episode, Scot and Jeff discuss Radiohead with Molly Ball, TIME magazine’s national political correspondent and a political analyst for CNN.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Introducing the Band</span></strong>:<br />\nYour hosts Scot Bertram (<u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/scotbertram\">@ScotBertram</a></u>) and Jeff Blehar (<u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/esotericCD\">@EsotericCD</a></u>) with guest Molly Ball (<u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mollyesque\">@mollyesque</a></u>). She is TIME magazine’s national political correspondent and a political analyst for CNN.</p>\n<p><span><strong>Molly’s Music Pick: Radiohead</strong></span>:<br />\nAhoy! In the deepest oceans, the bottom of the sea, Captain Ahab (aka Jeff) finally goes after his white whale and does an episode on the band people most associate him with, Radiohead! And he is in excellent company this week as the gang is joined by Molly Ball, another Radiohead mega-fan — and this is a group which has spawned an extremely dedicated, devoted fanbase which sits apart from its mainstream praise — to explore the full career of one of the greatest bands of all time. From <em>Pablo Honey </em>all the way to 2016’s <em>A Moon Shaped Pool</em>, the gang charts its way through an odyssey of music. There are stopovers to discuss the B-sides, the unreleased outtakes, the song that got ruined in the studio…this is one not only for people who are new to Radiohead, but also people who have been obsessed with them their entire adult lives, as Jeff and Molly have. A true labor of love.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n",
