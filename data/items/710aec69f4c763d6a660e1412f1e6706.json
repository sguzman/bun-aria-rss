  "description": "It’s a double shot of entertainment on this week’s Old Man & the Three as JJ and Tommy welcome in not one but two stars in Josh Hart and Jalen Brunson. After opening his home and having JJ live in his house for a large part of last year, (and also hounding him and Tommy for his chance on the big stage), close friend Hart kicks things off as he finally gets his shot to be the lead guest on the OM3. And deservedly so, as he brings his humor and intelligence to the table for a fantastic interview. He also has some comments on the size of the following guest’s head, but that’s beside the point. (You’ll understand when you hear it). Then, another friend of the pod Jalen Brunson joins the show for the return of the OM3 draft to give his take on the most unrealistic sports plays in movie history. Just like his game on the court, Jalen doesn’t disappoint. \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
