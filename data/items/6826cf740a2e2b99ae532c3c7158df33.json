The guys also discuss the Falcons trade options, the Seahawks extremely unlikely path back to the first round, LB scenarios for the Bills and how many wide receivers could be selected in the 1st. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
