  "description": "<p>We present a methodology that explores how sentence structure is reflected in\nneural representations of machine translation systems. We demonstrate our\nmodel-agnostic approach with the Transformer English-German translation model.\nWe analyze neuron-level correlation of activations between paraphrases while\ndiscussing the methodology challenges and the need for confound analysis to\nisolate the effects of shallow cues. We find that similarity between activation\npatterns can be mostly accounted for by similarity in word choice and sentence\nlength. Following that, we manipulate neuron activations to control the\nsyntactic form of the output. We show this intervention to be somewhat\nsuccessful, indicating that deep models capture sentence-structure\ndistinctions, despite finding no such indication at the neuron level. To\nconduct our experiments, we develop a semi-automatic method to generate\nmeaning-preserving minimal pair paraphrases (active-passive voice and adverbial\nclause-noun phrase) and compile a corpus of such pairs.\n</p>",
