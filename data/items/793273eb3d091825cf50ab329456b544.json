  "description": "The biggest national security story in America today is the biggest domestic story and the biggest political story and the biggest economic story and the biggest public health story. The COVID outbreak at the White House might have resulted in greater empathy for those who have suffered so due to the pandemic but the opposite seems to be happening. It seems to be leading to an effort by the president and his supporters to double down on disastrous policy choice and to put more Americans at risk. We discuss with Pultizer Prize Winner Laurie Garrett, Dr. Kavita Patel, former WH staffer, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
