  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bunnie and her favorite quarantine co-host in crime, Jelly, are joined this week by rapper and lyrical assassin Christian Webster, better known as Chris Webby. He and Jelly bond over their love of touring and the fans, and he shares how he is staying sane and creative while being at home.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Webby also talks about why getting arrested helped propel his career, what it’s like being a rapper in the current age, and why he will never get tired of watching The Sopranos. Then, Bunnie recounts one of the drunkest nights she’s ever had which just so happens to be at one of Webby’s shows. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A little recreational drug use now and then never hurt Chris, and he finds that it helps him stay creative and open to the flow of accepting this crazy time of life.
