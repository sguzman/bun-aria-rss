  "description": "LIVE QUESTIONS - Sabbath, Essential Oils, Free Will, and Marriage. - April 27th, 2017\n\n1. What is your take on keeping the Sabbath day Holy? It is one of the 10 commandments of the \"old\" covenant and I know Jesus is the \"new\" covenant, however Jesus said he had not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it. I can find scriptural arguments for both sides.\n\n2. I work in an intensive care unit. Why do christians place so much faith in essential oils and so little faith in science? Thanks\n\n3. Do we really have free will? If so how does God know which decision we are going to make? I guess I struggle with the idea of pre-destination. How can we believe in someone being pre-designed to be a murderer, rapist, mental health issues, commit suicide, and any other bad things in the world. Does that mean if someone commits suicide or does something bad they have no choice in the matter. I really struggle this idea. Please help clarify.\n\n4. What do you do when you really want to get married, but it doesn't seem like you're able to meet someone good for you? Does God care about this at all?\n\nWatch LIVE on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/voxpodcast/videos/1317625818305332/\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nMusic provided by Izzi Ray - http://www.soundcloud.com/izziray\nMusic available on iTunes - https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/izzi-ray/id386256769\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Twitter www.twitter.com/thevoxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nFollow Andy on Twitter www.twitter.com/Andy_lara\n",
