  "description": "<p>In his early 20s, Thomas Nitzche found himself in loads of debt. Like so many folks, he didn’t learn how credit cards really worked, and so the charges began to add up, and before he knew it he had an overwhelming balance that he could barely make minimum payments on. Couple that consumer spending with student loans, a car payment, a mortgage, and the final kicker- getting laid off and losing his income. Thomas found himself in a really stressful spot, but he was able to move from a place of desperation to using his experiences to help others. He now works for <a href=\"https://www.moneymanagement.org\">Money Management International</a>, which is the largest provider of nonprofit financial counseling and education in the United States. He’s all about conversations around money and destigmatizing debt, and so that’s what we’ve tackled in this episode.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Experimental IPA Vol 13, by Easy Chair Brewing Garage- thanks to our friend Jess for brewing this one up and donating it to the show!
