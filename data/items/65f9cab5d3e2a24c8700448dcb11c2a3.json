  "description": "<p><a href=\"http://hello-the-future.tumblr.com/\">Nicole Dieker</a> wears a lot of hats, as well as a brown coat. She's a freelance copywriter and ghostwriter, pens fiction, and writes essays. She's also a musician who bootstrapped herself out of a convention to which she returns every year, a rock climber, a Firefly fan, a whiskey drinker, and much more. Nicole wears her earnings on her sleeve, too: she discloses in regular posts precisely how much she's made in her freelance career. </p>\n\n<h2>Sponsors and patrons</h2>\n\n<p>Our show is made possible through the generous support of sponsors and patrons.</p>\n\n<p>We're sponsored this week by:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.99designs.com/disruptors\">99designs</a>: Have dozens of designers from the over 310,000 that are part of 99designs's network submit ideas for your logo, Web site, T-shirt, car wrap, or other design project, then pick the best and have a finished, professional result in a week or less for a flat price.
