  "description": "<p>Jesse Genet and Stephan Ango co-founded <a href=\"https://www.lumi.com\">Lumi</a> almost a decade ago. It first made wallets and prints and dyed material, then developed and distributed a light-sensitive fabric ink. Now it's a company that manages the production and ordering of packaging supplies. This might sound unrelated, but it's a natural transition resulting from interrogating one's interests, figuring out what your real business is, and learning new things. We talk about Shark Tank, fulfilling one's dreams, and why 10,000 shipments a month is small potatoes in the packaging world.</p>\n<h2>Sponsor: Community Theatre</h2>\n<p>This episode brought to you by: The Concept of Local Community Theatre!
