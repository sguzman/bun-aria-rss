  "description": "According to Nina Jankowicz, a fellow at the Wilson Center known for her research on online disinformation, women face a disproportionate amount of attacks online. These range from physical insults to threats of violence, and they're forcing women – especially younger ones – to censor themselves out of fear of physical or emotional retribution. In her new book, <em>How to Be a Woman Online</em>, she offers practical advice for those who, lacking institutional help, have to address these matters solely on their own. ",
