    "media:description": "Ariana Grande - my hair (Official Live Performance) | Vevo\n\nIf our Official Live Performances of “pov” and “safety net” reveal anything, it’s that Ariana Grande excels at her job because she’s so passionate about the results. You don’t hit the high notes, you don’t exude candor, and you don’t make pop music as moving as she does without crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. A very cool Cali session with the look and feel of a cozy little meadow was a perfect place to turn some of the best tunes on ‘Positions’ into utterly memorable performances. Go Team Ari. This spin on “my hair” has a jazzy feel, amplifying the breezy vibe that was established on ‘Positions.’ Makes sense, Ari’s vocals dart and flash like a nightclub saxophonist improvising through a tune. Hang tight, there are three more coming…\n\nThe Vevo official live performance of “my hair” by Ariana Grande.
