  "description": "We kick off this week talking about some possums and raccoons, flower power, and getting our storage until control. Then, we are joined with fabulous previous guest and design expert, speaker, consultant, and former editor of House Beautiful, Sophie Donelson. Sophie talks with us about her latest essay in the New York Times about why we don’t need our house to be perfect for Instagram, recommendations for picking out a paint color, and what life is like for Sophie in Montreal during this stay at home time.\nWhat You’ll Hear On This Episode:\n\nTrials and triumphs about good ole neighbor Jim and his possums, labeling and storage containers, cottage cheese, and sentimental yard maintenance.\n\nMore about the English and French decorating in Montreal, and the amazing views Sophie sees in her community.\n\nWhat are homes can do for us, and how we can have a loving and less combative conversation between ourselves and our homes.\n\nWhat lead Sophie and her husband to Montreal, and the pros and cons of living in a big city.\n\nThe inspiration behind Sophie’s essay in The New York Times, “Self-Quarantine is No Time For An Instagram-ready Kitchen.”\n\nWe have more flexibility and bandwidth to make our home comfy for our own needs, and not so much for the sake of it being pleasing or impressive to others.\n\nSophie recommends experimenting with the design and flow of a room and reminds us we are not locked into one way of design in our homes.\n\nGet your one little perfect corner and you can branch out from there. It’s never all going to be perfect.\n\nThe decision making behind her beautiful lavender walls.\n\nWhy having a designated playroom and sleep room has been a life and sanity saver.\n\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\n House Beautiful \nHouse & Home \n@sophiedow\nSophie Donelson\nSelf-Quarantine is No Time For An Instagram-ready Kitchen \nBig Books Small Talk \nJustina Blakeney \nIkea Bunk Bed \n\nDecorating Dilemma:\n\nCaroline’s painter used oil because it’s harder and more durable than latex. You can get a beautiful finish with brushing, it is just labor-intensive. A semi-gloss will be easier to clean, and if you are getting it professionally done have them spray it and use oil. If you are capable, patient, and thorough enough to do it yourself - good for you!\n\nLuckily this plan is easy to put into action! Sophie would recommend going to the hardware store to find some aluminum pails with some pebbles on the bottom. The rug is so important to make it feel homey and to collect the space together to make it feel one vibe. We love the natural charm of the ceiling and we wouldn’t change it! Sophie’s favorite trick for a bedside table is to use a bracket because it can fit your phone and a glass of water. Plants could help up the comfort level, and vintage rugs that don’t necessarily match could look great and also elevate the room.",
