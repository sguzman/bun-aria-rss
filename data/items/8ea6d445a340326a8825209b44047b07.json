  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, Brian Mudd of WJNO fills in for Mark. Before the election, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama told Joe Biden not to concede under any circumstance because they knew. In 2016 they attacked Trump with a bogus collusion narrative, and it took decades of entrenched government corruption to allow it to happen. The media refuses to report election fraud because they want you to be ignorant, which is why it’s important to be informed. When the media repeats the lie that Biden is President-elect, they discredit the recounts and audits underway in multiple states. This is mostly not about changing the outcome of the election, but the Republic going forward. Also, most of what’s being discussed about Dominion voting systems isn’t the full picture. Issues with Smartmatic and Sequoia systems in the 2000s found that systems could be manipulated and votes could be flipped from one candidate to another. Because of the worldwide attention, Smartmatic sold Sequoia in 2006, which is the root of the Venezuela conspiracy owning Dominion. We need to root out bad software and corrupt actors manipulating the outcomes of our elections.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
