  "description": "Russia has been trying to weaken the United States since the first days of the Cold War. But in that entire span of three-quarters of a century, even with the success of its spies and counter-espionage measures, it has never had a series of successes such as those it has enjoyed since 2016. As Tim Weiner, author of an important new book on Russia, \"The Folly and the Glory,\" says, the reason for that is due to the fact that Russia has been actively and continuously aided and abetted by the occupant of the Oval Office, the president of the United States. On this special podcast, we discuss Tim's new book with General James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence, and Laura Rosenberger, former Obama NSC and State Department official who now heads the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund. No punches are pulled. This is a powerfully unsettling discussion and our experts predictions for the immediate future demand the attention of all of us. Tune in.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
