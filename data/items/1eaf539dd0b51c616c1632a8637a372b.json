  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys get an intimate look at what life is like in the respective bubbles in Orlando and Edmonton. First, 8th Overall pick in the 2012 NBA Draft, 2013 NBA Slam Dunk Champion, and current guard for the Orlando Magic, Terrance Ross joins the program. Pat and Terrance discuss what&nbsp;the day to day is like in Orlando, if the food situation is as bad as people originally thought, if guys are still doing extra curricular activities, how he feels about the Magic's chances, and what he does to pass the time in between practices and games (1:11-16:01). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss Pat's wedding and what his expectations should be going in, whether&nbsp;or not he should be nervous, what to look for, and what to remember to make it as memorable as possible. Pat, AJ, and the boys also cover everything else while going off the rails a little bit on this Feel Good Friday (17:43-1:28:20). Lastly, NBC NHL Analyst and friend of the program, Pierre McGuire joins the show live from Edmonton. Pat and Pierre discuss the quarantine situation upon arrival in Canada, what the players have thought of the experience thus far with air conditioning going out at one of the hotels recently, how the NHL managed to pull this off, and who he thinks has the most realistic shot at taking home the Covid Cup (1:29:23-1:42:37). Don't forget to send in a picture of where you're listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch. Next week we'll be off as Pat's on his honeymoon, but there will be new clips posted to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a>, so make sure to subscribe if you haven't already. We appreciate you all. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
