  "description": "<p>One would not expect to find a castle in a Missouri city like Springfield, but indeed there is a structure here that is very castle-like and thus it has been given the name Pythian Castle. It is a massive structure that has found itself under the supervision of various owners in the past with very different uses for the building. It has served as an orphanage and retirement home and also as a place to rehabilitate injured service members. And POWs even found themselves incarcerated in the basement. The building has not been a place of tragedy, but emotions could have been high for military members and orphans alike. Or is there some other reason for supernatural activity in the building because there is definitely something unexplained going on within the walls? Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Pythian Castle. Moment in Oddity features the true story behind the Phantom of the Opera and This Day in History features the final launch of Space Shuttle Columbia.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/01/hgb-podcast-ep-97-pythian-castle.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/01/hgb-podcast-ep-97-pythian-castle.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer and get the Haunted True Crime Podcast!  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
