  "description": "<p>This week on The Cigar Authority we take a trip down memory lane as we look back at the first issue of Cigar Aficianodo from 25 years ago. It’s a bit of show and tell as Mr. Jonathan is on vacation, and Ed is attending to a family related issue across the box. How much has the cigar industry changed? You might be surprised.</p>\n<p>In the first hour we will light up a very good cigar in the Kristoff Criollo that was part of the care package. In the second hour we will light up a cigar that received the highest non-Cuban rating in the inaugural issue.</p>\n<p>All that and the usual bag of tricks Debonaire Mr. J, Asylum Barry, Cigar News and a Classic 3 Way.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='http://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n",
