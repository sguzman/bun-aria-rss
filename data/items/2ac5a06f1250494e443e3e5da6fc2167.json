  "description": "<p>Kara Swisher is perhaps the most feared—and effective—journalist in tech. She first made a splash covering AOL in the 1990s and she's continued to scoop Silicon Valley players ever since. In this crossover episode with Kara’s podcast, Katie and Kara discuss the competition between Instagram and Snapchat, and why Facebook executives have been slow to acknowledge the site's role in the 2016 election. “They don’t want to take responsibility for the fact that their platform was used by a malevolent power to create discord in our country,\" Kara says. She and Katie also delve into tech addiction in kids, the effect of automation on jobs, and their long careers in journalism. Plus, Kara turns the mic around and asks Katie about her time at Yahoo, and what she'd like to do next.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
