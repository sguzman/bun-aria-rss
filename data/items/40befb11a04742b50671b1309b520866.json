  "title": "#173 - Machette, Paint Thinner & Gasoline - The Unsparingness of Ugueth Urbina",
  "description": "<p>This week, we look at man who came from nothing, and achieved his dream of being a major leaguer. Not only that, he was an all star, and World Series Champion... But that all unraveled, and it ended up with some nasty charges involving a machete, some gasoline, a little paint thinner & a lighter. These charges would land him in Venezuelan prison with his good name ruined. He also indiscriminately fires hand guns from car windows & is not above a bar brawl. Did we mention that his mother was kidnapped & sold to a Columbian revolutionary gang & held for millions in ransom? Or that the rescue attempt was straight from an 80's action movie, complete with M-16s & exploding fuel tanks??
