  "description": "<p>My father, Nat Shaffir, talked to me about his experience in the Holocaust as a young boy. My father rarely, if ever, shared any of this with us growing up, so I'm glad I got a chance to hear him say it. This was originaly posted on the Skeptic Tank feed on Deathsquad, but since a lot of people didn't know about it there, and being Yom Hashoah today, I thought it was a good oportunity to repost it. These stories are hard to digest at points but I think it's important enough to continue to listen despite any level of discomfort.</p>",
