  "description": "<p><a href=\"http://mikefinoia.com\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Finoia</a> came to my apartment to talk about being a dirty hippie who followed Phish on the road from gig to gig. We also got into his trip to the \"final\" Grateful Dead concert ever in Chicago last year. I accidentally recorded it on ambient mode so it sounds kind of like a radio station from the '90s. But it's a fun episode full of drugs, music, and smelly vans. Oh, and I take my fertility test in the intro and outro.</p>",
