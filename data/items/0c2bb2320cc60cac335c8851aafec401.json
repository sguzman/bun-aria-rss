  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden authorized the killing of terrorist Ayman al-Zawahri by a CIA drone strike. However, when then-President Trump ordered a strike on Qassam Solemani and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, he was trashed by Biden for it. Biden's speech while well-delivered lacked much to be desired as he superfluously justified his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Al Zawahiri's death is important, but it is not the end of protecting this country when we literally have a border under siege by illegal immigration. Then, the U.S Air Force will be hosting a drag queen show at Langley Air Force Base. The U.S State Dept. also donated money to \"Queer Lisboa\" a gay-friendly film festival that promotes films including pedophilia amongst its offerings. Later, Nancy Pelosi is in Asia, and it's still unknown if she'll stop in Taiwan after China's threat to blow her plane out of the sky. China is aggressively preparing to invade and conquer Taiwan and they are watching how our military responds to their threats. Afterward, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich joins the show and explains why conservatives must get out and vote in Arizona On Tuesday. The stakes for liberty versus tyranny in Arizona and in the US are just too high. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
