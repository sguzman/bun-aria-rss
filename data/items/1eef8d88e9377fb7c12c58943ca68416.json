  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the economy is collapsing and President Biden refuses to take responsibility instead he eats ice cream. Biden worries about nothing while families struggle with fuel prices that are 40% higher. Democrats broke the economy and lit the fuse on inflation. Fuel shortages are eminent while food becomes more scarce. Yet Democrats blame corporate greed and the war in Ukraine as the reason for this as if there wasn't a war in Afghanistan or corporate greed during the Trump years when the country was energy dominant. Then, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joins the show to discuss his new book Bibi, My Story. https://www.simonandschuster.com/p/bibi-my-story Netanyahu mentioned that Iran threatens Israel and the Middle East's stability. Reiterating that the number one goal is to prevent the nuclear armament of Iran and the way to do it is through soft power like diplomacy and culture and hard power like a strong military and economy. Later, Mitch McConnell is a disaster and is promoting RINO's against solid conservatives in the midterm elections. McConnell's quest to maintain power at all costs must be stopped by re-blooded Americans that love this country. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
