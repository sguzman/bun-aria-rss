God promised Israel that rest was going to be the upshot of his salvation. In this text we see three things: 1) How Esther got rest from her enemies; 2) How Jesus gets us rest from our enemies; 3) How we can have rest from our enemies.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 6, 2007. Series: Esther and the Hiddenness of God. Scripture: Esther 7:1-10; 9:20-23.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
