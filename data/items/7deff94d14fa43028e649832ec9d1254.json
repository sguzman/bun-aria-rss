  "description": "<p>Failure is perhaps the biggest fear standing between most people and their dreams. The author Robert Schuller used to ask, “What would you attempt to do if you knew you wouldn’t fail?” In this episode, John Maxwell asks, “What have you learned from your failure?” If you want to achieve big things, failure is inevitable. But it’s what we learn (and whether we learn) from our failure that can determine our success.</p> <p>Today, you’ll hear John Maxwell summarize three major chapters from his book <em>Sometimes You Win, Sometimes You Learn</em> to help you gain a better perspective on failure and take your next step to success.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the <em>Sometimes You Win, Sometimes You Learn Worksheet</em>, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Learn and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Sometimes-You-Win-Sometimes-You-Learn--Lifes-Greatest-Lessons-are-Learned-from-Our-Losses-Hardcover_p_2785.html\"> <em>Sometimes You Win, Sometimes You Learn</em> by John C.
