We also touch upon dynamically dispatched Fns and experimental const Fn bounds.\n\nI've spliced out some audio issues that occurred on the live-stream, but hopefully it won't be too noticeable :p\n\n0:00:00 Introduction\n0:01:20 Rust for Rustaceans\n0:02:48 Function items\n0:06:26 Function pointers\n0:11:24 Function traits\n0:20:40 Closures\n0:33:49 Non-static closures\n0:38:50 dyn Fn\n0:49:44 const Fn\n1:00:28 for bounds\n1:04:06 closures in async fn\n\nLive version with chat: https://youtu.be/QVK4Ooo_PqM",
