  "description": "In his new book, Stan Lee: The Man Behind Marvel  (Rowman and Littlefield, 2017), cultural historian and biographer Bob Batchelor examines the life of Marvel’s Stan Lee one of the most iconic figures in comic book history. Batchelor has written the first biography of Stan Lee. Starting with his childhood as a Depression-era New Yorker born to immigrant parents, Batchelor follows Lee’s career as a teenage editor at Marvel Comics, his stint as a playwright for the United States Army during World War II, and his unrelenting work ethic and drive that transformed the comic book industry and brought characters such as Spider Man, the Hulk, Iron Man, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, and the X-Men to life. Batchelor explores the larger place in popular and American cultural history that Stan Lee has played over the past 70 years from comics to television to film, reflecting on the role of the superhero in the American experience. Well researched, Stan Lee: The Man Behind Marvel gives insight not only into well-known aspects of Lee’s life, but also presents readers with little known background into Lee’s past and what has made him the icon he is today. Batchelor’s book is a must read for Marvel and comic books fans.\n\n\n\nRebekah Buchanan is an Associate Professor of English at Western Illinois University.
