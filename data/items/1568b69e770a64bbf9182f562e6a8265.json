    "media:description": "The Engineering Research Center for Precision Microbiome Engineering, or PreMiEr, aims to develop diagnostic tools and engineering approaches that promote building designs for preventing the colonization of harmful bacteria, fungi or viruses while encouraging beneficial microorganisms.\nPreMiEr is funded by a five-year, $26 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), renewable for a second five-year, $26 million term. Joining Duke in the effort are researchers from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and North Carolina State University.
