  "description": "Today on the show, Elizabeth Warren shares her favorite Bible verse. The only problem is that her positions — especially on abortion— completely contradict that verse. Also, Beto comes out for third trimester abortion, which is a required position in the Democrat Party now. Also, a child is groped by a TSA agent. Finally, a kid is accosted by liberals after wearing a MAGA hat to a vigil for the mosque shooting victims. Some conservatives are treating him like a martyr. Personally, I’m tired of the attention seeking trolling on both sides. Date: 03-20-2019\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
