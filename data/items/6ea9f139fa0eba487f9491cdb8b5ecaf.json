  "title": "PMS 2.0 757 - OVERREACTION MONDAY, NFL Week 5 Recap, & Monday Night Football Preview With AJ Hawk",
  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys overreact to everything that happened in a wild week 5 of the NFL season including how the Bills look to be unstoppable, a tale of two halves in London as the Packers looked terrible in the second half as the Giants got a massive win, which makes us wonder, are the Giants for real? The Cowboys getting another huge win over the Rams, if the Cardinals are ever going to figure things out and whether or not Kyler and Kliff Kingsbury hate each other, the Patriots beating the hell out of the Patriots, the Jets potentially being a team to be reckoned with, go around the internet to look at some overreactions from the public, and everything else that happened in another great week of NFL action, before previewing tonight’s Monday Night Football game between the Raiders and Chiefs. Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show. We appreciate the hell out of all you. See you tomorrow for Aaron Rodgers Tuesday, cheers.</p>\n",
