  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Here in the United States, all but two states recently underwent our biannual time change, daylight-saving time. For most folks, this transition can be jarring and inconvenient. But when we decide to move the hands on the clocks forward one hour, what is the impact on human health?<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">On this episode of The Model Health Show, we’re going to take a deep dive into how daylight-saving time disrupts our circadian clocks. We’ll talk about the specific biological processes that can be negatively affected through moving our clocks forward. You’ll also hear some staggering statistics on how daylight-saving time contributes to more traffic accidents, increased risk of hospital admissions, and more adverse health effects.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">There’s a convincing argument that daylight-saving time is detrimental to the health, productivity, and safety of our species. Today you’re going to hear how our internal clocks are aligned with the sun, and why standard time is more beneficial for our overall health. You’ll also learn how to adapt to time changes, and why consistent sleep schedules are foundational for the functionality and health of our bodies. <span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>In this episode you’ll discover:</strong></p> <ul class=\"ul1\"> <li class=\"li1\">How <strong>daylight-saving time</strong> impacts our circadian clocks.</li> <li class=\"li1\">What The Sunshine Protection Act is and what it proposes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li class=\"li1\">How the <strong>circadian clocks</strong> in our cells work.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li class=\"li1\">Which functions and processes our biological clocks control in our bodies.</li> <li class=\"li1\">How the disruption of your circadian system can <strong>alter your microbiome</strong>.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li class=\"li1\">The origins of daylight-saving time, and the reason why it was implemented.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li class=\"li1\">Which <strong>two states</strong> have opted out of practicing daylight-saving time.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li class=\"li1\">How changing our clocks can increase our susceptibility to traffic accidents.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li class=\"li1\"><strong>What percentage</strong> of countries in the world change their clocks.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li class=\"li1\">Why standard time is better than daylight-saving time for human biology.</li> <li class=\"li1\">The importance of making <strong>human health</strong> the priority.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li class=\"li1\">Adverse effects associated with changing our clocks.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li class=\"li1\">Why <strong>consistent, quality sleep</strong> matters.</li> <li class=\"li1\">What percentage of Americans support eliminating seasonal time changes.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li class=\"li1\"><strong>How to adapt</strong> to time changes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li class=\"li1\">Why prioritizing sleep, movement, and nutrition is critical for your overall health.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> </ul> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>Items mentioned in this episode include:</strong></p> <ul class=\"ul1\"> <li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.com/paleovalley\"><span class= \"s2\">PaleoValley.com/model</span></a></span><span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span> <span class=\"s3\">--</span> Use code <strong>MODEL</strong> for 15% off!</li> <li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.com/organifi\"><span class= \"s2\">Organifi.com/Model</span></a></span> <span class= \"s3\">--</span> Use the coupon code <strong>MODEL</strong> for 20% off!</li> <li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.com/robb-wolf-healing-the-earth/\"><span class=\"s2\"> Energizing Our Food System with Robb Wolf – Episode 563</span></a></span></li> <li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Smarter-audiobook/dp/B01J4BJT7A/\"><span class=\"s2\"> Sleep Smarter</span></a></span><span class=\"s5\"><span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></li> <li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href= \"https://eatsmarterbook.com/\"><span class=\"s2\">Eat Smarter</span></a></span></li> </ul> <p class=\"p2\">Join TMHS Facebook community - <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2393689010676188/%2522%2520%255Ct%2520%2522_blank\"><span class=\"s6\">Model Nation</span></a></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>Be sure you are subscribed to this podcast to automatically receive your episodes: </strong></p> <ul class=\"ul1\"> <li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-model-health-show/id640246578\"> <span class=\"s2\">Apple Podcasts</span></a></span></li> <li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"https://www.stitcher.com/show/the-model-health-show\"><span class= \"s2\">Stitcher</span></a></span></li> <li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"https://open.spotify.com/show/6F3aCAq1L6k3eVqfaveMCp\"><span class= \"s2\">Spotify</span></a></span></li> <li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/themodelhealthshow\"><span class= \"s2\">Soundcloud</span></a></span></li> </ul> <p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class= \"s4\"><span class=\"s6\"><span class=\"s7\"><span class=\"s5\"><a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Episode+569.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">*<em>Download Transcript</em></a></span></span></span></span></span></span></p> <p class=\"p1\"> </p>",
