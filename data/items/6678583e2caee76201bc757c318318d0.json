Dan walks us through the fitness standards the average male should be able to meet from childhood to old age, beginning with the assessments he gives to those who are 55 years old and older, which includes carrying their body weight, a long jump, and something called “the toilet test.” We then reach back to childhood, and Dan discusses the physical skills kids should become adept in, which were inspired by a turn-of-the-20th-century physical culturist who thought every individual ought to be able to save his own life, and which can be broken down into the categories of pursuit, escape, and attack. We end our conversation with the physical standards those in the 18-55 range should be able to meet, including how much a man should be able to bench press, squat, and deadlift, and the walking test that’s an excellent assessment of your cardiovascular conditioning.</p><h3>Resources/Articles/People Mentioned in Podcast</h3><ul><li>My <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-exercise-well-rounded-man/\">first</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-655-simple-excuse-busting-advice-for-getting-in-shape/\">second</a> interview with Dan</li><li><a href=\"https://www.t-nation.com/training/10-things-every-lifter-should-be-able-to-do\">10 Things Every Lifter Should Be Able to Do</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/dont-just-lift-heavy-carry-heavy/\">Don’t Just Lift Heavy, Carry Heavy</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/take-the-simple-test-that-can-predict-your-mortality/\">Take the Simple Test That Can Predict Your Mortality</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/10-physical-skills-every-man-master/\">The 10 Physical Skills Every Man Should Master</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-663-how-to-achieve-physical-autonomy/\">How to Achieve Physical Autonomy</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-history-of-physical-fitness/\">The History of Physical Fitness</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/every-man-should-be-able-to-save-his-own-life-5-fitness-benchmarks-a-man-must-master/\">Every Man Should Be Able to Save His Own Life</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/balance-exercises/\">12 Balance Exercises You Can Do on a 2×4</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0794BXVY4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0794BXVY4&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">Shaker Plate</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-508-break-out-of-your-cage-and-stop-being-a-human-zoo-animal/\">Break Out of Your Cage and Stop Being a Human Zoo Animal</a></li></ul><h3>Connect With Dan</h3><p><a href=\"https://danjohnuniversity.com/\">DanJohnUniversity.com</a> (use code “artofman” for a discount) </p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CoachDanJohn1?fref=ts\">Dan on Facebook</a></p><p><a href=\"http://danjohn.net/\">Dan’s website</a></p><h3><br /> </h3>\n",
