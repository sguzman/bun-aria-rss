  "description": "<p>A very special JRE Review of Joe's impact on comedy and the changes he's help create at the World famous Comedy Store..</p>\n <p>Joe is a very well respected comedian not only for his brilliant comedy specials and his endless dedication to the art but for supporting and protecting other comics.. Back in the day he fought against Carlos Mencia who's career was big at the time and he did so to protect his fellow comedians from some unethical behavior.. Ultimately Joe was banned from the store but by doing what he did set the tone for other comics to be ethical and stand by their morals. Today I'm joined by my good friend and regular at the comedy store Mark to discuss the positive impact Joe has had on comedy..</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Follow me on Instagram at <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview\">www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview</a></p>\n <p>Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw?</a></p>\n <p>Please email me <a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">here</a> with any suggestions and questions for future shows..</p>\n",
