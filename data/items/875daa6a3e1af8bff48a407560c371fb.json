  "description": "First up today, we talked with Michael Knowles who had some great insight on what’s going on with agencies like the FBI and how the feckless Republicans can’t see what’s really going on. Next we talked with Kash Patel, who got the meat of what the raid was all about, and that’s trying to cover up anything that had to do with Spygate. Then we talked with Julie Kelly, who talked about how not only Trump is being targeted, but anyone in his sphere, and how it’s meant to intimidate him from running again. Finally, an explosive interview with Darren Beattie from Revolver, who had an amazing article about the mystery behind the J6 pipebomber and what the FBI is covering up.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
