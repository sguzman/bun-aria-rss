    "media:description": "None of these models overlap when you look at them from the initial viewpoint.  But what happens when you move the camera?\n\nThis is a \"just-for-fun\" video showing how the teaser image was created for\n\nMark Gillespie, Boris Springborn, Keenan Crane\n\"Discrete Conformal Equivalence of Polyhedral Surfaces\"\n(ACM Transactions on Graphics 2021)\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/CEPS/index.html\n\nA standard way to show a bunch of results in a geometry processing paper is to pack rendered 2D images into a single image using Qingnan Zhou's \"Mosaic Generator\": https://github.com/qnzhou/Mosaic\n\nWe put a twist on this idea by arranging our models in 3D space so that they nicely pack into a 2D image when projected onto the camera plane.  The video shows what happens when you move the camera from the \"perfect location\"!",
