  "description": "We are back, and coming to you live from the Gold Coast.... well, at least one of us is. Ben takes time out of his busy day working the Boxing venue to tell us all about his experiences behind the scenes of working the Commonwealth Games. Who will come out on top between the Aussies and Canadians in the pool? Which boxer could fist bump Ben to the ground?  Which Canadian commentator just cuts in and out of coverage as he pleases? What was the giant inflatable whale like up close at dress rehearsals? What is DAZN and why is it not carrying Netball? Why is Colin demanding Olympic success from his 2 year old son? And how many places in Queensland can one run into Tom Daley? It's the on the scene podcast coverage of the Commonwealth Games that will make you scream Jai Ho!",
