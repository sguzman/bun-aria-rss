  "description": "<p>Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Todd Rundgren is in a class all his own. Whether scoring Top 40 hits, playing all of the instruments on his albums or wildly experimenting with musical genres, Rundgren is continuously pushing the boundaries of creativity. That ethos and ingenuity can be found in his numerous solo albums from the 70s to present day, with his band Utopia and as a record producer for musicians like Patti Smith, The Psychedelic Furs and MeatLoaf. The trailblazing Rundgren is also a pioneer in computer technology and multimedia &ndash; creating the first color graphics tablet, first interactive album and first interactive concert tour. Todd Rundgren tells Alec how he pulls off making the music he wants to make, how he almost changed careers to become a computer programmer and how psychedelics helped him rethink music completely.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can listen to all of the music from this episode and other selections from Todd Rundgren in a curated playlist <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7Go33qEy2ldi6CY1yjFMH3?si=a871980a0b924a62&nd=1&utm_medium=organic&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA7WNSwrCMBRFV5MO%2B0lKP0IRUasTF%2BBInmlrY59JzGeQ3ZsKLkG4g8u9HM7snLabLLNaOTGFFLROUcgl22qjBs9dp%2FQoE0LLySPevMFuXhHCdoT2Meud%2FmiuXnHSCAGFdbHWJ8XY%2BxgoDqLaX4vw7C9nRlhvBWEHaOqibXLI7y0toaJfDSDegS9%2FVhFaySHuRTKN4LwZO2UeIAX%2FAAboxcURAQAA&product=open&%24full_url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fplaylist%2F7Go33qEy2ldi6CY1yjFMH3%3Fsi%3Da871980a0b924a62&feature=organic&_branch_match_id=306473021444063971\">here</a>.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
