  "description": "<p>YOU NEED TO TALK TO SOMEBODY. So many of us (especially men) are afraid to open up about what we’re going through. We often don’t even tell the people who are closest to us. For whatever reason, we think we have to suffer alone. But there is freedom in sharing your struggles. Whether it’s depression, low self-esteem, or something like erectile dysfunction, you need to be able to tell your doctor. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Bill Phillips where he talked about the importance of getting help for depression and other problems. Bill is the former Editor-In-Chief of Men’s Health Magazine and the author of The Better Man Project. Learn how to talk to your doctor and confront your health issues in Episode 888.<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode, check out the video, show notes and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/888 and follow at instagram.com/888</p>\n",
