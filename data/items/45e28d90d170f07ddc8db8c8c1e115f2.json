  "description": "<p>It's an exciting day today as we chat with our first ever Artistic Swimmer in the form of Australian Olympian Kirsten Kinash to learn about her amazing career, Olympic experiences and of course more about her amazing sport! We find out Kirsten's unique journey from growing up in Canada and getting involved in the sport right through to moving to Australia and the challenges in continuing her career on this side of the world. We also learn more about the sport and why it is maybe the most difficult sport in the world to compete and all the challenges that come with being an Artistic Swimmer. Added to this we learn more about the performance aspect of the sport, why Star Wars could play in to a future Olympic appearance and just how Kirsten officially became a meme after Tokyo. It's an amazing chat that you won't want to miss!</p>",
