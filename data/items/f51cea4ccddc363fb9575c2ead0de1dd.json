Fewer young men are going to college than in years past, and those that do go, fewer of them are graduating. What's more there's a general sense that young men today are simply unmotivated to seek out gainful employment or starting families. Meanwhile, girls and young women are surpassing boys and young men in education and in work.<br />My guest today on the podcast has spent his career studying how the biological differences between boys and girls and the changes in our culture and society during the past few decades can explain these discrpencies in achievement. His name is Dr. Leonard Sax and he's the author of several books including Boy's Adrift and Girls on the Edge. Today on the podcast, Dr. Sax and I discuss how gender effects the emotional and intellectual development of boys and girls and what parents and schools can do to help them thrive based on their unique attributes.
