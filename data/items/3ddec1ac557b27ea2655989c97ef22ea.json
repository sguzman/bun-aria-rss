  "description": "Hello everyone it’s Danielle and I am sooo happy to be back on the podcast I have missed you guys so much and thanks so much to Brooke for killing it while I was gone! Today’s solo episode will be an extension of my last YouTube video (youtube.com/daniellecarolan) about where I’ve been and where I am going from here. I will be expanding on my meetings with Hanna on interrupting daily acts of oppression and what I learned from those meetings. I then talk about how being back at college is, the classes I’m taking, and more. Enjoy. See you guys next week reunited with Brooke.",
