I explain each protocol in detail, the rationale behind it, and how the protocol can be adjusted depending on individual needs. I set these tools in the context of a 24-hour day as a way of framing how one might incorporate these tools and protocols into their own daily routine.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction: Protocols for sleep, mood, focus, exercise creativity\n(00:04:08) Sponsors\n(00:08:50) Protocol 1: Record Your Daily Waking Time & Temperature Minimum \n(00:12:07) Protocol 2: Self-Generate Forward Motion (Outdoors) \n(00:17:00) Protocol 3: View Natural Light For 10-30min Every Morning\n(00:22:43) What To Do If You Can’t View The Sun: Blue Light \n(00:26:50) Protocol 4: Hydrate Correctly \n(00:28:00) Protocol 5: Delay Caffeine 90-120m After Waking\n(00:30:48) Protocol 6: Fast (or Fat-Fast) Until Noon\n(00:32:30) What Actually Breaks A Fast & What Doesn’t?\n(00:34:30) Fat Loss & Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP1), Yerba Mate, Guayusa Tea\n(00:37:30) Protocol 7: Optimize Deep Work: Visual Elevation, Ultradian Cycles, White Noise\n(00:48:30) Optimal Time of Day To Do Hard Mental Work \n(00:52:07) Protocol 8: Optimal Exercise; 3:2 Ratio\n(01:03:54) Tools for Training & Mental Focus: Fasting, Salt, Stimulants, Alpha-GPC \n(01:10:00) Protocol 9: Eat For Brain Function & Mood\n(01:17:39) Protocol 10: Get Your Testosterone & Estrogen In An Ideal Range\n(01:24:00) Protocol 11: Reset the Mind & Body, Enhance Neuroplasticity, Reveri.com\n(01:31:15) Protocol 12: Hydrate Correctly, Nap Rules\n(01:33:29) Protocol 13: View Late Afternoon/Evening Light To Support Sleep & Dopamine\n(01:39:00) Protocol 14: Eat Dinner That Promotes Serotonin, Calm Sleep\n(01:44:27) Protocol 15: Optimize Falling & Staying Asleep; Tools & Supplements That Work\n(01:55:00) Protocol 16: Preventing Middle of the Night Waking\n(01:59:10) Protocol 17: Weekends, Recovering From A Poor Nights Sleep\n(02:05:20) Neural Network, Supplement Sources, Sponsors\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
