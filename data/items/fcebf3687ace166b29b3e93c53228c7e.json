  "description": "New study shows: California, New York, New Jersey handled covid lockdowns the worst. Florida and Utah among the best. Trump says terminating \"every single\" covid mandate should be on Republicans' to-do list after the 2022 midterm elections. Buck loved seeing the former president this weekend at Mar-a-Lago. The Biden Regime is planning on extending the airplane mask mandate another month, even as they open the borders to everyone. Clay said, \"Covid is so in control now that we can open the border and allow anybody basically to come across the border, but American citizens sill have to wear masks? It makes no sense.\" Social media videos show riots over food as Chinese city Shanghai enters third week of strict lockdown. Lockdown, zero covid, is an albatross for the government there, C&B say. Once a retail giant, Kmart nears extinction.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
