  "description": "Taylor is lusting and loving over someone famous.. but who is she talking about? We have some fun theories, some possible Easter eggs, and then some plausible theories! Plus, could you imagine embarrassing yourself this badly in front of a famous crush?<br />Nick, Ana, Amy and Lacey dissect this song and relate to it a little too much. <br />What did we miss? What should we talk about next? What album should we break down next?
