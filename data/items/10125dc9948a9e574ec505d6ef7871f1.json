  "title": "Two hour marathon in 2031, maybe",
  "content": "On Sunday (September 16, 2018) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliud_Kipchoge\">Eliud Kipchoge</a> ran the Berlin Marathon in 2:01:39, smashing the previous world record by more than a minute and taking a substantial step in the progression toward a two hour marathon.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2014/09/two-hour-marathon-in-2041.html\">In a previous article</a>, I noted that the marathon record pace since 1970 has been progressing linearly over time, and I proposed a model that explains why we might expect it to continue.&nbsp; Based on a linear extrapolation of the data so far, I predicted that someone would break the two hour barrier in 2041, plus or minus a few years.<br /><br />Now it is time to update my predictions in light of the new record.&nbsp; The following figure shows the progression of world record pace since 1970 (orange line), a linear fit to the data (blue line) and a 90% predictive confidence interval (shaded area).&nbsp; The dashed lines show the two hour marathon pace (13.1 mph) and lower and upper bounds for the year we will reach it.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i1F--gsbk0Q/W6KOlvw9agI/AAAAAAAAFUw/O6uofI6RMGcoxdF9CYqgqj7QTaOn7emDgCLcBGAs/s1600/world_record_prediction.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"288\" data-original-width=\"432\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i1F--gsbk0Q/W6KOlvw9agI/AAAAAAAAFUw/O6uofI6RMGcoxdF9CYqgqj7QTaOn7emDgCLcBGAs/s1600/world_record_prediction.png\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div>Since the previous record was broken in 2014, we have been slightly behind the long-term trend.&nbsp; But the new record more than makes up for it, putting us at the upper edge of the predictive interval.<br /><br />This model predicts that we might see a two hour marathon as early as 2031, and probably will before 2041.<br /><br />Note that this model is based on data from races.&nbsp; It is possible that we will see a two hour marathon sooner in under time trial conditions, as in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking2\">the Nike Breaking2 project</a>.",
