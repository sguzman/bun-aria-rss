For the Fall term (October - December) and more yearlong programming, applications close on September 13.<br /><br />Any student in 9th to 12th grade can apply. Because this a live, in-person program, you should live in the vicinity of the lab you apply to. We will accept applications from everyone, but strongly encourage Black and Latinx students to apply.<br /><br />You can apply and become a member without coding experience, but for our immersion-based programs, experience with coding will be required to successfully complete the program.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JStBz-tGJSo/XXFGCRKR8fI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/VdMq8Dz71kIdg5jFbL4qvSs0X-VsXFS4wCEwYBhgL/s1600/4C1A9604.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1067\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JStBz-tGJSo/XXFGCRKR8fI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/VdMq8Dz71kIdg5jFbL4qvSs0X-VsXFS4wCEwYBhgL/s640/4C1A9604.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />Visit the <a href=\"http://g.co/codenext\">Google Code Next website</a> for more information and to apply.
