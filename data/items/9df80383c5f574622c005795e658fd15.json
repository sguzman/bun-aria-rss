    "media:description": "What's in our minds when we throw an if/then sentence out there? How do we work out what worlds we may be talking about? In this week's episode, we talk about the semantics of conditionals: what an \"if\" looks like logically, why a simple logical arrow isn't enough to capture the complexities of conditionals, and how we change what possibilities we allow ourselves to think of based on what our \"if\" clause holds.\n\nThis is Topic #95!\n\nThis week's tag language: Kyrgyz!\n\nRelated videos:\nHow Logical is Language? https://youtu.be/lw4ykgRtv3Q\nHow Do We Capture the Truth of Beliefs? Type Theory: https://youtu.be/CWE9ycOxCEQ\nCan we define \"must\"? Modality: https://youtu.be/vtYdrzdU2dY\n\nLast episode:\nHow do we understand missing words?

Lambda Calculus: https://youtu.be/BwWQDzXBuwg\n\nOur website also has extra content about this week's topic, on other kinds of conditional sentences, at: http://www.thelingspace.com/episode-95/\n\nFind us on all the social media worlds:\nTumblr: http://thelingspace.tumblr.com/\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/TheLingSpace\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thelingspace/\n\nAnd at our website, http://www.thelingspace.com/ !\nYou can also find our store at the website, https://thelingspace.storenvy.com/\n\nWe also have forums to discuss this episode, and linguistics more generally.\n\nSources:\nThe theory of conditionals here dates back to Kratzer's 1986 paper \"Conditionals,\" which is where that quote at the end comes from: http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/ThkMjYxN/Conditionals.pdf\n\nThe idea of if-clauses as restrictors actually goes back to David Lewis' 1975 paper \"Adverbs of Quantification,\" which you can find here: http://www.andrewmbailey.com/dkl/Adverbs_of_Quantification.pdf. \n\nThe presentation was based mostly on some of the usual  semantic suspects: \nhttp://web.mit.edu/fintel/fintel-heim-intensional.pdf, \nSeth Cable's course notes: http://people.umass.edu/scable/LING620-SP18/Handouts/12.Conditionals.pdf\nhttp://schoubye.org/teaching/Formal-Semantics/FormalSemanticsNotes2014.pdf. \n\nCrucial inspiration also from here http://books.google.ca/books?id=1NwWDgAAQBAJ&dq=frana+modality+in+the+nominal+domain&source=gbs_navlinks_s , in a chapter by Ilaria Frana titled \"Modality in the Nominal Domain: The Case of Adnominal Conditionals.\" \n\nThere's also a series of videos on YouTube that explores the topic from a more philosophical point-of-view, and arrives at a different conclusion, but might still be of interest, starting here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zxp2-_pLCE\n\n#linguistics #semantics #TheLingSpace\n\nLooking forward to next time!",
