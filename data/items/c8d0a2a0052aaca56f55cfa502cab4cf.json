    "media:description": "In this lesson, you will learn how to TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER in Spanish while following a story about an imaginary character. \n\nThrough storytelling, as well as \"storyasking,\" you will have moments to practice speaking Spanish and respond to questions in the target language about the weather and our character.\n\nSpanish CI (Comprehensible Input) and TPRS (Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling) have been proven to be effective and engaging ways to learn a language. If you enjoy this approach to language acquisition, subscribe to my channel for more TPRS and Comprehensible Input videos to come!\n\nFreebie for my viewers!
