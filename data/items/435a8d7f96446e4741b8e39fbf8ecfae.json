  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ, and the boys chat about all the different things floating around the NFL as we enter week 18 of the season, what different playoff scenarios have presented themselves, and which teams are looking their best as we enter Super Wildcard Weekend. Joining the show to give more clairty and insight into the Antonio Brown situation in Tampa Bay and where it could go from here is Buccaneers reporter for the Tampa Bay Times and host of the Sports Day Tampa Bay Podcast, Rick Stroud (33:03-43:07). Later, Chuck Pagano joins Pat and AJ to chat about all the different stories in the NFL, Joe Judge's recent press conference and what happens going forward there, how you keep a team invested when the season is about to end and there is nothing left to play for, how difficult it is preparing for a team for the third time in a season, and more (44:17-1:26:10). Later, ESPN MLB Insider, Jeff \"The Jett\" Passan joins the show to discuss baseball's current lockout, how the game fixes this and moves forward, how the MLB actually makes money when it seems like less and less people care about the product than ever before, how he thinks this is all going to end, and much more (1:26:12-1:49:43).
