  "description": "<p>Episode 260 - We did it. 5 years of shows. I can’t believe it but thank you for joining along in this fun experiment in audio! Our guest this week is a repeat but one of my favorite vocalists of all time, Chris Colohan. He sings in the band Sect and owns the incredible company, Vegan Magic. He previously sang for the bands Cursed, Left For Dead, Burning Love, Countdown to Oblivion and more. He’s basically the realest of the real dudes you can ever meet. It had been a few years since our last chat, so I decided to celebrate and have him on the show. We get deep on what it’s like to run a business, the Southern Ontario hardcore scene and principles. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY! Step your wardrobe up by getting AMAZING clothes, underwear and more with Mack Weldon. Real talk, the best in the game.
