  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin. It’s all hands on deck for the politicians and first responders to help at Surfside, Florida. Yet, for the inhumane leftwing activists at the Washington Post, it's an opportunity to attack Governor Ron DeSantis with the hope that they can tie this to him somehow. Then, Olympian Gwen Berry was prepared with her \"Activist Athlete\" t-shirt this weekend to take a stand against the very country she was competing for. President Biden contributes to this destructive ideology with his hateful rhetoric which is echoed by Jen Psaki. Those who hate America will always focus on how to cast America in a negative light. Later, political indoctrination like Lat-Crit or critical Latino theory developed by white liberals suggests that white Protestant colonialists are the illegal aliens, not the indigenous people and Hispanics that originally that have inhabited the land. Moreover, critical gender theory professes that binary sexes have been replaced by 58 different gender types. This ideological oligopoly is supported by the media, academia, and big tech and will destroy history in the process. Then, do propagandists dressed up as tenured professors care about humanity and the crime wave that is sweeping the nation? The democrat party has unleashed an inhumane crime wave. The Marxist left displays a strikingly high degree of inhumanity primarily from cities run by Democrats with largely minority populations suffering at the hands of other minorities from the Democrat Party.  Finally, the climate change movement is just another of the Marxist Democrat's ways of controlling us and taking away our rights. This is an ideology that is dressed up in polar bears and melting ice caps in order to hide the iron fist. It is a grave threat to our existence, and the Biden administration has embraced a vast part of it.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
