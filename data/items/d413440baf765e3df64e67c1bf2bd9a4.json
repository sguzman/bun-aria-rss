  "description": "Moving to the cloud creates a tremendous opportunity to get security right and reduce the risk of data breach. But most cloud security initiatives get underway after services are deployed in the cloud. It’s frustrating when major breaches resulting from basic mistakes, like S3 buckets left unsecured or secrets exposed. Continually checking for risky configurations and unusual behavior in cloud logs is a requirement, but there is an opportunity to be proactive. What if you could configure your security and access controls as you set up cloud infrastructure? The CyberWire's Rick Howard speaks with Hash Table members Kevin Ford of North Dakota State government and Steve Winterfeld of Akamai, as well as sponsor Sysdig's Omer Azaria to discuss how security teams are adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security as part of their overall cloud security strategy to reduce risk.",
