  "description": "<p>Chris shares two encounters he had in Ohio. Chris writes \"I’m Chris, from Ohio. Would first like to say I really enjoy your show. I’ve been listening for a good 6 months or more now. I look forward to it every week. I’v been considering writing in for a little while now. I have a couple of stories that may be interesting for your show. I will try to sum them up quickly so you can get an idea.</p> <p>The first is a short story that happened to me back in June of this year. I was up with a friend in Sleeping Bear Dunes Michigan. It is a national lakeshore along lake Michigan. We were up for a weekend camp trip. One morning we got up early to go check out this overlook. It was about 7am we were walking the trail to this overlook. There was rainy weather off and on so that morning it was really foggy.</p> <p>Everything was still and dead quiet. As we were on the trail, suddenly something large came crashing down through the tree tops about 20-25 yards from us. When the object hit the ground it had a deep thud signifying it was very heavy. A minute or two later I started to hear what sounded like (the closest comparison I can think of) small children basically chattering off in the distance, in the direction the heavy object seemed to have come from.</p> <p>Immediately I thought of everything I had heard on your show. It seemed to me to be an exact replay of things I’ve heard other guests talk about. I continued to hear the chatter as we walked on. We made it to the overlook, hung out for a while and then headed back to the car. As we passed the same area of the chattering, I could still hear it only much more faint this time and farther away. I never saw anything, never heard any other movement or anything else. That was it. I can’t confirm anything but all of this reminded me of many other people’s encounters on the show, even occurring in the same order as others...\"</p>",
