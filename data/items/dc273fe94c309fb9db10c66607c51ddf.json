  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Speaker Pelosi's husband was attacked with a hammer and his skull was fractured. This follows the attack on Sen. Marco Rubio's campaign volunteer who now needs facial reconstructive surgery after he was beaten for being a Republican. It was Democrats that called to defund the police. It was Speaker Pelosi that called federal law enforcement \"stormtroopers\" during the BLM riots of 2020, and it was the police that saved Paul Pelosi's life. It was Sunny Hostin from The View that downplayed the attack on Congressman Lee Zeldin. Then, the DOJ will chill voting at Republican polling locations by deploying agents to immediately investigate complaints of voter intimidation. This is all the result of Donald Trump making more inroads with the Democrat base, in every demographic, than any other Republican president before him. Later, for Democrats it's not really about race, it's about the use of race. MSNBC pundits are unabashed anti-White racists, but they won't confront the White executives at their own media company. So why are they there? MSNBC offers no service to the United States. Afterward, US Senate candidate, Gen. Don Bolduc (Ret.), joins the show to explain why he is the best candidate in New Hampshire. Sen. Maggie Hassan has hurt New England's access to energy with her support for the democrat's radical climate policies. Finally, Sen. Ron Johnson calls in with an update on his re-election campaign against Lt. Gov Mandela Barnes. Johnson noted that Barnes is a radical leftist and is anti-law enforcement. Johnson has been targeted by the left for taking on the Biden Administration head-on. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
