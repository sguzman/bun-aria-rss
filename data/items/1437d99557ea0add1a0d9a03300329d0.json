In this prequel to the cult classic, they take a BIG swing, but does it connect? For the hit.&nbsp; It’s a baseball metaphor.&nbsp; Then our Malick Marathon continues with its penultimate entry, ‘Night Of The Cups’. Christian Bale stars as a lost man in search of himself. As there is apparently raging hurricanes around him at all times as Malick’s camera is never stationary.&nbsp;There’s the life-bringing rundown of the big releases on Physical Media, featuring the Streaming and Straight to DVD Picks of the Week, plus Chris checks in on whether Matt watched that first episode of ‘Garth Marenghi’s Dark Place’. Finally, Matt and Chris close out the show with another round of Call It!&nbsp; What’s making the cut this time…?</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">00:00-14:20: <strong>Intro/Orphan: First Kill</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">14:21-30:02: <strong>Physical Media & Darkplace</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">30:03-42:50: <strong>Knight Of The Cups</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">42:51-1:00:01: <strong>Call It!</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">1:00:02-1:01:37: <strong>Wrap Up</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Theme music by Jamal Malachi Ford-Bey</p>",
