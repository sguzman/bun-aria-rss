  "description": "<p>Today’s show is LOADED with a couple of incredible conversations. First, Pat is joined by former 33rd pick of the 1999 NBA Draft, Point Guard for the Denver Nuggets and Boston Celtics, subject of the 30-for-30 <em>Unguarded,</em> creator of Herren Talks, the Herren Project, and Herren Wellness<em>, </em>the pride of Fall River, Massachusetts, Chris Herren. Pat and Chris chat about his story which details the incredible lengths he had to go to recover from drug addiction. He relives some of the moments that he thinks impacted his life the most, chats about what he’s doing to help struggling addicts now, and why he wouldn’t change anything that has happened (2:16-28:56). Next, former UFC Heavyweight Champion, UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, Strikeforce Heavyweight Grand Prix Champion, King of the Cage Heavyweight Champion, UFC announcer, and current #1 Heavyweight contender, “DC” Daniel Cormier joins the program. Pat and DC discuss how his upcoming trilogy fight on August 15th against Stipe Miocic will be the last fight of his career, what it’s like facing someone for the third time, his thoughts on the pay scale in the UFC and how some fighters might be going about it wrong, what his training camp schedule looks like, if the smaller cage will be an advantage for him, and how his competitive mindset has driven him throughout his career (28:58-1:00:44). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ tell a couple of stories, shoot the breeze, and discuss everything that has been happening in the sports world (1:00:46-2:27:21). To close out the show, 2010 PGA Tour Rookie of the Year, owner of 9 wins as professional golfer including the 2015 Players Championship, owner of 3 runner-ups in Majors and a T3, one of the most interesting men in golf, Rickie Fowler joins the program. Pat and Rickie discuss what a typical practice round is like for a PGA pro, what kind of music he listens to while he’s playing, how having a close group of buddies on tour has helped his golf game, who thinks the best golfer of all-time is, what his relationship on the course with Phil Mickelson is like, what he’s doing with Rocket Mortgage to help the city of Detroit, and what he does mentally when he has an off day on the golf course (2:27:23-2:39:03). Don’t forget to send in a picture of where you’re listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch. We appreciate you all. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
