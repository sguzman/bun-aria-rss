  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We’re tackling one of Sarah’s favorite tropes this week — the celebrity romance! We talk about all the ways that her buttons were installed (thanks Judith McNaught) and about how rare movie stars are in romance even now, all these years later. We discuss The Chrises, the appeal of celebrity/normal person pairings, the difference between film/tv romance and rockstar/sports star romance, and about  why Americans especially love a celebrity. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Oh, and we get into our own existential despair.
