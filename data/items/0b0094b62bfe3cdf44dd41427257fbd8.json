  "description": "<p>When Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced last week that he would retire this summer, attention immediately turned to the few senators who are willing to break from their parties on major issues — and who may hold the fate of the next Supreme Court nominee in their hands. We speak to one of them. Guest: Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. For more information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.</p><p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this episode included a comment from Senator Susan Collins that misstated Americans’ views on the Supreme Court’s ruling in Roe v. Wade. While Americans are deeply divided on abortion rights, about 69 percent of adults oppose overturning the Supreme Court precedent; it is not “something like a 51-49” issue, as Ms. Collins said.</em></p>\n",
