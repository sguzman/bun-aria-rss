  "description": "<p>It's time to return to the sport of rowing today as we sit down and chat with Tokyo Bronze Medalist Luke Letcher about his career and his Olympic experience. We learn from Luke just how he got into rowing and the process it involved to go from just starting out through to competing for Australia on the world stage. We also learn just how close he was to walking away from the sport, and how the pandemic actually helped him to eventually land a spot on the Tokyo Olympic team. Added to this we learn more about that epic day 5 of Tokyo and how the energy was in the rowing team with all the success that followed, as well as learning more about his love for a certain classic Australian movie. It's a great chat that we know you will love, so click away and get to listening!</p>",
