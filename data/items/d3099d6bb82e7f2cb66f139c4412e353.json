  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Does the Bible have anything to say about the police? What about racial diversity? Are Christians called to submit to the government or reform it? Professor and Anglican priest, Esau McCaulley, talks about his new book, “Reading While Black,” and the African-American tradition of Scripture interpretation that avoids the either/or (conservative vs. liberal) thinking typical in the white church. Also this week, Phil shares about his experience being interviewed by Kirk Cameron and goes on a rant about “false binaries.” Christian is now an “award-winning” filmmaker. What should a useful voter guide for Christians include? And clowns object to the first presidential debate being called a “circus.”</p> <p class=\"p1\">\"How Do Christians Fit Into the Two-Party System?
