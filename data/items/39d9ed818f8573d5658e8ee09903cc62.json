  "description": "It's Affidavit Day! Clay and Buck continue to break down the heavily redacted Mar-a-Largo affidavit. AG Merrick Garland has painted himself into a ridiculous corner. Why did it take 18 months for the National Archives to call for these documents? Buck says, \"I never thought of the National Archives once when I was in the CIA,\" and he tells Clay that Clay is the only person he ever met who made a point of hanging out in the National Archives. Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson joins C&B to react to the heavily blacked-out affidavit and on his letter to DOJ revealing new FBI whistleblower allegations in the Hunter Biden investigation. You'd have to be crazy to charge Trump over these documents.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
