  "description": "<p>Here is Sundays early release. I will be speaking to four guests tonight. My first guest writes “I’ve recently started tuning into your podcast. My dad told me about it Friday and today I’ve been able to listen to it. And I’ve been listening since 9 this morning. I wanted to share my experience/encounters with you. My name is Sebastian.</p> <p>I have a couple experiences in Illinois and one in Idaho. The first instance took place when my brother and I were walking through the woods out by Staunton lake in Illinois. We went down the spillway and were walking the trails back behind the lake. We were about a mile into the woods and my little brother decided he wanted to stop and rest. So I went to walk a little farther ahead. I walked maybe 50 yards away from him before I realized it was dead silent. Which it wasn’t before. There were birds chirping and squirrels running around and just sounds of activity maybe 5 minutes prior to me realizing. After I realized it was quiet I slowed my pace. And took maybe fifteen more steps before I heard a branch break up the hill to my right. And right after I heard the break there was a low toned grunt that came afterwards. I was 13 at the time. And my little brother was 9. I heard the grunt and immediately took off running back towards my brother. I came barreling past him and all I could say was run. We ran all the way back to the road and made the mile walk back into town. He kept questioning me about why we ran. And I told him about the noise. He didn’t believe me. Well 3 or 4 weeks later we were at the same lake. It was about 9:30 to 10 at night. We were night fishing. We weren’t having any luck so we decided to throw rocks and sticks and anything else we could find across the little cove into the woods on the other side. We had a fairly bright lantern that lit up the other side of the cove, but just to the base of the tree line. We couldn’t see anything else past the tree line. Well maybe 20 minutes after we stopped throwing rocks and everything we heard some movement just out of eye sight on the other side of the cove. And then rocks started coming out of the tree line towards us. None made it to us, they all just hit the water in front of us. At the time I thought it was just people.</p> <p>That’s still a possibility. It wasn’t super remote. I’m not sure what happened out at the lake. And I’ll never know for sure. But my experience in Idaho is a little different. I’m getting goose bumps just typing about it. In 2016 I moved to Idaho with the girl I was seeing at the time. I was 19. We moved to Idaho falls in south east Idaho. Well it was late September and my girlfriends parents and I got into a little argument and I wasn’t wanting to stay there that night. So I packed a blanket and pillow into our 2001 Honda Accord we had, and drove about 8 miles outside of town into the mountains. It was a bright moon and plenty of stars. No light pollution. So it was very well lit. I eventually found this rock road off the main road, and I took it for about another mile. And then a red dirt road came off of the rock road and went back further towards the mountains. I had never been there before so it was all new terrain. I decided to take that dirt road. And it was full of twists and turns and it eventually lead me down the side of the mountain on the backside from where I came in at. It lead down to a valley in between these two mountains. And it had a small river running through it. I got down there and decided that was where I was going to sleep for the night. I shut the car off and the lights. I didn’t have any service on my phone, so I was playing games and smoking cigarettes in the car to try to pass time. It was about midnight. Now from the front of my car to the creek bank was about 6 feet. And I could tell from looking that there was a small drop off from the bank down to the creek. Maybe 3 feet or so. And there were bushes along the bank. The creek itself was maybe 15 feet away. Well anyway something told me to look up from my phone. I’m not sure why I did it. Or what possessed me to look up. But something told me to look up. And when I did I seen this very large hairy man like looking thing standing with it’s back turned to me in the creek. Maybe 20 feet away. Just into the creek. It was a dark brown. Not quite black. Hair was maybe 2 inches in length. I didn’t see arms passed the elbow at first. Then I realized they were kinda bent up. Like it’s hands were by its mouth, so I couldn’t see the forearms. I’m not sure if it was eating fish or what it was doing. But I got terrified.</p> <p>So I flipped the headlights of the car on. When I did that it instantly dropped to the ground. Quicker than I’ve ever seen. It was there then it wasn’t. And in a matter of maybe 2 seconds it went from 20 feet to peeking at me through the bushes right at the edge of the bank. 6 foot away from the front of my car. I could see it’s eyes, and the skin around the eyes. But nothing else. Massive eyes. Almost like baseballs, but just a little smaller. And we locked eyes for what felt like an eternity. But in reality probably no more than 3 or 4 seconds. After those few seconds went by I started the car and slowly started to reverse. When I did it didn’t move, flinch or nothing. Just kept my face in its sight. I backed up a little bit to where I’d be able to drive off and floored it. Sped up the mountain. Almost rolling off in the process of trying to get away. Now I’m a big guy. I’m 6’5 and 280 lbs. I’ve been training in martial arts for the last 9 years now. I know I can hold my own against certain things. I was the same size at 19. I’m 22 now. And I felt helpless. Like I could have fought with everything I had, and it not even register on this things scale, not even faze it. It was immense. I’ve been 15 feet away from a grizzly before while in a vehicle. And I though that was massive. But the grizzly had nothing on what I saw. My shoulder width is just a little over 2 feet. The shoulder width of this was easily two to three times mine. And it was easily a foot and a half to two feet taller than I was if I had to judge it. The back wasn’t necessarily like cut and lean, but I could tell there was a fair amount of muscle in the back. And the back of the arms looked muscular. And it had the cone shaped head. I’ve shared my Illinois encounters with other people. But never my Idaho encounter. And your show made me want to reach out.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Check out Ron's website <a href=\"http://ronmorehead.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://ronmorehead.com/</a></p>",
