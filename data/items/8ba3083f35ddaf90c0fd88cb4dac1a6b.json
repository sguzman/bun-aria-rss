  "description": "<p>Subscribe, rate five stars, and leave a review!\n\nKFC made his way to Boston to join Feits for Memorial Day and is having his \"Jordan Flu Game\" of podcasting on a hangover. Would you rather be the Pope or the President? We have a funeral for the term \"Karen\" on social media. Top 5 Tuesday returns with Top 5 Holidays. Tweet us your top 5(social links below). Voicemails include \"am I a virgin?\", backhanded gifts, and pro sports vs leisure sports.\n\n(01:01:50)Tim Dillon joins the show. We discuss the overuse of the term hero, convincing people you know what you're talking about by speaking with conviction, questioning billionaires, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Call Her Daddy, and much more.\n\n(01:41:58) Steve Wilkos joins the show. We discuss how he went from Jerry Springer's body guard to having a show of his own, having an iconic look, and several crazy stories from his time as a body guard.\n\nAs always, let us know what you think of the podcast and follow along on twitter.\n@KFCRadio @KFCBarstool @Feitsbarstool @TimJDillon @SteveWilkosTV\n\nSubscribe to our Youtube Channel here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/KFCradio\n\nFollow Us on Instagram Here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kfcradio/\n\n#KFCRadio #TimDillon #SteveWilkos</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
