  "description": "<p>The city of San Antonio is beautiful. It is home to the infamous Alamo. And right next to the Alamo sits the Emily Morgan Hotel. The hotel is considered the official hotel of the Alamo. It was once a state of the art medical facility. Today it is a DoubleTree by Hilton hotel that offers luxurious accommodations in a beautiful historic building. Those accommodations offer more than just luxuries. There are reportedly ghosts in this building. Some believe that the hotel is far more haunted than even the Alamo, where so many more people died. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Emily Morgan Hotel. Moment in Oddity features the kidnapping of Charlie Chaplin's body and This Day in History features the conviction of Boss Tweed.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/11/hgb-podcast-ep-83-emily-morgan-hotel.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/11/hgb-podcast-ep-83-emily-morgan-hotel.html</a></p> <p>Thank you to our executive producers who make this show possible!
