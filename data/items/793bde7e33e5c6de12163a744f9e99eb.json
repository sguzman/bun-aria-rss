  "description": "<p>The game of Go has been highly under-researched due to the lack of game\nrecords and analysis tools. In recent years, the increasing number of\nprofessional competitions and the advent of AlphaZero-based algorithms provide\nan excellent opportunity for analyzing human Go games on a large scale. In this\npaper, we present the ProfessionAl Go annotation datasEt (PAGE), containing\n98,525 games played by 2,007 professional players and spans over 70 years. The\ndataset includes rich AI analysis results for each move. Moreover, PAGE\nprovides detailed metadata for every player and game after manual cleaning and\nlabeling. Beyond the preliminary analysis of the dataset, we provide sample\ntasks that benefit from our dataset to demonstrate the potential application of\nPAGE in multiple research directions. To the best of our knowledge, PAGE is the\nfirst dataset with extensive annotation in the game of Go. This work is an\nextended version of [1] where we perform a more detailed description, analysis,\nand application.\n</p>",
