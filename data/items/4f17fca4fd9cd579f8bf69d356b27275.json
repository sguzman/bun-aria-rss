  "description": "<p>A club is a place for dancing, for abandon, for music, and for meeting strangers. Romeo Oriogun recalls a gay club that was for all those things, but also for escape. Living in a place where queer lives were under threat, he offers a praise song for this cathedral of safety and movement. Outside the world is silent, but inside the bar, people carry stories of their own desire, of their families, of their hopes; both for the future and the present.</p><p><strong>Romeo Oriogun</strong> is a Nigerian poet, essayist, and author of <i>Sacrament of Bodies</i> (University of Nebraska) and three chapbooks. He is the winner of the 2017 Brunel International African Poetry Prize. His poems have appeared in <i>Poetry</i>, <i>Harvard Review</i>, <i>American Poetry Review</i>, <i>Poetry London</i>, <i>The Poetry Review</i>, <i>Narrative Magazine</i>, <i>The Common</i>, and others. A graduate of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, his poems have been translated into several languages.</p><p>Find <a href=\"https://onbeing.org/programs/romeo-oriogun-pink-club/#transcript\">the transcript</a> for this show at onbeing.org.</p>\n",
