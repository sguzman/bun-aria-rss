  "description": "Two viral videos provide more evidence that western civilization is in rapid decline. One shows a woman giggling and smiling as she goes into a Planned Parenthood to kill her child. The other shows a drag queen dancing suggestively for a young girl as her parents look on and applaud. We'll discuss all of this. Also, coronavirus news, election news, and California's heroic efforts to battle gender segregated toy stores.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
