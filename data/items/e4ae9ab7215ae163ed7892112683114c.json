  "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Where do Nerds end and Perverts begin - and are you down for a little Hard Justice while bent over the hood of a Batmobile? When Bruce Wang’s long lost lover returns from Australia, she needs Bruce’s help to get her mojo back. He wants to help - and where better than ComicCon?! Brace yourselves, dear listener, cause there’s a lot of Cameos in this episode: Wolverine, Catwoman, Doctor Who, Superman, AquaMan, Boy Robin, Deadpool, that super hot Centaur guy from the Old Spice commercial - but thankfully, Squirrel Girl never makes an appearance. Yes, those really ‘out there’ fantasies can come true; all it takes is a clever, enthusiastic co-conspirator. #NerdAndPerverts #NewExperience</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>Song: ‘Trouble in Metropolis’ (Jefferson Bergey)</strong></p> <p class=\"p4\"><strong>Learn more about Jefferson Bergey at:</strong></p> <p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"http://JeffersonBergey.com\"><strong>JeffersonBergey.com</strong></a></span> <strong>or help him create at</strong></p> <p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"http://patreon.com/JeffersonBergey\"><strong>patreon.com/JeffersonBergey</strong></a></span><strong><br /> </strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>About the Storyteller:</em></strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>Bruce Wang is a prolific and well-respected Comic Book Writer and Cartoonist.
