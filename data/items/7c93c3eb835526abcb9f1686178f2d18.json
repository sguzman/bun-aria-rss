  "description": "The Democrat party doesn't support Roe v. Wade, what they really favor is infanticide. Americans must push back. Dishonest ideologically driven people who've taken over the Democrat Party want to take over this country by insisting that they destroy our Constitution and whatever they disagree with. The left's attack on Donald Trump is really an attack on America and each and every one of us. The airwaves are filled with leftwing reporters and former federal prosecutors distorting the notion of what truth really is. The rationale for a surprise emergency January 6 hearing doesn't add up. In less than 24 hours many in the media, conservative and otherwise, were duped by the testimony of one aide who was not a senior staffer to the President and had not been an eyewitness to anything. The uncorroborated testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson, without any cross-examination, was almost immediately challenged as false by the United States Secret Service. President Biden was embarrassingly asked if America was going backward while he was in Spain and trashed the US Supreme Court in the process. Biden's misstatements embolden the radical culture of death perpetrated by the left.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
