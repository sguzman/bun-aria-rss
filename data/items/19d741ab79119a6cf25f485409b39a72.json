  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Clarence Thomas wrote a brilliant opinion on the now unconstitutional New York law regarding carrying a concealed pistol or revolver. The Supreme Court found that New York's 'proper cause' law violated the second amendment and prior case law. No special need or 'proper cause' is needed, as that would violate the 14th amendment. There is no need to demonstrate 'proper cause' for one's right to free speech or any other Constitutional right, and as such one's right to protect themselves in their home extends outside their home as well. A state's regulations may not impede one's constitutional right. Then, the DOJ raided the home of Jeffrey Clark a former DOJ official from the Trump era. Several of Mr. Clark's colleagues are now trashing him, and it seems odd. House Republicans have announced preliminary findings of their investigation into Speaker Pelosi's failure to secure the capitol on January 6th. Afterward, Ken Hartman from Our Community Salutes recognizes young people in the military and teaches them about the US Constitution.\n \n \nTAGS: Clarence, Thomas, constitution, New York, NY, unconstitutional, conceal, carry, gun, pistol, revolver, scotus, supreme court, second amendment, 2a, free speech, Department of Justice, DoJ, Jeffery Clark, Pelosi, January 6, Ken Hartman, Hartman, Our Community Salutes\nLearn more about your ad choices.
