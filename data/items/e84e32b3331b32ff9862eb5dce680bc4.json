Despite what you might see on my YouTube page now, this was my experience on the platform several years ago when I first started. In fact, I got so frustrated I nearly gave up on it entirely. Does this describe your current circumstance? If so, fear not my friend. Today on the podcast I'm joined by the one and only Tim Schmoyer.

I know firsthand that Tim is the real deal as he and his company have been instrumental in helping me grow my YouTube presence over the last several years. One thing is for certain, whether you're a complete novice or a seasoned pro, Tim shares extremely valuable insight on all things YouTube.
