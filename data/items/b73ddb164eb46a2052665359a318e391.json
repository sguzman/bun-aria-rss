    "media:description": "This video presents theories about general game design concepts. It’s not meant to prescribe a set of ideals which all games must follow. However valuable any guideline might be, it’s always (or almost always) possible to imagine a game which is made better by ignoring such considerations. A great game cannot necessarily be made just by applying a set of principles.\n\nI don’t know if/when I’ll be making another video but if you enjoyed this one and would like to support me, you can make a pledge. There’s no reward for doing so but this video wouldn’t exist without the support of my patrons.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/matthewmatosis",
