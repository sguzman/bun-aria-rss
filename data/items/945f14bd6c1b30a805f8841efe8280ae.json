  "description": "Investors should be aware that false statements may be made -- including in company press releases, promotional materials, and social media posts -- about a company offering or developing products that prevent, detect, or treat COVID-19, in order to inflate the value of a company’s stock.  Fraudulent stock promotions of these companies also may be made through “research reports” that make predictions of a specific “target price.”  Never invest in a company based solely on information in a press release or stock promotion.  If claims about the company’s products are inaccurate or unreliable, you may lose a lot of the money you invest.",
