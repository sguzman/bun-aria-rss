  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the guys have arguably the best available conversation on the internet today ranging from Dan Marino's time in Miami, what's going on in the NFL, which comedians and TV shows wouldn't fly in today's PC culture, Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande calling it quits, and Goldman Sachs CEO moonlighting as a DJ. Also joining the show is an absolute icon in the world of sportscasting, the man, the myth, the legend, and host of the Dan Patrick Show, Dan Patrick, calls in for an incredibly candid and insightful conversation. They cover his exit from ESPN and his thoughts in the weeks after his departure, how the Dan Patrick Show came to be, what he thinks of the daily grind of radio, whether or not he misses Football Night in America, how he's formulated his interview style over the years, and what he thinks of the NFL so far this year (3:53-24:33). Today's episode is a great one. Come laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
