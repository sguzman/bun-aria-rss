  "title": "Ep. 775 - Dangerous, Radical, Far-Right Mob Promotes Science And Common Sense",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media is reporting that I was part of a radical, chaotic, extremist, dangerous mob at the school board meeting a few days ago. That’s not exactly how I remember it. This is just one of the lies they are telling as part of their latest push to convince you to panic over COVID all over again. Also, a woman in California has been charged with murder after throwing her infant off of a roof. She obviously deserves to rot in prison for what she did, and yet I can’t help but notice that if she had killed her infant only a few months earlier, and for the same reason, we would be told to celebrate her. And, Media Matters publishes a report highlighting the supposed “transphobia” of the Daily Wire in a transparent effort to get us booted from YouTube. Finally, in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll try to figure out whether it is actually sexist to describe a woman as “nice.” Jen Psaki says it is. \n\nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
