  "description": "Hey HBs! Come enjoy part 1 of REBEL by Beverly Jenkins! We've got a teacher who's calling in life is to help as newly-free people learn to read and write as possible and the dashing Captain who just wants to support her dreams and love her forever and maybe do sex in a tree house that he built with is own two hands! This America Times book is as densely-packed with wisdom as it is with sizzling banter and inspiring content.&nbsp;To hear Part 2, check out episode 129!\nBonus Content: 50 points to Slytherin after Melody sings AGAIN, Melody is a MILF with an equally sexy new ride, Erin and Melody learn a ton more about Reconstruction (which is firmly in America Times), \"your thing or my thing?\", lobster bisque fiascos, and so much more!&nbsp;\nLady Loves: Social Distancing! Let's all to it (not) together! Seriously, stay in your house, wash your hands for 20 seconds VERY frequently, wipe all smooth surfaces down with disinfecting solution regularly, and consolidate grocery shopping as much as possible. Also, shop for the elderly! If you're older, let people shop for you! Have you ever wanted to do a Love Actually with the signs? Erin thinks that's how you should ask your elderly neighbor if they need groceries. It's firmly her idea and no one else's.
