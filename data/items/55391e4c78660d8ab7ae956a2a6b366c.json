A week after White House aide Rob Porter resigned over domestic abuse allegations, President Trump said publicly for the first time that he is \"totally opposed to domestic violence.\" And with Congress still struggling to reach a deal on DACA and immigration, how would either outcome — bill or no bill — motivate voters? This episode, host/White House correspondent Tamara Keith, political reporter Asma Khalid, editor correspondent Ron Elving and national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
