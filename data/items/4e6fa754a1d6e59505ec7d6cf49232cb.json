  "description": "<p>I love David Farrier. His documentary <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tickled\"><em>Tickled</em></a><em> </em>was one of the most captivating and bizarre stories I have ever seen put to film and from then I just seemed to encounter his work across the web. Fast forward a few years later and our paths crossed when friend (and previous guest of the show, <a href=\"https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/100-words-or-less-the-podcast-15697/episodes/aaron-harris-from-isis-the-ban-31249124\">Aaron Harris from Isis</a>) connected us over email and then, it all came together. I had to have him on the pod to discuss his love of music, connection to subcultures and film making.
