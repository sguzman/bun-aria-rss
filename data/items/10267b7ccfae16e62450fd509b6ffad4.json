  "description": "<p>In Episode 5 of the Being Human is Good For Business Podcast, learn about the leaders who use their heads! These people rely on their head center of intelligence, their intellect, to lead their teams through good both times and bad. </p><p>Among this group are Enneagram Types 5, 6 and 7. These leaders are intellectually curious and are often seen as insightful, even visionary.  They are analytical and like to have a good solid plan for every eventuality, but often, deep down, they don’t trust. </p><p>“In these COVID times, we are seeing a lot of head-centered leadership,” says Trilogy Effect founding partner Wendy Appel, author of InsideOut Enneagram: The Game-Changing Guide for Leaders. “These leaders are excellent researchers and can expertly synthesise a lot of facts and information to support decisions and formulate plans. Often, it’s difficult for them to trust others or what may come, so to alleviate their fears they rely on hard data.”</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/about-us#the-approach-section\">Enneagram framework</a> helps leaders become more self-aware and to access the full potential of their teams. The Enneagram comprises nine distinct personality Types which are bundled into groups of three, based on core motivations, specific strengths and liabilities.
