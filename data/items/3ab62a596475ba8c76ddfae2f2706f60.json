  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that Russia has retaliated against the US with diplomatic expulsions and at least one consulate closure. Potential cyber operations remain a matter of concern. Julian Assange no longer has Internet access in his room at Ecuador's embassy. WannaCry hits a Boeing plant, but Boeing is resilient enough to work through the infection. A new keylogger pretends to be Kaspersky AV, but not very convincingly. Facebook works to upgrade user privacy, and Apple says it doesn't need to do the same. David Dufour from Webroot with tips for first-time conference goers. Guest is Deral Heiland from Rapid7 on smart sensors.",
