  "description": "The Caribbean has figuratively and literally been entangled in processes of global integration earlier than other parts of the Americas.\nIn Isles of Noise: Sonic Media in the Caribbean (UNC Press, 2016), Alejandra Bronfman offers a refreshing perspective to this well-trodden story. In this book, she traces the emergence and growth of telecommunications technologies in Haiti, Jamaica, and Cuba during the first half of the twentieth century.\nBronfman examines the ways these new communication technologies often undermined rather than served as tools of domination for imperial forces—American or British.\nMost importantly, this book has us reconsider the role of sound and, specifically, radio broadcasting as central to political mobilization in ridding the region from empire.\nAlejandra Bronfman is Chair and Associate Professor, Latin American, Caribbean & U.S. Latino Studies, University of Albany.\nSharika Crawford is an associate professor of history at the United States Naval Academy. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
