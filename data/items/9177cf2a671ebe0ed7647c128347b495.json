They've had their eggs, they've eaten their toast, and they're still listening to Paul Edgecombe as he tells his story over a warm glass of orange juice. The end is near, though. Join Dan Caffrey, Jenn Adams, Dan Pfleegor, and Michael Roffman as they reach the last pages of Stephen King's 1996 serialized novel, <em>The Green Mile</em>. In the second of two episodes dedicated to the book, they discuss its blemishes, its beauties, and its bones. They also discuss the loose connections to King's other works (there is one intriguing tie to The Dark Tower), the many, many slices of poundcake within, and eventually how many bright-red Pennywise clown noses this novel deserves. Stay tuned for the film adaptation in December.</p><br><p><strong>Chapters include:</strong> Intro, Misery (6:30), Sematary (25:00), Word Processor (45:00), Mudcake (1:00:00), King’s Dominion (1:15:00), Final Thoughts (1:24:00), and Outro (1:38:00)</p><br><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://scottwoodsmakeslists.wordpress.com/2015/01/09/stephen-kings-magical-negro-problem-isnt-magical/?fbclid=IwAR1G78uOMQPoHuw8B0cCaxQPEq6uQ-XbGbJjKixU6Z-iE1h7Op-_rWLAwiI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen King's Magical Negro Problem Isn't Magical</a>, <a href=\"http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/articles/stephen-kings-super-duper-magical-negroes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen King's Super-Duper Magical Negroes</a>, <a href=\"https://poormagazine.org/node/5649\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Magical Negro: From The Green Mile to Get Out</a>, and <a href=\"https://level.medium.com/stephen-king-needs-more-black-friends-5547f245d424\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen King Needs More Black Friends</a></p><br><p><strong>Follow us on </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/losersclubpod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LosersClubPod\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thelosersclubpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> </strong>| <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thebarrens\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
