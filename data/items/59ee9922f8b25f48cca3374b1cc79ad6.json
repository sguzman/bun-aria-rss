  "description": "<p>There’s a lot of crappy financial advice out there. Some sayings you might hear all the time and you’re not even sure where they even originated- maybe they’re more of a proverbial phrase. There are also bits of wisdom that might have been good at some point, but are now just outdated- it’s time to retire those old ways of thinking! And other phrases might just be broad blanket statements, but our financial landscape today requires a bit more nuance. We’re going to tackle some of these sayings and determine what we should and shouldn’t be doing with our money.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Golden Sabbath by Big Island Brewhaus- another big thanks to Cody in Hawaii for donating these beers to the show this week!
