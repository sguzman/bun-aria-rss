  "description": "<p>NEW BFFs MERCH DROP HERE: https://store.barstoolsports.com/collections/bffs\n\nWe are joined to start by Teala Dunn who talks childhood acting, her life on social media, and being hated on the internet for what seems to be no apparent reason. We play a game of \"Love It Or Hate It\" where we decide if polarizing figures deserve the hate they get, or if it is unjustified. We end with an impromptu game of FMK where some things come out that other may have wanted to keep under wraps. \n\nWe are then joined by Nikki Glaser where we talk her life in comedy, her new show, and teach her about the world of Tik Tok. We finish with headlines and talk of yes, another new Josh Richard's girl, but will this be the one to change him?\n\n\nSupport our sponsors!\n\nCoinbase: Sign up at https://barstool.link/CoinbaseBFF for $10 in free Bitcoin\nGametime: Download the Gametime app and redeem code BFF for $20 off your first purchase (terms apply).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
