  "description": "<div>Long before the hit podcast <em>Serial </em>spurred the world into podcast-listening, Rabia Chaudry was on a mission. The 1999 murder of a high school student named Hae Min Lee left a community grieving and a family friend of Rabia’s, 17-year-old Adnan Syed, in the crosshairs. He was sentenced to life in prison, where he still is to this day. In this episode, we’ll trace Rabia’s decades-long fight to free Adnan, find Hae’s killer and champion the truths of so many others along the way.</div>\n<div>\n<br>\nThis episode is part of a ten-part series called<em> Let The Women Do The Work</em>.
