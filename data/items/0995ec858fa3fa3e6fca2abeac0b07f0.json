We do this to help educators amplify their efforts and, most importantly, help students pursue their personal potential. Today, we’re sharing new updates to Chromebooks, Google Classroom and Google Meet to set up teachers and students for success ahead of the next school year.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"tt1uv\">Create screencasts and cast to a big screen with Chromebooks</h3><p data-block-key=\"b3qvu\">From sharing devices to 1:1, to teachers using Chromebooks alongside students, we’re constantly evolving our features to meet the needs of the classroom. We’re adding new features like the Screencast app, built into Chrome OS in M103, where you can record, trim, share and view transcribed screencasts — and create a custom library of videos automatically saved in Google Drive. Cast moderator is a new mode coming to select devices with Google TV that enables both educators and students to wirelessly share their Chromebook screen to a class display using an access code, so that only folks in the same classroom as the display are able to cast. To get notified on availability of cast moderator hardware, <a href=\"http://goo.gle/castmoderator-interest\">express interest in this form.</a> And for more on what’s new for Chromebooks, <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/theanywhereschool-chromebook\">read our blog</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-video\"><div class=\"h-c-page h-c-page--mobile-full-bleed\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><div class=\"h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col-l--10 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-1\"><div class=\"article-module uni-article-video uni-article-video--body\" data-component=\"uni-article-yt-player\" data-page-title=\"\" data-video-id=\"7mp1TcpJfF4\"><div class=\"uni-article-video__embed-container hidden\"><div id=\"uni-article-yt-player-7mp1TcpJfF4\"></div></div><figure><a class=\"h-c-video h-c-video--marquee uni-article-video__custom-wrapper\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"uni-article-video__aspect-image\"><img alt=\"YouTube video of Screencast on Chromebooks\" data-loading='{\n                        \"mobile\": \"//img.youtube.com/vi/7mp1TcpJfF4/sddefault.jpg\",\n                        \"desktop\": \"//img.youtube.com/vi/7mp1TcpJfF4/maxresdefault.jpg\"\n                      }' loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//img.youtube.com/vi/7mp1TcpJfF4/default.jpg\"/><div class=\"uni-article-video__dimmer\"></div><svg class=\"uni-article-video__play-button--active\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#yt_video_play_button_no_hole\"></use></svg><svg class=\"uni-article-video__play-button\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#yt_video_play_button\"></use></svg><div class=\"uni-article-video__duration loading\"><svg class=\"uni-article-video__duration-icon\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#yt_video_duration\"></use></svg><span class=\"uni-article-video__duration-time\">10:25</span></div></div></a></figure></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"tt1uv\">Adaptive learning enhancements in Google Classroom</h3><p data-block-key=\"1kpun\">We’re rolling out new<a href=\"https://edu.google.com/workspace-for-education/classroom/\">integrations and tools</a> to improve teachers’ day-to-day tasks and help students grow their skills. Practice sets lean into adaptive learning by giving students instant feedback on their answers and real-time support if they get stuck — providing automated insights for teachers to identify potential gaps in students’ understanding. Practice sets are now globally available in beta, and in English only, for Google Workspace for Education customers with Education Plus or Teaching and Learning Upgrade. <a href=\"http://goo.gle/practicesets-beta\">Sign up here to get access.</a> With add-ons, we’re making it possible for students and teachers to access more than 15 EdTech tools, like Kahoot! and Pear Deck, all with a single login. Teachers can create engaging assignments and see new grading experiences, while students don’t have to worry about remembering extra passwords and navigating external websites. Add-ons will be available with Education Plus or Teaching and Learning Upgrade. And to get ready for the new school year or semester, we’re expanding our roster import feature in Google Workspace for Education Plus to an additional 15 countries, in partnership with Elevate Data Sync, so class lists can automatically be synced with student information systems. <a href=\"https://goo.gle/elevatedatasync-beta\">Sign up here for the beta</a>.

Now, Meet calls can be auto-transcribed directly into a Google Doc for easy lesson reviews and the ability to search for keywords and concepts. Ever wished you could keep tabs on your class <i>and</i> present from another tab? Now you can, with Picture in Picture in Meet, where you can navigate other tabs in Chrome while viewing 4 tiles of students in a Meet call. And to keep your class engaged and regularly check for understanding, you can now add polls and Q&amp;A to Live-streams, and live-stream directly to YouTube.

The magic happens when tech is put in the hands of teachers who know how to engage students, to challenge them and instill that love of learning. Education is not one size fits all — and neither is the technology that powers education.</p></div></div></body></html>",
