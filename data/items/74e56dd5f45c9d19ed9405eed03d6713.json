After checking everyones juice levels, the conversation about the latest and greatest shows and movies begins. The boys then jump right into the Pod FOD, which is a folder compiled of all things around the internet. Todays FOD is kicked off by a gruesomely decorated front yard which may be a little too much, we get a look inside the fridge of Boston Connor, Elon Musk offering 100 million for a seemingly simple task and much much more.
