  "description": "<p>Oftentimes here on the podcast we talk about our daily lives. We’ll share little ways that we’re saving money, or you get to hear about our curb alert scores, and we might even talk a little too much about how much we’re riding our bikes. So if you’ve been listening for a few years you might know a good bit about us- that happens after 460 episodes! But we’ve never done a deep-dive origin story on the show and what better time to do that than here at the beginning of the year. Especially as we’re likely welcoming some new listeners to the fold. So during this episode you’ll get to learn all about Matt’s money origin story- how he was taught personal finance principles, his money struggles growing up, why he shouldn’t have opened a Roth IRA, and how Downton Abbey helped Matt and his wife Kate discover financial independence.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Athena Paradiso Blackberry by Creature Comforts!
