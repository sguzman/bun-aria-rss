It wasn&#8217;t until Friday though that we officially reached the depths of a bear market.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-3368\"></span></p>\n<p>There are different theories what defines a bear market. The most common is 20% pullback in an index. As <a href=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/2018/03/24/the-bull-barely-survived-on-friday/\">readers of this blog are aware</a>, I follow a slightly different definition, based on <a href=\"https://thedowtheory.com\">Jack Schannep&#8217;s work</a>. Based on this definition, a bear market is official when two of the three major indexes (Dow Jones Industrial, S&#038;P 500 and Dow Jones Transportation) reach a 16% decline of the most recent high. For the mathematically inclined, the 16% is not random &#8211; simply it takes about 19% gain off the bottom of a 16% decline to reach the same level. Thus, a bear market is official at 16%, and a bull market &#8211; at 19%.</p>\n<p>Friday was significant on these metrics. Here is the situation on the S&#038;P 500:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\">\nrequire(quantmod)\nrequire(PerformanceAnalytics)\n\nsp = getSymbols(\"^GSPC\", from=\"1900-01-01\", auto.assign=F)\nsp.ret = ROC(Cl(sp), type=\"discrete\")\ntable.Drawdowns(sp.ret[\"2008/\"], top=5)\n</pre>\n<p>This has the following output:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spbear.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spbear.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"631\" height=\"128\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3369\" srcset=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spbear.png 631w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spbear-240x49.png 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p>The current pullback is the first 16+% correction since 2008. The story is the same on the Dow Jones Industrial:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/djibear.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/djibear.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"623\" height=\"127\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3370\" srcset=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/djibear.png 623w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/djibear-240x49.png 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p>And slightly different on the Down Jones Transportation:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/djtbear.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/djtbear.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"631\" height=\"128\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3371\" srcset=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/djtbear.png 631w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/djtbear-240x49.png 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p>This is certainly the most cherished bear market in US history, but that won&#8217;t make it less painful or less damaging. A recession does not always follow a bear market, but does quite often. How often &#8211; check Jack Schannep&#8217;s book. There are a few interesting statistics, like the average bear market decline and duration. Let&#8217;s take the S&#038;P 500 (history from 1950) and do the math:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\">\ndd = table.Drawdowns(sp.ret, top=20)\nprint(dd)\n# A visual inspection shows that we\n# 11 previous bear markets \nmean(head(dd, 11)[,'Depth'])\n# [1] -0.3288091 - 33%\nmedian(head(dd, 11)[,'Depth'])\n# [1] -0.2797 - 28%\nmax(head(dd, 11)[,'Depth'])\n# [1] -0.1934 - 19%\n</pre>\n<p>A gloomy picture. The average bear market is 33%, the median bear market &#8211; 28% and the smallest &#8211; 19%. In other words, if history repeats itself, there is more pain to come. Significantly more on average.</p>\n<p>The last piece of the puzzle (mine puzzle, Jack Schannep has a lot more), is to check the market for oversold signs. For this, Schannep has proposed a simple, yet powerful, indicator to forecast market bottoms. <a href=\"https://theaverageinvestor.wordpress.com/2011/08/\">It was extremely precise</a> in the 2011 pullback. Here is the code:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\">\ncapitulation = function(spx=NULL, dji=NULL, nyse=NULL)\n{\n  require(quantmod)\n\n  spx = if(is.null(spx)) na.fill(Ad(getSymbols(\"^GSPC\", from=\"1900-01-01\", auto.assign=F)), \"extend\")  else spx\n  dji = if(is.null(dji)) na.fill(Ad(getSymbols(\"^DJI\", from=\"1900-01-01\", auto.assign=F)), \"extend\") else dji\n  nyse = if(is.null(nyse)) na.fill(Ad(getSymbols(\"^NYA\", from=\"1900-01-01\", auto.assign=F)), \"extend\") else nyse\n  \n  spx.macd = MACD(spx, nFast=1, nSlow=50, maType=EMA)\n  dji.macd = MACD(dji, nFast=1, nSlow=50, maType=EMA)\n  nyse.macd = MACD(nyse, nFast=1, nSlow=50, maType=EMA)\n  \n  merged = merge(spx.macd[,1], dji.macd[,1], nyse.macd[,1], spx, dji, nyse, all=FALSE)\n  merged = cbind(ifelse(merged[,1] <= -10 & merged[,2] <= -10 & merged[,3] <= -10, 1, 0), merged)\n  colnames(merged) = c(\"ind\", \"spx.ind\", \"dji.ind\", \"nyse.ind\", \"spx.close\", \"dji.close\", \"nyse.close\")\n  \n  capitulation = merged[merged[,1] == 1,2:NCOL(merged)]\n  \n  return(list(capitulation=capitulation, details=merged))\n}\ncap = capitulation()\ntail(cap$capitulation)\n#              spx.ind   dji.ind  nyse.ind spx.close dji.close nyse.close\n# 2009-03-05 -16.48942 -16.15225 -16.95556    682.55   6594.44    4267.60\n# 2009-03-06 -15.84705 -15.21571 -16.07971    683.38   6626.94    4284.49\n# 2009-03-09 -16.14169 -15.70102 -16.65649    676.53   6547.05    4226.31\n# 2009-03-10 -10.42353 -10.43552 -10.87757    719.60   6926.49    4499.38\n# 2011-08-08 -13.47900 -11.42400 -14.88095   1119.46  10809.85    6895.97\n# 2011-08-10 -12.61128 -11.47501 -11.57217   1120.76  10719.94    7101.24\n</pre>\n<p>The above table shows that there is no extreme selling in the current recess. All in all &#8211; more troubles ahead.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/2018/12/22/the-bear-is-here/\">The Bear is Here</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.quintuitive.com\">Quintuitive</a>.</p>\n",
