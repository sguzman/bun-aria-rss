  "description": "Hey HB's! We're here with  The Wedding Date by Jasmine Guillory. It's a contemporary, BWWM romance that's... mostly about donuts and coffee? THAT'S UNFAIR. Listen, we really wanted to love this one and we didn't. \n BONUS CONTENT: Hey skippers! You're in luck because Erin is over banter. Melody might be extra critical because she's acclimating to her hormonal IUD, but she doesn't think that's the problem. Awkwardness that can happen in interracial relationships, illegible muppet notes, has Erin been to her own wedding?, Michael's secret Toy Story obsession, bathroom trips with friends new and old, that one wedding where Erin was double-fisting double gins and Melody was heaping dairy on her plate (intolerance be damned), tip-of-the-nose-kissing gets a boop on the snoot, Snoot Boopers: a new show for dogs, *BING BOONG BONG* HIPAA Violations with Erin, and the problem with depictions of body issues with no orgasmic band-aid.\n We mention http://blackchicklit.com/ (Black Chick Lit Podcast) and Lacey's GoodReads review of The Proposal! Check them both out! Twitter: @blackchicklit, Instagram: @bclpodcast\n https://www.buzzsprout.com/113419 (Not Your Mom's Romance Book Club) also has a review about this novel!
