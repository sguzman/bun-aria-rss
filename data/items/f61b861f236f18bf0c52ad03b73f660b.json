  "title": "189: Type A Nun, Mindful Parenting, and Natural Awareness, Diana Winston",
  "description": "Diana Winston first learned about meditation as a kid, but it wasn’t until she traveled to Asia following college that her practice really took off. She has been practicing mindfulness meditation since 1989, including a year as a Buddhist nun in Burma! Thankfully for us, she has returned to mainstream society where we can learn from her teachings. She’s been called one of the nation’s best-known teachers of mindfulness and has taught mindfulness for 20 years at hospitals, universities, corporations, non-profits, and schools in the US and Asia. Currently she is the Director of Mindfulness Education at UCLA Semel Institute’s Mindful Awareness Research Center (MARC) and the co-author of Fully Present, the Science, Art and Practice of Mindfulness. She is also the author of Wide Awake for teens, and has published numerous articles on mindfulness. In our conversation, Winston shares stories from her own practice, including her time as a Buddhist nun, as well as what she calls her most challenging and rewarding practice - trying to mindfully parent her nine-year-old daughter.\nThe Plug Zone\nWebsite: http://www.dianawinston.com/about_me.html\nThe Little Book of Being: http://www.dianawinston.com/\nUCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center: www.uclahealth.org/marc\nTwitter: @dianawinston\n“Just This” Talk by Diana Winston in the Ten Percent Happier app: https://10percenthappier.app.link/EPje4jnDXW\n***VOICEMAILS***\nHave a question for Dan?
