  "description": "We look at the impact of Hurricane Ian after the storm decimated Ft. Myers and other areas. Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffers a major head and neck injury that left him unconscious and seemingly frozen with his hands in front of his face. Tua has been released from the hospital and is able to feel and move all his limbs, but it's not a good look for the NFL as they try to avoid further CTE controversy. Trevor Noah retires from his job as host of 'The Daily Show.' And lastly, we welcome our live audience back in the studio and they bring us custom leather belts.
