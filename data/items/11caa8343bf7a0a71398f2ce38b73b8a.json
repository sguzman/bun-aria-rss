    "media:description": "In Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity, massive objects like stars warp the geometry of spacetime. Then a particle travels along the straightest and shortest path that it can through spacetime, called a geodesic.

The first video was about a particle in Newtonian mechanics, and the second was about a particle in special relativity. In this video, we'll learn about the principle of least action for a particle in general relativity. The action is just the length of the particle's worldline through spacetime, and it picks the straightest and shortest path that it can. The fourth video is about a string in string theory.\n\nPart 1 Introduction to the principle of least action: https://youtu.be/sUk9y23FPHk\n\nPart 2 The action in special relativity: https://youtu.be/KVk1QNTWBxQ\n\nPart 4 The action for string theory: https://youtu.be/KpIaWiWvuRs\n\nTutoring  inquiries: https://www.physicswithelliot.com/tutoring\n\nIf you find the content I’m creating valuable and would like to help make it possible for me to continue sharing more, please consider supporting me!

Thank you so much!\n\nAbout physics mini lessons:\nIn these intermediate-level physics lessons, I'll try to give you a self-contained introduction to some fascinating physics topics. If you're just getting started on your physics journey, you might not understand every single detail in every video---that's totally fine! What I'm really hoping is that you'll be inspired to go off and keep learning more on your own.\n\nAbout me:\nI’m Dr. Elliot Schneider. I love physics, and I want to help others learn (and learn to love) physics, too. Whether you’re a beginner just starting out with your physics studies, a more advanced student, or a lifelong learner, I hope you’ll find resources here that enable you to deepen your understanding of the laws of nature.
