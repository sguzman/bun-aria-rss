What's the best way for her to be respectful about it? We discuss the difficulties of getting to places on time and how charming Peter Dinklage is. We listen to some voicemail follow ups on cleaning shoes and puke bowls. We go over a couple of listener submitted Pazsitzky Effects about changing shower heads, getting new pillows, and general tips on undergarments and stained mattresses. Christina pitches some red flags to the booth boys: would you rather a lady with long sharp claw nails of a lady REALLY into horoscopes. Christina wonders if Enny will ever teach a dating class and we get into VH1's \"The Pick Up Artist.\" Christina answers some listeners' \"What Would Christina P Do\" about dating with an age gap and keeping unsolicited advice at bay.</p> <p>Christina P. wants to hear from you since she is seriously lacking in cool mom friends.
