  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that a kill-switch for Memcrash may have been found (and Memcrash may be dangerous for other purposes than denial-of-service). Researchers in Hungary take a look at the Shadow Brokers' dumps and speculate about the purpose of the \"Territorial Dispute\" module. The Dutch Tax Authority sustained another DDoS attack last night. India's CERT renders a troubling report to Parliament. The FBI still wants a non-backdoor backdoor. David Dufour from Webroot on vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency markets. Guest is Richard Henderson from Absolute Software on protecting against insider threats. And some notes from SINET ITSEF.",
