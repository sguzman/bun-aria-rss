OP happily makes apple-crunch snacks laced with extra-strength horse laxatives. She sticks the snacks in the fridge... and later her roommate discovers the tasty treats. He eats about 3, and accidentally poisons himself with horse laxatives. Let's just say that the roommate has to spend the rest of the day glued to the toilet!</p>\n",
