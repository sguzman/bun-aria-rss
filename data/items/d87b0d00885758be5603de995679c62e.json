  "description": "For rock climbers, skiers, and other outdoor enthusiasts, the word \"send\" has a whole new meaning. You might cheer on a fellow snowboarder with \"Send it, bro!\" -- and being \"sendy\" is a really great thing. Plus: a nostalgic trip to Willa Cather's' Nebraska home inspires a reading from one of her classic books about life on the American prairie. And what do they call a sudden, heavy rain where you live? A gulley washer? A frog-strangler? Or maybe even a bridge-lifter? All that, and the flowery language of seed catalogs, rank and file, cut me a husk, I am sat down vs. I am sitting down, Lead on, MacDuff! vs. Lay on, MacDuff!, a hematological puzzle, and a popular Spanish-language refrain about an extremely long goodbye.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
