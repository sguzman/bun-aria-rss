  "description": "<p>Comedy isn't supposed to be sexy. Try telling that to this weeks guest. Chad Daniels isn't just one of the best comedians on the planet, he's extremely handsome and a master of Road Beave. Just ask the women of Asia, where Chad smashed for a week straight a few years back when he was filming I Need You To Kill, the documentary he appeared in with Tom and Pete Lee. </p> <p>This week we feature more deeply troubled people. Are they high? Not sure. Are they mentally stable? Doesn't appear so. Plus you the listener writes in about bum kisses, ball tugs, grandma's too old for the toilet and so much more. </p> <p>More psycho test questions too - wish Jada Pinkett would take it!</p>\n",
