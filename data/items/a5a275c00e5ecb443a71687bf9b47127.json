  "description": "We’ve all been through disappointments and unfair situations. Because of negative things of the past, even mistakes we’ve made, it’s easy to have the wrong image of ourselves. Too many times we’ve developed a slave mentality where we don’t pray bold prayers, we don’t believe for our dreams, and we don’t expect good breaks because we feel unworthy.But 1 John 3:2 tells us we are sons of God. Joel wants to help you gain a new vision and understanding of who you are, not thinking about what you were, what you’ve been through, or the mistakes you’ve made. When you realize who you are—a son and daughter of the Most High God— you’ll think differently and live differently as you expect God’s favor in your life.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
