I saw that having a robust relationship to feedback was the key to unlocking transcendent creative work and that started to mean more to me that protecting my vulnerabilities.\n\nIn this episode I want to share a 4 step process for building feedback into your practice in a way that will help your creative work resonate on a much deeper level.",
