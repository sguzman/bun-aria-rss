  "description": "LinkedIn is rolling out new features to combat a surge in AI-generated bot accounts, writes Brian Krebs. \"Many LinkedIn profiles now display a creation date, and the company is expanding its domain validation offering, which allows users to publicly confirm that they can reply to emails at the domain of their stated current employer.\" From the report: LinkedIn's new \"About This Profile\" section -- which is visible by clicking the \"More\" button at the top of a profile -- includes the year the account was created, the last time the profile information was updated, and an indication of how and whether an account has been verified.\n \nLinkedIn also said it is adding a warning to some LinkedIn messages that include high-risk content, or that try to entice the user into taking the conversation to another platform (like WeChat). \"We may warn you about messages that ask you to take the conversation to another platform because that can be a sign of a scam,\" the company said in a blog post. \"These warnings will also give you the choice to report the content without letting the sender know.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=LinkedIn+Adds+Verified+Emails%2C+Profile+Creation+Dates%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3U8Xmbc\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F11%2F04%2F2156215%2Flinkedin-adds-verified-emails-profile-creation-dates%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/22/11/04/2156215/linkedin-adds-verified-emails-profile-creation-dates?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=22334497&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",
