  "description": "<p>In this paper, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(RIS)-assisted 3D direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation system, in which a\nuniform planar array (UPA) RIS is deployed to provide virtual line-of-sight\n(LOS) links and reflect the uplink pilot signal to sensors. To overcome the\nmutually coupled problem between the beamforming design at the RIS and DoA\nestimation, we explore the separable sparse representation structure and\npropose an alternating optimization algorithm. The grid-based DoA estimation is\nmodeled as a joint-sparse recovery problem considering the grid bias, and the\nJoint-2D-OMP method is used to estimate both on-grid and off-grid parts. The\ncorresponding Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to evaluate the\nestimation. Then, the beampattern at the RIS is optimized to maximize the\nsignal-to-noise (SNR) at sensors according to the estimated angles. Numerical\nresults show that the proposed alternating optimization algorithm can achieve\nlower estimation error compared to benchmarks of random beamforming design.\n</p>",
