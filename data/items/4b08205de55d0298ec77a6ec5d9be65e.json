  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, this election is progressivism versus Americanism. It’s a race to the finish line to stop the radical leftist democratic socialists from taking over our government. A recent poll indicates that most voters say the press has divided the country more than President Trump has and the media won’t change or pull back their demagoguery. This is one of the lowest points of American press since our founding. The media works daily to dispirit the American people with their \"dog-whistles\". Why didn't they compare Dwight Eisenhower to Stalin or Hitler for deporting 1.3 Million illegal aliens under an initiative he called \"operation wetback.\" Even left wing activist Cesar Chavez opposed illegal immigration because it hurt scores of legal immigrants in the agriculture industry. Despite what the media will tell you, this is not a partisan issue or a racial issue. Sadly, the media is more focused on freedom of progressivism than it is freedom of the press. This upcoming election is about taking back our national principles of loving our country, the rule of law, private property rights, and faith that are required for a civil society. Then, Andrew Gillum has joined forces with an anti-Israel group (BDS) yet he's still endorsed by several Florida newspapers. Why isn't Don Lemon or CNN reporting this? Why isn't Oprah Winfrey speaking out on this? Then, US Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), Congressman Glenn Grothman (R-WI), and US Senate candidate Bob Hugin (R-NJ) call in to discuss their respective midterm elections.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
