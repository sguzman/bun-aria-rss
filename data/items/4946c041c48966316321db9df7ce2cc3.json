  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about last night's Thursday Night Football game between the Giants and the Football Team, and chat about how good Danny Dimes looked, but if the Giants are ultimately in trouble if they don't start winning soon, if Washington is for real and should be the favorite in the NFC East this year, and Pat and AJ Hawk look at all the different games from week 2 of the NFL slate. Joining the program is co-host of Good Morning Football, NFL Insider for FOX, co-host of the Flying Coach Podcast, and friend of the program, Peter Schrager. Pat, Peter, and AJ chat about the Thursday Night game, and what he's hearing around the league as we approach the 2nd week of the season including Za'Darius Smith going to the IR for the Packers, how he thinks the Colts are going to perform and what he knew about the Hard Knocks announcement, and what is going on at Good Morning Football (26:41-41:59). Next, Kicker and Punter for the Los Angeles Rams, one of the best tandems in the NFL, Johnny Hekker and Matt Gay join Pat and AJ to chat about this Rams team, Johnny's off season last year and what he think went wrong, whether or not they go to see if Pat has said anything about their performance after games, and more (52:03-1:04:46). Later, joining the program for another Feel Good Friday is former Independence CC Head Coach and star of season 3 & 4 of Netflix's Last Chance U, host of the SlapDick podcast, Coach Jason Brown. Pat and Jason chat about the rumors surrounding Urban Meyer to USC, who he thinks USC should hire, what other high profile coaches he could see getting fired relatively soon her, and what is pissing him off in the world of football as of late (1:05:55-1:26:19).
