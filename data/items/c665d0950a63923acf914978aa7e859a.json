    "media:description": "This video attempts to display the incredible detail that goes into drawing an arbitrary shape using Fourier epicycles.  Although there is little here that is truly new, I wanted to spend some time just enjoying the beauty of Fourier series.  Why?  Well, to quote Grant Sanderson, \"Because why not?\"  And why should he have all the fun?\n\nSupport this channel: One of the most helpful things you can do to support this channel is to share this video with others you think would find it interesting.
