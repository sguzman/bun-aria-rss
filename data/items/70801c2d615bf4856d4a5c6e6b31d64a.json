    "media:description": "About Likelihood Ratios, also sometimes called Bayes Factors*.\nHelp fund future projects: https://www.patreon.com/3blue1brown\nAn equally valuable form of support is to simply share some of the videos.\nSpecial thanks to these supporters: https://3b1b.co/bayes-factor-thanks\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nThe book by my friend Matt Cook about paradoxes mentioned at the end:\nhttps://amzn.to/3aBrEzg\n\nOn the topic, I can't help also mentioning another paradox book I'm rather fond of by Bunch:\nhttps://amzn.to/3mBDSKE\n\nAnother video on Bayes' theorem:\nhttps://youtu.be/HZGCoVF3YvM\n\n*As mentioned in the on-screen note at the end, while the terms \"Bayes Factor\" and \"Likelihood Ratio\" refer to the same ratio in this setting, where Bayes rule is used on the probability of an event with only two possible outcomes (you either have the disease or you don't), they do take on divergent meanings in more general contexts.  Namely, if you have a continuous parameter you are trying to estimate, the two terms reflect two alternate approaches you can use in comparing hypotheses.  In fact, some people take the phrase \"Bayes factor\" to _specifically_ refer to its use in this more continuous context.\n\nIf you want more details, Wikipedia actually has a really nice example discussing the difference:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor#Example\n\nThis post has some nice discussion of the distinction:\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/27345/likelihood-ratio-vs-bayes-factor\n\nTimetable:\n0:00 - What is the paradox?\n5:53 - The Bayes factor\n11:00 - The snazzy Bayes rule\n14:42 - Contrast with the usual formula\n\n------------------&#13;\n&#13;\nThese animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim&#13;\n&#13;\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.&#13;\n&#13;\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.&#13;\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:&#13;\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown&#13;\n&#13;\nStream the music on Spotify:&#13;\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u&#13;\n&#13;\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".
