    "media:description": "The only decent fable came out on Xbox in 2004.\n\nThe music is Norma: Casta Diva by Vincenzo Bellini. If you haven't heard the Maria Callas version, you're in for a treat: https://youtu.be/s-TwMfgaDC8\n\n\nNew Geometry for Ocelots paperback version (you may need to change your region) ► https://tinyurl.com/bdfpbun3 \nOther books what I wrote ► https://tinyurl.com/ycnl5bo3 \nI also make horrendous music ► https://soundcloud.com/exurbia-1 \nT-shirts, mugs, and sadness ► https://teespring.com/stores/exurb1a\nFor sending personalised insults ► https://www.facebook.com/exurb1a/\nHelp me to do this full-time if you're deranged enough ► https://www.patreon.com/exurb1r?ty=h \n\nAn apology if required:\nI've been a bit quiet of late. Sorry about that. Sometimes a while goes by when nothing worth making turns up. However. A new book will be out in the next few months – not depressing sci-fi for once – and more stuff is coming, promise. If that's something you're waiting for, then thank you kindly for waiting. I'm not sure why you're reading so far down in the description, but thanks for that too. In return, please accept this masterpiece: https://youtu.be/MKp30C3MwVk",
