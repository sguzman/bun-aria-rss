  "description": "When you hear the phrase ‘Black Panther’ you probably think of the 2018 Marvel film with Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan. But actually, Black Panther has a greater significance in society than just being the definition to a movie. In another round of Civil Rights history, the Black Panther Party's purpose is to gain justice for Black Americans and other oppressed groups in the US. Maia shares just how important they are not only in progressing societal knowledge, but as well in educational knowledge. In addition to this, Maia reminds us of that one time when we all woke up with a new U2 album downloaded onto our Apple devices and who apologized for the unwarranted library addition.
