  "description": "<p>Working as a clinician for many years, one of the most common questions I would get is, “What can I take for more energy?”.</p> <p>It was always a tough question because I knew I’d just be treating a symptom by giving them energizing natural supplements like maca, cordyceps, and ginseng. Sure, it’s better that they didn’t ask a drug dealer the same question. In the immortal words of Rick James, “Cocaine is a helluva drug…” But, I didn’t want them to see me like a natural pill-pusher, and get them hooked on something just to get them by, either. So, I dedicated myself to helping them get to the root of their energy problems. And today you’ll learn the very best of what I came up with.</p> <h2>In this episode you'll discover:</h2> <ul> <li>How my struggle with chronic fatigue began.</li> <li>A potent superherb that’s clinically proven to improve insulin sensitivity.</li> <li>What going to the gym is compensating for.</li> <li>How you’re able to literally charge up your cells like a battery.</li> <li>The surprising amount of energy the human body can generate.</li> <li>Simple strategies to get in more nutritious movement throughout the day.</li> <li>Why you can still wake up exhausted after 7 to 8 hours of sleep.</li> <li>What sleep architecture is.</li> <li>How many total sleep cycles you need for optimal energy.</li> <li>What happens in your brain during sleep.</li> <li>The 2 major things that can disrupt your sleep cycles.</li> <li>Key nutrient deficiencies that cause fatigue and sleep problems.</li> <li>The #1 mineral that supports human energy production.</li> <li>How dehydration impacts energy (and how much water you really need!).</li> </ul> <h2>Items mentioned in this episode include:</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/organifi\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Organifi.com</a> ⇐ Use the coupon code model for 20% off</li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/ease-magnesium\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EASE</a> ⇐ Get an exclusive 15% off here!</li> <li><a href=\"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/movement-matters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why All Movement Matters - With Guest Katy Bowman</a></li> <li><a href= \"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/create-a-winning-culture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How To Create A Winning Culture - With Guest Dr. Eric Thomas</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://juicemigourmet.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Juice Mi</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://sleepsmarterbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Sleep Smarter</a></li> <li><a href= \"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/spot-treating-body-fat/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Model Health Show Episode 204 - Live From  D.C.</a></li> <li><a href= \"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/best-water-filter-best-bottled-water/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Best Bottled Water, Water Filter, And Critical Water Facts</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/burn-more-fat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 Small Changes To Help Your Burn More Fat</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://themodelhealthshow.com/energy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Essential Guide To Maximizing Your Energy</a> ⇐ Get the powerhouse new course here!</li> </ul> <p>* <a href= \"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/themodelhealthshow/Episode+210.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download The Transcript</a></p> <p>Thank you so much for checking out this episode of The Model Health Show.
