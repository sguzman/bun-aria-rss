  "description": "Ripper Confidential. London, England. In this bonus episode, Aaron interviewed Ripper researcher Tom Wescott about his latest book, Ripper Confidential. Before we got to the book, I wanted to ask him questions related to the History Channel series, American Ripper. For anyone unfamiliar with it, the premise is that Jack the Ripper was actually H. W. Mudgett, a.k.a. H. H. Holmes. Is there evidence to support this theory? Ripper Confidential, using the latest available research materials, gives us a clearer picture of the Ripper's attacks, possible survivors, witness statements, as well as the evidence left at the crime scenes. What was the Ripper's modus operandi? How many victims can we say that he had? Are we any closer to learning his true identity?\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
