  "description": "<p>A notable feature of non-Hermitian systems with skin effects is the\nsensitivity of their spectra and eigenstates to the boundary conditions. In the\nliterature, three types of boundary conditions-periodic boundary condition,open\nboundary condition and a defect in the system as a boundary, are explored. In\nthis work we introduce the other type of boundary condition provided by a giant\natom. The giant atom couples to a nonreciprocal SuSchrieffer-Heeger chain at\ntwo points and plays the role of defects. We study the spectrum and\nlocalization of eigenstates of the system and find that the giant atom can\ninduce asymmetric zero modes. A remarkable feature is that bulk states might\nlocalize at the left or the right chain-atom coupling sites in weak\nlocalization regimes. This bipolar localization leads to Bloch-like states,\neven though translational invariance is broken. Moreover, we find that the\nlocalization is obviously weaker than the case with two small atoms or open\nboundary conditions even in strong coupling regimes. These intriguing results\nindicate that nonlocal coupling of giant atom to a nonreciprocal SSH chain\nweakens localization of the eigenstates. We also show that the Lyapunov\nexponent in the long-time dynamics in real space can act as a witness of the\nlocalized bulk states.\n</p>",
