  "description": "<p>We discuss the notion of translation-invariant vacua for 2d chiral algebras\nand relate it to the notion of the associated variety. The two-dimensional\nchiral algebra associated to four-dimensional ${\\cal N}=4$ $U(N)$ SYM has a\nconjectural holographic dual involving the B-model topological string theory.\nWe study the effect of non-zero vacuum expectation values on the chiral algebra\ncorrelation functions and derive a holographic dual Calabi-Yau geometry. We\ntest our proposal by a large $N$ analysis of correlation functions of\ndeterminant operators, whose saddles can be matched with semi-classical\nconfigurations of \"Giant Graviton\" D-branes in the bulk\n</p>",
