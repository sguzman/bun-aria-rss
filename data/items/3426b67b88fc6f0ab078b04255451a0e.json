Paint!\n\nThe personal changes we’ve all been through since we started the podcast.\n\nHaving a plan before you begin helps you reach your full vision and less like you’re never finished.\n\nHow much energy is saved using LED lights vs. traditional lightbulbs and all the other things we’ve learned about lighting.\n\n“The Cantaloupe Rule”—no accessories smaller than a cantaloupe!\n\n\nPerformance fabrics will save you many headaches in the long run.\n\nThe important relationship between designer and architect.\n\nYou should respect and decorate specific to house style while finding ways to infuse other elements.\n\nThe relationship between a designer and a client is so personal.\n\nWe’ve learned how important measuring is.
