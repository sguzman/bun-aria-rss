  "description": "<p>This week, we go deep into a mystery, that doesn't actually seem to be much of a mystery, at all. He was a hero, an idol, a champion, and a teammate of OJ Simpson. Problem is, he has way more in common with OJ than just playing on the same team. His crimes cause his children to despise him so much that they took it to court. It's a twisted tale of death, and deception... So much fun!!Attend your own parade, milk the cows, then try to dodge a murder charge with Jim Dunaway!!Check us out, every Tuesday. We will continue to bring you the biggest idiots in sports history!Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie WhismanDonate at...patreon.com/crimeinsportsContact us on...twitter.com/crimeinsportscrimeinsports@gmail.comfacebook.com/Crimeinsportsweb support and truecrimecomedyteam.com by Web & Writer. webandwriter.com facebook.com/webandwriterinstagram.com/crimeinsports#crime #sports #murder #police #prison #jail #cops #true #truecrime #trial #drugs #champion #assault #heavyweight #violence #kill #death #investigation #espn #foxsports #bloody #killer #firstdegree #braindamage #domesticviolence #wife #divorce #buffalobills #olemiss #miamidolphins #nfl #ncaa #ojsimpson #civiltrial</p><p> </p><p> </p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
