  "description": "<p><p>Brian Regan (42:30) stops by to discuss Pop Tarts, putting a baby in a microwave, how he does jokes without cursing, Loudermilk, how kids are stupid, and his new series Stand Up and Away produced by Jerry Seinfeld. KFC shazam'd a porn soundtrack and Pornhub Aria and LeoLuLu loved his blog. Leak Leisure is the rapper that made the song about banging a listener's sister. How a vagina is like the furnace in Home Alone. Voicemails include: lose you hair or 3 inches, stacked dicks, same shirt or same underwear.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
