The meanings of our meal words have shifted over time in concert with the standard time at which these meals are eaten. Spoiler: \"Dinner\" was the original \"breakfast,\" and etymologically, the two words mean almost the same thing. <br /> <br /> To support the show, go to: https://www.patreon.com/wordsforgranted</p>",
