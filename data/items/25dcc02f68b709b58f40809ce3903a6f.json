  "description": "Grady Hendrix LOVES horror movies, especially those old 80's slashers. And his new book is a tribute to that \"final girl\" at the end of so many of them. The one who doesn't necessarily survive by being smarter or stronger, but simply makes it to the end alive by not giving up. NPR's Audie Cornish interviewed him about his novel <em>Final Girl Support Group</em>, which is about exactly what it sounds like, a support group for women who survived psycho murderers — except it seems like someone's starting to hunt them down... again. As Hendrix says, what's the scariest thing for a \"Final Girl?\" A sequel. ",
