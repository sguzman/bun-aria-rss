  "description": "<p>Ron Morehead and Scott Nelson will be my guests on the show. We will be discussing Sasquatch and possible language. Author/Adventurist Ron Morehead, producer of the Sierra Sounds, has been known for decades for his world-wide research into the Bigfoot/Sasquatch phenomenon. To date, he comes closer than any other researcher to having a complete body of evidence. The Sierra Sounds are the only Bigfoot recordings that have been scientifically studied, time-tested, and accredited as genuine. Ron has documented his personal interactions with these giant beings and produced his story on a CD and also in a book, “Voices in the Wilderness.”   http://ronmorehead.com/   https://sasquatchchronicles.com</p>",
