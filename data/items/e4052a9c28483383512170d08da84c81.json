They include depressed areas like natural gas, agriculture, and ethanol. He says the fundamentals in these sectors are turning positive and stocks are still dirt cheap.   Finally, Steve shares his top stock picks within these sectors. He believes each name has incredible upside over the next 12 to 18 months.",
