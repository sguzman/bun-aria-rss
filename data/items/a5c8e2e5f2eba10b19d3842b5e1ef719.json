  "description": "Today we continued in our new series called, “FU” or “Forgiveness University.” Online classes are now in session and we are ready to learn about forgiveness. In the third week of this series, Pastor Michael taught us that we can’t give what we don’t have. If you are struggling with forgiving someone, it is because you have not fully received the forgiveness that is freely given to you. Pastor Michael provides us with a Checklist  to help us forgive the wrongs that have been done to us. You don’t want to miss this message!",
