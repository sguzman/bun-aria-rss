  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, why isn't existing immigration law being enforced at the southern border? President Biden himself has admitted in the past that White Europeans will be a minority in the US due to a nonstop stream of immigration. Biden also ignores the antisemitism of the Buffalo, NY shooter and tries to blame the \"replacement theory\" that his administration perpetuates on Republicans. Rep. Rashida Tlaib's bigoted radicalism and hate for Jews has never been denounced by Democrats or the media. Then, Pelosi's select committee on January 6th is obtaining information that the Department of Justice could not normally obtain, so they are asking Congress to produce transcripts to use for their criminal investigation. This clever work-around violates the liberties of individuals and gives the DOJ an unfair advantage and a reach they wouldn't otherwise have. One's sworn testimony under oath for a legislative proceeding does not meet the same standard the government would have to compel testimony in front of a grand jury for a criminal proceeding. Moreover, subpoenaing President Trump's personal lawyer and former staff for delaying the certification of an election violates the separation of powers, because one has a right to legally challenge an election. Later, the results in the Pennsylvania US Senate primary are headed to a recount between the two highest vote-getters. In other election news Sen. Roy Blount's son draws scrutiny for work by his political canvassing company and lobbying against voter ID, while concealing the source of funding. Afterward, former Ambassador Danny Danon calls in to discuss his new book \"In the Lion's Den: Israel and the World.\" Danon says Israel must remain strong because Israel has the same enemies America has just a lot closer to their homeland.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
