  "description": "<p>Earlier this year, Gregory Thompson and Duke Kwon released their book “Reparations: A Christian Call for Repentance and Repair,” in which they make a biblical argument for the American church’s responsibility to repay the debts inflicted upon black communities by systemic racism and white supremacy. In this moment of political division and evangelical panic over Critical Race Theory, it’s not surprising that responses to the book have been polarized. One of the most negative and widely read reviews came from theologian Kevin DeYoung who said “Reparations” is “clearly not shaped by the gospel.” Thompson and Kwon then wrote a lengthy and detailed response to DeYoung’s review. (Links to both are posted below.) In this episode, Thompson talks to Skye about the debate, criticism of his book, and what the white evangelical response to racism reveals about its theology, mission, and blind spots. Phil and Christian then join Skye to discuss Thompson’s interview, and Christian shares a personal story to remind us all that change is possible.</p> <p>“Reparations: A Christian Call for Repentance and Repair” - <a href= \"https://amzn.to/3jUMMov\">https://amzn.to/3jUMMov</a><span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Kevin DeYoung Review - <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/reparations-a-critical-theological-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/reparations-a-critical-theological-review/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/reparations-a-critical-theological-review/</a></p> <p>Review Response 1 - <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://thefrontporch.org/2021/07/sanctifying-the-status-quo-a-response-to-reverend-kevin-deyoung/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://thefrontporch.org/2021/07/sanctifying-the-status-quo-a-response-to-reverend-kevin-deyoung/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://thefrontporch.org/2021/07/sanctifying-the-status-quo-a-response-to-reverend-kevin-deyoung/</a></p> <p>Review Response 2 - <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://thefrontporch.org/2021/07/distinctively-christian-an-additional-response-to-reverend-kevin-deyoung/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://thefrontporch.org/2021/07/distinctively-christian-an-additional-response-to-reverend-kevin-deyoung/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://thefrontporch.org/2021/07/distinctively-christian-an-additional-response-to-reverend-kevin-deyoung/</a></p> <p>Other resources referenced:</p> <p>\"The Sum of Us\" - <a href= \"https://amzn.to/3tqEY0V\">https://amzn.to/3tqEY0V</a><span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://religionnews.com/2021/07/12/dont-believe-in-systemic-racism-lets-talk-about-the-sexual-revolution-charlottesville-robert-e-lee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://religionnews.com/2021/07/12/dont-believe-in-systemic-racism-lets-talk-about-the-sexual-revolution-charlottesville-robert-e-lee/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://religionnews.com/2021/07/12/dont-believe-in-systemic-racism-lets-talk-about-the-sexual-revolution-charlottesville-robert-e-lee/</a><br />  <br /></p> <p>(The Holy Post is supported by our listeners.
