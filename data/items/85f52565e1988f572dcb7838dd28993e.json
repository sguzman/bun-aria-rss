The Army has announced Drill Sergeants will no longer be screaming in the faces of the new recruits. Sad. \n\nRound 3: Curiouser and curiouser. More Russian energy heads are waking up dead. Some of them with toad toxins running through their veins at a rate that has never been seen. \n\nRound 4: Mark Esper is releasing a book and it talks about the craziest shit youve heard so far this week. \n\nRound 5: Your internet history might be your most protected information. What would you hate to see released the most?</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
