If you haven't heard their blend of metal heaviness, do yourself a favor and dive right in. Nate is an incredibly interesting dude and we discussed being vulnerable, the Little Rock music scene and his battle with addiction. Immediately after we started talking I felt a kinship with him and I hope you feel the same way.
