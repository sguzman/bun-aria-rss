  "description": "Outkick writer Jason Whitlock fills in for Glenn, with the help of James “Uncle Jimmy” Dodds. Jason holds nothing back on how, despite Washington, D.C., WE can bring America back together, lean into racial harmony, and restore the values of our founding. He discusses the replacement of Christianity with “black pride” in modern black culture. And further, he makes the case that modern liberals are the “ideological descendants of enslavers from 400 years ago,\" who impose “mental slavery” and insist black people are a “special classification” in America, defined by skin color. Jason also reviews his article on the “Unapologetically Black Olympics,\" asks, “what does America actually promise?\" and argues that racism has become an opinion.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
