  "description": "<p>Charlie welcomes Claremont Institute President Ryan Williams to expose a bombshell story revolving around the little focused upon military base schools, run exclusively by Congress, that are charged with educating students of service members based overseas. These are kids that have no other choices when it comes to education since they are studying abroad while their parents serve in the military; and somehow, our military bases are teaching ideological pathogens, grooming the next generation to be anti-American, Marxist revolutionaries. Next up, Charlie welcomes CEO of the pregnancy care network, Compass Care, Rev. Jim Harden, to give an update on the 60+ pregnancy care centers that have been firebombed by radical domestic extremists, and so far, as Jim reports, there have been zero arrests while pro-life activist Mark Houck gets raided by 25+ FBI agents for protecting his 12-year-old on a public sidewalk. Jim Harden sounds the alarm on what he calls the Kristallnacht for pregnancy care centers. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.charliekirk.com/support\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: http://www.charliekirk.com/support</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
