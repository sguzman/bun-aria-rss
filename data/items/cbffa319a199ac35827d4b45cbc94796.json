Horses rule the country, dogs are the military, cows, goats, sheep, and pigs are the everyday people. The government that has been in control of the country Jidada for 40 years has fallen to rebellion. But, as these things go, it quickly turns sour. Bulawayo told NPR's Scott Simon that \"it is simply an issue of the leadership kind of forgetting [...] why the people they – that fought to serve – made the sacrifice that they did.\"",
