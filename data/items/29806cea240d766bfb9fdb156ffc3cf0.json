    "media:description": "This video explores the story of the Borgias and their rise to power in Renaissance Italy. Two Borgias became pope during their dynasty—Calixtus III and Alexander VI—and pope Alexander is widely considered one of the most corrupt popes in history. Sex, greed, power, money all define the Borgias regime. But who were the Borgias? And why are the Borgias so evil in their own day, that they are remembered even today as something of a soap opera? This 14-minute video tells the story of Rodrigo, Lucrecia, and the wider Borgia family. \n\nStill haven’t subscribed to the channel? ►► https://goo.gl/KNKDPg \n\nFurther reading on the Borgias:\nG.J.
