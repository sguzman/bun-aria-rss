  "description": "Policing in America has no easy answers, but my guest Rafael A. Mangual suggests we aren’t even asking the right questions. He’s of the opinion that many beliefs critical of police are misplaced, while other real reforms go un pursued. His book is Criminal (In)Justice: What The Push For Decarceration And Depolicing Gets Wrong And Who It Hurts Most. Plus, charging the cops who really were responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor. And the Kansas abortion vote doesn’t mean everything has changed for November, but it does mean the Republicans face an issue that really puts them at odds with voters.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist\nLearn more about your ad choices.
