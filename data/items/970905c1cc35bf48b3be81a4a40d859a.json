  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, performative wokeness has reached epidemic levels in this country, and it was on full display yesterday. I’ll explain. Also we have our Five Headlines, including some updates on that weird story of the supposed right wing plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan. It appears that this was more of an FBI plot, which the FBI then foiled. And Prince Harry is once again showing how much he desires privacy by writing an explosive memoir about the Royal Family, while AOC shows how much she hates capitalism by investing heavily in her online merchandise story. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the ladies of the US women’s soccer team who showed how much they hate their own country by kneeling before their match last night. And then they lost badly. \nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
