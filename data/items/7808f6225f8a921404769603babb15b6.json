  "description": "<p><em>On Prophecy in Sleep</em> (Greek: ΠΕΡΙ ΤΗΣ ΚΑΘ ΥΠΝΟΝ ΜΑΝΤΙΚΗΣ) is also known as <em>On Divination in Sleep</em> (Latin: DE DIVINATIONE PER SOMNUM). In this short book Aristotle asks why alleged prophetic dreams typically come to base people at night instead of to the wise during the day which would be more consistent with a benevolent deity. Painting: <em>Shepherd and Sleeping Shepherdess</em> attributed to Reyer Jacobsz van Blommendael (1628-1675). Scanned by The J. Paul Getty Museum. </p>",
