  "description": "Today I will be reviewing The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey. One of the most influential business books of the twentieth century, Covey delves into the seven habits that separate effective people from the rest. The seven habits range from proactiveness to thinking-win-win and creating synergy, flowing from one to the other. However, the overarching theme throughout the book is the 'Inside Out' approach, which explains how obvious perceived problems can usually be solved by changing our internal perceptions to the question itself. This internal approach to external factors is the most rational and controllable way to deal with any problem. There is no doubt why this book has been so impactful over the past couple of decades. A clear and well-written message at its foundation with a simple laid out gives this book the potential to improve the life of anyone open-minded enough to the habits and principles explained within. There is no doubt that this book is five stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
