  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Most people know that obesity is a prevalent and pressing issue in our country today. A smaller subset of folks understand the gravity of this issue and the fact that weight issues lead to a higher susceptibility to COVID-19. Even fewer understand how obesity actually occurs or what can realistically be done to optimize our body fat ratios.</p> <p class=\"p1\">That’s why on today’s show, I’m taking you behind the scenes of body fat. We’re going to talk about how our body fat works and the various categories of fat. You’re going to hear about how excess body fat is created, and most importantly, what we can do to have a healthy amount of body fat. Specifically, we’re going to dive into realistic and clinically proven tools you can use to promote a healthy weight.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">This episode of The Model Health Show is packed with the science on body fat, insulin resistance, and metabolic health. We’re going to talk about our susceptibility to COVID-19 and why it’s more important than ever to get our communities healthier. I believe that the power to create change is in our hands, and change begins with knowledge.
