  "description": "<p>Radiotopia Presents and S***hole Country is proud to present a bonus episode from AfroQueer. 2021 has been a really rough year for Ghana’s LGBTQI people. Police raided and shut down a queer community center in Accra; 21 people attending a paralegal workshop in the city of Ho were arrested and locked up for 21 days before the case was dropped; and eight MPs have come up with draft legislation that, if adopted, makes it a crime just to be queer or a queer ally. But the LGBT community are fighting back - with a #KilltheBill campaign. Ghanaian filmmaker, Edem Robby, reports on what’s been happening and why - and, in a rare interview, she sits down with some of the so-called Ho 21 to hear the horrifying story of their arrests.</p>\n\n<p>This episode from AfroQueer was reported by Edem Robby.
