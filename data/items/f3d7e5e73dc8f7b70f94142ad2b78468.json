  "description": "Tim Berners-Lee, the British computer scientist credited with inventing the World Wide Web in 1989, said Friday that he doesn't view blockchain as a viable solution for building the next iteration of the internet. From a report: He has his own web decentralization project called Solid. \"It's important to clarify in order to discuss the impacts of new technology,\" said Berners-Lee, speaking onstage at the Web Summit event in Lisbon. \n\n\"You have to understand what the terms mean that we're discussing actually mean, beyond the buzzwords. It's a real shame in fact that the actual Web3 name was taken by Ethereum folks for the stuff that they're doing with blockchain. In fact, Web3 is not the web at all,\" he said.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Tim+Berners-Lee+Wants+Us+To+'Ignore'+Web3%2C+It's+'Not+the+Web+at+All'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3zJzSBi\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F11%2F04%2F2016237%2Ftim-berners-lee-wants-us-to-ignore-web3-its-not-the-web-at-all%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/22/11/04/2016237/tim-berners-lee-wants-us-to-ignore-web3-its-not-the-web-at-all?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=22334365&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",
