I decided to speak about this topic because of the many responses I got to a social media post I recently put up: <em>“Over-explaining is a common trauma response for those who were often made to feel at fault as a child. At one point, the desire to people-please provided safety. But, please know, what happened is not your fault, and it’s not your job to regulate other people’s emotional states.”</em></p>\n<p><strong>Read the show blog here: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/oversharing-over-explaining</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>OFFERS FROM OUR SPONSORS:</p>\n<p>-<strong>Ana Luisa Jewelry: I LOVE them, their pieces start at just $39, and you can get 20% off with their summer sale at&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://shop.analuisa.com/drleaf\"><strong>https://shop.analuisa.com/drleaf</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>-Ritual’s Essential Protein: Get 10% off during your first 3 months.
