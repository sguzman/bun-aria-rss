  "description": "<p>New York Times best-selling author, columnist and political commentator David Brooks discusses his new book, <em>The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life</em>.

He describes the “first mountain” life, which is self-centered, vs. the “second mountain” life, which is others-centered. David provides insight into how our culture operates from a “first mountain” perspective, by shaping us to be individualistic, but says it is the community approach to life where joy can be found.
