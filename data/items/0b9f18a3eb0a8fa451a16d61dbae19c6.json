Chris loves to go deep down the science rabbit hole. And he loves to be with, and make a real difference in the lives of the people he serves.</p><p>Funny thing is, none of this was ever supposed to happen...</p><p>CChris' entire career was triggered by an intractable illness caught in a small surfing village in Indonesia, during what was supposed to be a year-long surf safari.</p><p>That led to a 10 year, brutal health odyssey, where he traveled the world to seek the help of more than 30 different doctors, tried every one-size-fits-all approach to diet, a mountain of meds, amassed what he now calls his supplement graveyard, all in vain. Until, finally, he decided to take matters into his own hands, start to listen to his own body, do his own research and learn to heal himself.</p><p>As he began to make progress, he decided to return to school to train in the field that has now become his vocation.</p><p>This week's episode takes us deeper into Chris' journey, his recovery and how it became his vocation.
