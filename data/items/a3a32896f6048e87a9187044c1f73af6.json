  "description": "Due to unsanitized NUL values, attackers may be able to maliciously set environment variables on Windows. In syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd, invalid environment variable values containing NUL values are not properly checked for. A malicious environment variable value can exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example, the environment variable string &quot;A=B\\x00C=D&quot; sets the variables &quot;A=B&quot; and &quot;C=D&quot;.",
