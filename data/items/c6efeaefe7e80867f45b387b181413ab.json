  "description": "<p>How do you unlimit your fear?</p> <p>Fear is hardwired into your brain, and it isn’t always a bad thing. It’s meant to keep you safe, but in our modern world, stress is often misidentified in the brain as fear. This can trigger your fight, flight, or freeze response, and that can hurt your productivity, hinder your performance, and take away your peace of mind.</p> <p>In today’s episode, I want to talk about fear through the lens of the Limitless model. Using Mindset, Motivation, and Methods as a framework can not only help you achieve your goals, but it can help you identify what’s holding you back.</p> <p>No one is immune to feeling scared, and it doesn’t matter whether you’re afraid of heights or public speaking—both are very real in that moment. Fear can limit what you do, but like all limited beliefs, it’s learned. If you’ve been feeling overwhelmed or uncertain and aren’t sure how to face the fear holding you back, this episode is for you.</p> <p>***If you’re inspired, I want to invite you to join me in my brand NEW 10-day course, specifically designed to boost your productivity. I know it sounds too good to be true, but I give you step-by-step guides using the accelerated learning model to help you get more done and achieve your goals.
