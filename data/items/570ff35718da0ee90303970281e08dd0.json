  "title": "Episode 36: Markelle Fultz (featuring Sue Bird & Mero)",
  "description": "On this episode of the Old Man and the Three, JJ and Tommy sit down with rising NBA star Markelle Fultz. **Disclaimer**: this interview was conducted the day before he unfortunately suffered a season ending knee injury in Orlando on January 6th. Despite that horrible circumstance, it'll be easy to see that the road that lies ahead of him right now is nothing he can't conquer. An incredibly mentally strong player, Fultz talks about his injury and recovery, dealing with pressure and the expectations of being a number 1 pick, and how it felt being the target of a negative media attack. If there's one player we know can get through a difficult situation and bounce back on his feet, it's Markelle. We wish him nothing but the best and know he'll be back on the court soon enough. Now, to lighten things up a bit, the episode gets capped off by a spectacular TOP 5/Draft with close friend of the pod Sue Bird, and 1st time guest Mero (from Desus & Mero). This one is a fight to the finish.
