  "description": "Biden's disastrous 60 Minutes interview: Biden declares pandemic over, blue check victims outraged. Clay says, \"I think covid's a ploy to try to make it look like Biden's accomplished something as we get ready for the midterms.\" Buck, who says, \"I'm more focused on America,\" is not interested in the Queen's funeral, but it reminds him of a great book set in WWI, \"The Guns of August.\" Biden blames his approval rating on the pandemic and the \"psyche\" of people. The president just brushes off highest inflation rate in 40 years. What is \"presentism\"? Bill Maher gets it.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
