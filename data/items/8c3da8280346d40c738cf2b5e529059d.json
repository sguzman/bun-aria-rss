His band Flipsyde toured the world, but Jinho wanted to make real change to end police violence against his community – so he became a deputy sheriff himself. He was on the force for eight years before resigning in 2019. Jinho joins us today after trying a practice in cultivating intellectual humility. It asks us to consider how our memories and understanding of the world might be fallible, so we might not have all the answers. When Jinho tapped into the practice during a disagreement with a bandmate, he was able to navigate the conflict and come to a resolution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Check out Jinho’s band, Flipsyde: <a href=\"https://flipsyde.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://flipsyde.com/</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Try this practice: Cultivate Intellectual Humility</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>If you can, write out your answers.</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>When you encounter information or an opinion that contradicts your opinion or worldview, ask yourself these questions:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Why do you disagree?</p>\n\n<p>Are you making any assumptions about the other person and the source of their opinion?</p>\n\n<p>Might those assumptions be wrong?</p>\n\n<p>What about your own opinion, how did you come to believe it?</p>\n\n<p>Do you really have all of the information?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Now think about the scenario from the perspective of a person who disagrees with you.
