But while these options may reduce symptoms temporarily, they don't get to the root cause of the problem. In Functional Medicine, we dig deep to determine the underlying cause of skin issues, which often originate in the gut—treat the gut, and the skin clears up.</p><br><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Dr. Elizabeth Boham, Dhru Purohit, and Dr. Todd LePine about the pathophysiology of acne, why diet matters for skin health, and how gut health is related to skin health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing, she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dhru Purohit is a podcast host, serial entrepreneur, and investor in the health and wellness industry. His podcast, <em>The Dhru Purohit Podcast</em>, is a top 50 global health podcast with over 30 million unique downloads.

He is an Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years.
