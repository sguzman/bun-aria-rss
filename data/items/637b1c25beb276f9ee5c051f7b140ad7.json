  "description": "<p>When it comes to preserving homestead staples, there is perhaps none more confusing than the egg. If you spend time researching some of the methods used in the past, you're likely to question the validity and safety of the vast majority of them. Thankfully, today I'm joined by a true expert in egg preservation, Carolyn Thomas of Homesteading Family. In this episode we cover everything including liming, water glassing, oiling, freeze-drying, freezing, and much more. We even discuss some out of the ordinary methods like salt curing egg yolks and freezing egg based recipes. Whether you produce eggs on your homestead or purchase them from another source, this episode is sure to provide a ton of value and insure that you're able to preserve your eggs year round.</p><p>Want to connect further with Carolyn?

I have learned over the years that not all salt is created equal and having the good stuff really does make a difference in your culinary adventures. Redmond’s is the only salt mined in the good ol’ US of A. I love that it’s mined using sustainable practices AND contains 60+ trace minerals that not only make it incredibly good for you, but it tastes better too. Since I can’t grow salt myself (obviously) Right now, Redmond's is offering 15% off your entire order just for my podcast listeners.
