  "description": "<p>Do you long to make an impact or have a ton of ideas on ways to give back - but you aren’t sure if those ideas belong in the ‘good’ or ‘bad’ idea category? Or maybe your experienced skillset doesn’t overlap with your passion – what do you do now? Do you have to choose? Girlfriend, you’re not the only one with these cycling questions! Listen in as Jordan brings on powerhouse CEO/Founder of the Dressember Foundation, Blythe Hill, as they discuss how her small idea transformed into a dignity restoring non profit. In this conversation, you’ll learn how Blythe has raised over $5M for anti-human trafficking work, where her idea was surprisingly birthed in the first place, and why it’s vital that you believe in yourself – even before your dreams make sense. Gal, if you have a knack for business and heart for mission inspired impact, this episode is for you. Listen in to be encouraged to take action on that crazy idea, give back to those in need, and step into gratefulness this Thanksgiving week.</p>  <p>@jordanleedooley</p> <p>@shepodcast</p>  <p>Episode Link: <a href=\"http://jordanleedooley.com/how-a-small-idea-can-turn-into-big-impact\" target=\"_blank\">http://jordanleedooley.com/how-a-small-idea-can-turn-into-big-impact</a></p>  <p>The SHE Podcast is a part of the Lasting Media family of podcasts.
