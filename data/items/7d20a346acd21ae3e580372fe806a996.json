  "description": "For model Emily Ratajkowski, there's a blurred line between empowerment and objectification. Coming up in the world of modeling, a harrowing experience with a photographer provided an early education in power dynamics, shame and what it means to be the object of desire. Her essay on that experience for The Cut went viral last year. Now, she's expanded on the ideas in that piece in a new memoir called \"My Body.\" The Cut's executive producer Hanna Rosin talked to Emily about starring in an infamous music video, growing up with a woman's body and taking control of how that body was viewed as an adult.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
