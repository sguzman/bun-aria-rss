  "description": "<p>Causal inference from observational data requires untestable assumptions. If\nthese assumptions apply, machine learning (ML) methods can be used to study\ncomplex forms of causal-effect heterogeneity. Several ML methods were developed\nrecently to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). If the\nfeatures at hand cannot explain all heterogeneity, the individual treatment\neffects (ITEs) can seriously deviate from the CATE. In this work, we\ndemonstrate how the distributions of the ITE and the estimated CATE can differ\nwhen a causal random forest (CRF) is applied. We extend the CRF to estimate the\ndifference in conditional variance between treated and controls. If the ITE\ndistribution equals the CATE distribution, this difference in variance should\nbe small. If they differ, an additional causal assumption is necessary to\nquantify the heterogeneity not captured by the CATE distribution. The\nconditional variance of the ITE can be identified when the individual effect is\nindependent of the outcome under no treatment given the measured features.\nThen, in the cases where the ITE and CATE distributions differ, the extended\nCRF can appropriately estimate the characteristics of the ITE distribution\nwhile the CRF fails to do so.\n</p>",
