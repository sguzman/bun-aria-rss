A Reminder that we are all artists and in a world of youtube videos telling what camera gear to buy, blogs showing exactly where our lights should be places, and facebook posts telling us why we are doing it all wrong, that sometimes we need to step back and do what WE want to do. Explore what we want to explore. Today I chat with 3 members of the Beginner Photography Podcast Facebook group who I personally saw substantial growth in their work in 2020. I want to know what they did and how they focused on themselves to grow their skills. Special shoutout to Kimberly, Saul, and Jim for sharing with you all.</p><p><b>Become a premium member by December 18th and get your first month for free!</b></p><ul><li><a href='https://www.patreon.com/BeginnerPhotographyPodcast'>Click Here to Learn more about the premium membership</a></li></ul><p><figure data-trix-attachment='{\"contentType\":\"image\",\"height\":490,\"url\":\"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/90261/GarrisonBWC.jpg\",\"width\":650}' data-trix-content-type='image' class='attachment attachment--preview'><img src='https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/90261/GarrisonBWC.jpg' width='650' height='490'/><figcaption class='attachment__caption'></figcaption></figure></p><p>Grab your Free CloudSpot Account at <a href=\"http://deliverphotos.com/\">DeliverPhotos.com</a></p> <p>Grab your Free CloudSpot Account at <a href=\"http://deliverphotos.com/\">DeliverPhotos.com</a></p>",
