  "description": "On this week’s OM3, JJ and Tommy are joined by long time friend, long time NBA vet, All NBA defender - not to mention 2015 NBA Finals MVP - Andre Iguodala. In this wide ranging interview, Iggy touches on just about everything as he discusses topics like the new breed of players and the important element they're lacking, his uncanny knack for being on great teams, his six year run of being in the finals, the brilliance of Durant and Curry, and so much more. And then to take it even further, he sticks around for an EAT PRAY DUNK segment. It’s a 'can’t miss' interview as Iggy plays it straight and tells it like it is. \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
