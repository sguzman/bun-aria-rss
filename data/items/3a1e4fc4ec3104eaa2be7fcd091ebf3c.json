  "description": "<p>In this work we first prove, by formal arguments, that the diffusion limit of\nnonlinear kinetic equations, where both the transport term and the turning\noperator are density-dependent, leads to volume-exclusion chemotactic\nequations. We generalise an asymptotic preserving scheme for such nonlinear\nkinetic equations based on a micro-macro decomposition. By properly\ndiscretizing the nonlinear term implicitly-explicitly in an upwind manner, the\nscheme produces accurate approximations also in the case of strong\nchemosensitivity. We show, via detailed calculations, that the scheme presents\nthe following properties: asymptotic preserving, positivity preserving and\nenergy dissipation, which are essential for practical applications. We extend\nthis scheme to two dimensional kinetic models and we validate its efficiency by\nmeans of 1D and 2D numerical experiments of pattern formation in biological\nsystems.\n</p>",
