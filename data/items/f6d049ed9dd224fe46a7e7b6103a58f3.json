  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease Podcast we’ll be looking into the life a man whose legacy is wrought with conflict. To Americans who lived in the Ohio River Valley he was a folk  hero, but to the Native Americans he hated and murdered in cold-blood, he was known as the Deathwind. Clay Newcomb went to the Ohio Valley to interview outdoor writer and author, Chip Gross, to learn about the life of Lewis Wetzel. This dark-deep-dive comes at the request one of Steve Rinella of MeatEater, who is also a guest on this episode. We’ll talk about Wetzel’s life and the brutality of the American frontier. Lastly, in an effort to understand the mind frame of<br>Wetzel, Clay will interview mental health professional, Zach Newcomb, to learn if our boy Wetzel was truly a sociopath, a serial killer, or if his actions simply the result of life lived in a war zone. We doubt you’re going to want to miss this one.  We know folks let their young kids listen to Bear Grease (which we love), but we’ll warn you -- in this episode there is lots of talk of graphic violence.</p>\n<p><br>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p>\n<p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p>\n<p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
