  "description": "<p>In this forty-fourth episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast, Dr. Anthony Cashio decides that \"turn-about is fair play.\" He had been the guest in the very first episode of the show, and in this episode, he turns the tables and grills co-host Dr. Eric Thomas Weber as the guest for the day. The show focuses on Weber's 2013 book, <em>Democracy and Leadership</em>, and then relates Weber's theory of democratic leadership to his work as Executive Director of the Society of Philosophers in America, a.k.a. SOPHIA. </p> <p>Dr. Weber is the author of four books, including most recently <em>Democracy and Leadership</em> (2013) and <em>Uniting Mississippi</em> (2015). In 2015 he was awarded the Mississippi Humanities Council's Humanities Scholar Award in their Public Humanities Awards program. At the University of Mississippi, he was associate professor of public policy leadership from 2007 to 2016. In 2016, he moved to the University of Kentucky, where he is visiting associate professor in the philosophy department. In 2017, SOPHIA was awarded the major prize from the APA and the Philosophy Documentation Center for excellence and innovation in philosophy programs. </p> <p>Listen for our “You Tell Me!” questions and for some jokes in one of our concluding segments, called “Philosophunnies.” Reach out to us on Facebook <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at <a href=\"mailto:philosophybakesbread@gmail.com\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">philosophybakesbread@gmail.com</a>; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.
