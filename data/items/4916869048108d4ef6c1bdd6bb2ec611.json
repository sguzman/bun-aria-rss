  "description": "<p>This week, we address an email from a listener who writes “Could you and Alice address the “what’s the point of art”, “what do I do with all this crap” sort of issues? I’ve not listened to the news for a while now, but am actually listening to very little at all. Sometimes I find people too jolly, too positive, so I guess I’m looking for gentle, encouraging, empathetic. I can’t seem to pull myself up at the moment.”</p>\n<p>In response, we discuss how much it is our responsibility to change our mental state ... and how can do it. We also suggest that the question should be 'what is the point of art for ME?' Understanding this gives you motivation to show up even when you don't feel like it. Interestingly, we feel differently about this question and have different solutions, so hopefully you will resonate with one of us. We also discuss the 'butterfly effect' and why it might be a good thing and we share the ways in which we change our own moods (including a rather drastic strategy Alice recently employed - and is not recommending to others!)</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Extras outtakes: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_thjUPE1i4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_thjUPE1i4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQMg8Ve1Gy0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQMg8Ve1Gy0</a></p>\n<p>Abraham Hicks: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1ddJyJoSOrg\"><u>https://youtu.be/1ddJyJoSOrg</u></a></p>\n<p>Art in Isolation episode 1: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoqTM4IljJM\"><u>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoqTM4IljJM</u></a></p>\n<p>Gretchen Rubin Four Tendencies Quiz <a href=\"https://quiz.gretchenrubin.com/\">HERE</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
