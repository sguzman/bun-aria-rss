  "description": "<p>It's time to return to the sport of short track speed skating today as we speak with Australian skater Brendan Corey about his recent experiences at the Olympics and everything else about his amazing career! We find out from Brendan just how he got into the sport and how it was growing up in Canada when it came to going through the ranks in short track. We also learn about just what brought him to Australia to compete and how it was wearing the green and gold rather than the red and white. We also find out about his time in Beijing, how he nearly missed the Opening Ceremony and had to get the help of some of his teammates to make it happen as well as just why a certain iconic Canadian-born Australian Winter Olympian might spur him on to golden glory in Milan in 2026. It's an entertaining interview that will make your day better, so listen in and enjoy!</p>",
