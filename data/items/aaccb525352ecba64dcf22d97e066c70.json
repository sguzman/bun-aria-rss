  "description": "Who is Tua Tagovailoa? Daniel Jeremiah and Bucky Brooks take a deep look at one of the top QB prospects of the 2020 NFL Draft in their annual 360 series. The two scouts look past the tape and talk to those closest around Tua. How important is family to him? Has he recovered from the hip injury that prematurely ended his 2019 season at Alabama? Did he always know he would unseat Jalen Hurts? DJ sat down with Galu and Diane (6:28), Tua's parents, to talk about their family dynamic, what football means to him, and how they rallied around him after he hurt his hip. Vince Passas (19:01), Tua's high school QB coach, got a chance to chat with DJ about what he was like in high school and how he showed signs of leadership back then. Kirk Herbstreit (29:28) raved about his experience with Tua and how he saw how special he was in a closed practice before the National Championship game. Trent Dilfer (38:31) had nothing but heaps of praise for the young QB, calling him \"the best prospect\" he's ever seen. Finally, Tua sat down with NFL Network's Steve Wyche (54:17) to update everyone on his recovery and how he's communicating with teams in the midst of COVID-19.<p>Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
