On the first, a boy loves collecting stories, but no one really taught him proper story care, so they went the way of so many carnival goldfish. On the second, a young man protests his unfair (and kind of murdery) working conditions...by turning his boss's lunchbox into a toilet. On the third, there are people, there are cows, and no one can tell the two apart.</p>\n<p>The creature is the ziz, and it wrecks cities by accident.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://myths.link/twitter\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://myths.link/twitter\">https://myths.link/twitter</a></p>\n<p>Shop: <a href=\"https://myths.link/store\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://myths.link/store\">https://myths.link/store</a></p>\n<p>Membership: <a href=\"https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership\">https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership</a></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Sponsors:</p>\n<p><strong>Simplisafe</strong>!
