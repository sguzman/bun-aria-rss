  "description": "<p>Another great interview coming through your speakers today as we chat with American ski jumper Paige Jones about her time in the sport and her Olympic hopes for the upcoming Beijing Olympics! We find out how being born in an Olympic city in an Olympic year helped her on her journey in the sport and just what it was about ski jumping that took her preference over some other winter sports. We also find out her progression through the ranks and how much her experiences at the 2020 Youth Olympics helped her towards that progression. Added to this we find out about her time living in living in Australia and just why Star Wars influenced her career choice outside of sport. It's a fascinating chat that you'll want to jump right into! </p>",
