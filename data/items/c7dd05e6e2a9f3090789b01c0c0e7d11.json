  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys chat about what the USFL needs to do to be successful, AJ Brown removing Tennessee from his bio amidst rumors that he and the Titans are working on a long term extension, if any of these young receivers looking for an extension will get anything done before the draft, Carolina Panthers Offensive Coordinator Ben McAdoo stating that Sam Darnold is the starting Quarterback for the Panthers and then immediately walking those statements back, and much more. Joining the progrum is 6 year NFL veteran at LB, co-host of The Pivot with Fred Taylor and Ryan Clark, and friend of the show, Channing Crowder. Pat and Channing chat about what they've been up to at The Pivot, how much the game and players have changed since he was in the league, why the NFL is king, pissing his pants every single game of his career, and much more in a hilarious conversation (22:59-54:31). Later, friend of the show, current WBC and The Ring Heavyweight Champion of the World, the greatest Heavyweight boxer of all-time, The Gypsy King, Tyson Fury joins Pat and AJ to chat about his title fight against Dillian Whyte this weekend at Wembley Stadium in London, how he anticipates the fight going, what is next for him and whether or not he's really mulling retirement, his post fight plans, and much more (1:07:22-1:21:15).
