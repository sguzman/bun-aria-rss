  "description": "<div>\n<strong>Eliot Spitzer was a rising star in the Democratic Party...But then he got caught having sex with escorts. </strong><br>\n<br>\nClient 9, as you might imagine, introduces us to a host of fascinating characters. From the take-no-shit escorts who love their jobs, to the weirdo downtown artist who....well, we're still not quite sure why he's here...to Spitzer himself--a powerful man with great intentions who simply thought the rules didn't apply to him. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?
