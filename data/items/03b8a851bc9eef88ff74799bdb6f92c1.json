  "description": "<p>The barrier island of Folly Beach, South Carolina appears picturesque with its images of waves lapping against the sand. Locals refer to it as the \"Edge of America.\" Below the surface of painted sunsets and beautiful beaches lies a dark history of mysterious and tragic losses. Folly Beach really has it all from shipwrecks to the Civil War to pirates. Blackbeard himself took cover at Folly Beach. A native tribe also died out here. Is it this colorful history that has led to rumors of hauntings? Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Folly Beach. Moment in Oddity features the Dr. Suess House as suggested by listener Ren Davenport and This Day in History features the Shot Heard Round the World. Location was suggested by listener Dee and Research Assistants were Sharon Spungen and April Rogers-Krick.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/04/hgb-ep-119-folly-beach.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/04/hgb-ep-119-folly-beach.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
