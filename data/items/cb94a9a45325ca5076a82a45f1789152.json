  "description": "<p>We all breathe. It just happens. But, what if the way you breathe made a massive difference in everything from your risk for debilitating illness to your depth and quality of sleep, energy, creativity, and performance? Turns out, it does. Breathing is maybe the single most effective and accessible switch we can throw to radically transform and take control of the way we feel and live. And, by the way, when we leave it chance - as most of us do - our breathing often defaults into a mode that sends us spiraling into poor physical and mental health, and underperformance in all parts of life. Which is why I was so excited to sit down with James Nestor for this Best Of conversation.</p><br><p>James is a science writer who has written for Outside, Scientific American, The Atlantic, Dwell, The New York Times, and more. His award-winning book <em>Deep: Freediving, Renegade Science, and What the Ocean Tells Us About Ourselves </em>was a revelation and, in no small part, kicked off this science writer’s fascination with the breath. That led to a years-long, immersive quest to understand this often-ignored key to both human potential and all forms of peril. And it led to his blockbuster book,<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ekUIJS\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em>Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art</em></a>, which is a myth-busting and paradigm-shifting look at how we breathe, what it does to us and how to harness breathing to transform our health and lives.</p><br><p>You can find James at: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mrjamesnestor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"http://mrjamesnestor.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode </strong>you’ll also love the conversations we had with <a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/wim-hof/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wim Hoff</a> about breathing and how it affects your physiology and psychology.</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>My New Book <a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a> | My New Podcast <a href=\"https://pod.link/1610198312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SPARKED</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.kachava.com/GOODLIFE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ka'Chava</a></li><li><a href=\"http://outschool.com/goodlife\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Outschool</a></li></ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
