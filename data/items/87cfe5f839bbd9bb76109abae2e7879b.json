  "description": "<p>Egypt is a land of ancient treasures and wonders. Pharaohs were honored in death with immense public monuments that we know as pyramids. The Old Kingdom of Egypt built monuments in Giza and the Nile Delta. The New Kingdom pharaohs of Egypt wanted to be buried closer to their dynastic roots and they had their crypts built in the hills of Luxor. This area became known as the Valley of the Kings. The Valley of the Kings would end up housing the remains of at least sixty Egyptian nobles. Pharaohs from King Tut to Ramses II have tombs here. There are more than tombs here though. There are tales of curses and hauntings in the Valley of the Kings. How does Downton Abbey figure into this? Moment in Oddity features the Mothman and This Day in History features the first run of the Electromote.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/04/hgb-podcast-ep-43-valley-of-kings.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/04/hgb-podcast-ep-43-valley-of-kings.html</a></p>",
