  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, The attacks against Florida Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis are Alinsky tactics. His opponent Andrew Gillum cannot win if he comes out and exposes his socialism, so he calls DeSantis a racist. The more radical, the more Left the Democrat Party and its candidates are and become, the more they try to run their campaigns not on their radical ideology but on character assassination. They don’t want to run on socialism, they want to run on racism. Then, the government more and more wants to know about our race, our healthcare, our business, our travel…why? Some can surmise that they want to control us and use this data to decide who gets what loan, who needs to be redistributed to or from so that the government can decide who to reward or punish. Capitalism does not rely on the government, or your race, for it to succeed. It doesn't matter what race the farmer was that sold you their crops.
