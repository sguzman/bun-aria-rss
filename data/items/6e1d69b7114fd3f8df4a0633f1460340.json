    "media:description": "VTEC is Honda's variable valve technology used to change the amount of valve lift and valve duration in the engine.

And everyone loves horsepower.\n\nFull video on how VTEC works:\nhttps://youtu.be/tSCuRXnfLuI\n\nSubscribe to Engineering Explained for more videos! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7\nRecommended Books & Car Products - http://amzn.to/2BrekJm\nEE Shirts! - http://bit.ly/2BHsiuo\n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA",
