  "description": "How should we talk to our kids about what it means to fall in love? Parents know how good it can feel to make a strong connection and be on the receiving end of affection, but we also want to shield kids from heartbreak. Dr. Lisa helps walks us through how we can talk with our kids about both the emotional and physical sides of love, while Reena asks key questions about how to deal with the fact that these conversations are often uncomfortable for both parents and kids. Dr. Lisa explains how we can keep these important discussions going without being awkward or dismissive - offering a \"swat team\" strategy that can make a big difference. This episode also includes key guidance about how to make the most of the openings our kids provide to talk about young love.\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn @AskLisaPodcast, @Lisa.Damour, @ReenaNina\nCheckout Dr. Lisa’s website for more resources. \nhttps://www.drlisadamour.com/\nAsk Lisa is produced by: \nhttps://www.goodtroubleproductions.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.
