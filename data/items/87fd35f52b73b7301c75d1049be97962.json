    "media:description": "Today I will be unveiling part 3 of my series showcasing the ethno-racial map of South-Central Asia aka the Middle East, India and Central Asia. This is by far one of the most diverse regions of human habitation on Earth, from a genetic, linguistic, cultural, religious and phenotypic standpoint and hence is of great interest to many around the world, including myself.\n\nApologies for the delays. I lost a lot of progress due to my crappy computer, but thank you so much for waiting and being patient! Stay tuned, the rest is coming, I've been working on so many projects lately that I'm getting side-tracked and struggling with finishing any of them, but needless to say, they are all awesome and you will not be disappointed. Thank you so much for watching!",
