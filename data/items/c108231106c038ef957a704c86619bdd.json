  "description": "<p>Get ready for a brain buster. Or at least prepare to witness my brain being busted. Celtic mythology is... tricky to understand. And no one understands perfectly because the source material is scarce.  A LOT has been written about Celtic mythology but so much of it is conjecture presented as fact. The ancient Celts themselves didn't write anything down. Their enemies did. As did the Catholic monks who came to island to conquer a people the Roman army could not. Today we familiarize ourselves with Ireland - land most associated with the Celts and find out why Ireland is most strongly associated with Celtic culture when Celtic tribes lived as far away as Asia Minor. Who were these people? What did they believe? Why don't we know more about them? And what the Hell is a Selkie, Spriggan, or a  Dullahan?  So much mystery and madness explored today. <br /><br />The Bad Magic Charity of the month is Love Thy Neighbor! We'll  be giving $15,500 to this Denver-area based 501(3c) nonprofit dedicated to working with local businesses to hand out free food to the homeless.
