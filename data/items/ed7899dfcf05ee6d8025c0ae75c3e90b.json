  "description": "<p>We present a new description of the known large deviation function of the\nclassical symmetric simple exclusion process by exploiting its connection with\nthe quantum symmetric simple exclusion processes and using tools from free\nprobability. This may seem paradoxal as free probability usually deals with non\ncommutative probability while the simple exclusion process belongs to the realm\nof classical probability. On the way, we give a new formula for the free energy\n-- alias the logarithm of the Laplace transform of the probability distribution\n-- of correlated Bernoulli variables in terms of the set of their cumulants\nwith non-coinciding indices. This latter result is obtained either by\ndeveloping a combinatorial approach for cumulants of products of random\nvariables or by borrowing techniques from Feynman graphs.\n</p>",
