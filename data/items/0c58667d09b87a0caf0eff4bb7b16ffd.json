  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, when it comes to the corrupt January 6th committee, Democrats want everyone they subpoena to submit to their one-sided show trial, yet refuse to release the transcripts of depositions. Donald Trump did not take any illegal advice, he didn't call in the military, and he didn't call in the Dept. of Homeland Security to stop or interfere in the election or transition. Yet the Jan 6th committee continues to fabricate narratives to try and secure an indictment based on the 14th Amendment. In Washington, D.C., Democrats and their dark money groups have tentacles everywhere and control the levers of power. Federal judges, even those appointed by Trump and approved by Mitch McConnell, have ignored the legitimate claims of brilliant lawyers for Stephen K.Bannon, who is being tried for contempt of congress. Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, and other Democrats within Congress, the Department of Justice, and the media are in a rush to convict any Trump ally they can before the midterm elections so they can exploit it for their own political benefit. Then, lawlessness and violence cause decay to the civil society and that is at the core of the Democrat Party, and it always has been since the Confederacy, segregation, Jim Crow, and the KKK. Coupled with a growing Marxist movement within the Democrat Party, their ultimate goal is the destruction of American norms and the creation of their new political power structure.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
