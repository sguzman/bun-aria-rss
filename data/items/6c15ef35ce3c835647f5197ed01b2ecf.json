  "description": "<p>If you are waiting to see what other successful people do just so you can do the same thing, you are doing yourself a disservice. It's one thing to notice what someone else does well. It's legitimate to cherry pick a good idea or best practice and apply it to your life and business. But here's the bottom line: whatever you draw from someone else should be adapted and be developed for you. Personalize it or pass on it.  You don't want to be a carbon copy of someone else.  It's less than you deserve and bad business.</p>",
