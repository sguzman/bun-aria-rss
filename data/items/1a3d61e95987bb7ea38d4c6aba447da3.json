  "description": "<p>Is it Christmas in June?\nUsually the period around E3 is like a desert in which the year's worst games are left to rot under the sweltering summer sun. But as you may have gleamed from the carousel of review scores on the Polygon homepage, we have been submerged by a flood of excellence: Animal Crossing: New Leaf, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger, The Swapper, Gunpoint, The Last of Us, Don't Starve, Remember Me, State of Decay and the list goes on and on.\nWe discuss a few of those games this week, saving others for later this month. What about next week, you ask? Lean closer and I'll tell you a secret: next Friday we're streaming a special E3 video episode of the Besties live from Los Angeles.\nBefore you run out the door and scream thanks to the heavens, be sure to listen to this week's episode. We'd hate for it to go to waste.\n<p>3:40 - Best pocket-sized daily vacation (Animal Crossing: New Leaf)<br />\n18:40 - Best sound effect of the year (Gunpoint)<br />\n26:23 - Halftime!<br />\n30:43 - Best way to start a forest fire (Don't Starve)<br />\n38:20 - Best way to die (The Swapper)<br />\n43:54 - The winner is...</p>\n<p>Theme song by Ian Dorsch<br />\nGet the show:</p>\n<p>Download MP3\"<br />\nSubscribe to the podcast (RSS)<br />\nSubscribe on iTunes</p></p>\n",
