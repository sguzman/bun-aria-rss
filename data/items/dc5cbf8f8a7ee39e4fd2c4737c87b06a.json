  "description": "<p>More and more investors want their money to be going to companies who are doing good in the world, or at least to companies who are being responsible when it comes to the environment, social issues, and governance. Companies who are leading in this front may also be better positioned for future challenges and experience fewer instances of bribery, corruption, and fraud (bonus: giving you better returns on your investment)! Unfortunately, with socially responsible investing being fairly new on the scene, definitions can be unclear and terms are often used interchangeably. Listen as we dive into this topic, giving you the knowledge to help you decide what socially responsible investing means to you.</p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Toffee Stout by Carolina Brewery which you can find on Untappd. Another big thanks to Emma in NC for donating this beer to the show!
