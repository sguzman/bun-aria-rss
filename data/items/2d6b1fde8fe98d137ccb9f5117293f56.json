  "description": "Fred Minnick, multi-appearance guest on the show and author of the new book  Rum Curious, educates us bourbon drinkers on why rum isn’t so bad and how the rum industry needs the passion of the bourbon community.\n\nBack in February you had a article named “For Rum’s Sake”, an open letter to bourbon drinkers. Was it a plea?\n\nWhy rum? There’s lots of other spirits\n\nName a few brands that are accessible in parts of the US that are trustworthy.\n\nSo what’s wrong with Captain Morgan and those typical ones we all think of?\n\nWe know bourbon has 3 main ingredients, but what are some of the main ones going into rum?\n\nWe also have corn whiskey, rye whiskey, etc, any variants?\n\nSo people want to learn more about rum, besides your book, where are the rum fanatics?\n\nTalk about the laws and labels for rum producers\n\nWhat do you think about those companies that say they can create an aged rum in less than 7 days using technology?\n\nThanks to Emmet Klocker that sent us some samples from Lemon Hart, Havana Club, and 1931.",
