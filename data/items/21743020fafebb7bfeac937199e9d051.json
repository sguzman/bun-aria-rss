  "description": "<p>A linearly polarized Laguerre-Gaussian (LP-LG) laser beam with a twist index\n$l = -1$ has field structure that fundamentally differs from the field\nstructure of a conventional linearly polarized Gaussian beam. Close to the axis\nof the LP-LG beam, the longitudinal electric and magnetic fields dominate over\nthe transverse components. This structure offers an attractive opportunity to\naccelerate electrons in vacuum. It is shown, using three dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulations, that this scenario can be realized by reflecting\nan LP-LG laser off a plasma with a sharp density gradient. The simulations\nindicate that a 600~TW LP-LG laser beam effectively injects electrons into the\nbeam during the reflection. The electrons that are injected close to the laser\naxis experience a prolonged longitudinal acceleration by the longitudinal laser\nelectric field. The electrons form distinct monoenergetic bunches with a small\ndivergence angle. The energy in the most energetic bunch is 0.29 GeV. The bunch\ncharge is 6~pC and its duration is $\\sim 270$~as. The divergence angle is just\n\\dg{0.57} (10~mrad). By using a linearly polarized rather than a circularly\npolarized Laguerre-Gausian beam, our scheme makes it easier to demonstrate the\nelectron acceleration experimentally at a high-power laser facility.\n</p>",
