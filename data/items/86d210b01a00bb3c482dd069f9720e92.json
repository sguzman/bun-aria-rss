  "description": "This week we kick off 2014 by looking at a few nations that could be extra busy in a bad way this year.  In Iraq the government prepares an assault on out-of-control Fallujah. In Israel thousands of African migrants take to the streets to protest a new law. Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh have ended despite violence, a boycott from all opposition parties and the international community. Meanwhile Latvia has become the 18th country to join the euro.  And something strange is going on in Tokyo as Tuna prices plunge despite dwindling global stocks. Our NEWZ Source this week is a recently created organization finding ways to fund stories from post Haiyan Philippines. Finally today the plane is fueling up as the Dubai Project takes off in a matter of hours. For those who haven't heard it yet, Tim and Mitch are guests on the latest edition of CTRP recorded at 30C3.",
