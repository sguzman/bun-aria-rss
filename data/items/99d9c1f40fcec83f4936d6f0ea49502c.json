  "description": "<p>The saga continues! Joey Diaz returns to The HoneyDew! Starting in the summer of 1982, we cover from the ages of 18 to 20 (I think). We get to the Denver days, Denver nights, Denver drugs & Denver B&Es. I’m documenting Joey Diaz’s life story until we’re current! It could take 50 episodes and Joey might be in his late 60’s by then, but damnit it’s happening here on The Dew!</p>",
