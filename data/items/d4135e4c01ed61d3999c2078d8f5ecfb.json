  "description": "Nick Kostos, Will Brinson, Pete Prisco and Jason La Canfora make their Week 8 picks against the spread. They issue their bets on a doozy of a London game featuring the Vikings and Browns, followed by analysis on the surging Saints vs. the Bears, the struggling Falcons vs. the Jets, and an NFC South battle between the Panthers and Bucs. The wagers continue on the team with the league's best record, as the Eagles host the 49ers, big spreads in Bengals-Colts, Pats-Chargers, and another big rivalry as the Cowboys visit the Redskins. Then the guys cover who will cover primetime games highlighted by Steelers-Lions, and Broncos-Chiefs. Nick and Will are then joined by Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce (1:01:50), to discuss everything from stomaching hot chips, to Alex Smith and the Chiefs' great play this season, to some fun Andy Reid stories!\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
