  "itunes:summary": "Author A.J. Jacobs comes to the Apple Store SoHo to shares how he turned his life into an experiment in book, \"The Guinea Pig Diaries.\" Accompanied by moderator Travis Tonn, Jacobs discusses the various crazy experiments he undertook in the writing of this book. \n\nFrom the description: \"Among the many adventures: He outsources his life. A.J. hires a team of people in Bangalore, India, to take care of everything in his life from answering his e-mails to arguing with his spouse. He spends a month practicing Radical Honesty—a movement that encourages us to remove the filters between our brains and mouths. (To give you an idea of what happened, the name of the chapter is \"I Think You're Fat.\") He goes to the Academy Awards disguised as a movie star to understand the strange and warping effects of fame. He commits himself to ultimate rationality, using cutting-edge science to make the best decisions possible. It changes the way he makes choices big and small, from what to buy at the grocery store to how to talk to his kids. And his revelations will change how you make decisions, too. He attempts to follow George Washington's rules of life, uncovering surprising truths about leadership and politics in the 21st century. He also spends a lot of time bowing and doffing his hat.  And then there's the month when he followed his wife's every whim—foot massages, Kate Hudson movies, and all. Depending on your point of view, it's either the best or worst idea in the history of American marriage.\"",
