  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the National School Board Association did, in fact, collude with the White House before that memo calling parents domestic terrorists was issued. This program made the prescient state that there was coordination with the NSBA and the White House calling the letter an \"inside job\" at that time. Now on November 12th, 2021 its been confirmed that the NSBA has been actively engaged with several executive branch agencies. It is also believed that the DOJ had a hand in writing the memo. Then, Hawk Newsome, the head of Black Lives Matter of Greater New York City has declared that there will be arson and bloodshed in the streets if the NYPD's anti-crime task force is reinstated by the incoming Mayor Eric Adams. While there's no repercussion for the BLM leader, Steve Bannon was indicted for rejecting an overreaching subpoena from a partisan congressional committee obsessed with Donald Trump. How many presidents and their staff has this happened to? The Democrat party of Jim Crow remains a grave threat to this country as their war is promoted by Marxism and attacks the culture of Americanism, our economy, and our energy production. Later, when then-AG Eric Holder got caught running the \"Fast and Furious\" gun-running scandal he declined to respond to Congressional subpoenas and he was only held in contempt. There is no evidence that Steve Bannon led an insurrection on January 6th but he's been indicted.  Afterward, what the FBI is doing to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas is egregious. Leaking information from his cellphone to the New York Times has now become a routine pattern of political punishment. Finally, Grove City College Professor Paul Kengor joins the show to discuss his latest article in the American Spectator on natural immunity. Kengor argues that natural immunity is five times superior to the artificial immunity offered through vaccination, which only lasts about six months before a booster is needed to maintain efficacy.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
