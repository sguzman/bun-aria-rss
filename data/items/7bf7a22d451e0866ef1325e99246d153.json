She tries to make sense of it, to imagine alternatives, but only one conclusion is possible: it's the past, come to claim her. \n\nMartin Scarsden's new life seems perfect, right up until the moment it's shattered by a voicemail: a single scream, abruptly cut off, from his partner Mandalay Blonde.\n\nRacing home, he finds an unconscious man sprawled on the floor and Mandy gone. Someone has abducted her. But who, and why?\n\nSo starts a twisting tale of intrigue and danger, as Martin probes the past of the woman he loves, a woman who has buried her former life so deep she has never mentioned it.\n\nAnd for the first time, Mandy finds denial impossible, now the body of a mystery man has been discovered, a man whose name she doesn't know, a man she was engaged to marry when he died. It's time to face her demons once and for all; it's time she learned how to trust. \n\nSet in a Sydney riven with corruption and nepotism, privilege and power, Trust is the third riveting novel from award-winning and internationally acclaimed writer Chris Hammer.\n\n'The best Australian crime novel since Peter Temple's The Broken Shore.' - The Times on Silver",
