This brief note argues that the cosmology of the early Universe can be viewed as critical behavior in continuous dimensions. We find that the self-similar properties of the metric near the Big Bang singularity are comparable to the effects produced by minimal fractality of spacetime far above the electroweak scale.\n  \n   "
