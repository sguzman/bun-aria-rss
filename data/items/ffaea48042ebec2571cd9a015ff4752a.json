  "description": "<p>On Buber's 1923 book about the fundamental human position: As children, and historically, we start fully absorbed in relation with another person (like mom). Before that, we have no self-consciousness, no \"self\" at all. It's only by having these consuming \"encounters\" that we gradually distinguish ourselves from other people, and can then engage in what we'd normally consider \"experience,\" which Buber calls \"the I-It relation.\" Buber thinks that unless we can keep connected to this \"I-Thou\" phenomenon, through mature relationships, art, and nature. With guest Daniel Horne. <a href= \"http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/02/15/ep71-buber-citizen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the full discussion at partiallyexaminedlife.com.</a></p>",
