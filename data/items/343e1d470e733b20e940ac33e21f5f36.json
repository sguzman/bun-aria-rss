  "description": "<p>HELLO, MOMMIES! We're still reeling from all of the Robert Paul Champagne memes and content you've made for us. It's been overwhelming in all the best ways. Tom and Christina review some of the reaction to RPC coming on the show the last two weeks. Have you ever had a fart bully in your life? Is Emma Stone hot enough to be cast as Ryan Gosling's love interest? The Mommies debate.  Next, Josh Potter is on the couch to wet our whistle for our first guest, Sera Gamble. Josh tells some wild stories of cyber stalking and is presented with a proposition by the Main Mommies.  After hearing about some cyber stalking tales, Sera Gamble (writer and creator of \"YOU\") is in studio to give her insight into cyber stalking and how \"Joe\" in YOU has implemented social media to become a stalker. Sera also gives us some teases about the upcoming season of YOU and the story of getting the show out to the masses.  Next, he played for the Seattle Seahawks, New Orleans Saints, Miami Dolphins and The New England Patriots, but more importantly, he played against Tom in High School. It's fullback and broadcaster Heath Evans! Heath and Tom reminisce about their time in high school and the small differences in their athletic career, plus Heath has some great stories from his NFL days about Bill Belichick, Tom Brady and Randy Moss.</p>\n",
