  "description": "In this episode of The Barron Report, host Paul Barron speaks with Ken Chong, co-founder and chief executive officer at All Day Kitchens to explore how restaurants can grow their business through digital, delivery, and takeout. <br /><br />Three Key Points:<br /><br />Chong led several Marketplace product teams at Uber before co-founding All Day Kitchens, a San Francisco-based restaurant platform that offers support by providing services to expand their reach in delivery and pick-up. <br /><br />In terms of trends, Chong says All Day Kitchen is seeing a rapid rate of innovation, adaptation, and experimentation across the spectrum. Ranging from large nationwide chains, franchises, and single unit mom and pop or small business. Chong is seeing great success with this platform for small businesses that really need this technology. <br /><br />Chong says over the next five to ten years we will see a transformation and digitization of the food, local, and hyperlocal delivery. All categories are seeing rapid changes including grocery, alcohol, convenience stores to pharmacies and we are going to see a radical shift in how people think of last mile and hyperlocal. <br /><br />Tweetable Quotes: <br /><br />“I often compare the transition we're seeing in the F and B world moving to sort of a digital first world similar to how retail and e-commerce has transitioned in the last twenty years.” - Ken Chong<br /><br />“We think about a great digital first experience and ordering on the consumer side all the way down to whether it's a pickup or delivery experience on the other end.” - Ken Chong<br /><br />“I think that this is one of those win-win situations where the better we can build up that suite of analytics data access and toolset, the easier it is for restaurants to build and operate on top of this distributor restaurant platform.” - Ken Chong<br /><br />Industry veteran Paul Barron takes restaurant business to the next level. The restaurant industry isn’t just the business of food. It’s a cross-functional, multivariate entity that touches almost every industry — after all, everyone needs to eat. So, why not learn from the greats from all businesses? Connect the dots, read between the lines, build innovation strategies, become a thought leader, get the inside scoop on trends and open your eyes to full vision of restaurants and hospitality with The Barron Report. <br /><br />To keep listening to The Barron Report, check out the podcast on iTunes Now!",
