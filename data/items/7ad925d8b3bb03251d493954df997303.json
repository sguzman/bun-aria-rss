  "description": "What we see or hear may not always be what it seems. Often there are obscuring tricks of the light or ghostly whispers that sound like whistles on the wind. It comes down to the mind’s eye to believe in the stories that reveal horrors that can deceive. All of it hides behind the veil of a distorted reality. First, a harrowing tale based on the mythic internet video “Girldog.\" Next, a visitor’s facade falls when faced with their hunger. After that, a letter for the lady in the frame & a new tale of a demon on the wall. And finally, a message from beyond demands your attention.\nMake sure to check out the new podcast, Wild Wild Tech, available wherever you get your podcasts! https://bit.ly/WildWildTech\nLearn more about your ad choices.
