  "description": "<p>Food waste is one of the largest problems of our time. In fact, about 30% of all food produced globally (1.3 billion tons) is wasted—and it’s costing us. Food waste is also a major contributor to climate change; if food waste was represented as its own country it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter! In this minisode, Dr. Hyman dives into this topic and what we can do about it in our own homes with Kavita Shukla and Paul Hawken.</p><br><p>Kavita Shukla is the Founder and CEO of The FRESHGLOW Co. and the inventor of FreshPaper, a simple innovation taking on the massive global challenge of food waste by keeping food fresher, longer. FreshPaper is used by farmers and families across the globe, and The FRESHGLOW Co. has partnered with some of the largest retailers in the world, from Whole Foods to Walmart so that people everywhere can take advantage of this incredible product and the goodness of real food.</p><br><p>Paul Hawken is an environmentalist, entrepreneur, author, and activist who has dedicated his life to environmental sustainability and changing the relationship between business and the environment.
