  "description": "Si Robertson has a suave hat, a whole lot of energy, and a bunch of crazy stories about his college days. Si also shares his best fishing stories of all time, and they involve 2 fractured ribs, a 7-foot freshwater eel, and a 200-pound redfish. Martin has a theory on why Si's beard is shorter on one side, but Si has other ideas. John-David sports a new look. Phil, Jase, and Al left a big mess when they recorded \"Unashamed\" in the duck call room last week. Phillip makes Si a $100 bet about Si's favorite Bloody Mary mix. And Si drops the show's first \"that's what she said.\"   \n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
