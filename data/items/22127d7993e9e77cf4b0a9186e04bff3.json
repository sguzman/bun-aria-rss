  "description": "<p>This week Alice takes a break and Louise is joined by Rachel Davis for a chat about changes in both our art and our life, the courage required to make those changes, and the effect of gender on how we approach growth. In addition to her art career, Rachel has spent 30 years as a practicing psychologist . Now her pending retirement has thrown up questions about what to do next.&nbsp;Suddenly there is space and the opportunity for choice, and while these things are wonderful opportunities, they can also make us freeze. We share our personal experiences of change and choice and we talk about the idea of taking up space, something that can be particularly challenging for women.</p>\n<p>This free flowing discussion perhaps throws up more questions than answers, but we hope it is interesting, thought-provoking, and maybe even a little inspirational.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mentioned</p>\n<p>Find Rachel at <a href=\"\">https://www.racheldavisstudio.com/&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Find Alice and Louise at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
