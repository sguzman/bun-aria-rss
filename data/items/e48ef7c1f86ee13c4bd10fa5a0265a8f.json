  "description": "<p>The equation for canonical gravity produced by Wheeler and DeWitt in the late\n1960s still presents difficulties both in terms of its mathematical solution\nand its physical interpretation. One of these issues is, notoriously, the\nabsence of an explicit time. In this short note, we suggest one simple and\nstraightforward way to avoid this occurrence. We go back to the classical\nequation that inspired Wheeler and DeWitt (namely, the\nHamilton--Jacobi--Einstein equation) and make explicit, before quantization,\nthe presence of a known, classically meaningful notion of time. We do this by\nallowing Hamilton's principal function to be explicitly dependent on this time\nlocally. This choice results in a Wheeler--DeWitt equation with time. A working\nsolution for the de Sitter minisuperspace is shown.\n</p>",
