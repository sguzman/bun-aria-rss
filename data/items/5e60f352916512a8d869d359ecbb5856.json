  "description": "You can learn a lot about a person from their job. The same can be said of an economy. The market for jobs can us a lot about how the economy is doing, but more importantly, it is where we look to see who the economy is working for, and who is left behind. In today's lesson we'll visit two workplaces each facing a different labor puzzle. At one end, there's the question of when to replace a worker with a robot, and what it is like to be that worker waiting for the robots to come. We'll also visit a farm where raising wages aren't enough to attract the workers needed to do the work. How wages are set, and who gets the raises on this session of Summer School. | Subscribe to Planet Money+ in <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/290783428\">Apple Podcasts </a>or at <a href=\"http://plus.npr.org/planetmoney\">plus.npr.org/planetmoney</a>. |At <em>this </em>Summer School, phones ARE allowed during class...
