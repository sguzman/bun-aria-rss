  "description": "<p>For centuries, Japan was ruled by a military dictatorship, the Shogunate, and the samurais were the enforcers of this rule. The samurai was soldier, police officer, judge, jury, and executioner. He was the warrior that would rather die than bring dishonor to himself, his family, or his daimyo. His days and ways were highly ritualized. Molded by Buddhist, Confucian, and Shintoist philosophy, his sword was his soul and he carried it with him throughout his days and slept with it by his side throughout his nights.</p>\n<p>The samurai have a fascinating history and we explore it today, as well as the rise of the Japanese Shogunate, and the life of one of Japan's greatest warriors in this land of the rising sun edition, of Timesuck. </p>\n<p><strong>Timesuck is brought to you today by Eero! </strong>For free overnight shipping in the US or Canada, visit eero.com, select overnight as the shipping option, then enter TIMESUCK at checkout!</p>\n<p><strong>Merch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
