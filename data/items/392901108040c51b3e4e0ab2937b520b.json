  "description": "<div>This week, the gals get into exorcising (not the healthy kind). Topics include exorcism rituals from around the world, cool popes, an exceptionally unfortunate Romanian orphan, and why burying yourself alive is never wise. This week's episode is paired with Santa Elvira Pinot Grigio (we hear white wine a day keeps the demons at bay), so put down your torch, grab a bottle (and a rosary), and tune in.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
