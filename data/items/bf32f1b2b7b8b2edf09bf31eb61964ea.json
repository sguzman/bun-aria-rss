  "description": "<p>Barry Sonnenfeld was among Hollywood's most in-demand cinematographers (<em>Big</em>, <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>, <em>Misery</em>) when he decided to make the switch to directing in 1991. The producers were nervous, but the proof was in the pudding: Sonnenfeld's directorial debut was <em>The Addams Family</em>, one of the year's most successful comedies. From there, Sonnenfeld went on to direct <em>Get Shorty</em>, the <em>Men in Black</em> series, and some brilliant TV like <em>The Tick</em> and <em>A Series of Unfortunate Events</em>. Now he's written a memoir, <a href=\"https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/barry-sonnenfeld/barry-sonnenfeld-call-your-mother/9780316415613/\">Barry Sonnenfeld Call Your Mother</a>, in which he tells with humor and compassion the surprisingly harrowing story of his childhood -- and, of course, dishes on his colleagues in Hollywood. With Alec he goes beyond what's in the book about what went down on the sets of <em>Big</em>, <em>Misery</em>, <em>Wild Wild West</em> and <em>Men in Black</em>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
