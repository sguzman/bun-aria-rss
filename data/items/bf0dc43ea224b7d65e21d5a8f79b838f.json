The sisters also talk serial quarantine zoom dating, bad dates, and dating apps. And you’ll hear how they celebrated their dad’s 75th birthday. Plus, Sistine explains how she went from being painfully shy as a child to auditioning and landing a big role in Randall’s upcoming movie, “Midnight In The Switchgrass.” She also reveals how her dad found out about her acting gig, and who in her family is best at assisting her with auditions and running lines.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
