  "description": "<p>We tend to think we’re smart, rational beings, making good choices based on clear information. In truth, we’re anything but. We are pretty much walking, talking bundles of delusion and bias, much of it utterly hidden from our consciousness, by no one other than our subconscious. How do we get past this, how do we learn to see more clearly, not just what’s going on around us, but also within us? To help answer this question, today I’m sitting down with Julia Galef, author, podcaster, and speaker with a passion for good reasoning, and host of Rationally Speaking, a biweekly podcast featuring interviews with scientists and other thinkers, about everything from “Should the United States have open borders?” to “Has scientific progress slowed down?” to “What have you changed your mind about?” She’s also the author of an eye-opening new book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3D7AyjI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Scout Mindset</a>, which is a deep dive into the learnable skill of looking at things honestly and objectively — why that’s so valuable, why it doesn’t come naturally to humans, and how we can get better at it.</p><p>You can find Julia at: <a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juliagalef\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> |&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pod.link/351953012\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rationally Speaking podcast</a></p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode:</strong></p><p>You’ll also love the conversations we had with <a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/susan-david/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Susan David</a> about the role of emotions in how we think, feel and live.</p><br><p><strong>My new book is available for pre-order:</strong></p><p>Order <a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked: Discover Your Unique Imprint for Work that Makes You Come Alive</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and get your book bonuses!</p><br><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
