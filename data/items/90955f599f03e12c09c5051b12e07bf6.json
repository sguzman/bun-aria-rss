  "description": "Bitcoin dipped below $20,000 as overleveraged companies are going bust. We start today’s show by discussing the liquidation of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and its ripple effects… the flaws of MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor’s “all-in” Bitcoin strategy… and how the current crypto bear market reminds me of the dot-com crash.  Next, we discuss Morgan Stanley’s ridiculous call that Carnival Corp will go to zero… and I explain why I’m bullish on the cruise industry. In fact, my latest  recommendation is a Carnival competitor.  Finally, I highlight why Intel’s recent price action hints the markets could be near a bottom—and an important lesson from previous bear markets.  In this episode:  Overleveraged crypto companies are unraveling [1:55] MicroStrategy's “all-in” Bitcoin strategy is flawed [6:30] Could Bitcoin go to $250k next year? [10:50]  Why the crypto industry needs regulation [13:50] Big players are stepping up in this crypto bear market [18:14] Why Carnival Corp. won’t go to zero [25:51] Intel’s recent price action is positive for markets [34:05] Don’t make this common bear market mistake [35:40]  Enjoyed this episode?
