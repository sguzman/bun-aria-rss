  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Render we're doing things a little different. The guys are sitting around a campfire with James Lawrence (Hall of Fame Member), Gary Newcomb, Justin Michau and Gerald Brewer. They talk about Bear Newcomb's big bear and how they got it out of the woods. Clay goes into detail about his recent moose hunt, but not before James and Gerald talk about black panthers. Clay also tells about the bear he shot at three yards. It gets wild. They didn't get a chance to catch up on the final Holt Collier episode, but they plan to hit it on the next Render. </p>\n<p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p>\n<p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p>\n<p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
