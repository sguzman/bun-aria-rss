  "description": "Luka. Dončić. Need we say more? While watching him on the court often leaves us all wondering \"is there anything this guy doesn't do??\", there IS one thing that he hasn't done that much of at all. Interviews. Well, at least not like the kind you'll hear on this episode of the OM3. Luka joins JJ and Tommy for a sit down discussion and quickly shows us all that there is much more to him than just his incredible basketball skills. Displaying a sharp, sarcastic wit and humor, Dončić dives in to several topics, including the Mavs red-hot run over the last half of the season, his matchups with the game's other elite players, comparing NBA players to EuroLeague stars, his days of hooping for Real Madrid, and much more. It's a special discussion with someone you certainly don't hear a lot from so don't miss this one. But, that's not all. In fact there's much more that follows as new OM3 correspondent Alex Caruso joins the pod to catch us up on his injury, the Bulls march into the playoffs, and also participates in the Top 5/Draft, which focuses on the 'best March Madness plays that you would have liked to have witnessed in the arena'. So, bottom line, it's a power packed episode of the OM3.    \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
