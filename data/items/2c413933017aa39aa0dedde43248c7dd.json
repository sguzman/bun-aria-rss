  "description": "The Democrat legions are having more desertions. Joe Biden plays the blame game, saying things along the lines of: Republicans do nothing but obstruct our effort to lower your gas taxes, lower your food prices, lower your healthcare costs, lower your prescription drug costs. Nearly 60,000 unvaccinated US national guard troops could be penalized. Clay and Buck take calls from National Guard members who are going to be kicked out of service because they don't want to take a vaccine and boosters that don't work. Clay says, \"Reuters -- not exactly a Republican-favoring polling company -- announced that Joe Biden has equaled his all-time low in support. Thirty-six percent of Americans right now support Joe Biden. I actually believe that is likely too high.\" Inflation and the economy are the main reasons for the all-time low numbers, Reuters reports.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
