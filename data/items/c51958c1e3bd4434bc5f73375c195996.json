  "title": "Ep 104 | Dangerous Tech Oligarchs Who Answer to No One | Glenn Greenwald | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Have you noticed how the people who call everyone a conspiracy theorist are the biggest conspiracy theorists of all? Like the Russia Collusion conspiracy theory that the Washington elite used to discredit Trump and force him out of Washington, D.C. Or how the CIA is the real power center of American politics. Glenn Greenwald, Pulitzer-Prize-winning journalist and author of the new book, “Securing Democracy: My Fight for Press Freedom and Justice in Bolsonaro’s Brazil,” is an outsider in the media because he calls out these abuses of power. For one, he agrees that the Deep State is real. Greenwald is a rare breed these days: He does actual journalism. He explains things very well, like his description of Trump’s appeal and Obama’s mystique. \n\n﻿He and Glenn cover so many topics: Woke corporations, Julian Assange, the #MeToo movement, Putin, Snowden, The Constitution, Big Tech censorship. Why does the Left call Greenwald right-wing but the Right calls him left-wing? For a journalist, that used to be a badge of honor. But as Greenwald points out, the journalism industry has become a Woke priesthood. So, if you want to learn about actual journalism, listen to this episode. It’s totally worth getting through a couple of technical difficulties. \n \nSponsors:\n\nStaying healthy is tough, especially if you have a sweet tooth.\nFortunately, there’s Built Bars!
