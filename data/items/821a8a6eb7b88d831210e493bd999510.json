  "description": "<p>Love and Fear During Times of War: An Interview with Lama Rod Owens (2020-07-22) - This is a time of darkness and war. Fear lies at the heart of much of the violence we are experiencing. How do we befriend our fear and offer it permission to teach us how to move through it into a state of freedom? How do we use our fear to connect to the fear so many other people are experiencing? Ultimately, how do we begin to love what is unlovable, especially our fear?<br /> We will call on the teachings of Buddhadharma as well as our own intrinsic wisdom to lean into our fear with love.</p>",
