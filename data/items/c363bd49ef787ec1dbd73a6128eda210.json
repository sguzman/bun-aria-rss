  "description": "<p>Most people assume the lore of vampires that originated in Europe, stayed in that area, but there was a time when America was embroiled in the middle of a vampire craze in New England. It was the 1800s and the dreaded consumption was wreaking havoc. Many families lost several of their members. One of those families was the Brown family. It was the death of one of their daughters that started the Legend of Mercy Brown. Were there really vampires in America and was Mercy one of them? Join us as we investigate the history of this craze and a young woman named Mercy Brown. The Moment in Oddity features the Legend of Catherine's Hill and This Day in History features the Charge of the Light Brigade.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Get your History Goes Bump gear for winter:  <a href= \"https://shop.spreadshirt.com/HistoryGoesBump/\">https://shop.spreadshirt.com/HistoryGoesBump/</a></p> <p>Show notes: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/10/hgb-podcast-ep-78-legend-of-mercy-brown.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/10/hgb-podcast-ep-78-legend-of-mercy-brown.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p>",
