  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Israeli Ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer calls in to discuss the horrific fatal shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, PA.  The media in our Country and their progressive groupthink are absolutely disgusting, pushing their agenda within hours. It's sickening that the media is blaming the mass murder of American Jews by a sub-human killer  on rhetoric instead of on the killers hateful actions. Shame on them!  For eight years the U.S. was, in effect, at war as President Obama's Administration treated Jews, the nation of Israel , and its Prime Minister with utter contempt.  The Obama Administration armed Israel's enemy with a millions in cash as part of the Iran Nuclear Deal. President Trump however, has been a friend to Israel. In fact, the sick synagogue shooter made statements that Trump was too friendly with the Jews and had too many around. Yet the media will have you believe that the 11 precious human beings that were killed because of Trump. There were 14 mass murders during Obama's tenure did any mass media outlet blame his rhetoric for those killings? While Trump hasn't prosecuted journalists like Obama did, he does push back on the media calling them out by name. They're simply trying to bring down this Administration because they believe they are a power unto themselves.   When was the last time Don Lemon, Jim Acosta, Rachel Maddow or Andrea Mitchell did a story on Anti Semites like Louis Farrakhan, whom they hold up as legitimate. Why don't they get to the bottom of all that anti-semitism? Afterwards, US Senate candidates Josh Hawley (R-WI) and Matt Rosendale (R-MT) call in to discuss their respective races.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
