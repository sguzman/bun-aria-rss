  "description": "Glenn sits down to have a conversation with Dave Rubin who is a free-thinking classical liberal and hosts The Rubin Report. Coming from a left-leaning progressive background, Dave shares how he ultimately became fed up with the mainstream media narrative and popularity of click-bait news. Dave also shares how a person shouldn’t concern themselves with choosing a side but rather embracing their status as an individual. Glenn and Dave also explore how the modern left has lost its way to political correctness and groupthink at a dangerous level which has greatly distracted from the original American dream of the pursuit of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
