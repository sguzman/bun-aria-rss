But when it comes to sex, we really can be our own worst enemies: what if my new partner sees me naked, and decides to jet? What if I try out some dirty talk, and my partner laughs at me? What if I approach someone cute…and they say ‘no thank you’?</p><br><p>Fear can be crippling to our sex drive – but it can also be digested and processed. To do that, we can check the facts, we can remember that most things aren’t personal, and we can talk about our fears out loud. (Meditation helps too!) So on today’s best of episode, I’m talking to you all about YOUR sex fears: period sex, sharing a fetish with a new partner, old traumas, fear that you’ll never get over an ex, and much more to help you live YOUR most free, sexually healthy life.</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/the-secret-to-better-sex-talking-about-it/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Secret to Better Sex?
