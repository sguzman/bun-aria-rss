Our versions of reality seem to fall in line with the narrative and stories we constantly remind ourselves of, but the truth is, we’ve constructed a reality shaped and influenced by emotions that were never truthful from the beginning. Robert Greene, just released another book, The Daily Laws, and he joins Tom in this episode to share his profound wisdom and understanding of human nature. He beautifully peels back the layers of complexity around how we are able to perceive the world around us and the way in which we fit into our own stories.
