At 22, he received the Dean's Fellowship from the Master's Writing Program at Columbia University. Upon receipt of his expensive MFA, he promptly moved into a Toyota minivan to tour the country nonstop as a singer-songwriter, often sharing the stage with comedians like Doug Stanhope and musical acts like&nbsp;The Strokes&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Yeah Yeah Yeahs.</p><p>But mostly he drank.</p><p>It sounds glamorous. It wasn't. At 32, Mishka hit bottom, got sober and laced up a pair of running shoes.
