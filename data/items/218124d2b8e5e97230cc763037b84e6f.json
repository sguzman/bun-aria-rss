  "description": "<p>On today's show, Foxy sends some pretty serious accusations regarding the March Sadness bracket towards Nick and Ty, the guys go through some additional info about Joe Exotic and the rest of the cast and characters from Tiger King which leads them to have some differing opinions on the men involved, and the guys get into a Digs Debate about how many miles they could move in one day without having transportation or wheels of any kind, which evolves into Digs agreeing to try and walk on a treadmill for 45 miles next week in order to potentially win some cash and send some to charity. Does he have any chance? Probably not, but we'll find out. Enjoy.</p>\n",
