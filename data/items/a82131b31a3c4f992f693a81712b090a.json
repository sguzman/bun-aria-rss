  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the government doesn't have the power to cancel Thanksgiving or Christmas; they were never intended to have this power. Government doesn’t have a right to tell you not to assemble. The Pollyanna’s who can't see how President Trump wins this election - they are missing the point - this is about defending the American republic - not about politics. Then, as our history teaches, the Stamp Act, the Boston Massacre, and the Boston Tea Party are all examples of the British imposing tyranny upon the Americans. This sounds eerily similar to all of the edicts that Democrat governors are demanding as of late. Later, esteemed Attorney, and Trump Legal Team member, Lin Wood calls in to discuss his lawsuit against the State of Georgia challenging a consent agreement that was entered in by the State's Secretary of State and the law firm Perkins Coie which has previously represented Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democrat Party. Wood is filing a motion to stop the sham recount that's currently occurring. Wood says that the law is clear and that this election was stolen from President Trump. This is a coup disguised as an election and both Democrats and Republicans are complicit in it.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
