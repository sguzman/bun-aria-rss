    "media:description": "Lots of detail in a second video, but I've spent the last few weeks since the eclipse trying to process my timelapse into the most realistic view I could. In reality when you look up at a half-eclipsed moon, you can totally see that part of it already looks red, but if you just take a picture with one camera, the dynamic range is nowhere near where it would need to be to actually see what your eye does - so I fudged it - using two cameras and combining both clips in post. Hope you enjoy!\n\nFull video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R-iMmcQ5aI",
