  "description": "<p>ROUND 1 (12:25): The Marine Corps sent a group of special packages to the wrong address & the recipient was shocked to find… URINE. Sounds like a leader at 11th Marines Regiment might be a little PISSED off when they realize a full day’s worth of pee tests is wasted.\n\nROUND 2 (27:50): On a recent episode we talked about Congressman Adam Kinzinger’s family beefing with him over politics, but honey, that’s got nothing on Hitler’s nephew who went & blackmailed him & then joined the US Navy… Historical Drrrr-amaaaa!\n\nROUND 3 (37:51): Spring is fast approachin’ and with it, plans for... an Air Force C-130 raid near Salt Lake City? Kate: Whoa, what’s the buzzzzzzzzzzz about that? Chaps: Well I’m itchin’ to tell ya & the answer won’t bug you if you hate mosquitos, that’s for sure ::hearty, cornball laughs::\n\nROUND 4 (46:13): Military ‘Snapple Cap Facts’ that you can spout off at the bar. It’ll impress folks almost as much as slapping down a shiny, new challenge coin!!!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
