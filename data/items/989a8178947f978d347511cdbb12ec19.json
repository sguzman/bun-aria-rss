  "description": "<p>Mark Cole said it himself – this is one of our best episodes yet! We’re making John Maxwell Leadership Podcast history this week for two reasons: 1) We recorded this episode in front of a live audience, and 2) John Maxwell and Mark Cole sat down to discuss leadership with Marcus Buckingham!</p> <p>If you’re not familiar with Marcus Buckingham, he is the author of two of the best-selling business books of all time, has two Harvard Business Review’s most circulated, industry-changing cover articles, and has been the subject of an in-depth profile in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Forbes, Fortune, Fast Company, The Today Show, and The Oprah Winfrey Show. But most of you may know him from his work with Gallup’s StrengthsFinder tool, which has impacted and equipped countless lives and leaders around the world.</p> <p>In this episode, John and Marcus discuss their definitions of strengths and weaknesses, bust common leadership myths, and Marcus discusses his new book <em>Nine Lies About Work</em>. We say this all the time… “You don’t want to miss this episode.” But, listeners, you <em>really</em> don’t want to miss this episode.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the fill-in-the-blank notes from this conversation.
