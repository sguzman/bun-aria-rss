  "description": "<p>Today's episode serves as an epilogue to the series on Biblical etymology. Secular means ‘unaffiliated with religion,’ but originally, it was a word used to describe the measurement of long spans of time. Roughly equivalent to a century, the <em>saeculum</em>, as it was known in Ancient Rome, was celebrated with pagan rituals (ironic), theater, and games. Over the course of the episode, we trace the development of the <em>saeculum</em> from antiquity to the 19th century philosophical movement of secularism.  </p>",
