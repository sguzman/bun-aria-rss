  "description": "<p>Look back at your life over the last several months. What did you accomplish? Did you stick to the resolutions you made back in January?  Did you actually do the things that you planned to do or did you just talk about it? If you're looking for a reason to put off changing your situation and pursuing your best possible life, you'll always find one. Don't wait until New Year's to make a resolution. Make the resolution now--and act now. </p>",
