  "description": "In a brilliant bit of turnabout, John McCain's last act was to use his own funeral to bury Donald Trump.  By excluding him from the ceremonies and featuring leaders of both parties extolling values and virtues alien to Trump, McCain made an eloquent point. But will it have any lasting impact? Within just a couple of days the President was back Tweeting, his Supreme Court nominee was being rammed into office and a new book by Bob Woodward was dominating the headlines with new revelations of the president's unfitness to serve.  Join our panelists David Frum of the Atlantic, author of Trumpocracy, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University School of Law and Ed Luce of the Financial Times as they discuss a tumultuous few days in the nation's capital.
