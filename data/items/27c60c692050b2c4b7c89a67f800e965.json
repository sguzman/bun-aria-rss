  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the media is focused on Jussie Smollett being found guilty on five out of six charges for staging his own hate crime instead of focusing on how President Biden is about to give away a piece of Ukraine. Should Smollett be charged with extra time for committing a hate crime against himself? America deserves an honest discussion on race in America, but Joy Reid, \"The View,\" \"Good Morning America\" and others don't want to have that conversation. The left within the media would just rather call it racist, blame our country, and move on. Then, Biden is infuriating America's Eastern European allies over his weak rhetoric on Russia's aggression toward annexing Ukraine. Allies reject the notion that Russia should have any say on who joins NATO. Jen Psaki even went as far as saying that whether Russia invades Ukraine is entirely up to Putin, essentially abdicating the U.S's role and giving the green light to Putin. Later, a federal appeals court decided that Biden will have the final say on former President Trump's executive privilege and will likely make its way to the Supreme Court. Democrats in the House want to obliterate executive privilege so they can have their political way. They don't care about the Constitution as long as they can stop Trump in the future. This happens because the Democrat Party controls all branches, packed the court during the Obama years, and is only interested in political power, not in the people. Afterward, Adam Carolla calls in to discuss his new show \"The Daily Yeller\" on the \"Daily Wire\" and how a close-knit group of newspaper owners, a small minority, agree to see things as racially oppressed while a large silent majority of Americans see things as they really are as a meritocracy of hard-working Americans. Finally, Brent Bozell joins the show to discuss his new book, \"Stops Along the Way: A Catholic Soul, a Conservative Heart, an Irish Temper, and a Love of Life.\"\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Stops-Along-Way-Catholic-Conservative/dp/1642939242/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=brent+bozell&qid=1638916874&sr=8-1\nLearn more about your ad choices.
