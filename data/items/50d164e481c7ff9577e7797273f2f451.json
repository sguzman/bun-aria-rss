  "description": "Beto O'Rourke says that mothers decide the worth and value of their unborn children. We'll talk about how that sort of attitude leads directly to eugenics and genocide. Also, Ilhan Omar allegedly had an affair with a married man. We're told this is a personal matter and not relevant to voters. I disagree and I'll explain why. Finally, a woman babbles incoherently in front of a giant jiggling butt at the VMAs. Kamala Harris calls the performance powerful. I have a different description.
