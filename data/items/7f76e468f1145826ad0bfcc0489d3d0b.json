  "description": "<p>On today's episode, Jason and Producer Rob G kick things off with a quick homage to Steph Curry on the heels of his record-setting performance at the 2022 NBA All-Star Game. Following what many described as a snoozer on All-Star Saturday night, Curry came in and saved the weekend behind a barrage of three pointers. In fact, our fearless leader is ready to declare Steph's big night as the greatest All-Star Game performance since Magic Johnson in 1992. That's some legendary company right there. Later, the guys react to the news that LeBron James is already planning his exit from the Los Angeles Lakers in 2-3 years so that he can play his final NBA season with his son, Bronny. If you've been paying attention at all the past few years it's been pretty obvious that this was LeBron's plan all along, but it still has to be a little jarring if you're a Lakers fan. What's more, with reports circulating that LeBron and Klutch Sports are frustrated with the Lakers front office stemming from their inactivity at the trade deadline, it's becoming even more clear that The King is already planning his exit. Finally, the guys close the show with a few thoughts on Juwan Howard's infamous slap of a Wisconsin assistant basketball coach on Sunday. While neither one is calling for Howard to lose his job over it, it puts a black eye on the program and should absolutely lead to a lengthy suspension; Howard show know better.</p><p>Click <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/straight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre/id1523353907\">here</a> to subscribe, rate and review all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
