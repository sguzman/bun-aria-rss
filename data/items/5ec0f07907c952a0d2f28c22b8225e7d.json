  "title": "PMS 2.0 130 - College Football Playoff Committee Bullshit... & Some Good Conversation",
  "description": "<p>Today's show comes from an ice cold box truck in Pittsburgh, PA as Pat and the boys battle the elements and try to stay warm. Pat breaks down the College Football Playoff rankings that were just released, and he is not pleased with how things are shaking out as Minnesota is still on the outset of the top 6 despite making the biggest jump in the history of the rankings, but Pat has a simple message for the committee. Also joining the show is the all-time leading rusher at Florida State, and current NFL rushing leader, Dalvin Cook. He tells Pat what the secret to his success so far has been, why the Vikings offensive line has been so successful this year, what happened in the locker room in order to turn everything around after the issues that plagued the locker room earlier in the season, and Dalvin gives his thoughts on Deion Sanders potentially being the next Head Coach for Florida State and whether or not he thinks that will result in a return to dominance (19:59-27:42). Also joining the show is 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, 2018 Built Ford Tough Lineman of the Year, LA Rams left tackle, Andrew Whitworth. He breaks down why he thinks LSU has been successful this year and what he thinks of Coach O, the issues with the Rams this year and why he thinks they can turn things around once Todd Gurley is worked back into the offense, how he builds trust with lineman who haven't been in the league for very long and are constantly changing, and what his plans are after retirement (27:45-35:55). Pat also dives into the Colin Kaepernick situation and what he thinks will come from it and reminds us that regardless of how people feel about the situation, it's the NFL's sandbox and ultimately their decision. Pat also chats about Elton John and the film Rocketman ahead the concert, the Astros being in hot water over taping signs during their 2017 championship run, and some other things that are happening right now in the world.
