  "description": "A warning to all investors: “Cancel culture” is attacking Wall Street.   Nowadays, public opinion changes with the tide… and smart investors know to separate themselves from negativity and stick to their convictions. [00:30]   While most goldbugs are negative about anything but gold… Ed Karr, executive chairman of U.S. Gold Corp, is a fan of both the yellow metal and bitcoin. He shares his thoughts on bitcoin’s bull run… what’s behind the pullback in gold prices… and why he’s bullish on both assets long-term. [19:40]   Then, Daniel and I discuss the latest stimulus bill… why the market is rallying… and some ideas we like right now. I explain why interest rates won’t crash this market… and share a newly public stock I believe will hit $100 billion in valuation.
