  "description": "Despite his historic losing streak in the courts (not to mention his big election loss), Donald Trump continues to argue he was robbed. And many in his own party are supporting Trump's arguments and his baseless conspiracy theories. In fact the vast majority of Republicans now believe what is a complete fairy tale from a president who, whether he likes it or not, has just a few short weeks left in office. What is the significance of this extraordinary GOP unity around what amounts to nothing less than a coup attempt, an effort to disenfranchise millions of American voters simply because they did not support Trump. We discuss with NYU Law School's Ryan Goodman and former FBI special agent and senior lecturer at Yale's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs Asha Rangappa. Don't miss it.Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio.
