There’s no one who has shaped my own thinking about drugs so much as Andrew Weil.

There are, Andy explains, infinite ways of altering consciousness. Psychoactive drugs can show us possibilities, but how we foster those possibilities is up to us.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to this episode and let me know what you think. Our number is 1-833-779-2460.
