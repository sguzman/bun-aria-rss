  "description": "Duane Jethro’s Heritage Formation and the Senses in Post-Apartheid South Africa: Aesthetics of Power (Bloomsbury, 2020) is a terrific book. In it, Jethro develops a novel analytical framework to understand the relationship between the senses (taste, smell, sight, hearing and touch) and heritage formation.

Jethro’s interdisciplinary study makes an important contribution to sensory studies, memory studies and the material turn in the humanities and social sciences.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
