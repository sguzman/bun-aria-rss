  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, it's amazing as the country listens to Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Dr. Anthony Fauci as they share their plans to remake the world — from the air we breathe to the way we vote. They claim to care about people and businesses but their actions say otherwise. This is legislative terrorism! Fauci is a bureaucrat that knows more than he lets on. Then, cities like Portland, OR, and Seattle, WA are predominantly White in their demography with protesters averaging the age of 28 years old. This further proves that White liberals are the main agitators in these protests. Later, US Senate candidate, Dr. Manny Sethi (R-TN) calls in to discuss the smear campaign that his RINO opponent is running against his family. Sethi noted that other RINOS like Mitt Romney and Mitch McConnell have endorsed his opponent. Sethi has the endorsement of Mark Levin, Sen. Ted Cruz, former Sen. Jim DeMint, and Sen.Rand Paul. Afterward, the President is right; mail-in voting is detrimental and can jeopardize the integrity of our electoral system. In-person voting and qualified absentee ballots should be the only methods allowed for casting ballots.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
