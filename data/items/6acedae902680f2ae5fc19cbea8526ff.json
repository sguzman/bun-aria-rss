We don't know what to expect from Michael Thomas. We'll try to hash it out on today's show! We start with some key stats (3:50) for some of these players who are tough to project. We're talking Saquon Barkley's inefficiency, Tim Patrick's red zone role and Michael Thomas without Drew Brees ... Will Juju Smith-Schuster get back to his old self now that he is on the Chiefs (15:15)? Which team's passing game is tougher to project: Denver or San Francisco (24:15)? Does it make the most sense to just wait for Tim Patrick if you want a piece of this passing game? And how the heck are you supposed to come up with projections for Michael Thomas after missing basically a year and a half (33:15)? ... We debate Saquon Barkley (38:40) and Ezekiel Elliott (43:30). Jamey tells you why he's waiting for Tony Pollard and skipping Zeke for the most part ...
