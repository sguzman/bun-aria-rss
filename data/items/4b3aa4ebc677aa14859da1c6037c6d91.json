  "description": "<p>Today on the show I sit down with my ultra running friend Josh Spector to talk all things Badwater.&nbsp;Widely accepted as the “World's Toughest Foot Race”, Badwater is a 135 mile running race across Death Valley — the hottest place on Earth, where temperatures average 120+ in July and can reach as high as 130 F with pavements temps typically in the 170-180 degree F range.</p><p>Starting at Badwater Basin — the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below sea level, approxmately 100 invitation-only runners from across the globe begin a jaunt that will take them across bleak and scorching desert terrain as well as three formidable mountain passes, including the culminating 13-mile ascent up the portals of Mt. Whitney — the highest peak in the lower 48 — to finish at 8,300 feet.</p><p>Yeah – it's that insane.</p><p>I had the honor & privilege of being a member of Dean Karnazes' crew this year, along with Jason Koop, Brandon Friese and Nathan Peerbolt.&nbsp;Together we paced, fed, hydrated and generally did all we could to help Dean complete this unbelievable race for the 10th time.&nbsp;It was an extraordinary experience — one I won't soon forget.</p><p>Simultaneously, Josh — himself an accomplished ultra runner with three 100-milers under his belt — returned to Badwater for his third crewing experience, this time for runner Ray Sanchez.</p><p>In this episode we swap stories about the experience, giving the listener a rare peek at exactly what it's like to have a front row seat at what I have to say is one of the most incredible displays of the indomitable nature of the human spirit I have ever seen — and will likely ever see.</p><p>Enjoy the show.</p><p>To view a Flikr photo gallery of the journey click <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/56695270@N03/sets/72157634723690042/\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>– most images by Nathan Peerbolt with a few by Brandon Friese.&nbsp;I took the GoPro pics.</p><p>UPDATE!&nbsp;We are now up and running on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/richroll\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a>.&nbsp;What's Soundcloud?
