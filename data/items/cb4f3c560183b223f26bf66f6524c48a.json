We discuss if we think it's awkward for a guy to ask another guy where he got his clothes from and if Eddy ever found out where the jeans are from. Plus, Bobby discovered a new song from Megan Moroney called \"Tennessee Orange\" that he liked so much; he interviewed her to hear all about the backstory of the song, how her Georgia Bulldog Alum feel about it and the reaction she got from her parents when they first heard it. Bobby shares a sad update about his dog, Stanley The Bulldog, and the dilemma he now faces.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
