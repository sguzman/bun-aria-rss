A member of the AIA, he has been practicing architecture for more than 35 years, most of that time focused on his core passion, residential work. </p><p>Born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, Will graduated from the University of Houston with a Bachelors degree in Architecture in 1982. From there he moved to San Francisco before discovering Peaks Island, off the coast of Portland, in the mid 1980’s. It has been his home ever since.</p><p> Will spent two decades working in Portland offices during which time he found that working with residential clients offered the connection essential for him to feel deeply engaged. In the spring of 2007 Will established Winkelman Architecture to further that pursuit. A founding ideal of the practice was to keep it small, limiting the staff count to 10 or less, with the goal of keeping his hand collaboratively engaged in the design conversation and details of the office’s flow of projects. </p><p>More from Will Winkelman: </p><p>Website: http://www.winkarch.com/ </p><p>More from us: </p><p>Website: http://www.trentbell.com </p><p>Instagram: http://instagram.com/trentbellphotography/</p>\n",
