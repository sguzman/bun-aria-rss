  "description": "<p>What even *is* a jellyfish?! How do they eat? What are they made of? Can we eat them? Your new favorite Medusologist, Dr. Rebecca Helm, is a ray of human sunshine in the depths of the deep sea. Truly one of the finest biology conversations you may ever hear. Get ready for PacMan ghosts, pet jellyfish, the biggest and smallest jellies, new band names, live medusas, secret formulas to incite jellyfish puberty, and the lengths that she will go to to see a jelly bloom. And next week, your ears will fill with Toxinology as we explore jellyfish VENOM. Duck into the Polyp Parlor; this is a duo not to be missed. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rebeccarhelm.com/\">Dr. Rebecca Helm’s</a> Jellyfish Blog and website: <a href=\"https://jellybiologist.com/\">https://jellybiologist.com/</a></p>\n<p>Follow her at<a href=\"http://twitter.com/rebeccarhelm\"> Twitter.com/rebeccarhelm</a> or<a href=\"http://twitter.com/rebeccarhelm\"> twitter.com/rebeccarhelm</a></p>\n<p>A donation went to The Vancouver Aquarium: <a href=\"https://www.vanaqua.org/visit/live-cams-jelly-cam\">www.vanaqua.org</a></p>\n<p>Look at their Jelly Cam! <a href=\"https://www.vanaqua.org/visit/live-cams-jelly-cam\">https://www.vanaqua.org/visit/live-cams-jelly-cam</a></p>\n<p>Sponsor links:<a href=\"http://kiwico.com/ologies\"> kiwico.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p>For more links:<a href=\"http://alieward.com/ologies/medusology\"> alieward.com/ologies/medusology</a></p>\n<p>Transcripts & bleeped episodes at:<a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-extras\"> alieward.com/ologies-extras</a></p>\n<p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month:<a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\"> www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ologiesmerch.com/\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes and uh...bikinis?
