  "description": "Self-discipline is a much more reliable predictor of one’s future success than an IQ score. There are a lot of smart people. They score highly on tests, their comprehension is off the charts, and they always do well in school. But there aren’t a lot of disciplined people. They can’t make or keep commitments; they allow things to distract them when they need to be doing something else. Most importantly, that inability to discipline themselves keeps them from accomplishing their dreams and goals.
