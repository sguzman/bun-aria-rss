  "description": "<p>Scot and Jeff discuss the third part of Neil Young’s career (1980–2021) with Jeff Dufour.</p>\n<p><b>Introducing the Band:</b><br />\n Your hosts Scot Bertram (<a href=\"https://twitter/ScotBertram\" target=\"_blank\">@ScotBertram</a>) and Jeff Blehar (<a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/EsotericCD\" target=\"_blank\">@EsotericCD</a>) are joined by guest Jeff Dufour. Jeff is the editor in chief of <i><a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/\" target=\"_blank\">National Journal</a></i>. Find him on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dcdufour\" target=\"_blank\">@dcdufour</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Jeff’s Music Pick: Neil Young (Part 3)</b><br />\nIf you need a podcast to sample and hold or feel rockin’ in the free world, then settle in and prepare to devote a full four hours of your life to the gang’s account of the final (to date) 41 years of Neil Young’s career, from the dawn of the ’80s and the Reagan Era all the way to the present day. Thirty-eight albums! And somehow we manage to discuss a full thirty-four of them in depth. This is the period where Neil started zooming all over the map stylistically, from trad country music to synthpop to rockabilly to horn-soaked nightclub blues to just good old-fashioned Neil Young-style hard rock and folk. These 40 years had incredible highs and legendary lows, but we’re here to explain to you why it all makes much more sense than it might have seemed at the time, and why so many of these albums are actually hidden gems. (<i>Trans</i>, my friend. <i>Trans</i>.) Buckle up as we drive you through one of the more remarkable musical journeys in rock history.</p>\n",
