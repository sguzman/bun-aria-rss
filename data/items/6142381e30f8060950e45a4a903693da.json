Also Five Headlines including the trial of Derek Chauvin gets underway, Joe Biden says it’s our patriotic duty to wear masks, and the CDC director has an emotional breakdown on TV. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the teacher who is caught on video trying to racially brainwash a student. The video is disturbing but important. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
