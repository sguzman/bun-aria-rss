Next, they kibitz about the future of Jameis Winston (32:15) and if Patriots fans would root for Tom Brady and the Bucs over their own team in a Super Bowl (42:18)? The guys wrap up the show with a sports 'what if' question surrounding Michael Jordan (57:15).</p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
