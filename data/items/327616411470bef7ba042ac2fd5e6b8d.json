He has taught at universities for over 40 years and designed every type of structure conceivable, his sustainability credentials extend way beyond the ordinary, and he is much more than just a designer of things; he's a chronicler of the changing mood of Australian architecture and its many iterations over the years. \nIn this podcast, Tone Wheeler discusses the ‘Sydney School’ of architecture, about architecture needing purpose and place, localisation, sustainability and the growing population, robots, and the need to ‘slow it down’.",
