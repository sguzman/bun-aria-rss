  "description": "<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #29</strong>, my guest is <strong>Marc Allen</strong>, the internationally renowned author and president/publisher/co-founder of <strong>New World Library, </strong>which has published numerous classics in the personal growth field including Eckhart Tolle's <em>The Power of Now</em>, Shakti Gawain’s <em>Creative Visualization</em>, and <em>The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success</em> by Deepak Chopra.</p>\n<p>Marc joins me for a deep and inspirational conversation about the updated edition of <strong>Tantra for the West: A Direct Path to Living the Life of Your Dreams</strong>, in which he introduces a brand new way to experience the ancient and yet modern tradition that is called tantra.</p>\n<p>About: <strong>Marc Allen</strong> is an internationally renowned author and president and publisher of New World Library, which he co-founded (with Shakti Gawain) in 1977. He has guided the company from a small start-up with no capital to its current position as one of the leading independent publishers in the country.</p>\n<p>Marc is a well-known musician and composer as well, having released five albums of his music for the label he co-founded with Sky Canyon and Robert Powell, Watercourse Media.</p>\n<p>His latest book is The Greatest Secret of All. It may be Marc's most important book, because it gives us not only one of the clearest explanations of the \"secret\" of creating what you want in life, but also the far greater secrets of a life well-lived, a life of happiness, inner peace, ease, and fulfillment, where you contribute to making the world a better place for all.</p>\n<p>His previous book, The Type-Z Guide to Success, has been released both in print form and as an innovative multi-media ebook. His most popular book is The Millionaire Course: A Visionary Plan for Creating the Life of Your Dreams. It is an entire course, filled with keys to success.</p>\n<p>Over the years, he has written and published several other books, including Visionary Business: An Entrepreneur’s Guide to Success, which brought his principles to those in the business world, and A Visionary Life, which remains one of the best books ever written on personal fulfillment. He has also published The Ten Percent Solution: Simple Steps to Improve Our Lives and the World, and produced a popular audio CD, Stress Reduction and Creative Meditations.</p>\n<p>His books, audios, and workshops have been highly rewarding — even life-changing — experiences for thousands of people, and he has produced a 12-part audio version of his powerful seminar called The Success with Ease In-Depth Course.</p>\n<p>He lives in northern California, with his wife and two children. Marc and his wife Aurilene have founded the Brazil Hope Foundation to help street kids in Brazil.</p>\n<p>To learn more about <strong>Marc</strong> and his work, visit: <a href=\"http://marcallen.com\">http://marcallen.com</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>",
