  "title": "Ep 108 | Haley to GOP: Quit Playing Nice & Double Down on Trump's Policies | Nikki Haley | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "As the Biden administration forces everything from education to the military to go woke, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has a warning: We’re distracted. And when we’re distracted, bad things happen — violence in Israel, a cyberattack on a major pipeline, and perhaps worst of all, China smells blood in the water. But what is the Republican Party doing to offer actual leadership and solutions? Haley joins Glenn to argue that Republicans are just too “nice” — and they could learn a thing or two from President Trump’s policies. Haley explains to Glenn her solutions to our nation’s biggest problems — racial tensions, critical race theory, election integrity, foreign policy, and fixing the broken spirit of America. And in many cases, she’s already proven that these solutions WORK. “We need leadership,” says Haley. “It’s time for America to decide: What kind of leader do we want to be?” \n \nSponsors:\n\nYou didn’t start your business because you wanted to spend time on HR compliance.
