  "description": "<p><a href=\"http://www.benhorton.biz/\">Ben Horton's</a> passion is to use photography as a means to inspire people to take stewardship of the planet. He aims to give people who may not be able to see something for themselves a vicarious experience through his images that will instill a passion in them they would never have otherwise. Ben started his career with National Geographic by telling the story of the sharks of Cocos Island. He traced the illegal fishing industry from Costa Rica to China, and as a result of his work helped to increase the park boundaries and protection of two of Costa Rica’s national parks. He was awarded the National Geographic Society’s first ever Young Explorer Grant for his work, and he has since moved on to receive a number of other National Geographic grants, assignments, and recently stared in a documentary for National Geographic featuring his work in Thailand. Ben is based in southern California, where he works primarily on adventure campaigns</p> <p>Ben's <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/benhortonphoto/\">Instagram</a>.
