Well I’m here to tell you today that fasting falls into the first category, with plenty of proven benefits to optimize health and slow the symptoms of aging. Fasting also does more than change the physical body. It’s estimated that 30% of our thoughts are about our next meal. That’s a lot of time and energy wrapped up in food, and fasting can help us regain control of ourselves, our minds, and so much more.&nbsp;</p><br><p>On today’s episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, I’m thrilled to sit down with my good friend and an expert on fasting, Dave Asprey. Dave is the founder and Chairman of Bulletproof 360, a high-performance coffee and food company, and creator of the widely-popular Bulletproof Coffee. He is a three-time <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, host of the Webby award-winning podcast <em>Bulletproof Radio</em>, and has been featured on the <em>Today </em>show, Fox News, <em>Nightline</em>, CNN, and dozens more. Over the last two decades Dave, the “Father of Biohacking”, has worked with world-renowned doctors, researchers, scientists and global mavericks to uncover the latest, most innovative methods, techniques, and products for enhancing mental and physical performance.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Paleovalley, Athletic Greens, and Cozy Earth.</p><br><p>Paleovalley is offering 15% off your entire first order.
