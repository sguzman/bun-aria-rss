  "description": "<p>Milo Yiannopoulos came over to my apartment to have one of my favorite talks ever on this podcast. It's a talk about trolling. Milo is one of the best in the world at it. This is gonna take you a week to listen to. The intro goes for 57 minutes alone. You can skip it if you want, but it's 53 minutes of content that you'll be missing about my own start in trolling. Trolls are the most maligned and misunderstood of all the world's artist. And I don't use the term \"artist\" lightly. Trolling is an art form. I've been looking forward to this episode for months now. And you're going to love it or ABSOLUTELY HATE IT. I hope you're the former. But if you're the latter, then we got you. You've been trolled. pWn3d.</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Tour Dates</strong></span></p> <p>Nashville - Oct 17-19</p> <p>San Jose - Nov 7-9</p> <p>Chicago - Nov 16</p> <p>tix at www.arithegreat.com</p>",
