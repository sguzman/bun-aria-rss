  "description": "<p>Sometimes God's protection comes in packages that don't feel like protection.<br> <br> The Bible says Jesus has overcome the world. But what about when it doesn't feel like it right now, in this situation? On this episode of the podcast, Lysa TerKeurst and Dr. Joel Muddamalle will walk through places in Scripture that show us the unlikely places where Jesus' protection is actually present. We'll learn that just because we can't see what God is doing, does not mean He is not working. Just because we feel afraid, does not mean we have to live afraid. We just have to train our eyes and ears to where Jesus is present in our lives today so we can find comfort in Him no matter the circumstances.</p><p>Related Resources:</p><p><strong>All donations made from November 29-December 8 will be doubled!</strong> For the days when everything feels like too much … <strong>Proverbs 31 Ministries meets you with biblical Truth and encouragement in the moments you feel most overwhelmed.</strong> When you donate to Proverbs 31 Ministries you are helping us continue to offer the biblical resources you need to help you through your hard moments. <a href=\"https://donate.proverbs31.org/give?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=show-notes&utm_campaign=YE21\"><strong>Donate today!</strong></a><strong><br></strong><br> Our next ministry-wide Bible study is starting January 10!
