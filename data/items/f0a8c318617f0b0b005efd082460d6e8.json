  "description": "<p>Program synthesis or code generation aims to generate a program that\nsatisfies a problem specification. Recent approaches using large-scale\npretrained language models (LMs) have shown promising results, yet they have\nsome critical limitations. In particular, they often follow a standard\nsupervised fine-tuning procedure to train a code generation model only from the\npairs of natural-language problem descriptions and ground-truth programs. Such\nparadigm largely ignores some important but potentially useful signals in the\nproblem specification such as unit tests, which thus often results in poor\nperformance when solving complex unseen coding tasks. To address the\nlimitations, we propose \"CodeRL\", a new framework for program synthesis tasks\nthrough pretrained LMs and deep reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically,\nduring training, we treat the code-generating LM as an actor network, and\nintroduce a critic network that is trained to predict the functional\ncorrectness of generated programs and provide dense feedback signals to the\nactor. During inference, we introduce a new generation procedure with a\ncritical sampling strategy that allows a model to automatically regenerate\nprograms based on feedback from example unit tests and critic scores. For the\nmodel backbones, we extended the encoder-decoder architecture of CodeT5 with\nenhanced learning objectives, larger model sizes, and better pretraining data.\nOur method not only achieves new SOTA results on the challenging APPS\nbenchmark, but also shows strong zero-shot transfer capability with new SOTA\nresults on the simpler MBPP benchmark.\n</p>",
