    "media:description": "Just a heads up, this video will have spoilers for all three of Cixin Liu’s Remembrance of Earth’s past book and also for the spinoff novel Redemption of Time by Baoshu. This series details the story of mankind after they discover that there is a race of alien beings 4 lightyears away from our solar system that seek to destroy humanity and inhabit the earth. It will take about 400 years for the aliens to reach earth but in the meantime the cripple technological progress on earth so that humans could not advance enough to match them. Humanity was nearly fully destroyed in its struggle against this technologically superior alien race. The great war between humanity and the Trisolarans drives the main narrative of the series and yet we never see the appearance of the Trisolarans described in the original trilogy, it’s not until the spinoff that we finally get a glimpse of what they actually look like. However we do receive information in the first book about their biology and their life cycle.\n\nGet This book: https://amzn.to/3xFTS6P\n\nArt:https://docs.google.com/document/d/18flVE6GhsTRd7zjSAEySVorF66ymzyG3AfT_54LQ4Qo/edit?usp=drivesdk\nMusichttps://youtu.be/dLJVGX3j5tY:\n\nCheck out Quinn's Upcoming Sci-fi comic: https://www.quinnhoward.net/theliebehindthestar\n\nFOLLOW QUINN ON TWITTER: Twitter: https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRE\n\nThree-Body Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXGGVBzHLUfIzEhovpQJ2ENiNvJoOD2A\nH.P.
