  "description": "On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Slate’s movie critic Dana Stevens is joined by Willa Paskin, Slate’s television critic, and Sam Adams, a senior editor at Slate and the editor of Slate’s culture blog, Brow Beat, to spoil Palm Springs. At first, Palm Springs seems like a fun wedding rom-com until Nyles (Andy Samberg) is shot with a bow and arrow while fooling around in the desert with Sarah (Cristin Milioti). Injured, he crawls into a nearby cave and tells Sarah not to follow him. She ignores his warning and is pulled into his infinite time loop. Will she follow Nyles’ lead and make peace with the situation? Why is Nyles being hunted? Why is Sarah so desperate to find a way out? And what is with those dinosaurs? \n\nYou can read Sam’s interview with the theoretical physicist who consulted on the movie here. \n\nNote: As the title indicates, this podcast contains spoilers galore.\n\nEmail us at spoilers@slate.com.\n\nPodcast production by Rosemary Belson. \n\nSlate Plus members get ad-free podcasts and access to exclusive shows like Dana Stevens’ classic movies podcast Flashback.
