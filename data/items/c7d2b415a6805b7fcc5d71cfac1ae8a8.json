    "media:description": "Head to https://actnow.climeworks.com/futurology to start removing COâ‚‚ from the air today!\n\nClimate change is the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced. And, while efforts are in place to reduce emissions and eventually reach carbon neutrality, we will be releasing billions of tons of carbon dioxide in the meantime. To help lower emissions and eventually bring them back to normal, we must also start removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Fortunately, there is technology that does exactly that. With its innovative technology, the company Climeworks has become the leader in direct air capture technology. By taking part in one of their monthly subscriptions, you can remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and help in the fight against climate change.\n\nThank you to Climeworks for sponsoring this video!",
