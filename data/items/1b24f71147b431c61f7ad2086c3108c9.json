  "description": "Hello and welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! On this week's show I'm joined by market veteran - Richard Suttmeier. Rich has been analyzing stocks for over 40 years and is a weekly contributor for Forbes and TheStreet.com. He is the founder and CEO of Global Market Consultants. There's one thing about Richard that sets himself apart from any other guest I have on the show… He is the ultimate bear. But I don't blame him either… Rich is one of the few analysts I know that dives into data he calls “the balance sheet of the US economy.” Otherwise known as the FDIC Banking Profile. And on today’s episode, he takes us under the hood of the fourth quarter results - suggesting that some stocks have rallied too far, too fast. Rich brings the \"overbought\" argument back to the table. And highlights the several risks stocks are still exposed to… despite deregulation and other pro-business administrative efforts. He explains why investors need to play it safe and book their profits now, before it’s too late. As Richard puts it, a market correction is going to occur a lot sooner than expected. Now I can’t agree with everything… But as investors, it’s always important to look at a different perspective. And although Richard presents us with ideas that might sound extreme, let’s face it, you can never be “too safe.”",
