  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about Pat's first golf round of the year, teams with the best weapons in the NFL and why it's a weapons league right now, Tom Brady's interview with Michael Strahan on Good Morning America about realizing things can be done a different way, and everything else going on in the NFL right now. Joining the program is Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, going into his 10th year at LB in the NFL, Buccaneers LB Lavonte David to chat about being a Super Bowl champion, how Tom Brady changes a teams culture, why guys from South Florida are just built different, and how excited he is for the Buccaneers to have virtually everybody back (24:10-42:41). Next, Ole Miss Head Football Coach Lane Kiffin joins the show to chat about the state of his program, what he thinks about a couple of the prospects in the draft, and if he expects things to be fairly normal this upcoming season (44:59-1:00:05). Later, noted Sports Psychologist, and proctor of a test that we just learned about yesterday, Dr. Scott Goldman joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about his test after Mark Sanchez reported that Justin Fields scored the highest score on the recall portion. Dr. Goldman gives a comprehensive breakdown of what his test covers, which professional teams use them, if the data indicates something about certain positions or sports, and much more (1:02:39-1:38:17).
