Martin breaks down the rules about when to call someone sir or ma'am. Stone figures out how to make duck taste like beef. Dogs and old men are highly entertaining in the duck blind this year, and one dog looks a lot like Si! Stone's scariest drill sergeants were women. And John-David reads a fan question about Jase's coolness. \n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
