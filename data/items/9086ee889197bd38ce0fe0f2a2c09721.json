  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys recap last night's Thursday Night Football game between the Seahawks and Cardinals, what it means for the NFC West moving forward, and what we ultimately learned from the game. Joining the show is fan favorite and Pittsburgh Steelers Linebacker, Bob Spillane. Pat and Bob chat about what it's been like moving from the practice squad, to special teams, to starting at linebacker, what it's like playing for Coach Tomlin, if he's heard anything about the new mask mandate in PA, and what was better, his dump truck hit on Derrick Henry from a couple of weeks ago, or his pick 6 against Lamar Jackson (30:03-43:30). Next, ESPN NFL Insider and co-host of the Fantasy Focus Football Podcast, Field Yates joins Pat and AJ to chat about what he knows about the new mask mandate for players playing the game, who he sees getting a head coaching opportunity, which players on the injury report we can expect to see this weekend, and his Ohio State fandom (43:32-1:07:07). Later, Pat and AJ break down the entire NFL week 11 slate and give their picks to the games including the Packers v. Colts matchup which has Pat a little torn up trying to decide which way to lean (1:07:09-1:25:18).
