  "title": "Ep 150 | Ron DeSantis vs. Everyone: The Governor Who BROKE the Media | Ron DeSantis | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Corporate media hates Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. These days, that’s a badge of honor. They love to accuse him of tyranny and authoritarianism, to scaremonger about how he wants to \"destroy\" democracy. But he’s unafraid to call out their lies and keep Florida on the front lines for freedom. When Disney tried to protest his Parental Rights in Education law, he stood his ground — and won. He did the same with CRT and woke prosecutors and has an exciting announcement about taking on ESG. Gov. DeSantis joins Glenn to break down his growing collection of wins, why he isn’t slowing down, and his advice for Republicans hoping to make a difference in their states.\n\nSponsors:\n\nBetter Spectacles is offering an introductory 61% off of progressive eyewear plus free handcrafted Rodenstock frames.
