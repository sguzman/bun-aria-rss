  "description": "On this episode of The Colin and Samir Podcast, we take a look back at the past year of our lives…and this has been a year of a lot of ups and downs. Colin and I both wrote down some amazing moments from the year prior to the podcast and I think we both expected this episode to be filled with a lot of fun stories about those memories, and we absolutely touch of a lot of those, but we also dive into the uncertainty we felt during the year. The conversation takes some twists and turns that we didn’t know it was going to take, but I guess that’s fitting because it is similar to the way our year went...filled with unexpected twists and turns. \nSo if you’ve been following us all year or if you’re just starting to tune in, I think you’ll really enjoy this reflection into the past year of our lives and our careers.",
