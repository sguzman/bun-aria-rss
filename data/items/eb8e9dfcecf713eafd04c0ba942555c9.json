  "title": "Will charging infrastructure be a bottleneck for electric vehicles?",
  "description": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are moving quickly toward mass adoption. So how do we make sure that charging infrastructure keeps up?\nThe people who own, operate and install chargers have some big questions to answer: \n\nCan public chargers run a profit, and how do business models need to change to accelerate deployment?\n\nWhy is it so hard to repair broken stations?\n\nDoes it matter where we install new ones?\n\nWhen will chargers be as ubiquitous and easy to use as gas stations?\n\nIn this episode, Shayle digs into these questions with colleague Cassie Bowe, partner at the venture capital firm Energy Impact Partners, where she focuses on mobility. Cassie outlines the trajectory of charger deployment over the years, comparing charger accessibility in the U.S, China and Europe. \nShayle and Cassie cover smart charging (also known as V1G) and V2G, as well as the commodification of charging hardware. Plus, how soon we might see wireless charging and why Shayle doesn’t have an EV yet. \nCatalyst is supported by Antenna Group.
