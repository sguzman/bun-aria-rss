  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Advances in medical technology have produced a Covid-19 vaccine in record time, but some of these advances have a dark side. Gene editing technology may end some diseases, but should we interfere with the conception and birth of those who carry certain genes? And what about creating enhanced humans? Bioethicist Calum MacKellar joins Skye for an important, and somewhat disturbing conversation about the new era of eugenics we are entering. Also this week, the Holy Post crew discusses a new book about Millennials and burnout. What makes Millennials different from the Greatest Generation that endured the Great Depression and WWII? Are they struggling because of a breakdown in family and faith, or because of U.S. economic and political failures? Plus, is there still a place for public shaming? And, hand sanitizer + dog = chaos.</p>",
