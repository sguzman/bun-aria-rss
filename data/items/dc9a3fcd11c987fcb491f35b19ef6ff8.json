  "description": "Chelsea is at the hospital for tests and a consultation before the termination, which is next week. Ben arrives in the waiting room. Chelsea tries to cover, but Ben tells shocked Tracy that he is the father. There’s a strained conversation between Ben and Tracy while Chelsea has a blood test, then they all go in to see the doctor together. All are shocked and upset by what Chelsea will be facing. Chelsea says it’s her own fault for leaving it too late. Tracy and Ben are both very anxious. Privately, Tracy thanks Ben for his support, he’s doing well. Ben says he’s there for Chelsea. Tracy promises she won’t tell Ben’s family, or Jazzer, that he is the father. Ben says whatever Chelsea wants is what matters. \nCompetition and speculation have been rife in the village over the soil test results. Kirsty’s now looking through the results, which are fascinating. Bridge Farm has some surprises coming. She thinks she’ll display them in the pub rather than email them out – a more relaxed approach. Meanwhile, Rex has trouble of his own. He’s told Kate about them doing outdoor yoga and meditation, and she’s spitting fire about the Rewilding taking business from her. Kirsty listens to Kate rail, then says they were going to offer her first refusal on the sessions, but she’s clearly not interested. Wrongfooted, Kate tries to backtrack. Kirsty tells her she can be the witch on their Halloween walk. They’re desperate to find someone.",
