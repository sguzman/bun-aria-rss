  "description": "Is it over yet?  Can we come out of our basements now?  Is the worst year ever over?  Well...yes and no.  Yes, dear Deep State Radio nerds, you can come out of your basements.  It is 2018.  But no, the worst may not be over.  This week in two special episodes, we look back at the trends and unfinished business of 2017 in order to help us predict the catastrophes, screw-ups and near misses of 2018.  Oh, and the good stuff too, if there is any of that.  So join Team DSR--Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and David Sanger--to ring in the new year.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
