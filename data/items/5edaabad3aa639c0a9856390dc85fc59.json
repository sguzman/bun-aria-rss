  "description": "<p>Kerryn Feehan came over to tell me about this wild world of getting dudes to just send you money. For nothing. I mean, legitimately for nothing. And then we started talking and she started telling me about how to get them to send you way more money for doing at least a little something. It's a crazy world we live in and it's full of simps. Also, we will tell you what a \"simp\" is while you listen to the episode. I honestly loved this one. I found it so interesting and entertaining and I hope you guys like it as much as I did.</p> <p>This episode is brought to you by my subscribers at Patreon.
