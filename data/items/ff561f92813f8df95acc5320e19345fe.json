  "description": "Streetball. It's a style of basketball defined by trash talk, windmill dunks, no-look passes, and broken ankles. You can find streetball at city parks and rec centers, driveways and playgrounds, pro-am leagues and even -- in spirit -- NBA arenas. Through it all, you might even call it hoops in its purest form. Drawing inspiration from hip hop mixtapes, this podcast explores how streetball – and the way it’s played around the United States – has shaped not just the game of basketball, but the country's culture. In true mixtape form, the podcast is a compilation of stories, styles, and sounds, all illuminating the essence of the game.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
