  "description": "Super Tuesday winnowed the 2020 Democratic primary race down to two candidates: Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. So how would their presidencies actually differ? Who would staff their administrations? How would they handle Congress? How would they handle key foreign policy decisions? What are their likely points of failure? How would they change the Democratic Party?\nI asked my friend, colleague, and Weeds co-host Matt Yglesias to join me for this conversation, and it was a good one. We’ve both covered Biden and Sanders for a long time, but come away with somewhat different impressions of each. The points where we differ here were, for me, even more helpful than the points where we agreed.\nI'll be interested, as always, to hear your thoughts: ezrakleinshow@vox.com.\nReferences:\nMatt Yglesias' case for Bernie Sanders \nEzra's piece on what Bernie needs to learn from Biden\n\nNew to the show?
