  "description": "Former Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé first became an internet meme before most people knew what memes were: At Nintendo's presentation at the gaming expo E3 2004, he  turned heads by announcing, \"My name is Reggie. I'm about kickin' ass, I'm about takin' names, and we're about makin' games.\"\n\"I received a message from my teenage son who told me, 'Dad, you're famous,'\" Reggie says. \"They weren't called memes at the time — these were Photoshopped images. He sent me these images of me blowing up a competitive console; me dressed up like Sylvester Stallone from one of his movies; me looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger from TheTerminator.\"\nToday on Follow Friday, Reggie shares the backstory of another press conference that made him even more internet-famous, and talks about his new book https://www.harpercollinsleadership.com/9781400226672/disrupting-the-game/ (Disrupting the Game: From the Bronx to the Top of Nintendo). \nAnd he explains why we should follow \"Originals\" and \"Think Again\" author Adam Grant (https://www.instagram.com/adamgrant/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y= (@Adamgrant) on Instagram, @AdamMGrant on https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant?s=20&amp;t=k7JdUkXqcc0E-ftEUSd7ZQ (Twitter) and https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F (LinkedIn)); Pivot co-host and New York Times writer Kara Swisher (@karaswisher on https://twitter.com/karaswisher?s=20&amp;t=nr0M6GMwEGIkcVqddCJpWA (Twitter) and https://www.instagram.com/karaswisher/?hl=en (Instagram)); The Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon (@jimmyfallon on https://www.instagram.com/jimmyfallon/?hl=en (Instagram) and https://twitter.com/jimmyfallon?s=20&amp;t=V6zlWFOt6AIuFLSJDOn_QQ (Twitter)); and the founder of The Game Awards, Geoff Keighley (https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley?s=20&amp;t=C6tqLI-aFOZ3JwCjA9DcSA (@geoffkeighley) on Twitter).\nThank you to our amazing patrons: Jon, Justin, Amy, Yoichi, Danielle, Elizabeth, and Sylnai.
