As many who send their kids there can tell you, they're just as Woke, if not Woker. Critical Education Theorists (Critical Pedagogs) have not ignored private schools, just like they haven't ignored elite private universities that these schools primarily service, but how do they really think about them? In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay reads through a recent academic paper (http://www.criticaleducationnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/RCP_Feb2022_SusannahE.Livingston.pdf) regarding bringing Freirean and Leninist Critical Pedagogy into NAIS-certified private schools, and what is written by Susannah Livingston, recent graduate of GCAS (https://gcas.ie/)(Global Centre for Advanced Studies and teacher at an expensive private school in New York City, an explicitly neo-Marxist certification mill) is shocking.
