  "description": "<p>The first full week of 2021 has been action-packed for those of us in the United States of America, for reasons you’re probably aware of, including a riotous mob storming the US Capitol. The situation has spurred me to take the unusual step of doing a solo podcast in response to current events. But never fear, I’m not actually trying to analyze current events for their own sakes. Rather, I’m using them as a jumping-off point for a more general discussion of how democracy is supposed to work and how we can make it better. We’ve talked about related topics recently with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2020/11/02/121-cornel-west-on-what-democracy-is-and-should-be/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cornel West</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2020/12/07/126-david-stasavage-on-the-origin-and-history-of-democracy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David Stasavage</a>, but there are things I wanted to say in my own voice that fit well here.
