  "description": "<p>It's time to take a brief break from our interviews as we bring back the gang to talk about the Olympic sports and discuss everything about them in a long overdue episode! We go over what sports currently work and what sports currently don't work at both the Summer & Winter Olympics, and try to make sense about how some of them are held during the Olympics. We also go over the sports that could be included at the Olympics and discuss which are the ones we'd love to see in place of some of the current ones on the schedule. Added to this we talk about whether or not demonstration sports should return as well as the return of artistic events in the future. It's one great episode that you won't want to miss!</p>",
