  "description": "I had an interesting idea a few weeks ago, best explained through an example. Let's say you're running an e-commerce site (I kind of do) and you want to optimize the number of purchases.\nLet's also say we try to learn as much as we can from users, both using A/B tests but also using just basic slicing and dicing of the data."
