  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear about signs that NotPetya was covering up a broad espionage campaign. State-sponsored hacking seems, when not simple spying, to aim at eroding trust. Verizon suffers a major customer data breach said to derive from a vendor's misconfiguration of an Amazon S3 bucket. Industry notes—venture funding and an acquisition. David Dufour from Webroot on homoglyph attacks. Thomas Jones from Bay Dynamics on federal agencies being required to submit a Framework Implementation Action Plan. Singapore will license white hats. And Russia wants you properly signed into adult sites. Or, at least, one of them, anyway.",
