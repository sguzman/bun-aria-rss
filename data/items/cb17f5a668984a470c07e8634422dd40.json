  "itunes:summary": "Helen Pluckrose develops the definition of \"Social Justice\" as it is used in the academic literature in this tradition, explains its connections to identity politics and the political correctness movement, and then shows the relevance of the original postmodernists to this Theory in some detail. She does this to elegantly describe the progression of these ideas from Theory to activism to the streets by describing how these ideas originated, evolved, and were built upon by successive generations of Theorists leading up to those who have become famous names even outside of the scholarly world today: for examples, Peggy McIntosh, Barbara Applebaum, and Robin DiAngelo. She wraps up by explaining how this newest generation of Theorists simplified the highly abstract ideas of their predecessors and made it far clearer and easier to understand so that it could, as we now see all around us, eventually go mainstream.\n\nFollow Helen https://twitter.com/hpluckrose\n\nSupport New Discourses:\nhttps://patreon.com/newdiscourses\nhttps://subscribestar.com/newdiscourses\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://newdiscourses.com\n\nFollow:\nhttps://facebook.com/newdiscourses\nhttps://twitter.com/NewDiscourses\nhttps://instagram.com/newdiscourses \nhttps://pinterest.com/newdiscourses/\nhttps://linkedin.com/company/newdiscourses\nhttps://minds.com/newdiscourses\nhttps://reddit.com/r/NewDiscourses\n\nPodcast:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/newdiscourses\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-discourses/id1499880546\nhttps://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/Ipc3rvw364nzwvdjjpd6gg3cmuy\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/0HfzDaXI5L4LnJQStFWgZp\nhttps://stitcher.com/podcast/new-discourses\n\n© 2020 New Discourses.
