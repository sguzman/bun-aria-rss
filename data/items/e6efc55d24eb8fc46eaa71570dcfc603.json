This led to the blockbuster book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IbusX2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Finding Ultra</em></a>. But, behind the scenes, he was struggling with something else that would eventually bring him, once again, to his knees.</p><p>While he'd figured out his physical wellbeing, he had also awakened to the fact that his career as a lawyer was deeply unfulfilling. Married, with a wife and four kids, he left the law behind. Now, he had to figure out how to craft a new living. This led to a years-long, often brutally-hard journey that brought him within hours of losing the family home. But, together with his wife, <a href=\"http://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/julie-srimati-piatt-on-sacred-moments-and-vegan-cheese/\" target=\"_blank\">Julie Piatt</a>, they held to their belief that the only way was through.</p><p>That eventually led to a new vocation as an advocate, speaker, author and podcast producer focusing on healthy-living, plant-powered eating, sustainable food-systems and meaningful living. That journey is still unfolding. And, in today's conversation, we dive into the major points of reckoning, inflection and celebration.
