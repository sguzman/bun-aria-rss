  "description": "<p>After an unprecedented and, frankly, irresponsible one-week hiatus, we've returned to answer the deluge of questions the MBMBAM community flooded us with during the interlude. That just means we have a much sweeter stock of queries to choose from. Seriously, guys -- every single question in this episode is a matter of life or death. Especially  the one about teen make-out spots.  Suggested talking points: Golden Love Corral, Best Woman, Aaron (known dude), the circle of AIDS, long distance dating and shotputting, fat beers, Why Does The Sun Shine?, anger volcanoes, mama-law, friendship connections, On Kicking</p>\n",
