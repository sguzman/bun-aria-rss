  "description": "In a previous episode, we explored depositions and audio evidence from the 2019 boat crash in which the recently murdered Paul Murdaugh was eventually charged with Boating Under the Influence and causing the death of 19 year old Mallory Beach.  \nWhile there are a number of victims connected to this saga, we want to remind everyone that Mallory Beach was a bright young lady who lit up every room she walked into. On this 5th episode of the Murdough Murders Podcast, we look at newly released evidence from SCDNR and other agencies we expose what went wrong in that investigation to ensure law enforcement agencies are doing everything they can to achieve justice for all the victims connected to this saga.\n\nThank you to Haskins & Co for sponsoring this episode.
