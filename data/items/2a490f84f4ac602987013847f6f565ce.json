  "description": "<p>This week we’re breaking down “Casual Friday”, and the ladies talk with the actor behind the famous chili cold open, Brain Baumgartner! Brian, who played Kevin Malone, shares how he got his role and what it was like to play this oddball accountant. Afterwards the ladies discuss this episode; Michael is back as the Dunder Mifflin manager of the Scranton branch and he reinstates Casual Friday. He also seems to be giving preferential treatment to Pam and Ryan causing resentment among some of the other employees. Kate Flannery sends in a clip about her famous wardrobe malfunction, Angela shares a deleted scene where Creed reveals what he calls the breakroom, and Jenna does an amazing deep dive on invisible ink.
