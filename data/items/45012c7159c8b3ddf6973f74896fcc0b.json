  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, Nancy Pelosi wants to be Speaker of The House more than she wants to be a Patriot. She is beholden to the reprobates in the Democrat Party, but We The People are not. Pelosi trashed the president saying that he is engaged in a \"cover-up\" for asserting presidential privilege, as is his right through the executive branch, shortly before her meeting with the president in the Oval Office. These people want to destroy President Trump politically and professionally. Trump pre-empted the meeting for an impromptu rose garden press conference reiterating that he gave Special Council Bob Mueller full access to all white house staff, allowed the White House Lawyer to waive privilege and testify for more than 30 hours, and didn't resist 500 search warrants. Then, a renewed call to action is issued to Tea Party Conservatives and supporters of the Article V Convention of States movement to engage voters, raise funds, and bring challenges to the pretend moderate Democrats in Republican districts if they support this pseudo-impeachment. Later, Joe Biden is back on the rail peddling his blue-collar bull even though he's never held a lunch bucket in his life. Finally, Sen ted Cruz calls in to discuss his letter to Yale requesting documents related to its discriminatory policy. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
