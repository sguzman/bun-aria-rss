She's the costume designer, responsible for bringing these wildly different worlds -- stretched across time and space (and sometimes reality itself) -- to life entirely via their clothes. In this week's episode, Todd and Ane talk about designing those haunting Handmaid's cloaks, Ane's rural upbringing, and what clothes can say about a character.\n      \n      \n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
