  "description": "This week Alaina is diving into the Peter Tobin case! Peter Tobin, who was also known as Patrick McLaughlin, James Kelley and many other names, may have killed as many as 48. He was sentenced to life in prison and when he told investigators how many he’d killed he followed it up with “figure it out” and grinned.
