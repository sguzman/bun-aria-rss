  "description": "<p>“Romare Bearden was asked in a 1972 interview with Camille Billops how he would define black art, and he said that black art is the art that black artists do,” says Tate's Zoe Whitley. \"If someone were to say: 'What is white art?' you might say the Italian Renaissance, but you could equally say the German Renaissance, Rembrandt or English painting. Black art is as varied as that.”</p> <p>Joining us in London to discuss contemporary African art are Zoe Whitley, the curator and writer Osei Bonsu, and Sotheby's Hannah O’Leary. In a broad-ranging conversation, we cover the challenges of bringing more recognition to artists who have lived or worked on the Continent or been part of its diaspora.</p> <p>\"In Other Words\" is a presentation of AAP and Sotheby's, produced by Audiation.fm.</p> <p>For a full transcript, click here: http://www.artagencypartners.com/episode-16-transcript-contemporary-african-art/</p>",
