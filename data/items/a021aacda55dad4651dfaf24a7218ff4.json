  "description": "Does the purchase of Early Times by Sazerac signal trouble in the water for Brown-Forman? We look at the motivation behind this and if tariffs could have a future impact as well. If you’re thinking about visiting distilleries and experiencing Kentucky, is now the time to do it or wait until things settle down? And lastly, we ask ourselves what do we do with a bottle that only has 2 or 3 pours left? Finish it or save it?\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about People Magazine.\n\nSazerac purchased Early Times. What will happen to a recent bourbon entrant that has become a beloved bottom shelfer?\n\nDistilleries are slowly starting to open back up. Would you go ahead and take your KY vacation now or wait?\n\nDo you look at bottle fill levels and feel the need to finish them off or keep them?\n\nThanks to Blake from bourbonr.com, Jordan from BreakingBourbon.com, and Brian from sippncorn.com for joining.\n\nSupport this Podcast on Patreon",
