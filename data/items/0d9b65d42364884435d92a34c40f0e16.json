  "title": "Working at MoMA: How Do an Art Handler and a Museum Registrar Do Their Jobs?",
  "description": "Of all the people who work at MoMA, there very few who get as up close and personal with the artwork as the museum's art handlers and registrars. \nRegistrars are the people responsible for keeping tracking of every inch of every piece of art that belongs to the museum. They thoroughly inspect and catalog each detail and always know where everything is at all times. Meanwhile, art handlers are the ones trusted with physically moving the pieces. They’re the only department outside of conservation who are actually allowed to touch the artwork. \nJordan talks to Steven Wheeler and Sarah Wood about the special privileges and particular pet peeves of working in these two departments at MoMA. \nYou can email us at working@slate.com.\nPodcast production by Jessamine Molli.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
