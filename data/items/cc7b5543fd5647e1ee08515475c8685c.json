  "title": "Ep. 256: Vibrant Interiors with Andrea Monath Schumacher",
  "description": "We are so excited to welcome Andrea Monath Schumacher to the show. Andrea is an interior designer based out of Denver, Colorado. Her experience ranges from commercial and residential spaces, as well as set design for television at Days of Our Lives and Columbia Pictures. Her design style is heavily influenced by travel and emotion which is laced throughout her debut book Vibrant Interiors: Living Large at Home. She was named House Beautiful‘s Next Wave Designer and she’s also been featured in Architectural Digest, Veranda, and more. Today we talk about injecting personality into our interiors and how to tell a story with design. Andrea talks about how she taps into emotions to make a space feel warm, cozy, and inviting so her clients and guests can feel welcome to share their stories.\n\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nAndrea talks about her childhood and travels as the daughter of a virologist.\n\nWhat does Andrea mean by “storytelling your interior”?\n\nWhy Andrea loves using conversation starters in her design.\n\nLayering is a big key to making a space feel cozy.\n\nThe formal dining room is out and the multi-purpose dining room is in.\n\nAndrea loves making a breakfast nook truly inviting and loungey.\n\nWhat are Andrea’s tricks for designing to make people feel their best in their homes?\n\nThe story of how Andrea found her home and the items in it.\n\nWhy Andrea loves grasscloth everywhere; even on the ceilings.\n\nHow Andrea mixes and matches patterns.\n\nWhat is in Andrea’s secondary kitchen?\n\nAndrea’s tip for protecting her wallpaper.\n\nMore about Andrea’s textile and wallpaper collection.\n\nHow does Andrea like to bring art into her clients’ homes?\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma:\nHi Krista,\n\nThat whole corner where the tree is, I would put an L-shaped banquette. As far as the table, I would probably find a pedestal/center-based table so it’s easier to get in and out. I don’t like to throw anything away so I would find a way to repurpose it; maybe even as a desk? You could even cut the legs down to use as a tea-height table in the living room! I think the glass table in the living room is too small so that would be perfect. The chairs are fine, and if you had a banquette you could use them on the outside of the eating area. If you were to do the banquette, you would have to swag the lighting fixture to put it over the space. With kids, a zinc top table and/or an oval shape is great. I don’t think you need a rug if you use lots of cozy pillows or fabrics at the banquette, but if you want one you could use an indoor/outdoor rug. With kids, you need something easy to clean. I think you can also use drapery to warm up the space since the window coverings are sparse; you can even do a mock valence to make it look wider if those are operable blinds.\n\nGood luck, Krista!\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\n\nAndrea Schumacher Interiors\n\nAndrea Schumacher Interiors on Instagram\n\nVibrant Interiors: Living Large at Home\n\nLiesl Collection",
