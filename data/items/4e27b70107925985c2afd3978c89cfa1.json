  "description": "<p>As the holidays approach, we discuss how you can encourage others to give your art as a gift (or to ask for your art as a gift). The challenge, of course, is that art is a highly personal choice, so buyers might be concerned about \"getting it wrong.\" We put our heads together and came up with a range of tips and tricks designed to make it easy and risk-free for someone to give your art to a loved one. Our ideas range from the types of products you offer, to the ways in which you allow people to buy.</p>\n<p>This is also the last week to join our exciting end-of-year event scheduled for the week of November 18th. “Your Best Art Year Ever” will be an interactive live 5-day event during which we will share our approach to planning for success. There will be chat, laughs, sound advice, a chance to ask questions, and even a few free downloads so that you can plan your own “best art year ever.” You can join the Facebook group now and start to get to know everyone, so that you’re ready for when we start on November 18th.
