  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p><p>Do you remember the conversation you had with your parents, aunties, grandma or friends when you started your menstrual cycle? Whether you’ve realized it or not, the tone and content of that conversation has likely shaped your relationship to your cycle all these years later. To help us dig into how our menstrual cycles may impact our mental health, today I’m joined by Sara Flowers, DrPH, MPH. Dr. Flowers and I chatted about how our cycle changes throughout our lives, the ways that shame often shows up related to our cycles, the importance of having conversations with one another about how our bodies change throughout life, and she shared some great suggestions for how we can talk to the younger people in our lives differently about their cycles. </p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://vote.webbyawards.com/PublicVoting#/2021/podcasts/general-series/health-wellness\">Vote for the podcast in the Webby Awards!</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast!</p><p><a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/get-care/spot-on-period-tracker\">Spot On Period Tracker</a></p><p><a href=\"https://amaze.org/\">Amaze</a></p><p><a href=\"https://sexpositivefamilies.com/\">Sex Positive Families</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Flowers</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/\">https://www.plannedparenthood.org/</a></p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/plannedparenthood/\">@plannedparenthood</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PPFA\">@PPFA</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PlannedParenthood/\">@plannedparenthood</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p><p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
