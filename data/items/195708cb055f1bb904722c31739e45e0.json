  "content:encoded": "<p>Paul Alper points us to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2022/11/01/oz-senate-doctor-research\">a news article</a> that reports:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Oz research rejected from 2003 surgery conference, resulted in 2-year ban</p>\n<p>In May 2003, Mehmet Oz was the senior author on a study that explored a hot topic at the time . . . But Oz was forced to withdraw his work and was banned from presenting research to the organization for the next two years, according to seven people familiar with the events, whose account of his ban was confirmed by the Oz campaign. Oz is now the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>He was also prohibited from publishing his work in the society’s medical journal for the same period of time, according to the people familiar with the events, four of whom recalled details of the controversy on the record. </p>\n<p>“My understanding is it was the lack of really solid statistical analysis that called everything into question,” said one person who was sympathetic to Oz, saying he simply ran into funding and deadline problems.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My reply:  Sure, why would anyone think that just cos someone&#8217;s a good surgeon, that they&#8217;d have any idea how to conduct research?  I know lots of people who are really good at research but it&#8217;s not like they could do surgery.</p>\n<p>The interesting thing to me is that last paragraph of the above quote, as it seems to reflect the attitude that statistics is just a bunch of paperwork, or a set of hoops to jump through.  That attitude that researchers have, that their ideas are evidently correct and the statistics is just some rubber stamp.</p>\n<p>With Oz, though, there&#8217;s another twist, given his later record of promoting miracle cures.  It&#8217;s hard to imagine he really believes in all the things that he promotes&#8212;or maybe &#8220;belief&#8221; isn&#8217;t really the point; perhaps he just has a very general belief in the power of placebo, in which case anything he recommends would be automatically legit.  Indeed, the more people pay for it, the more effective the placebo power is.  Kinda like academic funding!</p>\n",
