  "description": "<p>This week we’re breaking down “The Lover.” Jim and Pam return from their honeymoon and discover that Michael is dating Pam’s mom, Helene. Let’s just say, Pam is not ok with it. Meanwhile, Dwight spies on Jim with a deceptive spy trick that involves a wooden mallard. Jenna talks about how playing super angry Pam was a challenge, Angela unveils a deleted scene where Michael plays with Helene’s socks, and the ladies have a much needed “BFF download.” This episode is so good, we guarantee it’s much better than the eight hours of tape Dwight has of Jim talking about paper.</p>\n",
