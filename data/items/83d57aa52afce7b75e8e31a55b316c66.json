  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Queen Elizabeth II died at 96 years old. She was a statesman and a class act that has seen changes in this world for good and for bad. The generation that fought a world war for this nation is all but gone, what is left is our generation. How are we doing? The generation to follow us has embraced Marxism. Our generation in Washington is weakening our nation. Will we leave our children a more prosperous country than we have now? Then, Democrats are all in on the de-growth (climate change) movement because Marx was against capitalist pro-growth policies for the private sector. This is about destroying the free market, not about climate change. Afterward, Sid Rosenberg joins the show to discuss his new book, \"Sid-izens United: Salacious Spiels, Stories, Suggestions, and Solutions to Withstand a Woke World.\" Rosenberg added that Trump was the best president of his lifetime and warned that leftwing policies in New York City are sending people packing across the country. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
