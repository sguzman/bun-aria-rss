Hillary is the author of the new book, French Comfort Food, and joins Cathy in a wonderful conversation about how she became intrigued with French food. After living in France for years, Hillary prides herself in featuring recipes that are considered family recipes that you won’t find elsewhere unless you ask the locals themselves. Hillary aims to reach the every day cook with the flavors and aura of the different regions in France, and even shares a simple trick for finding authentic recipes when traveling abroad. After the break, Hillary admits that the region of Nice happens to be her personal favorite cuisine. Explaining the diversity of food found in the area, it seems as though the blending of the cultures produces the most delicious delicacies.
