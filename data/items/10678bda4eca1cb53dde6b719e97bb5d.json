While it's not nutrition focussed it's still highly relevant to finding true health and wellness. Particularly in this current climate where it can be difficult to quieten the mind and tap into the inner voice that we all have. My hope is that Light provides you with inspiration to find the time to do exactly that - to quieten the mind so you can learn more about who you are and what you want to do with your life. I've been doing this imperfectly for a long time now and it's been enormously beneficial.\n\nResources:\nGrab a copy of Light's new book Knowing Where to Look on Amazon\nFollow Light on Instagram and Twitter\nVisit Light's website for information about his meditation training and retreats\n\nWant to support the show?\nIf you are enjoying the Plant Proof podcast a great way to support the show is by leaving a review on the Apple podcast app. It only takes a few minutes and helps more people find the episodes.\n\nSimon Hill, Nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist\nCreator of Plantproof.com and host of the Plant Proof Podcast\nAuthor of The Proof is in the Plants\nConnect with me on Instagram and Twitter\nDownload my two week meal plan\nLearn more about your ad choices.
