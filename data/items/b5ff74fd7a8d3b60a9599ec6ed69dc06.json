Bid on pre-draft calls with our experts, a spot in our Podcast League, a guest spot on our show and more! https://ebay.to/3p4Dc3Z\nFrom Jonathan Taylor to Ezekiel Elliott to Khalil Herbert and beyond, we'll tell you about the best and worst values in Fantasy drafts! We start with some Fantasy Fun Facts (0:50) on the 2022 RB class including why age 27 has been unkind to RBs in recent seasons, why Tony Pollard might deserve more carries (5:30) and what Elijah Mitchell did last season that was so unusual (7:45) ... Reviewing our recent pick-by-pick series (11:15), we'll take a look at five different teams in a 12-team league and how they built their RB depth. Dave proves you can love your RBs if you wait until the 3/4 turn to select your first two. Then we get into average draft position beginning with RBs in Round 1 (23:30). Should Christian McCaffrey be first overall? Who is most likely to be a bust? Round 2 (32:30) has some incredible value picks like Alvin Kamara and  Aaron Jones ... Moving on to the Round 3 RBs (41:55), are they too risky to justify as third round picks? Then we move on to Rounds 4-5 (46:40) which is fairly exciting, Round 6 (54:50) which is terrible and a couple more rounds before we focus on the best RBs after pick 100 (1:04:00) including some key rookies (1:09:35) ...
