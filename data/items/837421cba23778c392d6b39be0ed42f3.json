  "title": "Ep 90 | Why Corrupt Media Chose Joe Biden | Sharyl Attkisson | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Veteran award-winning investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson has watched from the inside as the mainstream media replaced news with activism. As a leading correspondent at CBS News for 21 years, she argues that there’s a new definition of censorship, and it involves the media, Big Tech, and the government working together to define what “truth” is – and their suppression of the Hunter Biden story in the months leading up to the election is a prime example. Sharyl and Glenn cover a range of topics: the “Digital New Deal,\" YouTube’s new ban, big brother, coronavirus restrictions, Dr. Fauci, and the great reset. She also gives her expert advice on how we can reverse what has happened to journalism, because America desperately needs to be able to trust again.\n\nThis Week’s Sponsors:\n\nLosing your hair is no fun.
