    "media:description": "Strandbeest Evolution 2020 provides an overview of the beach animals of the past thirty years. Over time, an evolution has taken place, which is visible in successive generations. Ultimately, I want to release these animals on the beaches, where they will lead a life of their own.\nEvery spring I go to the beach with a new animal and during the summer I do all kinds of experiments with the wind, sand and water. By autumn I will be a bit wiser when it comes to surviving on the beach. Then I declare the beast extinct and they go to the boneyard.\nI associate looking back in history with black and white movies. Looking back in silence. No music.\nBut the Strandbeest evolution will certainly continue for the next thirty years. www.strandbeest.com",
