  "description": "I’ve got a great interview for you today— this time, I’m featuring a conversation with Eden Collinsworth on her fascinating book, What the Ermine Saw: The Extraordinary Journey of Leonardo da Vinci's Most Mysterious Portrait. This extraordinary work of narrative non-fiction traces the remarkable history of Leonardo da Vinci’s enigmatic portrait: The Woman with an Ermine, from its original creation, including the fascinating story of its subject, Cecilia Gallerani, and on to its mysterious disappearance for 250 years after which it emerged in the hands of an aristocratic Polish family. Now on display in Krakow, the painting was exiled in Paris, and kept hidden from the Nazis by a brave housekeeper. These defining moments in history comprise a portrait of Europe’s past as vivid and complex as the painting itself.\n\nPlease SUBSCRIBE and REVIEW our show on Apple Podcasts and FOLLOW on Spotify\nInstagram / Facebook / YouTube\nBuy What the Ermine Saw here!\n\n\nSPONSORS:\nBetterHelp: Get 10% off your first month of counseling\nLearn more about your ad choices.
