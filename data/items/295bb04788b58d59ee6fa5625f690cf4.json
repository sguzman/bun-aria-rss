  "description": "Bing Bong! We’ve got an exciting episode this week featuring one of our most requested guests ever, New York Knicks star RJ Barrett. But first, we open with a few takeaways from this week’s NBA playoff games including Joel Embiid’s game winner and The Boston Celtics’ smothering defense on Kevin Durant. Then we’re joined by RJ and get his personal perspective on that Boston defense and how defenses change in general during the NBA playoffs. We also dig into his childhood in Europe, obligatory Duke talk and Coach K stories, the emotions of his draft night experience, first impressions of Knicks fans and their interactions with Trae Young, his relationship with Tom Thibodeau, that unbelievable game winner against The Celtics and so much more. This is a fantastic conversation start-to-finish and we’re thrilled to share it with you all.\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
