In this cast, New Models speaks with music journalist Liz Pelly, who has written extensively on Spotify, particularly its impact on independent music. She talks to us, here, about Spotify's structure, how it nudges artists to optimize their acts through metrics, and what it understands \"music\" (let alone \"independent\") culture to be. Liz also gives an update on community organizing in NYC's IRL music/nightlife sphere. For more, check: http://lizpelly.com/",
