I’m not talking about fossil fuels, I’m talking about a breakdown of the body’s internal energy systems that now affects even young adults in their prime. It might surprise you to learn that it’s not normal to feel tired all the time. Our on-the-go culture has made it the norm. But when we take a look at how the body’s mitochondria function (these are our tiny but powerful cellular energy factories) we see that so much of our modern lives is damaging our mitochondria and resulting in this energy deficit.&nbsp;</p><br><p>I’m so excited to talk to Dr. Steven Gundry about this topic on this episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy. Dr. Steven Gundry is one of the world’s top cardiothoracic surgeons and a pioneer in nutrition, as well as medical director at The International Heart and Lung Institute Center for Restorative Medicine. He has spent the last two decades studying the microbiome and now helps patients use diet and nutrition as a key form of treatment. He is author of many New York Times bestselling books including The Plant Paradox, and The Plant Paradox Cookbook, and The Longevity Paradox: How to Die Young at a Ripe Old Age, and just released The Energy Paradox: What to Do When Your Get-Up-and-Go Has Got Up and Gone.
