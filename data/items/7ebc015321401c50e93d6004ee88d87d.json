Anne and Kelly are world class improv instructors and ambassadors who have a long history at <em><a href=\"http://www.secondcity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Second City</a>, </em>the world’s first ever on-going improvisational theatre troupe. <em>The Second City</em> has turned out notable performers like Tina fey, Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers. Topics revolve around improv as it relates to mindfulness, creativity, cognitive reframing, authenticity and more. We also learned a lot from this interview about how improv can be used in everyday life, and we still get a kick out of the story we improvised involving the destruction of Purple Popsicle Man!
