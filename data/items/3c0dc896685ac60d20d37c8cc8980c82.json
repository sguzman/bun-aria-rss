  "description": "<p>The leak of a draft ruling by the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade has the entire country talking. Phil, Skye, and Kaitlyn discuss the overreactions from both the Left and Right, speculate about what a post-Roe America might look like, examine the complicated history of abortion including why many evangelicals originally supported Roe but then dramatically flipped on the issue, and share their hopes for what comes next.</p> <p>Then, acclaimed historian Mark Noll talks about the 30th anniversary of his influential book, “The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind.” In the early 1990s, Noll celebrated the strength of the evangelical church, but he warned about a dangerous shortage of evangelical scholars. Today, he fears the opposite. While evangelical scholarship has never been stronger, Noll is deeply concerned about an anti-intellectual church taken with conspiracy theories and partisan politics.</p> <p>Patreon Bonus segment: <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/posts/66264481/\">https://www.patreon.com/posts/66264481/</a></p> <p>News Segment<br /> 0:00 - Intro<br /> 2:31 - Supreme Court leak - initial reactions<br /> 8:49 - Changing views on abortion within evangelical Christianity<br /> 19:29 - Overreactions on both sides<br /> 33:48 - Upsides<br /> 42:55 - Downsides<br /> 47:32 - “The Southernization of the Pro-Life Movement”<br /> Resources mentioned:<br /> Advisory Opinions podcast - “Making Sense of the Supreme Court Leak”<br /> Part 1: <a href= \"https://advisoryopinions.thedispatch.com/p/making-sense-of-the-supreme-court?s=r\"> https://advisoryopinions.thedispatch.com/p/making-sense-of-the-supreme-court?s=r</a><br />  <br /> Part 2: <a href= \"https://advisoryopinions.thedispatch.com/p/making-sense-of-the-supreme-court-8db?s=r\"> https://advisoryopinions.thedispatch.com/p/making-sense-of-the-supreme-court-8db?s=r</a><br />  <br /> “If Roe is Overturned, Where Should the Pro-Life Movement Go Next?” by Tish Harrison Warren - <a href= \"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/08/opinion/abortion-roe-dobbs-pro-life.html\"> https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/08/opinion/abortion-roe-dobbs-pro-life.html</a><br />  <br /> “Apocalypse Now: How the Left and Right Get Danger Wrong” by Michael Wear - <a href= \"https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2022/april-web-only/political-apocalypse-christianity-right-left-evangelicals.html\"> https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2022/april-web-only/political-apocalypse-christianity-right-left-evangelicals.html</a><br />  <br /> “This Really Is a Different Pro-Life Movement” by Daniel K.
