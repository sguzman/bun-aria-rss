  "description": "<p>You guys, we've covered A LOT of garbage on this podcast, but somehow THIS insanity is the first one to warrant an actual trigger warning. So here's the head up, THESE BITCHES think abortion, sexual assault, rape, incest, school shootings, racism, homophobia, hate speech and AIDS are HILARIOUS! So they talk about it a lot. IN THE LEAST. SENSITIVE. WAY. POSSIBLE.Â </p>\n\n\n<p>So now, welcome behind the scenes of Hell House--a 'haunted house' where a bunch of SUPER JUDGY kids from a Dalas Pentecostal church play out depictions of Hell as they imagine it. You guys, this is \"Glee\" on, like, steroids. If steroids made you terrible, boring, sheltered, racist, and annoying.</p>\n",
