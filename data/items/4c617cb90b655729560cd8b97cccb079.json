The benefits that are up for grabs? The ins and outs of fat, fibre, protein, various micronutrients and much more.\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\nResources:\nNourish by Brenda Davis, RD and Reshma Shah, MD\nBrenda Davis on Twitter and Instagram\nDr Reshma Shah on Instagram\nHealth Canada's 2019 dietary guidelines\nNutrikynd Essential 8\n\nWant to support the show?\nIf you are enjoying the Plant Proof podcast a great way to support the show is by leaving a review on the Apple podcast app. It only takes a few minutes and helps more people find the episodes.\n\nSimon Hill, Nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist\nCreator of Plantproof.com and host of the Plant Proof Podcast\nAuthor of The Proof is in the Plants\nConnect with me on Instagram and Twitter\nDownload my two week meal plan\nLearn more about your ad choices.
