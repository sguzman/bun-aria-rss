  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane didn't love the pathetic hatchet job Bryant Gumbel and Soledad O'Brien produced last night for HBO on his new employer. Blind Mike joins to break down this sad excuse for journalism. Minihane searches in vane for idiots to defend HBO and explains why he spiked an interview with conservative firebrand Candace Owens after she backed down from a controversial take on flag burning. Fresh off the lucrative sale of his most recent work of art, Blind Mike reveals that he has not met his girlfriend's parents after seven months of dating. Minihane pans his producer's decision to take a 3-week honeymoon in Europe.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
