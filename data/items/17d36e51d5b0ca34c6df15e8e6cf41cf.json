  "description": "Hunter Biden sat down with ABC and gave VERY misleading answers to softball questions. It’s incredible how the media lets him slide but argues that Giuliani and Trump did the EXACT same thing! Senator Rand Paul joins to discuss his new book, “The Case Against Socialism,” and his take on Turkey, Syria, and the Kurds. LeBron James claimed that Rockets GM Daryl Morey was uninformed about Hong Kong, but James only proved that he puts the wealth of the NBA over the suffering population of China. Mark and Amber Archer, producers of the upcoming documentary “Inwood Drive,” describe their disturbing interview with Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, the Illinois abortion doctor who hoarded dead babies on his property, and how revenge fueled him.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
