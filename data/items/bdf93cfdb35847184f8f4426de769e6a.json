Loyal Garage listeners were emailing and bringing attention to the strange situation up in Toronto. For nearly eight years men had been practically disappearing right off of the streets of Toronto. This didn’t go unnoticed by police. In fact the police opened two major investigations to address the situation. The problem, neither investigation provided any answers. Until January, 2018 when the cases of Toronto’s missing men broke wide open. This week we discuss the continuing investigation into Canada’s most recent and very prolific serial killer.Beer of the Week - Keefe’s Irish Stout by Granite BreweryGarage Grade 4 out of 5 bottle caps</p>\n<p>Find the full archive of True Crime Garage for free only on Stitcher, as well as exclusive bonus episodes of True Crime Garage: Off The Record, on Stitcher Premium.
