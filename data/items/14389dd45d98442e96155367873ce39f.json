  "description": "Supreet Raju and her husband & co-founder, Gaurav Gupta are huge food and travel enthusiasts, exploring the blockchain industry together since 2017. While working and researching projects in the market, they noticed a consistent failure in making blockchain products truly accessible to general audiences. Even simple products were made to sound complex, which attracted no one except developers and tech-geeks. With increasing global interest in crypto & blockchain, they felt the need to create something simple, educational & user-friendly to onboard the next wave of adoption - which culminated into OneRare.<br /><br />The future of technology and consumer adoption is leaning more and more into the evolution of blockchain and how NFT's, the Metaverse, and more will play a bigger role in the future of restaurants, food supply chain as well as consumer adoption, and pop culture. We dive deep into this podcast in a way that will explode your mind with our special interview.",
