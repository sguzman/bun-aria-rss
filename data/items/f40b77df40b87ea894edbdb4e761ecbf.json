  "description": "<p>My guest today, Blair Imani, grew up in a house where sitting quiet in the face of any level of injustice was just not an option. Whether it was advocating for the needs of a sibling or standing up to right a wrong in her community, her parents set a powerful example and invited Blair to always rise to the challenge. And that’s exactly what she’s done.&nbsp;</p><br><p>But, along the way, Blair also discovered, there are different ways to make a difference, and we each need to figure out how to take up the mantle of change, while also honoring our unique circumstances and needs, and that includes acknowledging our own, very personal psychological and physical wellbeing.&nbsp;</p><p>Building on this, Blair transitioned from organizing and activism to focusing on education, but in a way only she could do - harnessing the power, reach, interactivity and visual impact of social media by creating short, punchy, informative and entertaining bursts of wisdom and inspiration she calls her Smarter in Seconds series, which, at this point, has become a global movement.</p><br><p>Now a writer, mental health advocate, award-winning educator, and historian living at the intersections of Black, Queer, and Muslim identity, Blair is the bestselling author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3v5h6lJ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Read This to Get Smarter, Making Our Way Home</em></a>, and <em>Modern HERstory</em>.
