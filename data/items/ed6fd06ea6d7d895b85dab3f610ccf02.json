Or maybe you know her as the better half of the world’s most successful film director, James Cameron – the incomparable mind behind the biggest cinematic blockbusters of all time: Aliens, Terminator, Titanic and of course Avatar – the highest grossing movie ever.</p><p>But Suzy Amis Cameron is so much more than all that. In addition to raising five kids, she is a pioneering environmental activist. A passionate philanthropist. An education innovator. And the maverick co-founder (along with her sister Rebecca) of MUSE. Grabbing international headlines last year when it became the first U.S. school to implement a 100% plant-based school lunch program, MUSE is an incredibly progressive, paradigm breaking K-12 institution devoted to sustainability; creative & critical thinking; and preparing young people&nbsp;to live consciously within themselves, one another and the planet.&nbsp;A pretty great vision if you ask me.</p><p>A living example of selfless advocacy in action, for the last 25 years Suzy has tirelessly dedicated herself to an array of environmental causes, working non-stop to reform education; combat global climate change; raze our execrable system of animal agriculture; overhaul our fatal addiction to the standard American diet; defeat chronic lifestyle disease; and engineer a better, healthier food system for all.</p><p>Towards this end, in 2014 James and Suzy founded <a href=\"http://foodchoicetaskforce.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Food Choice Taskforce,</a> a non-profit organization targeting the impact of animal agriculture on climate change to mobilize a global shift in food choice.&nbsp;She is also a founder of <a href=\"http://foodforestorganics.co.nz/\" target=\"_blank\">Food Forest Organics,</a> a New Zealand-based plant-based cafe and marketplace, and <a href=\"http://redcarpetgreendress.com/home/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Carpet Green Dress,</a> showcasing socially and environmentally responsible fashions.</p><p>This is a great conversation about her extraordinary life. It’s a conversation about the intricate, intertwined relationship between our actions and the biosphere. It’s about championing sustainable values – from what we do, to what we wear, to how we teach our children, to the food we eat. It's about&nbsp;how our consumer choices impact our personal health and the current and future health of this spinning blue globe we call home. And of course, it’s about what it’s like to be married to Hollywood’s most successful director.</p><p>Specific topics covered include:</p><br><p>* the impact of ‘Forks Over Knives’</p><p>* environmental concerns and advocacy</p><p>* animal agriculture as the center of all health issues</p><p>* health sector and environmentalist summit</p><p>* Chatham House research on agriculture & environment</p><p>* communicating with the average person the powers of a plant-based diet</p><p>* bringing about hope by changing what’s on our plate</p><p>* the importance of support systems</p><p>* MUSE School & MUSE Global</p><p>* educating the community on the plant-based lifestyle</p><p>* sustainability pledge & One Meal A Day</p><p>* our youth, the global champions of tomorrow</p><p>* typical day in the life of the Cameron’s</p><p>* sustainable fashion</p><p>* future projects to catalyze change</p><br><p>Suzy stirs me to do and be better.&nbsp;Listen in, and&nbsp;be equally inspired.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><br><p>Listen & Subscribe on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rich-roll-podcast/id582272991?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes</a> |</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
