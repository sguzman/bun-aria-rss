  "description": "Our audiobook this week is LAST CALL CASANOVA by Karla Doyle\n\nI’m back in Hope Harbor, the little town I can’t stay away from, for my buddy’s wedding to the love of his life. They’re perfect together. I’m happy for them, but that kind of relationship isn’t in my wheelhouse. Not anymore. Everything changes once there’s a picture of you holding an oversized check splashed across the internet. When it’s public knowledge you won the lottery and have ten million in the bank, everybody wants a piece of you.\n\nBeen there, got burned, and have the scorch marks to prove it. Money’s not the only thing I keep locked up now. My heart’s in the vault too. But there’s one piece of me I’ve been happy to share since then, and it’s guaranteed to satisfy. Looking for a good time? I’m your man. Just don’t look for more. That’s the rule. Or it was, until I met Mya.\n\nHope Harbor is full of gorgeous fish happy to hop on my hook anytime I’m in town. Too bad the only one I want doesn’t fall for my lines, and has no interest in my pole. Pretty sure she’d be happy if I took a long walk off the end of the short pier and never resurfaced.\n\nThe more Mya pushes me away, the more I want to reel her in. The truth is—I’m the one who’s hooked. And one night together is all it takes to know I never want to be released.\n\nGET THE eBOOK NOW: https://amzn.to/3ONp368\nKarla Doyle: https://amzn.to/3OKoHNB\nDad Bod Wingman: https://amzn.to/3xWMW4p\nResorting to Love: https://amzn.to/3nizt29\nGiveaway – https://bit.ly/3buQ93F\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nOther Mentions\nHis Fight by KL Donn\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nLatest Alexa Riley Releases: https://bit.ly/3qrQpVS\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\nAlexa Riley TikTok: https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdUryXr9/\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
