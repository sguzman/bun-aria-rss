  "description": "<p>BELIEVE IN SOMETHING GREATER. There are two types of winners I’ve observed. Both of them have confidence. But one winner, when asked how they did it, answers, “I am the greatest.” The other winner,  when asked how they did it, answers, “God is the greatest.” Are you putting pressure on yourself to succeed or fail? Or are you putting your strength in something greater? Whether or not you consider yourself a religious person, know that you are not going through life in a vacuum. You’re never on your journey alone. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about spirituality, loss, and dreaming big with one of the most inspirational performers on the planet: Lindsey Stirling. Lindsey Stirling is a modern-day \"Dancing Violinist\" who got her start on American’s Got Talent in 2010. Since then, she has over 11 million subscribers on YouTube. She has been called \"The Hip Hop Violinist\" due to her twist on songs from today's hits, as well as creating an electronic / dubstep album of original compositions. Lindsey has learned to use her spirituality to inspire her to do things she never thought possible. She shares the daily practices that ground her and retrain her brain.  So get ready to learn how to live intentionally and with gratitude on Episode 845.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhy do we lose the ability to dream?
