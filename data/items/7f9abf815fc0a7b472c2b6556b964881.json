  "description": "<p>One hundred days. It’s undeniably an arbitrary number. But a lot has happened in that time. We check in with past Daily guests about the Trump presidency so far. Guests: David Green, the head of Hobby Lobby, who took a fight over conservative values all the way to the Supreme Court; Dr. Mitch Jacques, a doctor in coal country whose patients hate Obamacare — but may need it most; and Mark Napier, an Arizona sheriff on the Mexican border, where illegal immigration is part of the landscape.
