The forest's official name is Aokigahara Forest and is known for being very quiet. Aokigahara is notorious though for its reputation as a place people go to die by their own hand. Most people call this wooded area \"The Suicide Forest.\" There are rumors that demons run the place. And the tales of hauntings are numerous. Diane and Denise share the Japanese culture around suicide and why this place seems to be cursed. Moment in Oddity features sword swallowing and This Day in History deals with the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/02/hgb-podcast-30-aokigahara-forest-in.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/02/hgb-podcast-30-aokigahara-forest-in.html</a></p>",
