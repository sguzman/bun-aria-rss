  "description": "<p>It’s all about Madawaska as Steve and Mike have already left the cozy confines of the Watertown studio for parts north. That leaves Kirk stranded with Matt and DEC, putting his talent to the test. But if anyone can make these two lightweights sound good, Kirk can. Madawaska Stacey celebrates her new found fame (0:35:09). Snoop Dogg threatens Gayle King with violence for daring to ask benign questions about Kobe’s legacy (0:55:38). Kirk gets a live travel update from weary traveler, Blind Mike (01:39:08). Daddy DEC, the song and the person are together at last (2:04:11).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
