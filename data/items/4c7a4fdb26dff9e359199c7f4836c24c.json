  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys recap last night's Monday Night Football game between the Bucs and the Rams and whether or not Tampa Bay is in trouble, and how the Rams need to be considered a real threat going forward in the NFC. Joining the show, as always, is the Quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat, Aaron, and AJ chat about this weekend's game against the Colts, and all of his thoughts including his performance, what he said to MVS after the game, he teaches everyone about his process, chats about the gifts he got his teammates, and what he's expecting from David Bakhtiari, plus much more (33:44-1:20:33). Later, Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, former Saints and Panthers great, Roman Harper joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about his thoughts on the Saints so far this season, how he's not quite sold on Taysom Hill just yet, some stories from times he's played against Aaron Rodgers, what Cam Newton is like as a teammate, and much more (1:23:17-1:44:48).
