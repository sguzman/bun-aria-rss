  "description": "<p>Today there exists no shortage of outlier detection algorithms in the\nliterature, yet the complementary and critical problem of unsupervised outlier\nmodel selection (UOMS) is vastly understudied. In this work we propose ELECT, a\nnew approach to select an effective candidate model, i.e. an outlier detection\nalgorithm and its hyperparameter(s), to employ on a new dataset without any\nlabels. At its core, ELECT is based on meta-learning; transferring prior\nknowledge (e.g. model performance) on historical datasets that are similar to\nthe new one to facilitate UOMS. Uniquely, it employs a dataset similarity\nmeasure that is performance-based, which is more direct and goal-driven than\nother measures used in the past. ELECT adaptively searches for similar\nhistorical datasets, as such, it can serve an output on-demand, being able to\naccommodate varying time budgets. Extensive experiments show that ELECT\nsignificantly outperforms a wide range of basic UOMS baselines, including no\nmodel selection (always using the same popular model such as iForest) as well\nas more recent selection strategies based on meta-features.\n</p>",
