  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The word “capitalism” has become incredibly loaded over the years. And since the term was actually popularized by Karl Marx to be the foil for his own ideology, that’s fairly understandable. It brings to mind all of the very worst aspects embodied by the elite, greedy, rent-seeking Gordon Geckos of the world, hoarding their capital resources like dragons on a pile of gold and profiting from the hard work of laborers while doing nothing productive themselves. This characterization, while incredibly common, is simply incorrect. Join Antony Davies and James Harrigan as they discuss the actual meaning of capitalism and more on this week’s episode of Words and Numbers.</span></p> <p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1510/1510.03952.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> MIT study of commute times</span></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/521911/universal-law-of-commuting-discovered-in-african-european-and-us-mobile-phone-data/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marchetti’s constant</span></a></p> <p><a href= \"http://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/average-commute-time-by-state.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commute times in the 50 states</span></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://fee.org/articles/california-wants-to-force-corporate-boards-to-adopt-illegal-gender-quotas/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California requires companies to place women on boards</span></a></p> <p><strong>Foolishness of the Week:</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.rawstory.com/2018/08/fox-news-host-laura-ingraham-suggests-government-take-facebook-twitter-like-public-utilities/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laura Ingraham wants Facebook to be a public utility</span></a></p> <p><strong>Topic of the Week: Capitalism:</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://adamsmithslostlegacy.blogspot.com/2009/01/free-capitalist-13-january-here-carries.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capitalism</span></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.mruniversity.com/courses/principles-economics-microeconomics/price-system-spontaneous-order\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prices as signals</span></a></p> <p><strong>Join the Conversation:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/antonydavies\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Antony Davies on Twitter</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesRHarrigan\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">James R.
