  "description": "<p>By 1975, George Lucas knew exactly what he wanted Star Wars to look like, but what it would sound like was another story altogether. Lucas was tired of Sci-Fi’s typical synthetic and electronic cliches; he wanted a sonic world that felt organic and personal. So he hired a young sound designer named Ben Burtt, and sent him out into the world with a recorder and microphone. </p><p>Burtt would need to blend and manipulate his recordings in order to achieve original sound designs, customized in every way to help bring the Skywalker saga to life. Like a detective, Burtt would have to hunt for the perfect buzz, bark, or hum to make Star Wars come alive. And in the process, he and Lucas would help to change the way audiences experience sound in films.</p><p><br></p><p>Support us by supporting our sponsors!</p><p><strong>The Art of Shaving </strong>-&nbsp;Visit The Art of Shaving at any of their 100 retail locations, or shop online at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://theartofshaving.com/\" target=\"_blank\">theartofshaving.com</a>&nbsp;and use the code AI to get 15% off your first order</p><p><strong>Cayman Jack</strong>- Cayman Jack provides premium prepared cocktails for those with good taste and little time.
