  "description": "<p>There are not a lot of positive messages in the media today. Even when great information that provides a lot of real world value for people shows up, it's often disguised in sensationalized story; something that makes you watch but doesn't necessarily make you think.</p> <p>I'm so proud of the friends in my life who, as of late, have been making their way onto major network television. They are great people and great teachers who are sliding their messages of positivity and health into the mainstream and it's really amazing to witness it all.</p> <p>No one is more fitting for this mission than my friend Drew Manning. Drew has been on my show before and absolutely blew me away with his story. He started off as a typical gym-going, strict diet-eating, protein shake-guzzling \"fit\" person working as a personal trainer. He eventually found that he couldn't relate in a deep way to a lot of his clients' weight struggles, so he decided to run an experiment to change that. Drew took it upon himself to gain over 70 pounds in the course of six months and the transformation that took place was shocking!</p> <p>Not only did he look like a totally different person, but he thought and felt like a different person, and the veil that disconnected him from understanding his clients started to be lifted. Drew knows that his stint being significantly overweight pales in comparison to those who've struggled for years with their weight. But it opened up the bridge to understanding, and his small experiment caught on like wildfire.</p> <p>Drew proceeded to lose those 70+ pounds over the following six months (with immense struggle and heartache) and the experience was properly dubbed the Fit2Fat2Fit experience. Now, nearly 5 years later, Drew's experience is being duplicated by fit trainers from all over the country, to put themselves into the client's shoes for a bit in hopes to find more empathy and a better way to help people become the best version of themselves.
