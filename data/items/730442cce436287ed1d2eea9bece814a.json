  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, we now have systemic anarchy! The left never had respect for peaceful protests, they hated the Tea Party, they hated small business owners protesting lock down orders, but they praise the looters and rioters burning down our streets, shooting innocents, and running people over. If the peaceful protesters know that ANTIFA, and other professional out-of-state brick and bomb-throwers, are taking advantage of these protests why do they continue to allow it? This does not reflect America, America was united in its repulsion against the former officer that grossly killed George Floyd. Yet, the Democrats, Joe Biden, and the media show no condemnation for the riots and looting, just for President Trump.  In fact they end their appearances with a call to get out and vote, as if the riots and the looting have some sort of kinship with the Democrat Party. Hating Trump will not correct the mistake of voting for Democrats. Then, what we do have in America is systemic poverty and systemic under-education. Irrespective of race, people want to succeed financially and have a chance at a good education and live in safe community. It’s as if Democrats think that people in poor neighborhoods like riots and looting — no they don't! Plus,Conservative Review Editor Daniel Horowitz calls in to discuss the expedited indictment in the George Floyd case. He also cited crime statistics which show a higher number of unarmed white people killed than unarmed black people in 2019.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
