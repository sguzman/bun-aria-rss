  "description": "<p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul remains in strong position to win a full term over Long Island Congressman Lee Zeldin. That’s according to the latest poll from the Siena College Research Institute, which finds Hochul up 54-to-37 percent among likely voters. In fact, Democrats are leading all statewide elections in the poll, as Republicans hope to break a 20-year losing streak. The poll also finds that when it comes to likely voters from both parties, it’s still the economy, stupid. For analysis we speak with Siena’s Steve Greenberg.</p>",
