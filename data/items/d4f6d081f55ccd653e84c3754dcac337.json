  "description": "<p>Facebookâ€™s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/\">hackercup</a> just ended. It is the first time I competed, and I made it to through the qualifications and round 1 into round 2. I unfortunately got stuck on the second question with an algorithm which was not fast enough. I still ended in the top 500, so I got a facebook hackercup T-shirt!</p>",
