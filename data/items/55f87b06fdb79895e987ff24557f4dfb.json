  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the war in Europe which begain in 1618 and continued on such a scale and with such devastation that its like was not seen for another three hundred years. It pitched Catholics against Protestants, Lutherans against Calvinists and Catholics against Catholics across the Holy Roman Empire, drawing in their neighbours and it lasted for thirty gruelling years, from the Defenestration of Prague to the Peace of Westphalia of 1648.  Many more civilians died than soldiers, and famine was so great that even cannibalism was excused. This topic was chosen from several hundred suggested by listeners this autumn.\n\nThe image above is a detail from a painting of The Battle of White Mountain on 7-8 November 1620, by Pieter Snayers (1592-1667)\n\nWith\n\nPeter Wilson\nChichele Professor of the History of War at the University of Oxford\n\nUlinka Rublack\nProfessor of Early Modern European History at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of St John’s College\n\nAnd\n\nToby Osborne\nAssociate Professor in History at Durham University\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
