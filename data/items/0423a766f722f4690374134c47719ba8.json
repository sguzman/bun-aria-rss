  "description": "<p>The author defined for each (commutative) Frobenius algebra a skein module of\nsurfaces in a $3$-manifold $M$ bounding a closed $1$-manifold $\\alpha \\subset\n\\partial M$. The surface components are colored by elements of the Frobenius\nalgebra. The modules are called the Bar-Natan modules of $(M,\\alpha )$. In this\narticle we show that Bar-Natan modules are colimit modules of functors\nassociated to Frobenius algebras, decoupling topology from algebra. The\nfunctors are defined on a category of $3$-dimensional compression bordisms\nembedded in cylinders over $M$ and take values in a linear category defined\nfrom the Frobenius algebra. The relation with the $1+1$-dimensional topological\nquantum field theory functor associated to the Frobenius algebra is studied. We\nshow that the geometric content of the skein modules is contained in a\ntunneling graph of $(M,\\alpha )$, providing a natural presentation of the\nBar-Natan module by application of the functor defined from the algebra. Such\npresentations have essentially been stated previously in work by the author and\nAsaeda-Frohman, using ad-hoc arguments. But they appear naturally on the\nbackground of the Bar-Natan functor and associated categorical considerations.\nWe discuss in general presentations of colimit modules for functors into module\ncategories in terms of minimal terminal sets of objects of the category in the\ncategorical setting. We also introduce a $2$-category version of the Bar-Natan\nfunctor, thereby in some way Bar-Natan modules of $(M,\\alpha )$.\n</p>",
