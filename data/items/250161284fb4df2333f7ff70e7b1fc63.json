  "description": "The Athens, Ga., rock group Of Montreal has built its reputation on wildly theatrical live performances. Sprung from the twisted imagination of flamboyant frontman Kevin Barnes, the band's shows include elaborate costumes and stage sets, synchronized dancing and massive bursts of psychedelic lighting effects. For Of Montreal's latest album, Paralytic Stalks, Barnes and his bandmates call their tour and stage show \"hallucinatory and transportive,\" with more than a dozen projection screens and strange, wandering creatures that look like amoebas. You can hear the spectacle unfold in this concert, recorded live from the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., on April 3. To watch video of this concert, visit npr.org/liveconcerts.",
