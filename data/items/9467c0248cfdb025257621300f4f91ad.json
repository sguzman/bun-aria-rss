Her job as assistant and photographer for a major social media influencer isn’t perfect, but it’s a rung on the ladder to bigger and better things. She’s confident she’ll one day take feature photos for National Geographic.\n\nSelf-made billionaire Braden Black didn’t get where he is by taking no for an answer. When a chance encounter with the refreshingly innocent and beautiful Skye piques his interest in more ways than one, he’s determined to make her submit.\n\nDating a billionaire soon has Skye in the middle of a Cinderella story…until the clock strikes midnight and Braden reveals his dark side. Heat sizzles between them, and Skye finds herself falling hard.\n\nBut Braden Black is no Prince Charming, and his dark desires are far from his only secret.\n\nFollow Me Darkly by Helen Hardt: https://bit.ly/3mzOjhL\nFollow Me Series: https://bit.ly/2KmSTmw\nThe Steel Brothers Saga: https://bit.ly/3p9sGqj\nMore books by Helen Hardt: https://bit.ly/3rdHciB\n\nAlexa Riley\nSanta’s Secret Baby: https://bit.ly/38oWmZN\nThe Winter Collection: https://bit.ly/38oWmZN \n\nOther Books Mentioned\nKerrigan Byrne, Courting Trouble\n\nYear-end books We Mentioned\nLaurann Dohner, Fury\nLast Hit\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins\nMidnight Sun by Stephanie Meyer\nA Heart of Blood and Ashes byMilla Vane\nA Court of Thorns and Roses by Sara J Maas\nThe Duke With the Dragon Tattoo by Kerrigan Byrne\nGrigori by Lauren Smith\nTable For Three by Lainey Reece\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nADS\nSnow&#039;s Spell by Loni Ree: https://amzn.to/2J8mGPc\nStroked by Lena Lucas: https://amzn.to/3ar4Oue\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
