  "title": "Monica Kim, \"The Interrogation Rooms of the Korean War: The Untold History\" (Princeton UP, 2019)",
  "description": "Monica Kim provides a fresh look at the Korean War with a people-centered approach that studies the experiences of prisoners of war. As the first major conflict after the 1949 Geneva Conventions, POW repatriation during the Korean War became a new battleground for the recognition of state sovereignty and a larger tool for political propaganda. The Interrogation Rooms of the Korean War: The Untold History (Princeton University Press, 2019) opens with a captured Korean solider who must navigate what identities and documentation to leverage depending on his captor. The extraordinary stories of everyday people involved in the Korean War illustrate how the effects of war span past and future conflicts.  The thoroughly researched book is full of fascinating stories and sheds light on lessons from the Korean War that are still relevant today.\nBeth Windisch is a national security practitioner.
