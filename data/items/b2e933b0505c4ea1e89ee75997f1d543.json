Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley (1946), \"The Death of the Author\" by Roland Barthes (1967), \"What is an Author?\" by Michel Foucault (1969), and “Against Theory” by Steven Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels (1982). When you're trying to figure out what, say, a poem means, isn't the best way to do that to just ask the author? Most of these guys say no, and that's supposed to reveal something about the nature of meaning.</p> <p><a href=\"http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/support\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Support us</a> for access to the ad-free, unbroken <a href= \"http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/05/07/ep189-authorial-intent-citizen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Citizen Edition</a> plus a <a href= \"http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/05/07/ep89-follow-up-citizen/\"> one-hour follow-up conversation</a>.</p>",
