  "description": "<p>At one time or another, most of us have considered giving up making our art. In this episode, we share our own experiences and discuss why this feeling arises. Perhaps we have ambitions that exceed our current skill level and this leads to disappointment with the results. Sometimes, we are not creating what we really want to create, leading to boredom and burn-out. It is also common for people to become discouraged when they lack a support system and even when they have a spouse or partner who actively discourages their art-making. The conversation leads us to conclude that all these issues can be addressed - we can find support elsewhere, we can improve our skills through education and practice, and we can start to make art that we really love instead of just doing the same old thing.</p>\n<p>This week we also tackle the topic of returning after a break and offer our different perspectives on how to get back into your work after the holidays.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Find out about Alice's Connected Artist Club and join the interest list here:<a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/artists/\"> <strong>https://alicesheridan.com/artists/</strong></a></p>\n<p>Link to louise’s Flickr album of self portraits <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/63799511@N05/albums/72157663186899771\"><u>https://www.flickr.com/photos/63799511@N05/albums/72157663186899771</u></a></p>\n<p>Link to studio tidy post <a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/how-to-kon-mari-your-studio/\">How to Kon Mari Your Studio</a></p>\n<p>See Alice's sketchbook progress page <a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/artjuice51\">HERE</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nourkarim-eddin.co.uk\">Nour the artist/Ocado delivery driver!</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>or Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Credits<br>\n\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
