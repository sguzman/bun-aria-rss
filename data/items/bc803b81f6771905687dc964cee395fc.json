Unfortunately this is one of those times where you might be tempted to overreact as you try to take control of a situation. It makes us think of when someone is diagnosed with cancer- yes there are instances where you need to immediately treat it, but there are also cases where it’s best to not take any drastic measures and instead just monitor the situation. We want to avoid the kneejerk reaction and the ‘just do something!’ mindset, when instead there are other steps we should be taking. So that’s what we’re talking about today- why we’re experiencing high inflation, how concerned we should be, and then the many different steps that you should consider in order to keep yourself from freaking out over inflation.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed Chocolate Pecan Porter by Temblor Brewing- a big thanks to Ryan and our friends there at the brewery for donating this delicious craft beer to the podcast!
