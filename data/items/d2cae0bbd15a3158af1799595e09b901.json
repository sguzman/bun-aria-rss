We wanted to follow up by going in depth on how we achieved this milestone in browser performance.<br /></i><br />Since the launch of Chrome in 2008, one of our <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/developers/core-principles/\">core principles</a> has been to build the fastest browser, whether you're on your phone or laptop.  We have never strayed from our performance mission, and are always analyzing and optimizing every part of Chrome. We're proud to announce that Chrome scores over 300 on <a href=\"https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.0/\">Apple’s Speedometer 2.0 benchmark suite</a> on the M1 MacBook, the highest score we’ve ever seen. In this <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/search/label/the%20fast%20and%20the%20curious\">The Fast and the Curious post</a> we'll go behind the scenes to share all the work that went into making Chrome blazingly fast.<br /><br />“If you can’t measure it you can’t improve it” – this sentiment has driven a large part of our work to improve Chrome’s performance since the early days. For measuring browser performance, there has been a long history of various benchmarks that aim to provide test workloads for browsers to track their performance. Making these benchmarks both reflective of the real and ever changing world, while also being consistent, is a challenge. Chrome uses a combination of internal benchmarking infrastructure and public, industry-standard benchmarks, to continuously measure Chrome’s performance. For comparing browsers’ JavaScript performance, <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/8063/speedometer-2-0-a-benchmark-for-modern-web-app-responsiveness/\">Apple’s Speedometer 2.0 benchmark</a> is the most reflective of the real world, and most broadly used today. <br /><br />We’ve been tracking our performance on Speedometer 2.0 ever since it came out:</span><div><span><br /></span></div><div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjJwPLEz6Ue7PuA_LCuxSOmk8URK3D2sKlSplRCSxqmXNcJG8T-5Mi9yCYDXtTNfQCNKqofq5h8qPoSEG7E30gZmOgH4f1JfNrcnDsFE2VulKu521lW2kLyDHDez8NiLA99aIinDJqCdtyRsxRN2Be3Uo-UBUDgzsh5uX2N25XNRRg6ZEhFce_M8xqxdw=s1864\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"968\" data-original-width=\"1864\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjJwPLEz6Ue7PuA_LCuxSOmk8URK3D2sKlSplRCSxqmXNcJG8T-5Mi9yCYDXtTNfQCNKqofq5h8qPoSEG7E30gZmOgH4f1JfNrcnDsFE2VulKu521lW2kLyDHDez8NiLA99aIinDJqCdtyRsxRN2Be3Uo-UBUDgzsh5uX2N25XNRRg6ZEhFce_M8xqxdw=w1313-h682\" width=\"1313\" /></a></div><br /><span><br /></span></div><div><span><br /><i>Beginning with the M87 release, Chrome shipped on the M1 based Mac and began measuring the speed of Chrome on the new CPU reflected in the red line above.</i><br /><br />Since 2015, we’ve been measuring Chrome’s Speedometer scores on a 13-inch MacBook. In the graph above, you can see just some of the many projects that have helped make a dramatic improvement in performance. You can learn about <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/fast-properties\">fast lookups</a>, <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/launching-ignition-and-turbofan\">the Ignition + TurboFan compilers</a>, <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/scanner\">blazingly fast parsing</a>, <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/adaptor-frame\">faster JS calls</a>, <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/spectre\">Spectre</a>, <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/pointer-compression\">Pointer Compression</a>, <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/short-builtin-calls\">Short builtins</a>, <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/sparkplug\">Sparkplug</a> and much more on <a href=\"https://v8.dev/\">V8.dev</a>. You’ll notice some projects actually decrease our Speedometer score, as building an entire browser is about managing trade offs. For example, with pointer compression, we were willing to take a small performance hit for the large memory savings it provided. Similarly, when the <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/spectre\">Spectre CPU exploit</a> hit, we traded off performance to help guarantee the safety of our users.<br /><br />The result of years of work has been an 83% improvement in Speedometer score, a dramatic improvement we are happy to deliver to our users. With Apple’s introduction of the M1 CPU, combined with <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2021/05/chrome-is-faster-in-m91.html\">Sparkplug</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2021/12/faster-chrome-let-the-compiler-do-the-work.html#:~:text=But%20we%20can%20do%20more%20(ThinLTO)\">LTO+PGO</a>, Chrome now scores over 300 - the highest score any browser has ever achieved \\o/.<br /><br />We are excited to achieve this milestone in performance and look forward to delivering even more performance improvements with each release. Stay tuned to this blog to stay up to date on all things speed. <br /><br />Posted by Thomas Nattestad, Chrome Product Manager<br /><br /><i>Footnote:Data source for M1 MacBook statistics: <a href=\"https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.0/\">Speedometer 2.0</a> comparing Chrome 99.0.4812.0 --enable-features=CanvasOopRasterization --use-cmd-decoder=passthrough vs. Safari 15.2 17612.3.6.1.6 on a MacBook Pro (14\", 2021), Apple M1 Max, 10 cores (8 performance, 2 efficiency), 32 GPU cores, 64gb device.</i><br /></span></div>",
