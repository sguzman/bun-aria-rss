  "description": "The new Netflix film <em>Don't Look Up</em> has a crazy Academy Awards pedigree. Writer-director Adam McKay won an Oscar for <em>The Big Short </em>and the Oscar-studded cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence as scientists who discover that a massive comet is hurtling toward Earth. The only problem: They can't get the media's attention (represented here by Cate Blanchett and Tyler Perry) or get the president (played by Meryl Streep) to care. But with all these stars in the mix, did <em>Don't Look Up</em> miss the mark? ",
