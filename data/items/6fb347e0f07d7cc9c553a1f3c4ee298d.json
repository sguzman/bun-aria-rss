  "description": "<p><p>Jimmi Simpson stops by to talk Always Sunny, Westworld and his new show Perpetual Grace, on Epix. Gina Brillon talks about touring with Gabriel Iglesias, why NYC sucks, why Chicago is really proud of their alleys, and if being a twin makes you crazy automatically. John is very, very bad at negotiating. The Lion King stinks. The worst shirt ever, Big Data, Jeremy Lin hits rock bottom. Voicemails include hard dicks in the textbooks, my girl doesn't watch TV, and could a 10 year old live your life.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
