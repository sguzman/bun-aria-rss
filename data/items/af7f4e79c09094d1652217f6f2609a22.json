  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including a discussion of whether the Nike Zoom Vaporfly 4% provides runners with an unfair advantage. Several long-distance runners asked the sport’s governing body, the IAAF, to investigate the shoes, which played a central role in a pair of record-setting performances recently. Among them: Eliud Kipchoge became the first person to run a 26.2-mile race in under two hours at an unofficial event in Vienna. Also discussed is Major League Baseball’s desire to implement changes to the minor-league game, including the contraction of some 40 clubs. One of the plans would convert some teams from the lower-level minors -- rookie ball and lower Class A -- into a so-called Dream League of undrafted players looking to make it in the game. The current operating agreement between the big-league clubs and their 160 minor-league affiliates expires in 2020. Also talked about is the Cubs’ new regional sports network, Marquee Sports Network, getting a deal with AT&T, which includes DirecTV.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
