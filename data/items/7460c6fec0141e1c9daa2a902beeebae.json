They are effusive in their praise for the Panthers at +5 this week vs Dallas, and even demand action on the lowly New York Jets as sizable underdogs. Plus listeners get a Foxhole Pick Of The Week, the identification of a Rah Rah Mike Tomlin Spot, and so much more.</p><p>TNF (9 MIN)</p><p>NYG NO (15 MIN)</p><p>KC PHL (19 MIN)</p><p>BUF HOU (23 MIN)</p><p>CAR DAL (24 MIN)</p><p>CLE MIN (31 MIN)</p><p>DET CHI (34 MIN)</p><p>TEN NYJ (37 MIN)</p><p>IND MIA (39 MIN)</p><p>WFT AZ (40 MIN)</p><p>SEA SF (43 MIN)</p><p>AZ LAR (46 MIN)</p><p>PIT GB (48 MIN)</p><p>BALT DEN (50 MIN)</p><p>TB NE (52 MIN)</p><p>MNF (55 MIN)</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
