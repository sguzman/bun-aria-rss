  "description": "Thank you for tuning in for another episode of Tin Foil Hat with Sam Tripoli.  This episode we go deep maybe too deep.  We welcome twitter internet researcher Jay Kay to the to discuss her theory that Jonbenet never existed and it was all psyop special casted on all of us.  Now Jay Kay went even deeper on the show so it gets really crazy.  The views expressed by Jay Kay are really out there and not that of anyone else on the show.  I do want to say that Jay Kay is not a podcaster, an author trying to sell a book, a fit maker or anything other than a researcher.  This was her first podcast and she might not understand what can happen if you go little too deep.  She didn't ask to come on I asked her.  So she isn't a polished presenter so I ask you cut her some slack.  I asked her on because I thought her thread was very interesting.  If you don't agree with something she said that is fine please just let it go.  I like her enthusiasm and would love to talk to her again.  Check out the thread she put together on Jonbenet that is really interesting.  I learned a lot of stuff that I didn't know about the case.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/humanvibration/status/1215115949235482626\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/humanvibration/status/1215115949235482626</a><br /><br />Please check out all of our platforms:<br />Our Youtube page<br />Youtube.com/SamTripoli<br /><br />Check out all the Tin Foil Hat Full Episode Videos at<br />brokensimulation.com<br /><br />My youtube.com<br />Youtube.com/SamTripoli<br /><br />Patreon:<br />Patreon.com/TinFoilHat<br /><br />Tshirts:<br />TinFoilHattshirts.com<br /><br />Cameo.com<br /><a href=\"http://www.cameo.com/samtripoli\" rel=\"noopener\">www.cameo.com/samtripoli</a><br /><br />Thank you to our sponsors:<br />Manscaped: Get 20% Off and Free Shipping with the code TINFOILHAT at Manscaped.com.
