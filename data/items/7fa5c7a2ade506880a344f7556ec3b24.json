Let’s look at some sentiment analysis examples applied to business problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>You can <strong>aggregate customer sentiments from free-form feedback data </strong>and determine if your customers are primarily promoters or detractors. You can then take corrective measures to gradually <em>rebuild trust with the detractors</em> and turn them into promoters.</li><li>You can <strong>keep your online platform clean and free from bullies </strong>by detecting hateful and inappropriate comments.</li><li>You can determine <strong>which employees are demotivated </strong>or about to quit based on their outlook from recent feedback, peer reviews, and manager feedback and provide a constructive path ahead for employees to succeed at the company.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, as you can see from these sentiment analysis examples, sentiment analysis is a versatile tool that can help you better understand employees and customers, keep platforms safe, provide customers with a better shopping and product selection experience, and learn from competitor brands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More importantly, when you combine <em>sentiment analysis</em> with other AI-driven technologies such as <em>text summarization,</em> you can get deeper, more powerful insights.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How are Businesses Using Sentiment Analysis? (Real-World Examples)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we know what sentiment analysis can help accomplish, let’s see how three companies are using sentiment analysis for a specific business purpose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>GAIL</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Great Wolf Lodge (GWL), a chain of resorts and indoor water parks, has expanded its broad digital strategy by using <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/3435118/introducing-gail-great-wolf-lodges-ai-for-pinpointing-guest-sentiment.html\">AI to classify customer comments based on sentiment</a>. They developed what they call the <em>Great Wolf Lodge’s Artificial Intelligence Lexicographer (GAIL)</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GWL capitalizes on the concept of net promoter score (NPS) to gauge the experience of individual customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of using an NPS score to determine customer satisfaction, GAIL determines if customers are <em>net promoter</em>s, <em>detractor</em>s, or <em>neutral parties </em>based on the free-text responses posted in monthly customer surveys. This is analogous to predicting if the customer sentiment is <em>positive</em>, <em>negative</em>, or <em>neutral</em>. GAIL essentially “reads” the comments and generates an opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"850\" height=\"447\" src=\"https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/image-12.png\" alt=\"sentiment analysis business application examples\" class=\"wp-image-8110\" srcset=\"https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/image-12.png 850w, https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/image-12-300x158.png 300w, https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/image-12-150x79.png 150w, https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/image-12-768x404.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" /><figcaption>Detractors, promoters, and how the NPS score is computed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Through this effort, the company hopes to understand its guests better and improve the customer experience. For example, by analyzing comments by detractors, Great Wolf Lodge would know areas in their service that need improvement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyzing this unstructured data manually would take far too long for humans. However, GAIL can <em>parse this data in seconds </em>and determine whether the author is a net promoter, detractor, or neutral party.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Meta</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta—with nearly 1.7 billion daily active users—naturally has content posted on the platform that violates its rules. Among this negative content is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ai-hate-speech-improves-unclear/\"><strong>hate speech</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Defining and detecting hate speech is one of the biggest political and technical challenges for Meta and similar platforms. Detecting hate speech is a type of sentiment analysis problem focused on content with overall negative implications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humans review the AI-flagged posts in the same way as posts reported by users. In fact, the platform removed 9.6 million pieces of content flagged as hate speech in the first quarter of 2020 alone. While the sentiment models alone may not be sufficient to control hate speech on the platform, the tool does capture a massive number of spam posts, significantly reducing the amount of manual work by humans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"475\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IOgGQI_H1HU69ZQOM6cIUxe0w4HGkla3hremcoHR-gt9xwog8TmcE0LdpCZwlGRyidpmJcnPWQ4B9FsY8CAm9TTvIb7ic0wqOtzVDob_VOEE-nLrPKIAKZGxZ13ZQBYd9US4J5eJzpzYZbPrDyk0CEo\" alt=\"text categorization example\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">The volume of AI-based hate speech removal on Facebook.

Ocean Spray first needed to understand consumer sentiment and behaviors around cranberry juice better so that they could innovate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically such innovation is done with the help of small focus groups of 10-15 people. However, Ocean Spray decided to leverage AI-driven analysis of thousands of online conversations, such as user reviews and tweets around cranberry juice, to really<em> listen at scale.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, instead of just classifying content like what Meta does, Ocean Spray leveraged <em>themes</em> and <em>opinion summaries</em> to understand consumer sentiment around specific topics. Through this analysis, Ocean Spray understood how consumers were using cranberry juice in real life, giving them ideas on how best to innovate and fill gaps in the marketplace.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research surfaced unexpected customer behaviors. For example, they found that women enjoyed cranberry juice as a substitute drink without the alcohol in place of cocktails. Such insights helped them launch<a href=\"https://news.oceanspray.com/2017-03-2017-Sip-Back-and-Unwind-With-a-Mocktail-Moment\"> two new beverage lines</a>, boosting revenues and helping them get out of an over-saturated segment of the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/sentiment-analysis-1024x1017.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8112\" width=\"773\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/sentiment-analysis-1024x1017.png 1024w, https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/sentiment-analysis-300x298.png 300w, https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/sentiment-analysis-150x150.png 150w, https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/sentiment-analysis-768x763.png 768w, https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/sentiment-analysis.png 1224w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px\" /><figcaption>A new beverage line by Ocean Spray in direct response to understanding consumer behaviors around cranberry juice.

Further, you have various ways to leverage sentiment information—from using it for new product innovation to improving the customer experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started with sentiment analysis, you first need to understand your business <strong>application</strong>. Consider these questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What would you like to know about your brand, customers, or employees? </li><li>How granular should the information be? </li><li>Do you just need sentiment information, or textual themes and summaries?</li><li><span style=\"background-color: var(--ast-global-color-5); font-size: 1rem;\">Are you planning to integrate the solution into your dashboards or perform an independent analysis?</span></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take an example. Say you need to understand the general sentiment in your company’s <em>support conversations</em>. You want to learn the ongoing “tone” and “mood” of your customers. Further, you want to visualize this within your dashboards. In such a case, you&#8217;d need to employ an <em><strong>emotion classifier</strong></em> to generate predictions on <em>relevant conversations</em>. You can then leverage those sentiments in your dashboards for downstream analysis.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01207v1.pdf\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"698\" height=\"612\" src=\"https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/sentiment-analysis-emotion-classification.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8121\" srcset=\"https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/sentiment-analysis-emotion-classification.png 698w, https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/sentiment-analysis-emotion-classification-300x263.png 300w, https://kavita-ganesan.com/wp-content/uploads/sentiment-analysis-emotion-classification-150x132.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px\" /></a><figcaption>Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions. The boxed emotions are commonly used for developing emotion classifiers.

But for others, you can leverage off-the-shelf tools such as <a href=\"https://medium.com/google-cloud/sentiment-analysis-using-google-cloud-machine-learning-552be9b9c39b\">Google’s Natural Language API</a> or the <a href=\"https://perspectiveapi.com/\">Perspective API</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, for a multi-faceted analysis, you’d have to combine <strong>off-the-shelf tools with custom pipelines and analysis </strong>to help you answer all questions for optimal decision-making. This is what one of my clients did. They combined insights from an independent off-the-shelf text analytics tool such as <strong>Netbase</strong> (extremely pricey, by the way) with custom-built pipelines for a complete market research analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are endless possibilities in how you can employ these sentiment analysis tools. But remember to let the application guide the solutions that you’ll employ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, over to you.
