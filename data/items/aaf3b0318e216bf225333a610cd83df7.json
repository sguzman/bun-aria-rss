Earlier models were rounder and louder, often suffering from the phenomenon of \"tunnel boom,\" where deafening compressed air would rush out of a tunnel after a train rushed in. But a moment of inspiration from engineer and birdwatcher Eiji Nakatsu led the system to be redesigned based on the aerodynamics of three species of birds.
