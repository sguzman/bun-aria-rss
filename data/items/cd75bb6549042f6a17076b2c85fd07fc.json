  "description": "<p>EPISODE 96 - BEN COOKE - Stunt Coordinator, 2nd Unit Director</p> <p>Team Deakins looks into the world of movie stunts with Stunt Coordinator and 2nd Unit Director, Ben Cooke (MULAN, 1917,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span> SKYFALL, CASINO ROYALE). We learn about the different areas of stunt work and the different experiences of being a stunt double or a stunt coordinator on a film. He talks about his experience of stunt doubling Daniel Craig in the Bond movies and tells us all about the huge stunt in Quantum of Solace and how learned he was doing it just the day before. We also talk about the stunts in Snow White and the Huntsman. Other areas we covered were working with locals in a large stunt sequence, the most undervalued aspects of a stunt job, dealing with an actor who wants to do all his own stunts, and creating stunts that fit into the tone of the movie. As he was the stunt coordinator on the film 1917, we dived into that experience in detail. We learned a lot about this area of filmmaking in this episode - don’t miss it!</p>",
