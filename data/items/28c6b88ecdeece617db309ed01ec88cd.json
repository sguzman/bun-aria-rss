  "description": "<p>LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein to go through the tragedy and comedy of this whole life business, all against the backdrop of the history of cinema, all joined by writer / character performer / sketch comedian and more, CARIAD LLOYD!</p><br><p>The tragedy and comedy parts are balanced out perfectly and expertly, and Cariad is a trained pair of hands on these subjects as you will have witnessed on her own ‘Griefcast’ podcast, where guests are invited to openly discuss grief and the wide world within. So here in this episode, along with a HUGE amount of film chatter, you can expect to hear about her honesty and approach to self-care with her show, the evolution of her own grief through the show, good old fashioned small talk and the art of, being married to a film maker, theories on death, her obsessive Star Wars viewing as a child, resigning from any future horror film fanclubs through watching The Shining, more crying after having kids, crying on cue versus ugly crying, the bullshit of the stages of grief, freedom to laugh at women being gross on screen and how the history of the UK isn’t often taught in as great detail as it could. A hugely varied and entertaining episode, which you are sure to enjoy from start to end.
