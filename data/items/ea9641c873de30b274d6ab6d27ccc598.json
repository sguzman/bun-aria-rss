In this episode, we learn about the history of ice harvesting and the industry that built up around it, where ice cut from lakes in New England was shipped to as far away as India and the Caribbean. We hear more about this history from Gavin Weightman, author of <em>The Frozen Water Trade</em>. And we visit Rockywold-Deephaven Camps in New Hampshire, where ice is still harvested each winter from Squam Lake and used to keep old fashioned ice boxes at the camp cool all summer long.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nDownload our learning guides: <a href=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/fb/14/768afd5c4fc2ba87b0d709893525/how-did-people-keep-food-cold-in-olden-times.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PDF</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xKmXoW2Re0rusxgwGQpnkBjqJHT-TWsacc95OzhbIBU/copy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google Slide</a> | <a href=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/fa/6f/2dd9956043eca8a5c51c8af367cb/but-why-174-ice-harvesting-transcript.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Before refrigeration, people stored food in a lot of different ways.
