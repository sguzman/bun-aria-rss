  "description": "<p>Are you saving your money when instead you should be investing it? Or maybe you’ve been investing, but alternatively you should be saving! Folks get confused as those terms are often used interchangeably, but they are very different. For example, we call it “saving for retirement” when we are actually “investing for retirement.” Saving and investing are both important and have their place, and so the trick is knowing <em>when</em> you should be doing either. During this episode, we’ll cover some of the different indicators and considerations that will help you to determine whether you should be saving or investing. And it depends on your goals, but there’s a good chance you’ll need to do both!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Kong Double Hazy IPA by BarrelHouse Brewing Co - a big thanks to our friend Josh for donating this beer to the show!
