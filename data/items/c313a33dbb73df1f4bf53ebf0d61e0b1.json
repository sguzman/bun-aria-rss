  "description": "Huge jobs numbers come at ideal time for Biden. Don't panic, but the Dems might be staging a comeback. Buck says, \"This week is a reminder there is no celebration until the victory is complete, there is no retreat until we are victorious. That means taking back the House and the Senate. The House is looking good, but we want a big majority in the House not just a little, itty-bitty majority.\" Senator Chris Coons promises more \"professional\" tax enforcement. It's about votes: Merrick Garland and DOJ charges cops in Breonna Taylor case because they want to gin up as many black votes as possible for the election. Buck is going solo today as Clay wraps-up his family vacation on Mackinac Island, Michigan.
