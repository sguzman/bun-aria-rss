    "media:description": "► In this week's video, I dive into Duster's unreleased/unfinished music that has been floating around the internet for a while now. I talk about the band's fan made compilation albums such as \"Experimental Dust\", \"Low Earth Orbit\" and \"Testphase, Tape One\". Give 'em a listen, they're something really special.\n\nDuster is Clay Parton, Canaan Dove Amber and Jason Albertini. The band is mostly known for their influential 1998 record \"Stratosphere\" along with songs like \"Gold Dust\" & \"Inside Out\". \n\n► LINK TO THE STORY OF DUSTER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG4dT70XVJQ&t=3s\n\n► Leave a like if you enjoyed!
