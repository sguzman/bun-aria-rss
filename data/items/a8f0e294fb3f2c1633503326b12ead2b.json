  "description": "<p>Finding balance in life. Developing trust in something bigger than yourself. Surrendering your self-will. Relying on faith to guide you. And the courage to risk it all for the sake of living your best, most authentic life.</p><p>Today marks the return of my erstwhile co–host, mother of my children and my wife of 11 years.</p><p>Julie Piatt.</p><p>Last week we celebrated our anniversary by renewing our vows. A small little ceremony with just the kids, it was a meaningful way to pay tribute to this journey we've taken. Bringing the kids into the equation, all six of us took the opportunity to share our own “vows” by expressing gratitude for what each member of the family brings to our communal band.</p><p>It's important to create ceremony around seminal moments. To pause. And take the time to honor each other.&nbsp;It was profound.&nbsp;An event that brought us all closer to each other. And more connected to the journey ahead.</p><p>After being married for many years its easy to fall into cruise control – my across the board default mode. Whether its fitness, diet, profession, relationships, or (in my case) sobriety, it doesn't take much to convince ourselves that everything is cool, then ease off the gas.</p><p>Personally, taking things for granted is my pastime. Avoiding this pitfall is&nbsp;a daily practice that demands a level of focused consciousness around all aspects of my life&nbsp;to help me understand that there is always improvement to be had. That growth requires constant work and pressure and focus.</p><p>But a crucial truism I learned very early on in recovery is that there is no stasis. In every given moment you are either growing or regressing. Moving towards a drink or away from a drink. Heading towards something better or lapsing backwards into bad habits, behaviors, addictions, assumptions, modalities, whatever.</p><p>Without attention, my life can quickly spiral out of balance. Prone to obsessiveness, it's my nature to lose myself. To become so immersed in what I am doing, whatever it is – training, writing, podcasting – that I lose sight of the bigger picture. Other aspects of my busy life that require my attention. And more often than not, these aspects are the most important aspects.</p><p>Balance — the primary topic of today's conversation —&nbsp;is the fickle lover I am always courting yet struggle mightily to master. It's like squeezing a water ballon. Just when you think you've got it compressed, something pops out. Squeeze the bulge down and it pops up somewhere else. Always see-sawing from over focusing on one aspect of my life at the distress of another.&nbsp;Story of my life.</p><p>The more work I do on myself, the better and bigger my life gets. With this comes more opportunities to get out of balance. Which means even more work to keep all the plates spinning at the same speed.&nbsp;The irony.</p><p>Of course we all struggle with balancing our busy lives. It’s not easy. So today is all about trying to better understand the mechanics behind maintaining proper life balance to avoid the common pitfalls. And keep us on track, moving in the right direction.</p><p>Julie — a much more innately balanced person than I – is perfectly suited for this conversation, always helping me see the objective truth of how I am acting and helping me bring things into focus. She is bursting with&nbsp;wisdom on the subject so I though this would make for a very dynamic and hopefully helpful conversation for you.</p><p>Finally, it's only apropos that today (Monday July 21) also happens to be Julie's birthday. I didn't plan it that way, just a tiny example of how Julie seems to effortlessly roll in harmony.&nbsp;So give her a shoutout on Twitter.&nbsp;Or better yet, check out her newly launched website <a href=\"http://srimati.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SriMati,com</a>. If you dig where she's coming from, she will be posting spiritual nuggets,</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
