First, Anna, Sim and Paul talk to a woman whose husband is a terrible gift-giver.  Listen in as Paul enlightens her about the \"Languages of Love\" and the gang brainstorms about how to point him in the right direction. Next, they call Brittany, a woman who has been involved for six months with a stand-up comedian she met on a dating app. Paul and Anna leave no stone unturned in trying to help her figure out whether she likes him enough to commit to a possible long-distance relationship and, if so, how to talk to him about their relationship...as illustrated through another hilarious role-play. <br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
