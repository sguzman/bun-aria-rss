  "description": "<p>On Jacques Lacan's \"Seminar on 'The Purloined Letter'\" (1956), Jacques Derrida's \"The Purveyor of Truth\" (1975), and other essays in the collection <em>The Purloined Poe: Lacan, Derrida, and Psychoanalytic Reading</em>. How should philosophers approach literature? Lacan read Edgar Allen Poe's story about a sleuth who outthinks a devious Minister as an illustration of his model of the psyche, and why we persist in self-destructive patterns. Derrida thought this reading not only imposed a bunch of psychobabble onto the story, but demonstrated that Lacan just didn't know how to read a text. <a href= \"http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/04/19/ep75-lacan-derrida-poe-citizen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the full discussion at partiallyexaminedlife.com.</a></p>",
