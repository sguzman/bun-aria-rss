Those of you who are therapists, coaches, crystal workers, healers of all sorts, listen in. But, if you are the sage of your family, perhaps a priest or pastor, or maybe a teacher who hears the burdens of your students, then this is for you as well. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As healers, we need to be sure to avoid codependency. What does that mean exactly? As a whole, it means not making your client or family member or student’s journey about you. You cannot superimpose your issues onto their healing. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first way to avoid codependency is by not arguing with people who aren’t ready for transformation. You cannot push people toward healing. They will walk the path toward healing in their own time and you badgering them into it will not make them go any faster. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When people share their feelings with you, stop, take a moment, and then ask them what they need from you. Rather than listening and then immediately trying to fix the problem, see what they’re looking to gain by confiding in you first. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also don’t personalize the other person’s progress. Their wins and losses are not reflective of your involvement in their life. It’s their healing journey, not yours so their progress has nothing to do with you. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen in to hear all four ways plus a little bonus. We all have our own issues to deal with which is why healers also need to have their own healer to go to. Just make sure that you don’t use your relationship with your clients to work on your own baggage. </span></p> <h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode: </span></h2> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[00:34] Being a healer is a privilege in someone’s life no matter if it’s in a personal or professional capacity. </span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[02:27] If you are a healer, it’s important that you don’t expect more from the relationship than it is. </span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[05:38] You do not argue with people who are not ready for transformation. </span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[07:29] This looks like you, making their journey about you.
