  "description": "Peter Ney is a PhD candidate in the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington where he is advised by Professor Tadayoshi Kohno. His current research is focused on understanding computer security risks in emerging technologies like DNA synthesis and sequencing and the new threats posed by maliciously crafted, synthetic DNA. He and his team found that security of DNA processing programs is poor and show with a proof-of-concept that it is possible to attack computer systems with adversarial synthetic DNA.",
