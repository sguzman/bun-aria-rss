  "description": "<p>EPISODE 43 - FRANZ KRAUS Part 1 - Arriflex</p> <p>Team Deakins sits down with Franz Kraus of Arriflex who has overseen most of the company’s digital visual advancements. We learn the history and progression into digital technology. He also walks us through the greater importance of dynamic range vs resolution. We learn how the sensor size affects the relationship between lens and subject. We speak about the Arri 65 camera as well as the LF camera. And much more! Franz was so generous with his knowledge that we have to split our session into two episodes!! It’s a great deep dive into digital technology!</p>",
