In this episode, Emily and Laura reflect on five years of the podcast and share a big announcement about some exciting changes on the horizon for Risen Motherhood! But one thing that will never change is our passion for bringing gospel hope to moms for many years to come.</p> <p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><em>We’re grateful to Christian Standard Bible, a Bible translation for everyone, for making this week’s show possible.
