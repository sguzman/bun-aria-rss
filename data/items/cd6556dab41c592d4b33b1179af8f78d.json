  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Kathy Hochul is the luckiest Lieutenant Governor in America; she is first in the line of succession for Governor in NY. The left wants to push Andrew Cuomo out and replace him with one of their more radical democrats. Also, the media has largely failed to accurately report on the mishandling of the Biden Administration's vaccine distribution. Then, Democrats' open-borders immigration policies incite lawlessness and coyotes to smuggle kidnapped children across the border. Assimilation has been replaced by 'Critical Race Theory' and the notion of 'White Privilege.' Later, the news of Jamal Khashoggi's death by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia has been leaked out so that the Biden Administration can weaken US ties with Saudi Arabia and strengthen ties with Iran. Iran is a grave threat and cannot be ignored. Afterward, former President Trump took to the stage at CPAC 2021 pushing back on the Democrats calling them anti-job anti-science, anti-family, anti-borders, and anti-women. Highlighting Biden's reversals of his most successful policies.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
