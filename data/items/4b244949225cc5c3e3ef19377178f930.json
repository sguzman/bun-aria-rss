  "description": "<p>We double-dip a bit in this week's show, reading two short stories and proving that you don't have to have a ton of time to read something thought-provoking. The theme is \"female authors writing about controversial-at-the-time ideas,\" and the stories are&nbsp;The Yellow Wallpaper&nbsp;by Charlotte Perkins Gilman and&nbsp;The Lottery&nbsp;by Shirley Jackson.</p><p>One is about a misdiagnosed \"hysterical\" woman slowly going insane through lack of mental stimulation, one is about a seemingly innocuous small town that is slavishly devoted to its own traditions. Both remain subversive and retain their impact even today.</p><p>Oh yeah and we also talk about which grocery store animal mascot would win in a fight. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
