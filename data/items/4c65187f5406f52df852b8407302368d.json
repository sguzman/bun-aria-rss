Sean left his house in Calhoun, Georgia and was driving to North Carolina. It was going to be a quick trip to drop off his friend Eric Brown. But Sean likely had more than just dropping off his friend in his plans. Like most of Sean's recent activity this trip revolved around drugs. Either buying, selling or trading drugs for weapons. In Calhoun, Meth is cheap and always available. It is everywhere and the Meth trade is woven into the fabric of this small town. After 9 p.m. Sean picked up Eric at Eric's cousin's house and away they went. Eric went to Clay County, North Carolina and Sean Patrick McDuffy Jr. went into a missing persons file.
