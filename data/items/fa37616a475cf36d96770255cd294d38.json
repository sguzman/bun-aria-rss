  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">How do you know if you’re a Christian nationalist? Kaitlyn Schiess is back with Phil and Skye to unpack Samuel Perry’s top 10 indicators of Christian nationalism and they add a few of their own. They also discuss why there’s so much overlap between Christian nationalism and Christian fundamentalism. Plus, Phil explains how the evolution of contemporary Christian music reveals what’s happened to the American church. Then, Skye talks with Preston Sprinkle about his new book “Embodied: Transgender Identities, the Church, and What the Bible Has to Say.” They discuss what extremists on the Right and Left get wrong about the transgender conversation, and what a pastoral, not just a theological, response looks like. Also this week, a more accurate covid test is being used in China—but there’s a downside.</p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><a href= \"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/anal-swab-china-coronavirus/2021/01/27/cc284f56-6054-11eb-a177-7765f29a9524_story.html\"> https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/anal-swab-china-coronavirus/2021/01/27/cc284f56-6054-11eb-a177-7765f29a9524_story.html</a></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><a href= \"https://twitter.com/socofthesacred/status/1358834106356948996\">https://twitter.com/socofthesacred/status/1358834106356948996</a></p>",
