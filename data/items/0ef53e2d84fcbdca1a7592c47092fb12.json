Also Five Headlines including the Left doxing a woman for nodding during Trump’s town hall. And in our Daily Cancellation, we will cancel body shaming. Not the thing itself. We will cancel the term “body shaming” and all the panicking people do over it. \nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
