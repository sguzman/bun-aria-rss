  "description": "<p>Did you know dementia begins in the brain decades before symptoms start showing up? We can see changes in brain scans 30 or 40 years before forgetfulness and other disconcerting symptoms creep in. But I’ve seen so many patients overcome symptoms of brain dysfunction through the right diet and lifestyle changes. If our actions can have that much power to reverse some forms of brain illness, why aren’t we talking more about using them for prevention?&nbsp; I’ve seen people with genetic predispositions avoid a diagnosis altogether by living a conscious life.&nbsp;</p><br><p>That’s exactly what my guest and good friend, Max Lugavere, and I get into on this week’s episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>. Max lost his mom last year to a rare disease called Lewy body dementia, which comes along with the neurodegenerative and physical symptoms of both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Max is a filmmaker, health, and science journalist and the author of the <em>New York Times </em>bestselling book <em>Genius Foods: Become Smarter, Happier, and More Productive While Protecting Your Brain for Life. </em>He is also the host of the #1 iTunes health podcast <em>The Genius Life</em>. Max is excited to release his sophomore book, <em>The Genius Life: Heal Your Mind, Strengthen Your Body, and Become Extraordinary</em>, a lifestyle guide to living happily and healthily with proven, research-based lifestyle tactics, which we dig into more throughout this episode.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Lumen, Thrive Market, and Farmacy.</p><br><p>I’ve recently started using an exciting new device called Lumen that measures your metabolism through the breath and gives you feedback on how your nutrition impacts your metabolism.
