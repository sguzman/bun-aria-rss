  "description": "<p><p> </p><p>Round 1:  Should we weaponize ticks? Congress wants research into how we could use these little fuckers to decimate entire civilizations. </p><p>Round 2: The fact that “flying infantryman on hoverboard” wasnt an MOS when we joined makes us feel cheated. One lucky French soldier got to fly all over the Bastille Day parade. </p><p>Round 3: The new commandant wants to implement rules on social media? Will that work? Not if we block and mute all our NCOs it wont.  </p><p>Round 4: A bunch of boogereaters are planning on storming Area 51. How do the people on base prepare for something like that?</p><p>Round 5:  Rough and Rowdy is later this week. We can't wait!</p><p> </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
