  "description": "<p>On this week's episode the duo are joined in the studio by Janelle and Omo, two ladies who administer HIV tests in New York City's biggest neighborhoods. The ladies delve into getting tested, how to handle not so great news with results and debunk some of the biggest myths surrounding \"the big H\". They share stories about having to share positive results and the girls ask everything under the sun about how to be responsible and stay safe in the age of casual dating and one night stands. We don't feel it would be right if we didn't bring these conversations to the platform so we hope you find the comedic relief and education in this week's episode.
