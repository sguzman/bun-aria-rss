  "title": "Ep. 800 - Trans Sex Offender Harasses Women. Media Sides With Sex Offender.",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a few months ago, the entire corporate media condemned a woman a bigot and a transphobe when she complained about a man exposing himself inside the women’s locker room at Wi Spa in Los Angeles. But in recent weeks, the media has stopped talking about the case completely. That’s because of the recent revelations about this man, and what he was really doing inside that locker room. They don’t want us to talk about this story anymore, but we will today. Also, the mayor of San Francisco defends herself against charges of hypocrisy after being seen partying maskless at a night club. Daycare workers are caught on tape trying to force a mask onto a very young child. The former head of the FDA says that the whole “six feet of social distancing” rule was arbitrary and nobody knows where it came from. And the Biden Administration now wants permanent access to all of your banking information and your transaction history. Who could possibly object to that? \nYou petitioned, and we heard you.
