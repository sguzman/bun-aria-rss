  "description": "<p>The Flatwoods Monster. The Whirling Whimpus. Devil Dogs and Sheepsquatch. The Virginia Moonshine Man-Possum, GreenBrier Skink-Skank,  the Tiddle-Whisper Dragon of Johnson City, the Rocky Branch Giant Rape-Beetle, the Snallygaster. Which one of these are cryptids thought to exist by people in Appalachia? Which are creatures I made up for this episode? How do you say Appalachia? What does it mean to be Appalachian? Why does the hillbilly stereotype come from Appalachia? Why is the banjo associated with Appalachia? Today we look into a lot of cryptids and also learn a great deal about the land that stretches from Canada all the down to Georgia. Enjoy!<br /><br />Thanks again for allowing the 2021 Bad Magic Giving Tree to be such a success! We raised $49,000 through a combination of Patreon, fan, and personal donation. And now 198 children are going to receive the presents they would have otherwise never received.
