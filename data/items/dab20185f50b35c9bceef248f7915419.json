  "description": "<p><p>The Red Robin conspiracy theory involving Steve Robinson, an uncertain number of french fries, and a terrible hair cut, has deepened today as a whistle-blower steps forward with shocking information. A former guest of the show has threatened Kirk Minihane with veiled references to Bob Murchison, and Minihane is none to please with her -- or her imaginary alter-ego. The Boston Globe has published a new story about the Boston Bomber and they choose none other than Kevin Cullen to write it. Minihane revisits the investigative journalism that exposed Cullen has a fabulist and began his long simmering feud with Shirley Leung. Blind Mike pans Kmarko's new labor of love -- The Barstool Book of Drinks. New evidence has come out about Prince Andrew's relationship with his accuser and Jeff Epstein. Meanwhile, Minihane is still not certain whether this entire world is all in his insane imagination.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
