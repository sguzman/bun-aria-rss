  "title": "PMS 2.0 513 - OVERREACTION MONDAY, NFL Week 5 Recap With Darius Butler & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys overreact to everything that happened in a wild weekend of NFL Football as they wrap up week 5 of the NFL season and look ahead to tonight's Colts v. Ravens Monday Night Football game. They cover the Packers wild win in Cincinnati, a horrendous day #ForTheBrand league wide, the Buffalo Bills being an absolute wagon, if there is major cause for concern with the Chiefs and their defense, the Cardinals staying undefeated is a tight game against the 49ers, the Pittsburgh Steelers potentially being all the way back, if the Cowboys are potentially the best team in the NFC, the issues in New York with the Giants, and everything else from a great weekend of football. Joining the program to chat about all his takes from the weekend and what he was most impressed and disappointed with is AJ Hawk (47:42-1:05:52). Later, joining Pat and AJ Hawk is 9 year NFL vet at DB, host of the Man-To-Man podcast, Everything DB, Darius Butler. Pat, Darius, and AJ discuss whether or not the Chiefs are dead and if they can turn things around, why Darius thinks the Chargers are a real threat with Justin Herbert and Brandon Staley, what things are like down in South Florida as the Dolphins seem to getting worse each week and if the Deshaun Watson buzz is heating back up, why he isn't impressed with Dan Campbell crying at his press conference, and all his other big takeaways from week 5 of the NFL season (1:05:56-1:32:01).
