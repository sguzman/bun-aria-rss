  "description": "<p>A farmer (now deceased) who lived on Elkins Creek in Georgia called the police to report disturbances on his rural homestead. For several weeks, something had been frequenting his property. Strange noises were heard and eventually livestock and pet dogs went missing. Whatever it was would bang on the outside of his trailer in the dead of night.</p> <p>Eventually, the man had his barn door ripped off its hinges when something was apparently trying to raid his corncrib. He called the authorities once again to report the vandalism. A deputy named James P. Akin was dispatched to look into the matter. Deputy Akin suspected local moonshiners were trying to discourage the man from living at the property.</p> <p>The farmer told Deputy Akin that he knew what was doing the damage, and showed the officer five huge footprints along the banks of Elkins Creek. Though all five prints were clear, four of them were totally submerged in the water of the creek. One, however, was in the fine silt next to the water’s edge and was still in excellent condition.</p> <p>Tonight I speak with the now retired Deputy Jim Akin who will give us some real insight on what was going on the witness' property. Jim shares a lot of strange and creepy behavior the creature was doing on and around the farmer's property. At the time, Deputy Akin did not believe in Sasquatch and felt that if there was a 1% chance it was real, it was in the Pacific NW. He found it hard to believe that a creature like this may be alive and well in Pike County, Georgia...</p>",
