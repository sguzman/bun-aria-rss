  "description": "<p>Nick is a comedian and very old friend of Joes. He also has a podcast called Nick Dip so check it out if you enjoyed the conversation. There are parts of their talk which get a little heated when politics are brought up but they both handle it well and have a great time overall. LikedÂ  hearing this guest a lot lol</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
