  "description": "<p>Another week, another podcast from a random part of Shannon’s living spaces. This week: her NYC apartment and (hopefully short-lived) inflatable chair. Shannon’s moving pod from Nashville gets delivered to NYC, but not before Dutch Man #2 spends the night. Bert saved the day (not all heroes wear capes, folks). Shannon’s bed is just soooo comfy… wait, did you just say study? Giggle through this little storytime with us on Season 2 Episode 9 of Probably A Podcast. </p>",
