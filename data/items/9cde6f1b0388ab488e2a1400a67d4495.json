  "description": "When you had sleepovers as a child, what did you call the makeshift beds you made on the floor? In some places, you call those bedclothes and blankets a pallet. This word comes from an old term for \"straw.\" And: What's the story behind the bedtime admonition \"Sleep tight, and don't let the bedbugs bite\"? Plus, when grownups are talking about sex or money, they may remind each other that \"little pitchers have big ears.\" It's a reference to the ear-shaped handle on a jug, and the knack kids have for picking up on adult topics and then spilling that new knowledge elsewhere. Plus, lick the calf over, lady locks, dirty clothes vs. laundry, towhead, and build a coffee.\n Read full show notes, hear hundreds of free episodes, send your thoughts and questions, and learn more on the A Way with Words website: https://waywordradio.org/.
