And it's really important to remember that distinction. That they are only opinions.” [10:42] “And the only thing that matters is your reaction to whatever comes up. Because you know in life, in business, stuff's going to come up at some point. You just don't know what it is. And it's all about your reaction, how you deal with that....” [20:05] “I always think that the things that will make you thrive in business, are exactly the same things that will make you thrive in a family.” [25:15] “I've got friends who have got boats who were going to go sailing around the world at the same time as we were. They're still in England, they haven't left because they are waiting for perfect. It doesn't exist. Figure out what are the really big things, get on the way, and then trust yourself, you'll be able to figure out those things as you go along.” [26:46] “The thing that I've learnt, whenever I get to a point where I don't know the answer, I feel the frustration building up in me, map coming down off the wall, that sort of stuff. I now know that's a trigger, I've got to go and learn something.” [31:46]   FOLLOW CASPAR CRAVEN: WEBSITE - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2NqKE4d\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2NqKE4d</a> TWITTER - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2zXpRBS\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2zXpRBS</a> LINKEDIN - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2OF2HZn\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2OF2HZn</a> VIMEO - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2OFWjB2\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2OFWjB2</a> INSTAGRAM - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2QyndIk\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2QyndIk</a> FACEBOOK - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2NtXj6y\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2NtXj6y</a> BOOKS MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: Where the Magic Happens - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2y7JlCJ\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/2y7JlCJ</a> [2:16] Psycho Cybernetics - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2yjfuJA\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/2yjfuJA</a> [9:33] PEOPLE MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: Dan Kennedy - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2PgBf16\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2PgBf16</a> [15:17]  ",
