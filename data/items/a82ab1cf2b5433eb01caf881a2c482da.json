  "description": "We study optimal tax design based on the idea that policy-makers face trade-offs between\nmultiple margins of redistribution. Within a Mirrleesian economy with earnings, consumption\nand retirement savings, we derive a novel formula for optimal income and savings distortions\nbased on redistributional arbitrage. We establish a sufficient statistics representation of the\nlabor income and capital tax rates on top income earners in dynamic environments, which relies\non the observed distributions of both income and consumption. Because consumption has a\nthinner Pareto tail than income, our quantitative results suggest that it is optimal to shift a\nsubstantial fraction of the top earners' tax burden from income to savings.",
