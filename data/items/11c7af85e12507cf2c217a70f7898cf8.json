  "title": "183 - Baba Yaga: OG Witch",
  "description": "<p>Baba Yaga - OG witch and one of the many characters of ancient Slavic folklore. Today we explore Slavic folklore just like we explored Germanic folklore with the Brother's Grimm episode. The peoples of medieval Russia and Eastern Europe loved a good dark tale to teach their kids to be wary of strangers, listen to their parents, etc. Fear sells now and fear sold then, and Baba Yaga was scary. She was most often depicted as an evil witch living in a magical mobile home able to move about on top of chicken legs. And if you had the unfortunate experience of meeting Baba Yaga, she most likely was going to try and eat you. So meet Baba and some of the other crazy characters that populated her world and more, today, on Timesuck. </p>\n<p>Check out Lynze and I's new horror podcast <strong>Scared to Death.</strong> Listen on Spotify, Stitcher, iTunes, Youtube, and more!
