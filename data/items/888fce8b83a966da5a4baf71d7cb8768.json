  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about Aaron Rodgers being back at camp and react in real time to Rodgers' press conference addressing where he's at, how everything got to this point, his thoughts on the future, and the current state of the Packers. They also look around other locations in the NFL including Xavien Howard being unhappy with his contract situation with the Dolphins and requesting a trade, and Deshaun Watson showing up at Texans camp but removing his jersey, and much more. Joining the program to chat about the Rodgers situation, the Xavien Howard and Stephon Gilmore situations, and to share a few stories is 9 year NFL veteran at DB, one of Pat's former teammates, and former member of the Cardinals and Ravens, Jerraud Powers (22:52-46:59). Later, after Pat and AJ Hawk chat about Aaron's press conference and what it means for the Packers right now and in the future, Super Bowl Champion, 14 year NFL veteran at QB, and current Head Coach of Lipscomb Academy, Trent Dilfer joins the show to chat about how the Packers got to this point with Rodgers, why that whole situation is a mystery to him, if he thinks Aaron will ultimately stay in Green Bay, and how important it is for teams to let the Quarterback have a say in situations that directly influence the outcome of his job (49:02-1:34:16).
