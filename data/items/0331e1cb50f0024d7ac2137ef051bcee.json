  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">We are deep into campaign season with Christians on all sides becoming increasingly anxious and vocal. Phil talks with Kaitlyn Schiess, author of “The Liturgy of Politics,” about the false narratives shaping the hearts and politics of many Christians. She identifies these “false gospels” as prosperity, patriotism, security, and supremacy—and they’re far more subtle and powerful than you might think, and they affect both sides of the partisan divide. Also this week, Jerry Falwell Jr. responds to his expulsion from Liberty U. by quoting MLK’s “Free at last...” speech. And Mike Pence quotes the Bible in his RNC speech but replaces “Jesus” with “Old Glory.” Is it the clearest example of Christian Nationalism yet?</p> <p class=\"p1\">“What Jerry Falwell Jr. Taught Me at Liberty University” by Kaitlyn Schiess: <a href= \"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/opinion/jerry-falwell-liberty.html\"> https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/opinion/jerry-falwell-liberty.html</a></p> <p class=\"p1\">“The Liturgy of Politics” by Kaitlyn Schiess: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Liturgy-Politics-Spiritual-Formation-Neighbor/dp/0830848304\"> https://www.amazon.com/Liturgy-Politics-Spiritual-Formation-Neighbor/dp/0830848304</a></p> <p class=\"p1\">“Vice President Mike Pence Swapped Out “Jesus” for “Old Glory” in His RNC Address”: <a href= \"https://relevantmagazine.com/culture/vice-president-mike-pence-swapped-out-jesus-for-old-glory-in-his-rnc-address/\"> https://relevantmagazine.com/culture/vice-president-mike-pence-swapped-out-jesus-for-old-glory-in-his-rnc-address/</a></p>",
