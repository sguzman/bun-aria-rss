  "description": "<p>What do you want out of life? What do you want to&nbsp;<strong>accomplish in the next 3-5 years</strong>? When asked this question, most entrepreneurs give a pretty simplistic answer. Something like “Oh, we’ll get more clients by this time next year” or “I’ll buy two more houses and then I’ll be happy”. How often do we&nbsp;<strong>sit down and paint a picture of what we want our life to look like</strong>? Today we’re discussing&nbsp;<strong>Vivid Visions&nbsp;</strong>with their creator&nbsp;<strong>Cameron Herold</strong>.</p><p>Cameron is a<strong>&nbsp;veteran in the business world</strong>, he likes to say that he was “groomed” by his entrepreneurial grandparents and father to become a success story. By the time Cameron was 21, he had a&nbsp;<strong>full-on business that had 12 employees</strong>, and at 22 he bought his first&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/guides/buy-and-hold-rental-property\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>rental property</strong></a>. He later became a franchisee for College Pro Painters and was so successful that he went on to coach new franchisees.</p><p>He’s partnered with&nbsp;<strong>hundred-million dollar companies</strong>, grown and sold businesses for millions, coached the<strong>&nbsp;CEO of Sprint, a monarchy in the middle east</strong>, has written 5 books, and runs the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cooalliance.com/podcasts/?utm_source=www.google.com&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=Google&referrer-analytics=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Second in Command Podcast</a>, where he talks to successful COOs. Cameron is someone who clearly has accomplished a lot and has a TON of wisdom to share.</p><p>Cameron has serious knowledge on&nbsp;<strong>business management&nbsp;</strong>and talks about the importance of the<strong>&nbsp;CEO and COO relationship</strong>. Cameron describes how a COO needs to be a partner to the entrepreneur (the CEO) and operate as the<strong>&nbsp;ying to the CEO’s yang</strong>. If you’ve heard the terms “<strong>the visionary and the innovator</strong>” from books like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007QWLLV2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Traction</em></a>, this is exactly what Cameron is talking about.</p><p>If you’ve been wondering where the idea of a “plan” or “vision” comes into play, Brandon, David, and Cameron all discuss their “<strong>Vivid Visions</strong>” and how it’s led them to success in their life. Cameron coined the term “Vivid Vision” because most entrepreneurs were simply writing down a 1-2 sentence mission statement instead of&nbsp;<strong>creating a vision of what they wanted their company and future to look like</strong>. This vision not only helps you build a life you want by design, it also entices great executives, employees, and partners to join you on your path to that clear and decisive “Vivid Vision”.</p><p>In This Episode We Cover:</p><ul><li>How Brandon found out about the “<strong>Vivid Vision</strong>” and how it has changed his worldview since creating one</li><li>Why Cameron decided to&nbsp;<strong>coach COOs as opposed to CEOs</strong></li><li>The importance of having a&nbsp;<strong>COO or 2nd in command that you trust and believe in</strong></li><li>Why your&nbsp;<strong>job postings should scare</strong>&nbsp;those who aren’t ready to take risks and grow</li><li>Why entrepreneurs have such a<strong>&nbsp;hard time when letting go</strong></li><li>How to&nbsp;<strong>create your “Vivid Vision”</strong>&nbsp;in 7 steps</li><li>What a great “Vivid Vision” looks like, what it includes, and how to structure it</li><li>And&nbsp;<strong>So&nbsp;</strong>Much More!</li></ul><p>Links from the Show</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BiggerPockets Podcast</a></li><li><a href=\"https://store.biggerpockets.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BiggerPockets book store</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/beardybrandon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Brandon's Instagram</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/davidgreene24/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David's Instagram</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/wp-admin/post.php?post=121532&action=edit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BiggerPockets Business Podcast 39: Creating Your Vision and Achieving Massive Success with Cameron Herold</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/biggerpockets-podcast-230real-estate-investing-side-hustle-grammy-winning-producer-seth-mosley\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BiggerPockets Podcast 230: Real Estate Investing as a Side Hustle with Grammy-Winning Producer Seth Mosley</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_1848.jpeg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Brandon's Vivid Vision</a>&nbsp;(photo)</li><li><a href=\"https://cooalliance.com/podcasts/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Second-In-Command Podcast</a></li><li><a href=\"https://cameronherold.com/vivid-vision/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vivid Vision Website</a></li></ul><p>Click here to check the full show notes: https://www.biggerpockets.com/show447</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
