Pressure is growing on President Joe Biden and Democrats to try to do something about it — including canceling some or even all student loan debt altogether. Fenaba Addo, an associate professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, talks about the burden student debt represents for borrowers and what it would mean for that debt to be forgiven.
