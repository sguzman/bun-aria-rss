  "title": "Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari",
  "description": "A follow up to Yuval's previous bestseller 'Sapiens', Homo Deus seeks to theorise how humans will evolve in the 21st century surrounded by new technologies. The book describes how humans who had once conquered and were in control of the world, are reaching a point in our evolution where machines and more specifically algorithms run our lives. The agricultural and industrial revolution has now become the humanist revolution where humans facilitate and dictate their divine nature. The book also explores new concepts in algorithmic mathematics where computers and smart devices will know us better than ourselves as they start to become more integrated in our way of living. Personally, I preferred this book to Sapiens for two reasons. Firstly, it was forward-looking and not directed at blaming a specific race or religion. Secondly, it was exciting to hear theories to our future existence as human beings written in an engaging and informative way. I rate this book five stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
