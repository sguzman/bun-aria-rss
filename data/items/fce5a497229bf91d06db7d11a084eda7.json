  "description": "Our audiobook this week is UNDENIABLE by NY Times Bestselling Author Aleatha Romig!\n\nNarrated by Daniel James Lewis and Elle Sonali\n\nForbidden love…is undeniable.\n\nWhen she was younger, like all little girls, Sophie Hawkins believed in fantasies. She believed in happily-ever-after and that one day her prince would come. What made Sophie’s dreams a bit different was that the man of her dreams wasn’t a fictional prince but her best friend’s dad.\n\nMatt was handsome and nice, the kind of man every woman would want.\n\nTime passes, and through the years, Sophie’s reality changes, yet her attraction and memories of Matt Hamilton never fade. Where boys and men are concerned, Matt remains her gold standard.\n\nWhen his daughter was young, Matt Hamilton had it all: a family and success.\n\nWith the ticking of the clock and changing of the calendar, seasons pass and situations adjust. Business success remains, but personally, his world changes…until the day fate sets the undeniable in motion.\n\nSophie was a sweet little girl, his daughter’s best friend, and a ray of undeniable sunshine. That was before. Now she’s more. She is a grown woman.\n\nWho can deny the undeniable?\n\nUNDENIABLE eBook Preorder: https://amzn.to/2zo3rf8\n\nINDULGENCE box set (Kindle Unlimited): https://amzn.to/2YHTMuN\n\nMAID FOR THE ROYAL PRINCE by Winter James: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087DW8CXY\n\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\n\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\n\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\n\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
