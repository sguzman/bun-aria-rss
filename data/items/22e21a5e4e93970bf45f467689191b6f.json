  "description": "Yesterday, the Fed held its November meeting and raised interest rates by 75 basis points.  We break down the market reaction to the Fed… why the Fed won’t pivot… an absurd comment Powell made during his press conference… why you need to brace for further downside… and how to rake in profits as that happens. As earnings season continues, we discuss the record results from power management company Eaton (ETN)... what pawn shop operator FirstCash Holdings’ (FCFS) strong earnings say about the economy... and how energy policies are letting one coal company—a Curzio Research Advisory holding—print cash. In this episode   The market’s up-and-down reaction to the Fed meeting [0:30] Powell’s ridiculous comparison on historical interest rates [6:45] Eaton’s record earnings [9:15] What one pawn shop operator says about the economy [18:00] Energy policies mean this coal company is printing cash [23:40] How to profit as the market plunges [32:27]  Enjoyed this episode?
