  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys are joined by 18 year NFL veteran, 3x Pro Bowler, friend of the show, and now Pat's teammate in the booth for ESPN's College Football Thursday Primetime games, Matt Hasselbeck. They discuss Matt's long career in the NFL, and what he likes about commentating games as opposed to playing in them, he sheds some light on his broadcasting style and how he thinks that will play off Pat's, he shares some of his favorite stories about his time as one of Pat's teammates, including when he almost died in the locker room, he chats about his relationship with Brett Favre while on the Packers and throughout his career in the league, talks about some of the remedies he used to keep himself feeling young as he was getting older, and he and Pat look ahead to this season's Thursday Night college football slate (3:44-1:07:26). Be on the lookout for more news about Pat and boys, as calling college football games on Thursday night's won't be the only thing Pat has going this fall. Also, be sure to check out <a href=\"https://store.patmcafeeshow.com/\">https://store.patmcafeeshow.com</a> as everything in the store is currently 20% off with code #ThursdayNightMcAfee.
