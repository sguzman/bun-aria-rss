  "description": "Jones Day's connection to Donald Trump has landed at least 14 of their lawyers positions in the administration. But the law firm stood out long before the Trump relationship. Jones Day has the most total lawyers working in the United States, according to the most recent ranking. In 2015, they hired 10 U.S. Supreme Court law clerks. And, perhaps most unique by today's standards, they have a management structure that gives almost all decision making authority to their managing partner, including decisions about compensation and who will be his successor.\n\nIn this episode of the Big Law Business podcast, Josh Block does a deep dive on Jones Day with Bloomberg Businessweek's Paul Barrett, and Above the Law's David Lat.\n\nBig Law Business: \nhttps://bol.bna.com/\n\nSponsored by Bloomberg Law: \nwww.bna.com/bloomberglaw?promocode=BLBBLAW\n\nSubscribe to the Big Law Business podcast on iTunes:\nitunes.apple.com/us/podcast/big-l…d1074067483?mt=2",
