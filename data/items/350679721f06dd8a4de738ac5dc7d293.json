  "description": "<p>The gaming industry is a $150 billion annual marketplace that is growing at a rapid pace. Competitive gaming has now become a full-time career for many and a lucrative habit for others. There are leagues and championship competitions for all the top games including Fortnite, NBA 2k, and Madden. Last year, a 16-year-old won $1 million at the Fortnite world series. Players Lounge is a platform that allows players to compete against each other for cash prizes very similar to FanDuel in the fantasy sports world. They have over 10,000 users and made payouts over $25 million to gamers in 2019. Austin Woolridge is the co-founder and CEO of Players Lounge. In episode 85, he spoke with us and gave us Players Lounge’s journey, we also covered the world of gaming and e-sports, and he gave us an unprecedented look behind the scenes for companies looking to gain venture capital.
