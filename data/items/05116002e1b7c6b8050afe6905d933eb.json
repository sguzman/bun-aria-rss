  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Brian Mudd of WJNO fills in for Mark. There's a new variant of Covid called Omicron and President Joe Biden inspires no confidence except for discussing more vaccines. The \"Faucists\" of the world favor lockdowns and don't seem to get it, but Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has created a roadmap to handle Covid really well, and many other state governors can learn from it. Also, historically the most liberal voters are the youth, but their positions change as their tax payments increase and they earn more and start families. However, voters aged 18-34 are currently the least happy with Biden, giving him a 69% disapproval rating. This is backlash from the youth is likely due to vaccine mandates and restriction of freedom. Afterward, the body politic must reject absurdity. America needs a Reagan revolution of conservative thinkers to push back on the left's bad policies.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
