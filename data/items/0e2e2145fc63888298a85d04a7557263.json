  "description": "<p>The world is still in quarantine and Cam Newton is no longer a Panther. We roast some Skype backgrounds because Coronavirus has shown us everyoneâ€™s home (2:37 - 27:57). Hot Seat/Cool Throne including Taylor Swift Vs the Kardashians and PFT and Big Cat are better than NBA Owners (27:57 - 39:34).

We get mad at the NFL 100 list starting with Tight Ends, Mt Flushmore of worst types of water and Guys on Chicks</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
