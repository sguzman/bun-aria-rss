  "description": "On this special episode of The H3 Podcast Ethan and Hila are joined by a brave young man named Chris Betancourt and his best friend Dillon Hill. Chris has been diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia and was given one year to live. So he and Dillon set out on a mission to check off as many items from his bucket list as they can. One item was to meet Ethan- another was to meet Philip DeFranco. On this episode of The H3 Podcast, he does both! We are humbled by Chris's story and his attitude and humor in the face of death and it was a pleasure to have him on the podcast.",
