What do you want your present and future to look like? How do you see yourself? What can you do to get there? In this mini-sode, Dr. Hyman explores with his guests, Mark Bittman, Cal Newport, and Vishen Lakhiani, the importance of creating a vision for your life, particularly in the face of the barrage of food marketing to which we are all exposed.</p><br><p>Mark Bittman is the author of more than 20 acclaimed books, including the “How to Cook Everything” series. He was a food columnist, opinion columnist, and the lead magazine food writer at the New York Times, where he started writing in 1984 and still writes occasionally.</p><p>Mark is currently a member of the faculty of Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health and is writing a new cookbook called “Dinner for Everyone” to share how simple and delicious it can be to cook at home, no matter what your dietary preferences are.</p><br><p>Cal Newport is an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University and writes about the impact of technological innovations on our culture. He is the author of six books, including <em>Digital Minimalism</em> and <em>Deep Work.</em></p><br><p>Vishen Lakhiani is the founder of Mindvalley University, a former computer engineer, and is noted for his ability to integrate information across the field of human transformation into unified models.
