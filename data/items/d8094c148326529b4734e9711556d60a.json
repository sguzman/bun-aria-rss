  "title": "PMS 2.0 038 - Mike Florio, Pro Football Talk, & Kris Jenner",
  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys do a DEEP dive into the Divisional Round of the playoffs and cover everything else that happened in the NFL over the weekend. They chat about the Patriots not being dead, the Chiefs dominating victory over the Colts, the Rams looking like one of the best teams in the NFL, and Nick Foles seeing his magic run out. Gorms also talks a bit about his weekend going to the Colts/Chiefs game on the private jet with Jim Irsay. Later, friend of the show, Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk calls in for a nice hearty football discussion. They bounce around from the playoffs, his schedule now that the football season is almost over, and what he thinks about all the different coaching changes thus far. The room also fires several questions at Florio ranging from AB potentially playing in San Francisco or somewhere else, if the Packers made a good decision in Matt LaFleur, how he settled on Pro Football Talk, and who he thinks will win the Super Bowl (1:26:34-2:10:13). Pat also debuts a new segment, “Let’s Get Topical,” as he discusses who might be out to get The Rock after a UK magazine misquoted him in an interview, and the conspiracy behind the Instagram egg that took over Kylie Jenner for the most liked picture on the app. It's a really good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
