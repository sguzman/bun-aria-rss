His clinical interests include infective endocarditis including cardiac electronic implantable device infections as well as opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. He is a Fellow in the American College of Internal Medicine and a Member of the Infectious Disease Society of America. Dr. Gordon is the person to talk to when it comes to gaining a better understanding of infectious diseases. He explains some of the unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and how they will dictate the way we move forward with healthcare and as a society in the coming years.
