  "description": "Getting folks back to the office might not be that easy, as most remote workers report they’d prefer to continue working from home. Elsewhere, Britney Spears fans have a lot to look forward to now that the singer has confirmed her first memoir will be released next year. “Last Week Tonight” host John Oliver helps Stephen Colbert tell some little white lies about these adorable puppies to help them find forever homes. “Law & Order” is returning to NBC and Sam Waterston is resuming his role as attorney Jack McCoy. Listen as he tells Stephen about walking onto the new set for the first time, and shares stories about meeting and working with mega-stars like Katharine Hepburn and Robert Redford. And the star of “Good Sam” on CBS, Sophia Bush, has a genuine interest in the amazing work done by doctors and surgeons but she prays no one mistakes her for a doctor in a real-life emergency situation. Catch Sophia in “Good Sam,” airing Wednesdays on CBS and streaming any time on Paramount+.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
