  "description": "<div>WHY. ARE. THEY. ALL. HOARDERS?<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Heads Up! This episode of TCO covers parts 3 & 4 of the Netflix series. To hear our coverage of the first two episodes of the Netflix series,<a href=\"https://www.truecrimeobsessed.com/single-post/2018/07/10/49-Evil-Genius-Part-1-Covering-Episodes-1-2-of-the-Netflix-Series\">go here!<br>\n</a><br>\n\n</div>\n<div>In this episode, we watch Marjorie just berate the soul out of her lawyer via Skpye, learn that the filmmaker’s unhealthy (and possibly unethical?) relationship with Marjorie is off the rails, we learn who the masterminds behind the pizza-delivery-bank-heist were (maybe), we meet more hoarders, AND we posit that meathead Jerry from the FBI and Jason Zwick from ATF are in a relationship? Maybe? Whatever, it’s all awful but we make you laugh.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Looking for more TCO?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Check out our bonus episodes on Patreon!</a> We covered \"Serial\" episode-by-episode and capped the series off with an interview with Rabia Chaudry--Adnan's friend who brought his story to Sarah Koenig.
