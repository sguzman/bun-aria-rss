  "description": "Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson, John Breech and Sean Wagner-McGough to react to Sunday's divisional round playoff games. The guys start by discussing the Chiefs incredible 51-31 comeback victory over the Texans (4:40), analyzing how Kansas City climbed out of a 24-0 deficit and Bill O'Brien's coaching decisions that contributed to the collapse. The Pick Six Superfriends then take a look at the AFC Championship between the Chiefs and Titans (27:30), while wrapping up Houston's season and outlook for the future. Next, Will, Ryan, John and Sean break down the Packers 28-23 win over the Seahawks (49:00), dissecting the vintage performance from Seattle, not exploiting Russell Wilson's skill-set until it was too late and finally offering credit to Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay. They examine some controversial officiating decisions before previewing the NFC Championship between the Packers and 49ers (1:09:00). Finally, winners and losers from Sunday (1:15:30)!\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
