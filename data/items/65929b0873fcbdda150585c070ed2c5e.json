So the year following her 4 Deserts achievement, she conquered a 222km non-stop foot race across the Himalayas at 6,000 meters above sea level —&nbsp;an event that had only been completed previously by one man.</p><p>That experience triggered a deep desire to leverage her running for humanitarian causes. So she got to work, running and raising money for causes she believed in. Among her accomplishments:</p><br><p>* A&nbsp;379km non-stop run across Australia’s Simpson Desert on behalf of&nbsp;Save the Children Australia;</p><p>* A community run & fundraising event&nbsp;on behalf of <a href=\"http://www.richroll.com/podcast/turia-pitt/\" target=\"_blank\">podcast fave Turia Pitt</a> and Kate Sanderson, victims of the Kimberley&nbsp;ultramarathon bushfire – a race in which Samantha also competed;</p><p>* A 32-day, 1968km run across South Africa's Freedom Trail, also on behalf of Save The Children Australia; and</p><p>* A 76-day, 3253 run across India from&nbsp;from Jaislamer, Rajasthan to Shillong, Meghalaya on behalf of World Vision</p><br><p>Amidst the insanity of it all, she somehow managed to raise over $203,000 and counting for the aforementioned causes.</p><p>Today we unpack Samantha's extraordinary, inspiring journey, blisters and all.</p><p>This is a phenomenal conversation about Samantha’s transformation from someone with no athletic background into the inspiring ultra-athlete humanitarian she is today. From all the hardships and seemingly insurmountable setbacks and obstacles&nbsp;to the rare air she occupies today, it's a story about self-belief, purpose, perseverance and the call to service.</p><p>But the core theme of today's conversation is the close kinship that exists between passion and suffering. And the magic that transpires when you have the willingness to entertain the impossible, step outside your comfort zone and courageously leap through fear into the abyss.</p><p>Sam is an absolute delight. It was a privilege to spend a few hours with her and boyfriend Mark Wales, a badass Australian Special Ops Commander she met when they were both contestants on Australian Survivor.</p><p>You're gonna love this one.
