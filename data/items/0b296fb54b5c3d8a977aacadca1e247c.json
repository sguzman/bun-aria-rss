And then, in honor of Boris Johnson’s removal from the UK Prime Minister role, we listen back to Mike’s 2016 interview with Financial Times columnist Ed Luce conducted shortly after Boris was named UK Foreign Minister. Luce is the author of Time to Start Thinking: America and the Spectre of Decline, and he shared some interesting insights about Boris as he rose to the top of UK politics.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist \nLearn more about your ad choices.
