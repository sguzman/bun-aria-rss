  "title": "You Thought What? False Beliefs About Art-Making [85]",
  "description": "<p>This week, we tackle some of the false beliefs that can bring artists down. &nbsp;So many of us accept our thoughts without questioning them - especially when it comes to the thoughts that hold us back. To shine a light on this issue, we decided to share some of our own past beliefs (and how we got past them). Louise's false beliefs included the idea that you have to be born with talent, the notion that artists can't make money, and the firm conviction that she would never be able to use colour (which is now her favourite part of painting). <br>\n<br>\nAlice's limiting beliefs included you must paint with oils, you need hours at a time to make good work, and you must have gallery representation to be taken 'seriously.' &nbsp;During the conversation, you'll learn about Alice's childhood prize for colouring and Louise's 'compare and despair' relationship with 8 year-old Dale Arey. &nbsp;But most of all, you'll see just how many ideas and thoughts could have stopped us in our tracks. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Mentioned:<br>\n</strong><br>\nFrancis Bacon studio <a href=\"http://francis-bacon.com/artworks/studio\">http://francis-bacon.com/artworks/studio</a><br>\nDreadzone 360 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOfWV4_2llU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOfWV4_2llU</a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
