    "media:description": "Just as we needed an industry standard format that would allow the efficient packaging and transmission of 3D assets (glTF), we now need new mechanisms that allow us to efficiently assemble and transmit an entire 3D scene from glTF assets, including ways to define behaviors and interactivity. In this webinar, members of the Khronos 3D Formats working group will preview and seek community feedback on proposals for how to add interactivity and behaviors to glTF. In addition, we preview what's on offer in the proposed interactivity behaviors extensions and showcase capabilities and preliminary implementations.\n\nSpeakers: Brent Scannell, Dwight Rodgers, Ben Houston\nPresentation: https://www.khronos.org/events/delivering-interactive-experiences-with-gltf",
