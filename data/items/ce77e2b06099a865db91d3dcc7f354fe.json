  "description": "<p>On this episode, Jonah and Vanessa welcome the one and only Joel Kim Booster! Jonah and Vanessa bond with Joel about their collective love of bean burritos and the challenge of heating them evenly, the fate of Keebler Tato Skins, and their varying skill levels at making dips. (Spoiler: Joel is the only one who is good at it!) Plus, they get into childhood birthday party activities from Jonah's baseball card show excursion to to Vanessa's many Plaster of Paradise painting parties and explore the current cultural phenomenon of adults engaging in traditionally kid-oriented activities. Finally, we ask the age old question: Do we really need our fries to have truffle on them?! You'll have to listen to find out... but the answer is no!&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
