What does an average working day look like for Terry, and what supplemental duty has he had to push back against? [07:43]</p><p>A lot of busy people don’t get around to reading one or two books a week, but for Terry, it makes being busy all the more possible. [13:36]</p><p>What are some realizations about success that have come to Terry while reading Walter Isaacson’s The Code Breaker and watching the Michael Jordan documentary The Last Dance? [15:04]</p><p>What’s the biggest mistake a lot of people make — in every walk of life — that causes the most amount of unnecessary suffering? [19:29]</p><p>How did Terry break himself of the habit of “victimology?” What initiated the event his family now refers to as “the D-Day moment,” and why did he carry a lifelong aversion to therapy that could have possibly helped him sooner? [23:32]</p><p>What you should be prepared to do without if you’re intent on living life as if you’re in a revenge movie, and what Terry did to regain control of his own actions instead of defaulting to chaos. [33:52]</p><p>Terry shares real-life examples that demonstrated — to his family as well as himself — that he could break destructive, impulsive patterns of behavior in favor of positive, responsible ones. [42:35]</p><p>How endurance plays into the way Terry demonstrates strength these days compared to how he expressed it in his earlier, more bombastic iteration. [53:35]</p><p>Why Terry believes the world determines winners way too early — and what we should be doing instead. [56:35]</p><p>How can competition be the opposite of creativity if resistance is crucial to growth? Terry explains. [58:58]</p><p>Terry’s thoughts on protest movements that don’t begin with the aim of reconciliation. [1:02:44]</p><p>Terry illustrates why he really is a category of one — even when he sometimes lapses in the midst of trying to live his most teachable life. [1:05:04]</p><p>Genius words from a (Thelonius) Monk, Terry’s war with cynicism, and other parting thoughts.

What does an average working day look like for Terry, and what supplemental duty has he had to push back against? [07:43]\n\nA lot of busy people don’t get around to reading one or two books a week, but for Terry, it makes being busy all the more possible. [13:36]\n\nWhat are some realizations about success that have come to Terry while reading Walter Isaacson’s The Code Breaker and watching the Michael Jordan documentary The Last Dance? [15:04]\n\nWhat’s the biggest mistake a lot of people make — in every walk of life — that causes the most amount of unnecessary suffering? [19:29]\n\nHow did Terry break himself of the habit of “victimology?” What initiated the event his family now refers to as “the D-Day moment,” and why did he carry a lifelong aversion to therapy that could have possibly helped him sooner? [23:32]\n\nWhat you should be prepared to do without if you’re intent on living life as if you’re in a revenge movie, and what Terry did to regain control of his own actions instead of defaulting to chaos. [33:52]\n\nTerry shares real-life examples that demonstrated — to his family as well as himself — that he could break destructive, impulsive patterns of behavior in favor of positive, responsible ones. [42:35]\n\nHow endurance plays into the way Terry demonstrates strength these days compared to how he expressed it in his earlier, more bombastic iteration. [53:35]\n\nWhy Terry believes the world determines winners way too early — and what we should be doing instead. [56:35]\n\nHow can competition be the opposite of creativity if resistance is crucial to growth? Terry explains. [58:58]\n\nTerry’s thoughts on protest movements that don’t begin with the aim of reconciliation. [1:02:44]\n\nTerry illustrates why he really is a category of one — even when he sometimes lapses in the midst of trying to live his most teachable life. [1:05:04]\n\nGenius words from a (Thelonius) Monk, Terry’s war with cynicism, and other parting thoughts.
