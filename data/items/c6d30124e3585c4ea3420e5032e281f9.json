  "description": "<p>WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR DREAM? Are you giving all you’ve got? Or are you afraid to go all in? So often we give up before we’ve even begun. You are worthy of going after your dreams. You are worthy of fighting for what you want. You’ve got to commit to yourself so that you can succeed at the one thing you can control- your effort. For this Five Minute Friday, I’m doing a special solo episode where I share where I’m at in my journey to become an Olympic athlete. I received some difficult news about six weeks ago about the Pan American Games. But I’m still training with the team for the next ten days. I need to give everything I can so that I don’t have any regrets.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nWhy I’m leaving for Brazil for the next week (1:30)<br />\nThe physical sacrifices I’ve made for handball (3:00)<br />\nThe reason I’m going even though I’m an alternate (3:50)<br />\nWhat it takes to accomplish a goal (8:00)</p>\n",
