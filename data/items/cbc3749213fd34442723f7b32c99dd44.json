  "description": "After the lawlessness and lies of the GOP convention it is clearer than ever that another term in office for Donald Trump would be devastating for democracy in America. And given the willingness of the GOP to violate the law and the fragility of political leads in times like these, you would have to be, in the words of our regular Rosa Brooks, deranged to think Trump might not achieve victory in November. We discuss that possibility, the conventions, yet another instance of police barbarism, further mishandling of the coronavirus crisis and more with Rosa, with former Obama White House official Dr. Kavita Patel and with NYU Law School's Ryan Goodman. Don't miss this thought-provoking if disturbing episode.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
