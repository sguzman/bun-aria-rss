  "description": "<p>Lot to unpack in this one! Today we are blending history, aliens, and conspiracy. We'll be talking about the Ancient Sumerians - quite possibly the world's first civilization. Who were they and what \"firsts\" did they contribute to human civilization? Why did their culture flourish so long ago? We'll go over one of the oldest, if not the oldest written story in the world - the epic of Gilgamesh. And then, we'll look into how Ancient Sumerians connects to Ancient Aliens/Astronaut Theory. What is this theory based in? Expertise and verified historical research? Or science fiction? </p>\n<p>We're donating over $14,000 this month to The Wildland Firefighter Foundation. Since 1999, the Foundation has also provided emergency support services to the families of firefighters, seriously injured or killed in the line of duty. Families left behind, many with young children, often find themselves with few resources, and the Foundation steps in to help.</p>\n<p>Go to<strong> <a href=\"https://wffoundation.org/\">https://wffoundation.org/</a> </strong>to learn more. </p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BuAjeehokFA\">https://youtu.be/BuAjeehokFA</a><br /><br /></strong><strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Sxi48qqMbo\"></a></strong><strong>M</strong><strong>erch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a>  <br /><br />Discord! </strong><strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\">https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
