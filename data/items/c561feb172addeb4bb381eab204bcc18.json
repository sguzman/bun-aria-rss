  "description": "Today Stephen and I talk with EWP Phd grad and adjunct faculty, Heidi Fraser. She is also the Director of the CIIS Center for Writing and Scholarship, and was a former EWP program manager. We explore aspects of Integral Yoga as taught by Hari Das Chaudhuri and Bahman Shairazi and it’s applications in scholarship and activism. We also discuss approaches to understanding Integral education based on Heidi’s dissertation research on the nature of Integral Education at CIIS.\nHeidi Fraser Hageman completed her Ph.D. in East-West Psychology (EWP) at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) in May 2015. Her doctoral research focused on exploring an integral education at CIIS through surveying and interviewing alumni from the EWP program about the personal and professional value of their non-traditional graduate degree. While completing her dissertation, Heidi spent seven semesters with the Center for Writing and Scholarship working with writers across disciplines to develop reading, writing, and research skills specific to what genre they were studying in, and completed seven teaching assistantships with faculty across the Institute.\nCurrently, Heidi teaches at CIIS, where she also resides as Director of the Center for Writing and Scholarship. Passionate about lifelong learning, teaching that nurtures student development along multiple lines of intelligence simultaneously, research in higher education concerning student learning objectives and outcomes, and progressive models of educating, she aspires to assist students in understanding the value of their integral education and how to effectively communicate that to circles outside CIIS.\nConnect with EWP: Website • Youtube • Facebook\nLearn more about your ad choices.
