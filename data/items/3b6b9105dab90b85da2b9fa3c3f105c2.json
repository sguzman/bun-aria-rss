  "description": "<p>In this episode of <em>Chatter</em>, a podcast hosted by David Priess and Shane Harris that features in-depth discussions with fascinating people at the creative edges of national security, Harris and Priess speak jointly with former intelligence officer, prominent yacht-watcher and book author Alex Finley. They talk about her career in the CIA's Directorate of Operations (which became the National Clandestine Service during her tenure there), her keen observation and analysis of Russian oligarchs' mega-yachts (which brought her onto cable news networks this spring after several countries started to seize the ships in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine), and her experience writing a series of spy satire novels (which take espionage absurdity to a new level). The three of them also kicked around views on a range of spy satire films,&nbsp;from 1985's&nbsp;Spies Like Us&nbsp;to the puppet-centric&nbsp;Team America&nbsp;to&nbsp;Spy&nbsp;with Melissa McCarthy.
