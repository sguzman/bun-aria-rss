  "description": "There’s an actual debate right now over what 2+2 equals. The last night of the DNC was full of bad “resistance” comedy and a slightly less incoherent Joe Biden. GOP congressional candidate Kim Klacik joins after her ad went viral for showing how little black lives really matter to the Democrats running Baltimore. Chicago’s mayor said she has a right to secure her own home from protesters, but what about other citizens? Joe Biden claimed he’s an “agent of light” against darkness. Julio Rosas, senior writer at Townhall, discusses how tone-deaf the DNC is for pushing gun control and defunding the police at the same time. Lives Matter host Drew Hernandez has the truth about the man who was violently knocked out by Antifa in Portland.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
