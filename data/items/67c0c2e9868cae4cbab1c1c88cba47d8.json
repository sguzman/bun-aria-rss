  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys are back after taking Friday off as Pat was soaking up the rays in a warmer climate. They continue to chat about Carson Wentz officially becoming an Indianapolis Colt, Colts WR Michael Pittman not wanting to give up his number for Carson, Deshaun Watson potentially going to Carolina, and everything else going on in the sports world. Pat and the boys are also joined by three great guests. First, Colts CB, one of the best young defensive players in the league, Kenny Moore II joins Pat and the boys in studio to chat about his season, Carson Wentz becoming a Colt, what he's got planned for the offseason, what he needs to get better at, and much more (25:55-48:05). Next, Super Bowl Champion, #12 overall pick of the 2018 NFL Draft, Buccaneers NT, Vita Vea joins Pat and the boys chat about being a monster, his relationship with Suh, if he's always been that big, the Super Bowl hangover, what he's got planned for the offseason, his workout regimen, and more (49:53-1:11:52). Lastly, joining Pat and AJ Hawk fresh off a Genesis Invitational Championship is PGA Golfer Max Homa to chat about roasting people's swings, anxiety on the golf course, what kind of pros he hates playing with, his relationship with Tiger, and more (1:13:18-1:31:21).
