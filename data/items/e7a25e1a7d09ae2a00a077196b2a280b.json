  "description": "<p>Welcome back to The Literary Life Podcast and our discussion of the Art of Writing! If you missed last week’s discussion, you can go back and catch up <a href= \"http://theliterary.life/040/\">here</a>. We start off today with Angelina Stanford asking Karen Glass about the principles of good writing. Karen talks a bit about William Zinsser and his ideas about writing and education. Our hosts give some practical encouragement to the average homeschool parent listening to this conversation. Cindy highlights the value of waiting to teach specific skills until students are old enough to process them.</p> <p>Angelina, Cindy and Karen talk about narration in the Charlotte Mason education, its benefits and its challenges. They emphasize the importance of guiding children to think well instead of just learning mechanical skills devoid of context. Angelina brings up the sensitive topic of assessing and grading writing. Karen leaves us with a challenge to narrate this podcast discussion in writing in order to apply what you've learned! </p> <h3>Loving In Truth</h3> <p><em>by Sir Philip Sydney</em></p> <p>Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,<br /> That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,<br /> Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,<br /> Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,—<br /> I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,<br /> Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,<br /> Oft turning others’ leaves, to see if thence would flow<br /> Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain.<br /> But words came halting forth, wanting Invention’s stay:<br /> Invention, Nature’s child, fled step-dame Study’s blows,<br /> And others’ feet still seemed but strangers in my way.<br /> Thus great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,<br /> Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite:<br /> “Fool,” said my Muse to me, “look in thy heart and write.”</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TjNTk6\">Writing to Learn</a></em> by William Zinsser</p> <h3>Support The Literary Life:</h3> <p>Become a patron of The Literary Life podcast as part of the “Friends and Fellows Community” on <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/theliterarylife/overview\">Patreon,</a> and get some amazing bonus content!
