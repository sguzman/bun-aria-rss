But what really happens? Turns out they both have some pretty big secrets. There are a few twists in this one (which we didn't see coming), and it inspired us to talk a little bit about dating in New York (it's a battlefield). We both share our best (worst?) stories of being ghosted.</p> <p>We recorded this episode while on vacation in Morocco. This was one of the best trips either of us have taken and we spill all the details in the post!</p> <p>We are taking a two week hiatus but will be back on September 26th with an advice ep! In the meantime, our next book is Save the Date by Morgan Matson.</p> <p><strong>Can't get enough Bad On Paper?</strong></p> <p>Join our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/yapod\">FB group</a> for amazing book recs & more</p> <p>Follow us on Instagram <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/badonpaperpodcast\">@badonpaperpodcast</a></p>",
