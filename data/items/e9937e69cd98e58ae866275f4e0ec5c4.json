  "description": "<p>Following the removal of axial confinement the momentum distribution of a\nTonks-Girardeau gas approaches that of a system of noninteracting spinless\nfermions in the initial harmonic trap. This phenomenon, called dynamical\nfermionization, has been experimentally confirmed in the case of the\nLieb-Liniger model and theoretically predicted in the case of multicomponent\nsystems at zero temperature. We prove analytically that for all spinor gases\nwith strong repulsive contact interactions at finite temperature the momentum\ndistribution after release from the trap asymptotically approaches that of a\nsystem of spinless fermions at the same temperature but with a renormalized\nchemical potential which depends on the number of components of the spinor\nsystem. In the case of the Gaudin-Yang model we check numerically our\nanalytical predictions using the results obtained from a nonequilibrium\ngeneralization of Lenard's formula describing the time evolution of the\nfield-field correlators.\n</p>",
