  "description": "<p>Hear music that begins with classical instruments, like the string quartet, piano, or an orchestra, but which is then augmented, enhanced by electronics, percussion, or preparation. Listen to works by English violinist, pianist, and composer Poppy Ackroyd, Netherlands-based composer Peter Adriaansz, and cinematic music from the augmented string quartet amiina.</p>\n<p>The versatile Dutch pianist Saskia Lankhoorn plays a specially-prepared piano over a bed of droning sine tones in a work by Seattle-born, Netherlands-based Peter Adriaansz, “Attachments III.” Then, hear music by the Icelandic outfit, amiina, which was once the touring string quartet with Sigur Ros, and has now expanded to include percussion &amp; electronics. From amiina, hear selections from their standalone original live score to the 1913 film Fantômas, that lord of terror, creator of fear, and genius of evil who initially came to live in the crime fictions of French writers.</p>\n<p>Then, listen to \"Rave,\" music for piano and pre-recorded electronics by Molly Joyce for longtime friend and collaborator, pianist Vicky Chow from her record, <em>Aorta. </em>Also, hear music for percussion and electronics by John Luther Adams, featuring Glenn Kotche, from the long-form work, Ilimaq. Plus, listen to grand music for amplified orchestra by English composer Andrew Poppy from a record released on ZTT Records in the mid-eighties.</p>\n<p>PROGRAM #3927,  classical instruments, contemporary sounds  (First Aired 12-8-2016)        </p>\n<p>ARTIST: Andrew Poppy<br>WORK: 32 Frames for Amplified Orchestra, excerpt [1:00]<br>RECORDING: The Artefact Series<br>SOURCE: ZTT Records 186<br>INFO: <a href=\"http://www.ztt.com/artists/andrew-poppy/andrew-poppy-on-zang-tuum-tumb\" target=\"_blank\">ztt.com</a>  </p>\n<p>ARTIST: Saskia Lankhoorn, piano<br>WORK: Peter Adriaansz: Attachments III [7:52]<br>RECORDING: Enclosures<br>SOURCE: Ergodos ER 25<br>INFO: <a href=\"https://ergodos.ie/shop/records/enclosures/\" target=\"_blank\">ergodos.ie</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Poppy Ackroyd<br>WORK: Birdwoman [5:36]<br>RECORDING: Feathers<br>SOURCE: Denovali Records<br>INFO: <a href=\"http://denovali.com/shop/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=poppy+feathers\">denovali.com</a></p>\n<p><span>ARTIST: George Hurd Ensemble</span><br><span>WORK: Tethering Bird, excerpt [:38]</span><br><span>RECORDING: Navigation Without Numbers</span><br><span>SOURCE: Innova 937</span><br><span>INFO: <a href=\"https://www.innova.mu/albums/george-hurd/navigation-without-numbers\" target=\"_blank\">innova.mu</a></span></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Amiina<br>WORK: Guðmundur Vignir Karlsson: Crocodile [5:39]<br>RECORDING: Fantômas<br>SOURCE/INFO: <a href=\"https://exit.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Famiina.com\">amiina.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Andrew Poppy<br>WORK: 32 Frames for Amplified Orchestra [8:39]<br>RECORDING: The Artefact Series<br>SOURCE: ZTT Records 186<br>INFO: <a href=\"http://www.ztt.com/artists/andrew-poppy/andrew-poppy-on-zang-tuum-tumb\" target=\"_blank\">ztt.com</a>  </p>\n<p>ARTIST: Amiina<br>WORK: Solrun Sumarlidadottir: Café [3:25]<br>RECORDING: Fantômas<br>SOURCE/INFO: <a href=\"https://exit.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Famiina.com\">amiina.com</a></p>\n<p><span>ARTIST: Restroy</span><br><span>WORK: Skin, excerpt [:46]</span><br><span>RECORDING: Saturn Return</span><br><span>SOURCE: Milk Factory Productions </span><br><span>INFO: <a href=\"https://milkfactoryproductions.bandcamp.com/album/saturn-return\" target=\"_blank\">milkfactoryproductions.bandcamp.com</a></span></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Vicky Chow<br>WORK: Molly Joyce: Rave [11:17]<br>RECORDING: Aorta <br>SOURCE: NWAM083<br>INFO: <a href=\"http://newamrecords.com/chow-aorta\" target=\"_blank\">newamrecords.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST:  John Luther Adams &amp; Glenn Kotche<br>WORK: John Luther Adams: Ilimaq , Ascension [3:06]<br>RECORDING: Ilimaq<br>SOURCE: <a href=\"http://cantaloupemusic.com/albums/ilimaq\">Cantaloupe Music</a> 21112<br>INFO: <a href=\"https://johnlutheradams.bandcamp.com/album/ilimaq\">johnlutheradams.bandcamp.com</a></p>",
