David's story is fascinating. He went from leading Cabinet minister to ex MP within just a few months and now considers himself politically homeless. How did this happen to one of the Tories' most prominent and capable performers? It's probably not that hard to figure out but David tells his story with typical wit and warmth.&nbsp;He also reminisces about the coalition years, including the political legacy of austerity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow David on Twitter: @DavidGauke</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See Matt's completely rewritten stand-up show&nbsp;<strong>Clowns&nbsp;To&nbsp;The&nbsp;Left&nbsp;Of Me, Jokers&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Right</strong>&nbsp;on the following dates:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tues 18 Oct - Leicester Square Theatre</p><p>Fri 21 Oct - Bloomsbury Theatre</p><p>Fri 28 Oct - Bloomsbury Theatre</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tickets:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mattforde.com/2022tour\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mattforde.com/2022tour</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Buy tickets to&nbsp;<strong>The Political Party</strong>, live at The Duchess Theatre&nbsp;here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nimaxtheatres.com/shows/the-political-party-with-matt-forde/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://nimaxtheatres.com/shows/the-political-party-with-matt-forde/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Forthcoming guests include:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3 Oct:&nbsp;<strong>Mick Lynch</strong></p><p>17 Oct:&nbsp;<strong>Grant Shapps</strong></p><p>7 Nov:&nbsp;<strong>David Dimbleby</strong></p><p>14 Nov:<strong> Matt Hancock</strong></p><p>5 Dec:<strong>&nbsp;Rachel Reeves</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read David's New Statesman piece:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/comment/2022/09/conservatives-lost-fantasy-world-danger-country\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.newstatesman.com/comment/2022/09/conservatives-lost-fantasy-world-danger-country</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read David's ConservativeHome piece on Kwarsi Kwarteng's Budget:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://conservativehome.com/2022/09/26/david-gauke-after-last-weeks-budget-in-all-but-name-its-clear-how-brave-the-government-is-or-in-other-words-foolhardy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://conservativehome.com/2022/09/26/david-gauke-after-last-weeks-budget-in-all-but-name-its-clear-how-brave-the-government-is-or-in-other-words-foolhardy/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
