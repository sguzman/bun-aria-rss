  "description": "<p>I’ve come to realize something, we are all healing from something. All the time. Maybe it’s a physical illness or injury or harm, maybe it’s rooted more in our minds, maybe it’s even rooted in the culture. But, we’re all invited into a path of healing, and we all need it on some level, even if we don’t know it, or want to own it quite yet.</p><p>Question is, how do you find healing when you feel like all the odds are stacked against you?</p><br><p>When you feel like you take two steps backward for every step forward? How do you heal beyond the visible wounds, and reclaim something deeper, more whole? And, how do we heal as a path of growth and expression and joy?</p><br><p>This is where we’re heading in today’s conversation with Alex Elle, who's found a way to approach self-healing from a practical, relatable, expansive standpoint. Alex is an author, certified breathwork coach, and restorative writing teacher whose powerful healing journey has led her to where she is today. Her newest book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3WtTmDu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How We Heal: Uncover Your Power and Set Yourself Free</em></a>, is a practical and empowering guide to self-healing, filled with essential techniques and insights that invite readers to unlock their confidence to heal on their own. </p><br><p>And in our conversation today, we explore Alex's own healing journey and the barriers—which you might find relatable—that stood in the way of her process, and we discuss the difficulties of healing when no one else around you is doing it, breaking generational cycles, and how to heal when you're ready.&nbsp;</p><br><p>You can find Alex at: <a href=\"https://www.alexelle.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alex/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode </strong>you’ll also love the conversations we had with <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/good-life-project/id647826736?i=1000546179064\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Lesser</a> about a life of perpetual awakening and healing.</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My New Book </strong><a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a></li><li><strong>My New Podcast </strong><a href=\"https://pod.link/1610198312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SPARKED</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sponsors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Our Sponsor Page For a Complete List of Vanity URLs & Discount Codes.</a></li><li><strong>Skylight Calendar: </strong>Skylight Calendar is a touchscreen digital wall calendar that displays your family's important events.
