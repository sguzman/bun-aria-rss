  "description": "Empire of Imagination: Gary Gygax and the Birth of Dungeons and Dragons (Bloomsbury, 2015) by Michael Witwer is an exceptional biography of the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons, E. Gary Gygax. Witwer presents an honest, meticulously researched historical account of his subject’s life, while at the same time offering a compelling narrative for his readers. Lovers of Dungeons and Dragons will find much to love in this book, which was clearly a passion project for Witwer, who began the text in the context of research during his Master’s degree. I highly recommend Empire of Imagination to anyone with an interest in the story of this seminal, enormously important game and its brilliant albeit quirky creators.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
