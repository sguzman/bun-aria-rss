The new Photonic Engine allows for Deep Fusion before the compression stage. This allows a higher level of image quality with efficient processing speeds.\n\nWith new emergency features, the new A16 processor, the new dynamic island and better battery life - is the iPhone 14 worth the upgrade? Depends on what your needs are but so far I’ve been very impressed with these phones.\n\nMy Adobe Lightroom and Capture One Presets https://theartofphotography.tv/presets/\nAoP T-Shirts https://aop.threadless.com/\nNeed a website? http://squarespace.com/aop\n\nOn my channel you will find videos about photography, cinematography, post processing tutorials for Capture One, Lightroom and Photoshop, photo assignments that YOU can participate in, the Artist Series and more.
