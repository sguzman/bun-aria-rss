  "description": "<p>Rafinha is a Brazilian comedian that really started the comedy scene in Brazil back in the early 2000s. He’s been on TV, movies and has his own comedy club in his town. Standup is having a boom in parts of Brazil now due to him and now he’s moved to LA to become a comic in the US. Really great conversation from a very cool guy.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
