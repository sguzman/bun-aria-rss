  "description": "<p>As we hit the summer solstice, we take a pause to look back on the first half of the year, and ask what we might want for the next six months. This is exactly what summer solstice has always been on our half of the world - a time to slow down and enjoy the sun and just take some time to think about our next evolution. As we discuss this, we consider the realities of personal growth, the inevitability of getting things wrong before we get them right, and the importance of putting ourselves first (something that is particularly hard for many women). This kind of pause is a fabulous way to break routine and challenge our habits. We hope this episode inspires you to spend a day or two simply reflecting on where you have been and where you would like to go.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>If you'd like to keep the Refresh Retreat sessions you can find out more here: <a href=\"https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/refresh\">www.soulrocketstudio.com/refresh</a></p>\n<p>Blog about the summer solstice: <a href=\"https://spiritualgangster.com/blogs/news/summer-solstice-honoring-the-light-within\"><u>https://spiritualgangster.com/blogs/news/summer-solstice-honoring-the-light-within</u></a></p>\n<p>Glennan Doyle: Untamed <a href=\"\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Untamed-Glennon-Doyle/dp/1984801252</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
