  "description": "What's more screwed up in the White House--personnel or policy?  There's virtually no senior advisor to the President who hasn't left or been rumored to be on their way out.  (With the exception of Trump's Igor, Stephen Miller, who will be flattering his boss and promoting institutionalized racism until the very last day of the administration.)  There is almost no policy area where the policy approach has not been ill-considered and contradicted by someone in the administration.  Our experts including former Under Secretary of State Bob Hormats, David Sanger of the New York Times, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University discuss the latest developments in both areas--from the departure of Hope Hicks to some really really bad 1920's vintage trade policies.
