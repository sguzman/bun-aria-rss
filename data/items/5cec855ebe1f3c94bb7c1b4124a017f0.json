  "description": "Bad Bets, a podcast series from The Wall Street Journal that unravels big-business dramas that have had a big impact on our world, is back for Season 2. This season, we delve into the story of Nikola founder Trevor Milton. He took his company Nikola to dizzying heights on the promise of a zero-emissions semi truck. At its peak, Nikola’s publicly traded stock was worth more than Ford—until a ragtag group of whistleblowers and short sellers revealed that Nikola and its truck wasn’t all that it seemed. This season on Bad Bets, Journal reporter Ben Foldy will tell the inside story of Trevor Milton’s rise and fall. You’ll hear exclusive interviews and recordings, and details from secret documents. And we’ll take you deep into Trevor Milton’s federal fraud trial, where he’s fighting the charges against him.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
