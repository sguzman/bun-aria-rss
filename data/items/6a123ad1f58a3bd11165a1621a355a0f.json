  "itunes:summary": "Of course, he did not know where it was. He was eighty-five years of age and had written dozens of books. I was asking him if he could tell me exactly where in his books I could find the quote I was looking for. He told me that he had absolutely no idea, but gave me permission to quote it anyway. Since then I have used his quote over and over again because it seemed to me that Bishop Lesslie Newbigin had summarised a crucial insight for our understanding of Jesus and the New Testament.\n‘The resurrection was not the reversal of a defeat but the manifestation of a victory.’\nThe cross was not a defeat. Rather, taken together, the cross and resurrection are the greatest victory to have taken place in the history of the world. It is a victory that has huge implications for our own lives, our society and the future of this world.\nThe idea of ‘victory’ can smack of imperialism and pride. Of course, triumphalism is to be avoided. However, ‘victory’ is not a negative word in the Bible, even in the New Testament.\nThe key to a right understanding of ‘victory’ is to see it as a gift made possible ‘through our Lord Jesus Christ’ (1 Corinthians 15:57). This means that the appropriate response is not pride, but thankfulness.",
