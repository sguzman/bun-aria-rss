  "description": "Hi everyone! In today's episode, I am getting HONEST about some things. Things I have not really admitted to many before. Addiction, confusion, bad habits, bad friends, ill intentions, and more. I also speak about how I truly realized that my habits were only pulling me away from God, and how I found Christ again after living a double life. \n\nJeanine's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jeanineamapola/\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/happyandhealthy/message\nSupport this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/happyandhealthy/support\" rel=\"payment\">https://anchor.fm/happyandhealthy/support</a>",
