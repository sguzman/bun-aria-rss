  "description": "HBO's <em>We Own This City</em> zeroes in on rampant corruption and abuse within Baltimore's criminal justice system. It features drug dealers, civilians and the police officers who recklessly target them both. There's also politicians and federal agents with competing interests and egos. If this sounds like <em>The Wire</em>, they do share some DNA: David Simon and George Pelecanos are its creators. And while a few <em>Wire</em>-verse alumni appear, is this series more than just a rewiring of Baltimore politics?",
