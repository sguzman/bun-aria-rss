  "title": "Aidy Bryant, Comedian Alex Edelman | It's Been Two Long",
  "description": "Two years ago tonight, Stephen Colbert performed his monologue for a nearly-empty Ed Sullivan Theater as New York City began to enter the first phase of the pandemic lockdown. Join Stephen for a not-so-fond look back at the past two years and some of the ways we’ve grown (primarily at the waistband). Next, with so much money flowing into the NFT market, it’s no surprise that it has attracted a new generation of art thieves. And with NFT theft on the rise, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood turned it into a blockbuster heist movie. And Stephen can’t hide his shock when the delightful Aidy Bryant tells him she used to work four-month stints on a cruise ship teaching improv classes to young people. Stick around for more from Aidy Bryant, and check out her new show, “Human Resources,” streaming now on Netflix. Then, Stephen answers audience questions, and nothing is too personal, and no answer too dumb, especially if it involves aliens. And finally, comedian, writer and actor Alex Edelman makes his Late Show stand-up comedy debut and gets the whole theater laughing with true stories about his family. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
