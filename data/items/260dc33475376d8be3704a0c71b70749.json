  "description": "<p>“I'd always wanted to write a ghost story. And I always wanted to write about what it was like to be haunted, because I feel that so many of us are.” Louise Erdrich’s new novel, <em>The Sentence</em>—her first after <em>The Night Watchman</em>, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction—is a funny, big-hearted and profound story of second chances and ghosts, books and bookselling, and the messy love between spouses and parents and children. Louise joins us on the show to talk about hauntings, perfect short novels, the joys of bookselling, the power of names and more. Featured books: <em>The Sentence</em> by Louise Erdrich and <em>Euphoria</em> by Lily King. Produced/hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>",
