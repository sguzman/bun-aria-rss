  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys get into a heated argument about whether or not movie theatres are dead after AMC Theatres announced that they might not be able to survive as a business, and unsurprisingly, the room is divided down the middle. The guys also check out some #PodFacts and see what they've gotten wrong over the past few episodes, and give praise to Mutt, a cigarette dog in WW1 who may have been a key cog in winning the war. If you're out this weekend, stay safe. Enjoy</p>\n",
