Matt tells his story of being a kid in 1983 and having a friend hand a copy of <i>Murmur</i> to him. He explains how he learned to play guitar by spinning early R.E.M. records, and how their music followed him all through his life, from an auto-body shop in North Long Beach all the way to eastern Europe during the post-Communist ’90s. Jeff marvels at how R.E.M. was the one American indie band from the ’80s scene to gain escape velocity and make it big.</p>\n<p><b><span>The Early Years</span><br />\n</b>The gang discusses R.E.M.’s early mysterious LPs, the foundation of their legend. Is <i>Murmur</i> the greatest debut album of all time? Jeff certainly thinks so; whereas Scot doesn’t even think it’s the best of their first two records. preferring the more energetic <i>Reckoning</i>. Matt nominates “We Walk” for his upcoming compilation disc entitled <i>Songs That Singlehandedly Ruin Otherwise Perfect Albums</i>. Attention is given to the fully-formed nature of the band’s sound–it didn’t come about by chance, as it turns out–and the hints of impending gloom found on songs like “Camera.”</p>\n<p>KEY SONGS: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbK7WzJstTw\" target=\"_blank\">We Walk</a>” (<i>Murmur</i>, 1983); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88TZSjL7mrw\" target=\"_blank\">Wolves, Lower</a>” (<i>Chronic Town </i>EP, 1982); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ZEGhsPSKE\" target=\"_blank\">Gardening At Night (different vocal mix)</a>” (<i>Eponymous</i>, 1988); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxyaq5NspiA\" target=\"_blank\">Laughing</a>” (<i>Murmur</i>, 1983); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSzFfgfAhTA\" target=\"_blank\">Perfect Circle</a>” (<i>Murmur</i>, 1983); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0wj8AK32tQ\" target=\"_blank\">Sitting Still</a>” (<i>Murmur</i>, 1983); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Sz0h5LYdyY\" target=\"_blank\">Talk About The Passion</a>” (<i>Murmur</i>, 1983); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntY15gVsgJA\" target=\"_blank\">Harborcoat</a>” (<i>Reckoning</i>, 1984); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCst8UKSfL8\" target=\"_blank\">So.

Jeff, meanwhile, explains that he doesn’t entirely trust people who dislike the song “Driver 8.”</p>\n<p>Scot focuses on the underrated greatness of the record’s 1986 followup <i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i>, and everyone heartily agrees that it is mysteriously neglected. Jeff explains why it was a record that should have failed: heavily reliance on old/recycled material, a curiously odd instrumental, a cover track — and yet none of that matters. Matt singles out the effectiveness of the album’s environmental and political themes: powerful without ever seeming preachy.</p>\n<p>KEY SONGS: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVgO_KAcRqQ\" target=\"_blank\">Driver 8</a>” (<i>Fables Of The Reconstruction</i>, 1985); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovuP_4is0wY\" target=\"_blank\">Maps And Legends</a>” (<i>Fables Of The Reconstruction, </i>1985); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYA63w2PtFk\" target=\"_blank\">Feeling Gravity’s Pull</a>” (<i>Fables Of The Reconstruction</i>, 1985); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YalGy1R-9c\" target=\"_blank\">Auctioneer (Another Engine)</a>” (<i>Fables Of The Reconstruction</i>, 1985); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6ud6b1RIxE\" target=\"_blank\">Fall On Me</a>” (<i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i>, 1986); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Wz1DRuPJo&feature=youtu.be&t=9s\" target=\"_blank\">Superman</a>” (<i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i>, 1986); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPD1zPFZ3Q\" target=\"_blank\">Cuyahoga</a>” (<i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i>, 1986); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vgEWp7Voyk\" target=\"_blank\">These Days</a>” (<i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i>, 1986); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NSJbEeNSe0\" target=\"_blank\">Swan Swan H</a>” (<i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i>, 1986)</p>\n<p><span><b>R.E.M. breaks into the big-time with a big new sound. </b><strong><i>Document</i></strong><b> and the major-label debut of </b></span><i><span><b>Green.</b></span><br />\n</i>Jeff just can’t think of enough bad things to say about <i>Document</i>, the R.E.M. album that broke the band into the mainstream with its two major radio hits, and Matt tends to agree.

Jeff has a weak spot for well-recorded chamber-pop with odd conceits, and defends “Belong” in particular.

Jeff is having none of that however and singles out “Sweetness Follows” in particular as the sort of song he is simply in awe of. Everybody defends “Everybody Hurts.”</p>\n<p>KEY SONGS: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHeEXia7fbM\" target=\"_blank\">Losing My Religion</a>” (<i>Out Of Time</i>, 1991); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0pLIO0aDlo\" target=\"_blank\">Radio Song</a>” (<i>Out Of Time</i>, 1991); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jluo5VoZeYg\" target=\"_blank\">Texarkana</a>” (<i>Out Of Time</i>, 1991); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMFyV60KhdI\" target=\"_blank\">Near Wild Heaven</a>” (<i>Out Of Time</i>, 1991); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyOnKHTo8Xw\" target=\"_blank\">Belong</a>” (<i>Out Of Time</i>, 1991); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI95HD_6PIo\" target=\"_blank\">Me In Honey</a>” (<i>Out Of Time</i>, 1991); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El6Uq2u2z6A\" target=\"_blank\">Drive</a>” (<i>Automatic For The People</i>, 1992); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dum-6gcW5U\" target=\"_blank\">The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight</a>” (<i>Automatic For The People</i>, 1992); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rOiW_xY-kc\" target=\"_blank\">Everybody Hurts</a>” (<i>Automatic For The People</i>, 1992); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6OY-IoJLeY\" target=\"_blank\">Sweetness Follows</a>” (<i>Automatic For The People</i>, 1992); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUm87Hnr_To\" target=\"_blank\">Man On The Moon</a>” (<i>Automatic For The People</i>; 1992)</p>\n<p><b><span>The disastrous faceplant of <i>Monster</i>, the revival of <i>New Adventures In Hi-Fi</i>, Bill Berry’s departure and the long slow sunset of the band</span><br />\n</b>The gang discusses the unexpected flop that was R.E.M.’s “hard rock”/we’re-a-live-act-again move, <i>Monster–</i>to date the the most <i>returned</i> CD of all time–and speculate on why it failed so miserably. Scot memorably describes it as a record that “sounds good . . . once.” Matt suggests that they didn’t fully understand the genres (grunge and glam) they were trying to cop, while Jeff speculates that they just couldn’t go home again; they had changed into something else during their evolution and there was no return.</p>\n<p>Jeff has high praise, however, for its follow-up <i>New Adventures In Hi-Fi</i>, which he considers the last truly great record the band ever released. Matt and Scot are less impressed, but this merely means that they are wrong. (N.B. Jeff writes the show-notes.) Jeff also praises <i>Up</i> as an admirable attempt to react to the loss of Bill Berry, who retired from the group in 1996 after a brain aneurysm, and while Matt can see the argument he thinks the band should have hung it up at this point. All three agree that R.E.M. lost something critical with Berry, something that renders their last four records (and the final decade of the career) a curiously unnecessary appendix.</p>\n<p>KEY SONGS: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdOMdH_uEO8\" target=\"_blank\">Strange Currencies</a>” (<i>Monster</i>, 1994); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI7ZaBO5X_c\" target=\"_blank\">I Don’t Sleep, I Dream</a>” (<i>Monster</i>, 1994); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiFhXuCLS10\" target=\"_blank\">Be Mine</a>” (<i>New Adventures In Hi-Fi</i>, 1996); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izkgT1N_REg\" target=\"_blank\">Bittersweet Me</a>” (<i>New Adventures In Hi-Fi</i>, 1996); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqwvVLa3hc\" target=\"_blank\">Leave</a>” (<i>New Adventures In Hi-Fi</i>, 1996); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrcZyeQxt30\" target=\"_blank\">New Test Leper (acoustic version)</a>” (B-side of “Bittersweet Me,” 1996); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl6aWzgWLjM\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Of Death</a>” (<i>Beat The Retreat – A Tribute To Richard Thompson</i>, 1994); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq6bheVYtJg\" target=\"_blank\">Lotus</a>” (<i>Up</i>, 1998); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n8OHUJSmRo\" target=\"_blank\">Walk Unafraid</a>” (<i>Up</i>, 1998); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N21472M8p9E\" target=\"_blank\">Hope</a>” (<i>Up, </i>1998); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYeQb3yBF0c\" target=\"_blank\">All The Way To Reno (You’re Gonna Be A Star)</a>” (<i>Reveal</i>, 2001); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htnBqmWygVM\" target=\"_blank\">Beachball</a>” (<i>Reveal</i>, 2001)</p>\n<p><b><span>Finale</span><br />\n</b>Matt, Scot and Jeff each name their 2 key albums and 5 key songs by R.E.M.</p>\n",

Scot memorably describes it as a record that “sounds good . . . once.” Matt suggests that they didn’t fully understand the genres (grunge and glam) they were trying to cop, while Jeff speculates that they just couldn’t go home again; they had changed into something else during their evolution and there was no return.</p>\n<p>Jeff has high praise, however, for its follow-up <i>New Adventures In Hi-Fi</i>, which he considers the last truly great record the band ever released. Matt and Scot are less impressed, but this merely means that they are wrong. (N.B. Jeff writes the show-notes.) Jeff also praises <i>Up</i> as an admirable attempt to react to the loss of Bill Berry, who retired from the group in 1996 after a brain aneurysm, and while Matt can see the argument he thinks the band should have hung it up at this point. All three agree that R.E.M. lost something critical with Berry, something that renders their last four records (and the final decade of the career) a curiously unnecessary appendix.</p>\n<p>KEY SONGS: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdOMdH_uEO8\" target=\"_blank\">Strange Currencies</a>” (<i>Monster</i>, 1994); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI7ZaBO5X_c\" target=\"_blank\">I Don’t Sleep, I Dream</a>” (<i>Monster</i>, 1994); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiFhXuCLS10\" target=\"_blank\">Be Mine</a>” (<i>New Adventures In Hi-Fi</i>, 1996); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izkgT1N_REg\" target=\"_blank\">Bittersweet Me</a>” (<i>New Adventures In Hi-Fi</i>, 1996); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqwvVLa3hc\" target=\"_blank\">Leave</a>” (<i>New Adventures In Hi-Fi</i>, 1996); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrcZyeQxt30\" target=\"_blank\">New Test Leper (acoustic version)</a>” (B-side of “Bittersweet Me,” 1996); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl6aWzgWLjM\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Of Death</a>” (<i>Beat The Retreat – A Tribute To Richard Thompson</i>, 1994); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq6bheVYtJg\" target=\"_blank\">Lotus</a>” (<i>Up</i>, 1998); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n8OHUJSmRo\" target=\"_blank\">Walk Unafraid</a>” (<i>Up</i>, 1998); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N21472M8p9E\" target=\"_blank\">Hope</a>” (<i>Up, </i>1998); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYeQb3yBF0c\" target=\"_blank\">All The Way To Reno (You’re Gonna Be A Star)</a>” (<i>Reveal</i>, 2001); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htnBqmWygVM\" target=\"_blank\">Beachball</a>” (<i>Reveal</i>, 2001)</p>\n<p><b><span>Finale</span><br />\n</b>Matt, Scot and Jeff each name their 2 key albums and 5 key songs by R.E.M.</p>\n",
