  "description": "<p>In the Vertex Triangle 2-Club problem, we are given an undirected graph $G$\nand aim to find a maximum-vertex subgraph of $G$ that has diameter at most 2\nand in which every vertex is contained in at least $\\ell$ triangles in the\nsubgraph. So far, the only algorithm for solving Vertex Triangle 2-Club relies\non an ILP formulation [Almeida and Br\\'as, Comput. Oper. Res. 2019]. In this\nwork, we develop a combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm that, coupled with\na set of data reduction rules, outperforms the existing implementation and is\nable to find optimal solutions on sparse real-world graphs with more than\n100,000 vertices in a few minutes. We also extend our algorithm to the Edge\nTriangle 2-Club problem where the triangle constraint is imposed on all edges\nof the subgraph.\n</p>",
