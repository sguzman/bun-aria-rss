  "description": "In this episode, Fred talks Jesus, drugs and political idiots with Southern Rapper Jelly Roll, who freely admits he wanted to kiss Fred on the air. In this deep-and-comedic interview, Jelly Roll talks a lot of common sense on his path to Fred selecting a bourbon perfect for his palate. The fact Jelly Roll liked all the flavors he suggested made it easier to pick a great bourbon.\n\nIf you're not following Jelly Roll, you're missing out on one of the hip hop scene's most unique individuals. He recently did a film with Chelsea Handler and has collaborated with  Tech N9ne, Lil Wyte, Haystak and Struggle Jennings. But full warning: This interview contains explicit language. Do not listen to around children.\n\nThis week's trivia question: What major whiskey brand hired a salesman to follow around and supply a famous musician with their whiskey?\n\nAlso, a heckler heckles Fred during his reads. Can he handle the insults?\n\nRecording Location: Louder Than Life Festival\n\nSponsors\n\nMichter's American Whiskey\n\n291 Colorado Whiskey \n\nHeaven Hill Distillery  \n\nFollow Fred\n\nYouTube\n\nFredMinnick.com\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nSpirits Network\n\nBourbon Plus\n\nBourbon Pursuit\n\nSubscribe to Jelly Roll\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtyzzW6rIQiGP7gfGTXkhDw\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
