  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, we are extremely lucky to have this President and Vice President coordinating the federal response to this pandemic. There is a serious potential danger for the coronavirus, but right now the number of positive cases averages to 82 people per state and averages to less than 1.4 deaths per state. The cure for coronavirus will not come from Congress, it will come from the innovation unleashed in the private sector. Let's not forget that the shortage of tests didn't come from the White House — it came from the CDC. The Democrats are creating as much hype and hysteria about a depression to funnel as much money to states like New York. Nationalizing industries, quantitative easing, and quasi-dictatorial decision-making along with massive regulation will only hurt this nation. FDR did this when he took America from a recession to a depression. What President Trump's administration has done in the past six weeks is nothing short of remarkable. Making money available to businesses that need it to get over the hump caused by this pandemic is another reason why this will not be a depression. Then, the big difference from the recession of Carter-Reagan, or the great depression was caused by financial collapse, not because of the virus. America’s financial position is stronger than it’s been in a long time. This isn't the Federal Reserve causing this recession, it’s the response to mother nature and this virus that are causing these economic consequences. Later, in Canada, liberal Trudeau announced that he will be closing the Canadian border. Yet, Joe Biden said in last night's debate that he would not construct a wall or deport anyone unless they commit a felony inside of the United States.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
