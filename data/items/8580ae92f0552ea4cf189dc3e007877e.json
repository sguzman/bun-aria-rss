  "description": "With every breakthrough, computer scientists are pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence (AI). We see it in everything from predictive text to facial recognition to mapping disease incidence. But increasingly machines show many of the same biases as humans, particularly with communities of color and vulnerable populations. In this episode, we learn how leading technologists are disrupting their own inventions to create a more humane AI.\nFor more information on this episode, visit nationalgeographic.com/overheard.\n\nWant more?\nIn 2020 widespread use of medical masks has created a new niche—face-mask recognition. The technology would help local governments enforce mask mandates, but is it worth it?\nThanks to evolution, human faces are much more variable than other body parts. In the words of one researcher, “It's like evolving a name tag.”\nMost people have difficulty accurately recognizing strangers. But a few individuals—called super-recognizers—excel at the task.
