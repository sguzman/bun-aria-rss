  "description": "<p>The boss behind The Beatrice Inn in New York City, Chef Angie Mar is one of the hardest working chefs we know and 100% an original. A late bloomer in the food world, she was in the real estate business for years and realized being a chef was her true calling. After culinary school, she worked for Chef April Bloomfield, then helped turn around The Bea, as she calls it. Not only did she garner rave reviews for the place, but she bought the restaurant from its owners last year. Tune in to hear more of Angie's impressive story. P.S. The news didn't break in time for our interview, but Angie is one of Food & Wine's Best New Chefs 2017. Make sure you pick up the issue. We're happy to see Food & Wine has recognized more female chefs this year than ever before.</p>\n",
