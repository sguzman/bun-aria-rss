In the weeks before the 2020 election, most corporate outlets spread the CIA lie that the materials on the Hunter Biden laptop -- which raised questions about the activities of front-runner Joe Biden in Ukraine and China -- were \"Russian disinformation,\" meaning that the documents were fake and were forged by Russia. It was clear from the start that the archive was real and they were lying. But even now that the New York Times, the Washington Post and a Politico reporter have all authenticated the archive, these media outlets that spread that destructive lie refuse to retract it or acknowledge this proof.",
