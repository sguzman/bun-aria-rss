  "description": "<p>This paper presents LE3D; a novel data drift detection framework for\npreserving data integrity and confidentiality. LE3D is a generalisable platform\nfor evaluating novel drift detection mechanisms within the Internet of Things\n(IoT) sensor deployments. Our framework operates in a distributed manner,\npreserving data privacy while still being adaptable to new sensors with minimal\nonline reconfiguration. Our framework currently supports multiple drift\nestimators for time-series IoT data and can easily be extended to accommodate\nnew data types and drift detection mechanisms. This demo will illustrate the\nfunctionality of LE3D under a real-world-like scenario.\n</p>",
