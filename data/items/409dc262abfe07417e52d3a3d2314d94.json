  "description": "When our kids are older, we usually define confidence as trusting yourself and not following the crowd. And yet, when our kids are younger, we often have the exact opposite definition: Why isn’t my kid confident enough to make friends at the playground? Why won’t my child leave my lap at a party? Why do they stay on the sidelines at soccer? In this episode, Dr. Becky talks to three callers about reframing shyness as a form of confidence. With practical scripts and strategies, she encourages parents to reflect on what shyness brings up for us, resist the “shy” label, and tell our kids that they’ll know when they’re ready.\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A  <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
