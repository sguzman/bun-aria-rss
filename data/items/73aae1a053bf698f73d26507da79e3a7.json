  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, do ‘We The People’ have a right to participate in this impeachment process? All day long we've heard reports of secret closed-door testimony from witness after witness and we are only fed whatever cherry-picked information the democrats want to leak. The media and the Democrats have a symbiotic relationship but that does nothing for the American people. The media as an institution exists to serve as a check on our government and let us know what they are doing. However, the media is allowing history to be made while a star-chamber styled impeachment inquiry is underway and the press could care less — in some instances, they're leading it. Now the media is fixated on setting up Rudy Giuliani, meanwhile, Hunter Biden sits with reporters on morning television and doesn't even have to go under oath. The American people need more media options, more technology, and more competition within the press. Then, Nancy Pelosi held a press conference to announce that the full House will hold off on a vote for an impeachment inquiry right now. Later, Hong Kong continues to suffer at the hand of China and NBA players like Lebron James give their voice to China. Afterward, Fox News Anchor and Author Bret Baier join the show to discuss his new book \"Three Days At The Brink: FDR’s Daring Gamble to Win World War II.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
