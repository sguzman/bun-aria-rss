  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, what is JD Vance's record? What did you know about Representatives Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene five or six years ago? Nothing. Were they spearheading the conservative movement in Ohio like Senate Candidate Josh Mandel was? Electing risky candidates like billionaire-backed JD Vance makes it very difficult to vote them out if you're not satisfied. Vance lacks the record that Mandel has so he attacks and smears him because Vance has no conservative record, but he did admit that he voted against President Trump in 2016. Mandel is a combat veteran and former Secretary of State in Ohio that stood up to RINOs. Afterward, Mandel joins the show. Mandel reiterated his stance as a constitutional conservative. He questioned whether his opponent was even a registered Republican, let alone a conservative. Then, the New York Times has authored a malicious hit piece on Fox News Channel Host Tucker Carlson falsely claiming he is a White supremacist. However, it’s the NY Times that has the dubious past with relatives of its founder that fought for cessation because of their support for slavery. Later, it's inevitable that our country will experience more brownouts and blackouts as Biden implements more Green New Deal policies. This leads to shortages in paper and lumber production which drives up their cost. As Biden and the degrowth climate change movement attack fossil fuels less food will be available. Less fuel, less food and housing.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
