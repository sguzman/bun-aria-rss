Well, it is, and today you can learn how. Perhaps the greatest part of this exciting news is that the changes we can make to reverse biological aging are pretty simple and very accessible. The amazing doctor behind this groundbreaking research is my good friend, colleague, and long-time collaborator Dr. Kara Fitzgerald.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Fitzgerald is on the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine, is an IFM Certified Practitioner, and lectures globally on Functional Medicine. She runs a Functional Medicine Clinic Immersion program for professionals and hosts a podcast series, New Frontiers in Functional Medicine, and an active blog on her website. Her clinical practice is in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. With the Helfgott Research Institute, Dr. Fitzgerald is actively engaged in clinical research on the DNA methylome using a diet and lifestyle intervention developed in her practice. The first publication from the study focuses on the reversal of biological aging and was published this past April in the journal Aging.
