But they also rest on over a millennium of interpretation and debate.    In our first episode of this series on &quot;The Making of the Islamic World,&quot; we&#39;re exploring the history of Islamic legal traditions and the ways in which scholarship on the past relates to how people imagine what Islamic law is and what it can be. In addition to discussing what Islamic jurisprudence is and how it developed, we examine the extent to which Islamic law provided a framework for addressing matters that had little to do with religion as we might conventionally understand it. We also feature the voices of scholars engaged in new research that makes us rethink common misconceptions about the early history of Islam that have implications for how Muslims understand Islamic law today.   </div>  <a href=\"https://www.ottomanhistorypodcast.com/2020/12/islamic-law.html#more\">« Click for More »</a>",
