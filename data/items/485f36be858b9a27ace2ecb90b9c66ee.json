  "description": "<p>September 19, 2020. Keene, New Hampshire. 25 year old Jonathan Amerault is a no-show for his job at Teleflex on September 19th and two days later his mother reports him missing to the New Hampshire police. Britany Barron, his girlfriend and coworker, also missed work but had called in to say she was quitting. The authorities didn't believe this to be a coincidence and went to work conducting interviews and searching for Jonathan and Britany. What they would later discover was a diabolical plot by someone to ambush and brutally murder one of the two. </p><p>Support Generation Why and great causes that we donate to: patreon.com/generationwhy</p><p>Listen ad free with Wondery+.
