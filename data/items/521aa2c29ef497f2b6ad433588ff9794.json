  "itunes:summary": "Vernon Bogdanor’s latest book, Britain and Europe in a Troubled World, considers the motivations which lay behind Brexit, and asks how widespread they are in the rest of Europe.  Has the elitism in the original European project become a handicap to progress? How can ‘ever closer union’ be achieved by popular consent amongst 27 highly diverse member states? Is it possible for the member states to consider the interests of Europe as a whole? To discuss these questions he is joined by Dr Julie Smith, Reader in European Politics at Cambridge and member of the House of Lords International Relations and Defence Committee, and Agata Gostyńska-Jakubowska, Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for European Reform, Brussels.",
