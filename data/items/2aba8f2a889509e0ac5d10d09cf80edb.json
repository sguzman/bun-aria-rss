  "description": "The Supreme Court's decision in <em>Roe v. Wade</em> transformed the landscape of abortion rights overnight. For the doctors, lawyers, feminists, and others who had fought for nationwide legalization, <em>Roe</em> was the end of a long battle. But for the growing movement against abortion rights, it was the beginning of a new battle: to protect the fetus, challenge abortion providers, and ultimately overturn <em>Roe.</em> This is the story of how opponents of abortion rights banded together, built power, and launched one of the most successful grassroots campaigns of the past century.",
