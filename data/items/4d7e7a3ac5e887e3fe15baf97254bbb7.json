  "description": "My guest this episode is Dr. Emily Balcetis, PhD, Professor of Psychology at New York University (NYU). Dr. Balcetis’ research focuses on how our perception of the world, particularly our visual perceptions, influences our level and persistence of motivation, how we conceptualize goals, actual goal achievement, and our emotional state as we pursue goals. Dr. Balcetis explains how to best visualize and overcome challenges in pursuit of larger, complex goals. We also discuss the science of how to define goals and intermediate milestones, overcome obstacles, and effectively track progress. This episode highlights science-based, immediately actionable tools that anyone can use to set and achieve physical and/or cognitive goals more effectively.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Emily Balcetis, Visualization of Goals & Motivation\n(00:03:24) Momentous Supplements\n(00:04:38) Thesis, Levels, ROKA\n(00:08:08) Vision & Motivation\n(00:11:37) Tool: Narrowing Visual Focus & Improving Exercise\n(00:21:39) Adjusting Visual Attention & Perceived Fatigue\n(00:25:14) Tool: Visual Focus “Spotlight”\n(00:27:57) Tool: Goal Gradient Hypothesis, Visual Spotlight to Increase Effort\n(00:33:38) AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:35:00) Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists \n(00:41:28) Tool: How to Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles\n(00:46:38) Vision is Unique, Challenging the Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-Goals\n(00:57:12) Do Fit People View the World Differently?, States of Body & Visual Experiences\n(01:05:54) Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation\n(01:10:13) Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection\n(01:21:54) Year in Review & Memory\n(01:26:32) Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming\n(01:31:33) Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution\n(01:36:12) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Momentous Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
