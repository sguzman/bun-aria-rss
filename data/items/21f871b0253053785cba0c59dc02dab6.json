  "description": "<p>Sean Patton becomes the first Skeptic Tank guest to ever appear via webcam to tell me about what New Orleans was like for him in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Pretty much Skeptic Tank is the only podcast where you'll hear about stuff like this in a funny podcast. Anyway, that time seemed to me to have a lot of parallels to what's going on right now. So he told me about some of the stuff that went down out there. Really great, funny conversation that helped me deal with quarantine zero percent better so don't expect any answers.</p> <p> </p> <p>Check out Sean's podcast, \"<a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/5-words-with-sean-patton-caitlin-cook/id1463455010\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5 Words</a>.\" I'll be on in a couple weeks.</p> <p>And please help support him if you can, by downloading his new standup album, <a href= \"https://music.apple.com/us/album/scuttlebutt/1489360888\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scuttlebutt</a>.</p>",
