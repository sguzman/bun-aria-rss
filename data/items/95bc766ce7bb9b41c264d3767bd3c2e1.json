At BoF VOICES, Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson laid out how to turn the industry’s new awareness into meaningful action.</em></p> <p>In 2020, the fashion industry reckoned with its history — and present — of racial discrimination. Companies promised to address the lack of Black voices on their creative teams and in the C-suite, as well as toxic internal cultures.But visibility is only the first step. Now is the time to “translate caring into action,” Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said at BoF’s VOICES.The most important change the industry can make, he said, is to stop talking about race in a passive voice. It’s not that Black people are less likely to get hired in the fashion industry — rather, the fashion industry excludes Black people.Inclusivity measures such as mentorship and creating career pipelines for Black employees are inadequate, he went on to say. Too much effort is focused on “fixing” individuals, without addressing the system that created barriers to advancement in the first place.“When we talk about vulnerable communities, we spend our time trying to fix those people,” Robinson said. “When we talk about systems and structures, we spend our time trying to fix those systems and those structures.”</p> <p> </p> <em>Find out more about #BoFVOICES  </em><em><a href= 'https://events.businessoffashion.com'>here</a></em><em>.</em>   <em>To contact </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'>The Business of Fashion</a></em> <em>with comments, questions or speaker ideas please email </em><em><a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>podcast@businessoffashion.com</a></em><em>.</em>   <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?
