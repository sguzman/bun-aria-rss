  "description": "Today’s guest is someone you may have talked to personally: my sister, Christine Curzio. She’s head of human resources and customer service here at Curzio Research (among the many other hats she wears). Customers don’t typically call when things are going great. Most often, they call when there’s a fire to put out. Christine shares some of the wildest issues we’ve faced at Curzio... and how we implement our mission of always doing right by you, the customer. [1:25] Now, customer service isn’t all negative stories... Christine highlights some great feedback she’s received from folks looking out for us. [5:28] But if you’re thinking, “the customer is always right,” well… think again. We explain why you’ve got to protect your brand and employees… and even be willing to part ways with customers under certain circumstances. [7:28] We reminisce about the old days working with our late father... and break down the major industry changes we’ve seen over the years—like the advent of security tokens. And Christine shares a funny story involving our dad competing against a stock-picking monkey. [10:05] We also share some amazing gifts we’ve received from customers… [17:40] Finally, Christine lays out some key “backend” factors and growing pains that every business owner should be aware of… and how to adapt.
