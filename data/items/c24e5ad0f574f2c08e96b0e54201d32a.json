They also watch the recent interview that President Biden did with Jake Tapper and examine his shocking lack of followup. Later they turn to the phones and speak with a caller who wants an update on something Adam used to say frequently that doesn't seem to be the case today. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nCon-Cret.com/Podcast\nRoman.com/ADS\nSimpliSafe.com/Adam2",
