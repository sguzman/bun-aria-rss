  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">The United States spends more on healthcare than any other country, yet our citizens are sicker than ever. There’s clearly a disconnect between what’s happening inside the healthcare system and the treatment that patients receive. While most healthcare practitioners set out on a career path to help folks, they too are caught in a system of standards of care that prohibit true change, health, and vibrancy.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">There’s no one better suited to speak on this issue than Dr. John Abramson. He is a former family physician, a Harvard Medical School faculty member, and an expert in pharmaceutical litigation. Dr. Abramson is also the author of <em>Sickening</em>, a book written from his experience behind the scenes of the medical industry. <em>Sickening</em> exposes the far-reaching deception and greed of the American healthcare system.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">This episode contains conversations on lawsuits in the pharmaceutical industry, how insulin costs have skyrocketed in recent decades, and how big pharma prevents well-meaning physicians from actually helping patients. While most of this information is saddening, Dr. Abramson’s underlying message provides solutions for American healthcare reform and true healing through personal responsibility.
