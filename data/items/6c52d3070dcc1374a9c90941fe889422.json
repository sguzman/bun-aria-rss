  "description": "<p>In this parable, we see Jesus teaching about how he wants his followers to live. The main theme of this story is that a Christian is no longer his or her own, but a Christian is a servant.</p>\n<p>Through this story, we'll see that a servant is somebody who has settled something intellectually and emotionally; they’ve settled that God owes them nothing. But we'll also see that a Christian is more than a servant: Christians are sons and daughters of God. </p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on August 21, 1994. Series: The Parables of Jesus (1994). Scripture: Luke 17:1-13.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
