    "media:description": "I tell the story of how I purchased this Atelier Ayesha figure from Japan, with the help of a small shop called JFigure.com who conducted the proxy bidding for me. \n(Please note that there is also another company called \"JFigures\" - it's easy to confuse the two!)\n\nPlease note that there are a large number of businesses specialising in handling auctions, purchases and forward shipping from Japan. Most of them, as far as I can make out, use highly automated services. Nothing wrong with that, of course, and they can obviously operate with somewhat lower charges than small, individual operators.\nHowever, I really wanted a more personal service for a figure as important to me as Ayesha, so using the proxy service provided by a small shop like JFigure suited me better.\n\nTime Stamps:\n00:00 Intro\n01:25 The shipping box\n02:25 Background history and price development\n05:00 Penguin Parade manufactured\n06:50 Rant about eBay\n09:25 Contact with JFigure\n11:55 The auction process\n13:50 Ayesha - the figure\n16:25 Perspective on recent figure quality issues\n17:25 Wrapping up - Details in Description below!\n\nThere is a highly detailed review of the Ayesha figure, with much background info, here:\nhttps://neveroutgrewtoys.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/review-18-scale-ayesha-altugle-by-penguin-parade/\nThe Hidari artwork files were sourced here:\nhttps://art.alphacoders.com/arts/view/95187\n\n#AtelierAyesha #Figures #Figurine #Collecting",
