  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease Podcast, we’ll be exploring a story as American as cornbread and black-eyed peas, we’re talking about one of America’s first heroes--Daniel Boone. We’ll sift through the myth and truth and discuss why the heck we’re still talking about him 200 years after his death. We’ll learn about the mechanism of archetypes, and Clay Newcomb will interview two New York Times best-selling authors Robert Morgan and Steven Rinella about their fascination with Boone. We'll learn that the truth is wilder than the myth. This is part one of our series on Ol’ Dan’l Boone, and in it we’ll walk through the first 35 years of Boone’s life. You’re not going to want to miss this one.</p><p><br></p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p><p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p><p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p><p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/products/bear-grease-hat\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
