  "description": "Streaming services have revolutionized the way we listen to music. But before we had these platforms, how did we tune in? Let's rewind back before the radio, cassettes, or CDs, and take a look at the record player. In this episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, Maia shares the history of how German immigrant Emile Berliner found inspiration to improve upon Thomas Edison’s invention of the phonograph. Berliner’s improvement became known as the gramophone, which we commonly call the record player. This was world changing for the music industry, creating accessibility for people all around the world to hear music that was available to them live. Speaking of the music industry, on this day the first hip hop group hit the Billboard Top 10 with their third album, which led them to be inducted into the Library of Congress. Join this episode today and make sure you’re following along with the daily updates @365daysmxmtoon on all platforms.
