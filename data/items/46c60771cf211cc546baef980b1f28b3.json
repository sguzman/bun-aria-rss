  "description": "<p>Byron Katie (speaker, author of <i>Loving What Is Now</i>) teaches us the systematic process (i.e. \"The Work\") she uses to examine any positive or negative thought, from parenting and relationships to work and finances, to test what is and isn’t valid. She opens up about the awakening she experienced while lying on the floor of a halfway house while being treated for disordered eating, and how that revelation allowed her to overcome depression and suicidal thoughts, while reshaping every area of her life. Byron guides us through the practice of identifying and questioning thoughts that can lead to personal suffering and explains how our underlying beliefs may unknowingly fuel our emotions. She applies \"The Work\" processes to practical examples from Mayim and Jonathans’ lives while highlighting the importance of meditation, slowing down to listen, and readiness to put aside judgements, fear, and resentment.</p><p>Byron Katie's Live Zooms: <a href=\"https://thework.com/at-home-with-byron-katie/\">https://thework.com/at-home-with-byron-katie/</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
