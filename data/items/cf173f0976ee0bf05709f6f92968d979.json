  "description": "<p>This week on Zero Blog Thirty, the boys welcome Congressman Tom Rooney of Florida to the show. The Congressman currently serves on the House's Permanent Committee on Intelligence, where he is involved with the investigation into Russia's possible meddling with the Presidential election. He also is a strong congressional voice to the crisis in the South Sudan, the Armed Services Committee, and he made Connor smile ear-to-ear when they talk about West Point. Chaps didn't like that part. Rep. Rooney also spoke about how he thinks President Trump and Sec. Mattis' first 100 days have gone. Barstool and the Congress: A match made in heaven. The boys also brought back #DoggieBag and gave a HUGE shoutout to the Coast Guard!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
