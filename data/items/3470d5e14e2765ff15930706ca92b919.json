A new weekly show that won't replace, but will be added to our long-form conversations and short riffs. Two \"guests-in-residence\" and I will be hanging out for the better part of a month, usually 3 weeks. This really lets you get to know them and benefit from their deep interests and lens on life.</p><p>In each Roundtable, we'll go deep into three specific topics.
