And full honestly they be kept in that place; and some be restored onto their wit and health again. And some be abiding therein for ever.\" As Bethlem, or Bedlam, it became a tourist attraction in the 17th Century at its new site in Moorfields and, for its relatively small size, made a significant impression on public attitudes to mental illness. The illustration, above, is from the eighth and final part of Hogarth's 'A Rake's Progress' (1732-3), where Bedlam is the last stage in the decline and fall of a young spendthrift,Tom Rakewell.\n\nWith \n\nHilary Marland\nProfessor of History at the University of Warwick\n\nJustin Champion\nProfessor of the History of Early Modern Ideas at Royal Holloway, University of London and President of the Historical Association\n\nAnd\n\nJonathan Andrews\nReader in the History of Psychiatry at Newcastle University\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
