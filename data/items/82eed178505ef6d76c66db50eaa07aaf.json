  "title": "Episode 34: Robert T. Hyland & Frieda Lim",
  "description": "<p>This week on Let’s Eat In Cathy focused on urban, container and guerilla gardening. Robert Hyland (insideurbangreen.org) and Frieda Lynn, veteran-self proclaimed “urban greenscapers”, discussed their work with everything from aesthetic landscaping to edible produce. Their style of spreading all things green combines rooftop and windowsill gardening techinques with an urban “guerilla” landscaping sensibility. A major topic was the utilization of “SIPS” or structural insulated panels, a literal building block and ultra-versatile tool of the urban greenscaper. Tune in to hear these green-thumbed revolutionaries talk about simultaneously making the city beautiful and growing food, all with a DIY mentality.
