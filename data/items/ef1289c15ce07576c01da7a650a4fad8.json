  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, Mr. Call Screener and ‘This Is America’ podcast host, Rich Valdes fills in for Mark Levin. President Biden is intentionally spreading fear over the Omicron variant with the hope that businesses will shut themselves down and people go back into isolation, so he doesn’t have to mandate another lockdown. Biden today said that if you are vaccinated you can celebrate Christmas, but if you’re unvaccinated you should be avoided. This is demagoguery at its finest by the left to continue to push their agenda. Also, Latinos are leaving the Democrat party because of years of failed policies, combined with the success experienced under Donald Trump. This is a serious problem for the left, as it takes away a voting bloc relied upon for decades. The push of woke culture, especially the LatinX movement, does not resonate with Latinos in the way Democrats want it to. Later, parents have been successfully pushing back at school board meetings to stop CRT from being taught in their schools. We find out more every day how schools have been indoctrinating our children, like in California where teachers were busted for transitioning children without parental knowledge.\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
