We had great conversation which dug into a lot of topics. I&#8217;ve written up <a href=\"https://buttondown.email/NotANumber/archive/lessons-learned-from-the-executives-at-pydata/\">notes on my NotANumber newsletter</a>. If you&#8217;re a leader of DS and Data Eng teams, you probably want to review those notes.</p>\n<p>To follow on the conversations I&#8217;m going to run the following two (free) Zoom based discussion sessions. I&#8217;ll be recording the calls and adding notes to <a href=\"https://notanumber.email/\">future newsletters</a>. If you&#8217;d like to join, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc1XshrUEL8EF52bM5zQLV54PtX50S2rStZjngsBvKKCTHG6g/viewform\">fill in this invite form</a> and I can add you to the calendar invite. You can lurk and listen or &#8211; better &#8211; join in with questions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><del>Monday July 11, 4pm (UK time)</del>, <strong>Data Science Team Structure</strong> &#8211; getting a good structure for your org, hybrid vs fully remote practices, processes that support your team, how to avoid being left out</li>\n<li>Monday August 8th, 4pm (UK time), <strong>Backlog & Derisking & Estimation</strong> &#8211; how to build a backlog, derisking quickly and estimating the value behind your project</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m expecting a healthy list of issues and good feedback and discussion for both calls. I&#8217;ll be sharing an agenda in advance to those who have contacted me. My goal is to turn these into bigger events in the future.</p>\n<hr>\nIan is a Chief Interim Data Scientist via his <a href=http://morconsulting.com>Mor Consulting</a>.
