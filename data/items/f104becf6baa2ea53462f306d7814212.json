  "description": "<p>Episode 33 is with two of the most important figures in the financial literacy movement. DJ Envy needs no introduction everyone already watches and listens to him everyday. He’s a music and radio icon but his career as a real estate mogul and entrepreneur is just as if not more impressive. Cesar Piña aka Flipping NJ’s life story is made for a movie. He came home from the federal penitentiary in 2006 with a new born baby and no money. In 13 years he mangaged to go from 0 to 900 housing units. He currently has a net worth of over $65 million, and is in the process of building 3 commercial apartment complexes with over 150 combined units. The two titans joined forces last year and created a real estate juggernaut. They currently are traveling around the country educating thousands at their real estate seminars. In episode 33 they sat down with us to tell their stories, they also gave priceless insight into high-end real estate development and they explained how anyone can start making money in real estate. They outlined the blueprint for success and the pitfalls to watch out for.
