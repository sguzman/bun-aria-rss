  "description": "As PC culture, led fearlessly by Miss Woke 2021 Robin DiAngelo, moves deeper into decreeing what terms and actions count as racist, Professor Adolph Reed has a warning for us:\n\n“Both the discursive and institutional have emerged around a systemic disposition to find ways to evade talking about class and economic inequality, then it just grows in that dark environment with other fungi and so forth and so on.”\n\nThat’s “historian of ideologies” talk for a simple yet important concept which he explains further:\n\nWhen we focus too much on the struggle against racism and prejudice, what recedes from view is the struggle against specific policies that cause essential problems of economic inequality.\n\nIn his return to Useful Idiots, Professor Reed judges excerpts from DiAngelo’s new book Nice Racism, shares stories of civil rights history, and does something basic yet suddenly important in a time when both racism and faux-anti-racism seem to be growing: he simply defines racism.\n\nIt’s an important episode which also turns out to be one of the funniest ones yet. Here’s what else you’ll get:\n\n–Katie Halper’s NBA Finals Predictions\n\n–Poor Saudi Arabia tries to defend itself against Yemeni children\n\n–Biden and Republicans finally find a chastity belt for their mouths\n\n–And of course, it sucks to Zuck\n\nIt’s all this, and more, on this week’s episode of Useful Idiots.
