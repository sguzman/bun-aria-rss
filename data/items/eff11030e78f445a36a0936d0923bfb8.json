Add 2 handfuls of regular ice cubes and stir until cold. Strain the drink into a lowball glass. Garnish with a cocktail cherry.<br /><br />Using tongs (do not touch the dry ice!), add a 1/2-inch to 1-inch chunk of dry ice to the glass, which will sink to the bottom and immediately make a smoking effect. The ice cube will disappear in about 5 minutes. Do not drink the dry ice! Wait until the cube disappears before enjoying your drink (or you can take sips with the dry ice in the bottom).<br /><br />Follow Us!<br />@cocktalespodcast<br />@kikisaidso<br />@coffeebeandean<br /><br />Check Out Our Sponsors!<br />Try Green Chef!<br /><a href=\"http://www.greenchef.com/cocktales125\" rel=\"noopener\">www.greenchef.com/cocktales125</a> and use code cocktales125<br /><br />Talkspace- Try online therapy today and use code COCKTALES for $100 off your first month! <a href=\"https://www.talkspace.com/cocktales\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.talkspace.com/cocktales</a><br /><br />DAME PRODUCTS- code: COCKTALES visit <a href=\"https://www.dameproducts.com/cocktales\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.dameproducts.com/cocktales</a><br /><br />Text TALES to 64000 to get your discounted painting at <a href=\"https://www.paintyourlife.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.paintyourlife.com</a><br /><br />Get Your Vesper!<br />use code LOVETALES for a free engraving!<br /><a href=\"https://www.lovecrave.com/products/vesper/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.lovecrave.com/products/vesper/</a><br />PLUS LAST WEEK FOR ENTRY TO THE CONTEST<br />For the Vesper Giveaway!!<br />-Must follow @cocktalespodcast @lovecrave on IG<br />-Send a \"CockTale\" about an experience with you and a toy to <a href=\"mailto:cocktales.atl@gmail.com\">cocktales.atl@gmail.com</a> and must put \"VESPER\" in subject line<br />-Must live in the continental US to be eligible<br /><br />See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
