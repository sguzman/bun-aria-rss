The idea is to buy companies that are out of favor and cheap.\nThis is difficult to accomplish today when most equity markets are richly valued. This requires investors to even more selective than usual. It is important to scrutinize a company's balance sheet carefully and think about the business' long term prospects. \"You need to know that the business itself, the enterprise, should have a huge staying power, three, five, 10 years down the road,\" Wiggins de Oliveira says.\nThe boom in passive investing funds is one item of concern at present. The result of the proliferation of passive funds is that a lot of companies' shares get purchased by virtue of inclusion in an ETF or index, and not because of the underlying value of its business. \"At some point when this bubble pops and a lot of retail investors come out of passive funds it's going to be a difficult environment with mass selling,\" Wiggins de Oliveira says. While passive funds are certainly important in many ways, \"I'm not sure retail investors are going to be able to withstand the downturn when it comes.
