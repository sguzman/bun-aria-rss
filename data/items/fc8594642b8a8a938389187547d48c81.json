  "description": "Chris Coghlan Chris recently took the unusual step of setting up a new political party. They're called 'Renew' and are a centrist, pro-European party, but will they be able to gain a foothold in British politics? Chris explains what setting up a new party involves, how policy is made, what their aims and ambitions for the future are and where his driving force comes from. It's a fascinating insight into how to create a political movement. You can follow Chris here: @_chris_coghlan You can follow Renew here: @Renew_Britain You can follow Matt here: @mattforde And you can buy tickets to Matt's live shows and the tour that he won't shut up about here: www.mattforde.com/live<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
