  "description": "<p>Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the prospect of the National Football League adding one regular season game for each team, bringing the total to 17.

Also discussed is Major League Baseball's attendance, which ended the season at a 16-year low, and down for the sixth time in seven seasons. Also talked about is the financial status of Rutgers athletics in the wake of its football coach being fired, and California Governor Gavin Newsom signing a bill that could upend the NCAA's amateur model.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
