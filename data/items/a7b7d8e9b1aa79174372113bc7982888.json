It&#8217;s an ETL framework you plug into your software to load, processing, and migrate data on the JVM.</p>\n<p>It uses a single API, modeled after the Java I/O classes, to handle data in a variety of formats and structures. It&#8217;s single-piece-flow approach to data allows it to handle huge amounts of data with a minimum overhead while still being able to scale using multi-threading. This approach also allows it to process both batch and streaming data through the same pipelines.</p>\n<p>Data Pipeline comes in a range of versions including a free Express edition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>2. <a href=\"https://github.com/j-easy/easy-batch\" target=\"_blank\">Easy Batch</a></b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/j-easy/easy-batch\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2145\" src=\"https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/easy-batch.png\" alt=\"easy batch\" width=\"979\" height=\"214\" srcset=\"https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/easy-batch.png 979w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/easy-batch-300x66.png 300w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/easy-batch-768x168.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Easy Batch was built with the aim of <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">getting rid of boilerplate code</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that is usually required for setting up reading, writing, filtering, parsing and validating data, logging and reporting. It allows the user to just work on the application logic and not worry about these tasks.</span></p>\n<p>Working with Easy Batch is simple. Records are read from a data source, processed in the pipeline and written in batches to a data sink. Record and Batch APIs provided by the framework are used for processing records from any type of data source.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>3. <a href=\"https://camel.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Camel</a></b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://camel.apache.org/\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2302 size-full\" src=\"https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apache-camel.png\" width=\"1341\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apache-camel.png 1341w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apache-camel-300x113.png 300w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apache-camel-768x289.png 768w, https://northconcepts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apache-camel-1024x386.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1341px) 100vw, 1341px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Apache Camel is an enterprise integration framework in Java.
