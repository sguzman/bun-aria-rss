  "description": "<p>Your birthday comes around every year- and you never forget because it’s something that you look forward to! But we’d argue that there are certain financial tasks that we should also revisit at least once a year, but we’re less than enthusiastic about knocking them out. This neglect is compounded by the fact that our finances have gotten more complicated than ever. You likely have accounts everywhere: you might have multiple 401ks, savings accounts, credit cards- it might feel like there’s too much going on as you juggle more logins than you can keep up with. Now these are tasks that don’t need to become ongoing obligations, but we do think they will help you make your personal finances more manageable. Whether it’s something as straightforward and practical as making some tweaks to your budget or if it’s the beginning of a season of reevaluating your life goals, we have a number of tasks that will allow you to spring clean your finances.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a classic: Saison Dupont by Brasserie Dupont!
