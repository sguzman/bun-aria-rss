  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden and VP Harris and absent from view and responsibility regarding the disaster at the southern border. The current crisis is a thousand times worse than anything that occurred under the Trump administration. Then, is it possible for former officer Derek Chauvin to receive due process? Even if jurors are sequestered, the general public is not and CNN and other media outlets have re-played the video incessantly. Witnesses testified in open court that they saw their loved ones in place of George Floyd while recalling the incident. Irrespective of Floyd's toxicology report, what Chauvin did here was abominable. Later, Americans have a right to know what our government is doing and the Neo-Marxist Democrats are doing whatever they want behind the scenes. They are trying to conquer the individual, free will, and our voting system by way of their government power. Afterward, a teacher is caught on tape coercing a student to say he sees race in a picture after the student simply said all he saw was two people. This flies in the face of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's dream of people being judged by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
