  "description": "In this episode of The Barron Report, host Paul Barron and co-founder and executive chairman of Seated, Bo Peabody, review insights and measures around safely reopening restaurants from the first-hand experience of Peabody’s involvement in the task force for the initial reopening of Georgia restaurants. The industry has been patiently awaiting the green light to reinstate operations. Food safety has always been embedded into the backbone of foodservice but now the industry must apply new systems to alleviate customer fears of contracting illnesses via dining venues. The key changes that must take place include increasing table spacing, eliminating reuseable menus, creating separate entrances and exits, requiring servers to wear masks, and providing disposable tableware.",
