  "description": "<p>Nobody ever talks about life insurance, so naturally, we’re doing an episode on it! While likely the least sexy aspect of personal finance, it’s incredibly important- especially if you have loved ones who are dependent on you, and the income you earn. This week we’re answering a listener’s question as he specifically asks if he has enough life insurance in place, as well as how important is his age when it comes to his annual premiums. These are some awesome questions (thanks Josh) so listen to the entire episode to hear our thoughts on life insurance!</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we each enjoyed an Intergalactic Juice Hunter which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. A huge thanks to listener Carl for doing a beer trade with us!
