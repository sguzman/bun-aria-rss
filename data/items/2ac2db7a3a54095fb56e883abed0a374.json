  "title": "Anne Lamott: Three Prayers for Challenging Times",
  "description": "<p>New York Times best-selling author, public speaker and writing teacher Anne Lamott discusses what she says are the three types of prayers that can help anyone through challenging times. Anne says it's easy to thank God when life is going well, but when times get tough, she says feelings of anger or complete silence can also act as prayer. Anne believes that as long you’re telling the truth of your heart, prayer can take on many forms. Anne talks about her book \"Stitches: A Handbook on Meaning, Hope and Repair.\" The book is a humorous and profoundly moving meditation on the search for meaning and how we can make the wounded parts of ourselves whole again, stitch by stitch. Anne also opens up about her own recovery from addiction and her ongoing commitment to appreciate the sacred in everyday life.</p>\n",
