  "description": "<div>Hi friends, how are you today? I hope you are having a wonderful day so far! I have really been enjoying these stories from long ago, the women sure were a little cray, to say the least. But I must say, there were a lot of strange coincidences going on around Louise's life, wasn't there? She was the definition of suspish to say the least. Thank you for tuning into Murder, Mystery & Makeup. I love and appreciate you so much, and I hope to be seeing you very soon. <br>\nxo<br>\nBailey Sarian<br>\n<br>\nWatch the original video <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZSiKL_zDsgA\">here</a> and make sure you subscribe to my YouTube @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/BaileySarian\">BaileySarian</a>!</div>\n",
