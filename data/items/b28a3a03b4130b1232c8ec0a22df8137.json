  "description": "<div>Monday, February 13, 2017, was a bonus day off school for students in the small American town of Delphi, Indiana. Best friends Abigail Williams and Liberty German decided to spend the day hiking and taking photographs on the Monon High Bridge Trail, which forms part of Delphi’s Historic Trails. Later that evening, when they fail to meet Liberty’s father at their designated pick-up spot, it’s soon suspected that the two teenagers met with foul play. <br>\n<br>\n---</div>\n<div>\n<br>\nEpisode narrated by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/casefilehost\">Anonymous Host<br>\n</a>Episode researched by Erin Munro and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/casefilehost\">Anonymous Host</a>\n</div>\n<div>Episode written by Elsha McGill, Erin Munro, and Milly Raso</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"https://casefilepodcast.com/case-119-abigail-williams-and-liberty-german/\">casefilepodcast.com/case-119-abigail-williams-and-liberty-german</a>\n</div>\n",
