  "description": "Kittisaro graduated from Princeton as a Rhodes Scholar and went on to Oxford before going to Thailand to ordain with Ajahn Chah in 1976. He was a monk for 15 years.  Thanissara started Buddhist practice in 1975, decided to ordain after meeting Ajahn Chah and spent 12 years as a Buddhist nun. They had known each other for years when they fell in love in 1991. They decided to leave the order so they could be together and were married the following year.  They have gone on to become co-founders of Dharmagiri Sacred Mountain Retreat in South Africa and co-authors of Listening to the Heart: A Contemplative Guide to Engaged Buddhism. They are Guiding Teachers of Sacred Mountain Sangha, on the Spirit Rock Teacher Council, and are Core Teachers at Insight Meditation Society. In a wide ranging interview, they discuss their practice and how their monastic lives have prepared them for their life in a relationship.\nPlug Zone\nWebsite: http://sacredmountainsangha.org/\nBooks\nListening to the Heart: A Contemplative Journey to Engaged Buddhism:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Listening-Heart-Contemplative-Journey-Buddhism/dp/1583948392\nTime to Stand Up: An Engaged Buddhist Manifesto for Our Earth -- The Buddha's Life and Message through Feminine Eyes\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Time-Stand-Up-Buddhist-Manifesto/dp/158394916X\nHave a question for Dan?
