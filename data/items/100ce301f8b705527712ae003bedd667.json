I'm Michael Zezas, Morgan Stanley's Head of U.S. Public Policy Research and Municipal Strategy.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ellen Zentner:</strong> And I'm Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley's Chief U.S. Economist.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Michael Zezas:</strong> And on this special episode of Thoughts on the Market, we'll discuss the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, with a focus on its impact on the U.S. economic outlook. It's Wednesday, August 10th, at noon in New York.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Michael Zezas:</strong> So, Ellen, the Senate just passed the Democrats Inflation Reduction Act on a party line vote. And we know this has been a long awaited centerpiece to President Biden's agenda. But let me start with one of the more pressing questions here; from your perspective, does the Inflation Reduction Act reduce inflation? Or maybe more specifically, does it reduce inflation in a way that impacts how the Fed looks at inflation and how markets look at inflation?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ellen Zentner:</strong> So for it to impact the Fed today and how the markets are looking at inflation, it really has to show very near term effects here, where the IRA focuses more on longer term effects on inflation. So today we've got recent inflation report that came out this week showing that inflation moved lower, so softened. Especially showing the effects of those lower energy prices, which everyone notices because you go and gas up at the pump and so, you know right away what inflation is doing. And that's led to some more optimism from households. That at least gives the Fed some comfort, right, that they're doing the right thing here, raising rates and helping to bring inflation down. But there's a good deal more work for the Fed to do, and we think they raise rates by another 50 basis points at their September meeting. The rates market also took note of some of the inflation metrics of late that are looking a little bit better. But still, it's not definitive for markets what the Fed will do. We need a couple of more data points over the next few months. So the IRA is just a completely separate issue right now for the Fed and markets because that's going to be in the longer run impact.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Michael Zezas:</strong> So the bill is constructed to actually pay down the federal government deficit by about $300 billion over 10 years, and conventional wisdom is that when you're reducing deficits, you're helping to calm inflation. Is that still the case here?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ellen Zentner:</strong> So it's still the case in general because it means less government debt that has to be issued. But let's put it in perspective, $300 billion deficit reduction spread over ten years is 30 billion a year in an economy that's greater than 20 trillion. And so it's very difficult to see.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Michael Zezas:</strong> Okay, so the Inflation Reduction Act seems like it helps over the long term, but probably not a game changer in the short term.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ellen Zentner:</strong> That's right.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Michael Zezas:</strong> Let's talk about some of the more specific elements within the bill and their potential impact on inflation over the longer term. So, for example, the IRA extends Affordable Care Act subsidies. It also allows Medicare to negotiate prices for prescription drugs, or at least some prescription drugs, for the first time. How do you view the impacts of those provisions?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ellen Zentner:</strong> So these are really the provisions that get at the meat of impacting inflation over the longer run. And I'll focus in on health care costs here. So specifically, drug prices have been quite high. Being able to lower drug prices helps lower income households, that helps older cohorts, and the cost of medical services gets a very large weight in overall consumer inflation and it gets a large weight because we spend so much on it. The other thing I'd note here, though, is that since it allows Medicare to negotiate prices for some drugs for the first time, well, that word negotiate is key here. It takes time to negotiate price changes, and that's why this bill is more something that affects longer run inflation rather than near term.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Michael Zezas:</strong> Right. So bottom line, for market participants, this Inflation Reduction Act might ultimately deliver on its name. But if you want to understand what the Fed is going to do in the short term and how it might impact the rates markets, better off paying attention to incoming data over the next few months. It's also fair to say there's other market effects to watch emanating from the IRA, namely corporate tax effects and spending on clean energy. Those are two topics we're going to get into in podcasts over the next couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Michael Zezas:</strong> Ellen, thanks for taking the time to talk.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ellen Zentner:</strong> Great speaking with you, Michael.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Michael Zezas:</strong> As a reminder, if you enjoy Thoughts on the Market, please take a moment to rate and review us on the Apple Podcasts app. It helps more people find the show. </p>",
