  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 6/13/22",
  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the stock market tanked today, and the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again because they miscalculated and subsidized massive deficit spending. The Democrats, without a single Republican vote, passed the largest deficit-spending bill in American history. Before that, 19 Republicans voted with the Democrats for an infrastructure bill that spent trillions more. This is why we have inflation. The country is now economically dislocated, and the Democrats' goal is to limit your choices like only getting gas on certain days, and controlling and lowering your electricity consumption. Biden, the Democrats, and the American Marxists are systemically dismantling the greatest economic engine this world has ever seen. Then, President McKinley invited the wealthiest men in America to save America from fiscal insolvency. An independent board known as the Federal Reserve was created to ensure that the country had sound money. However, the federal system has become a Ponzi scheme and the Fed has become the drug dealers for the drug addicts in Washington whose drug of choice is printing and spending tax dollars. Later, it's only a matter of time before we're at war with communist China, not because of America but because of their aggression. If China attacks Taiwan and the U.S does nothing they will view this as weakness and come after us. There is an eerily similar parallel between our history from the Great Depression through World War II and recent history. Afterward, the push for red-flag laws is upon us, but we've seen what they've done with the FISA Court, we've seen what they've done with the Patriot Act. No more. Don't be bullied and cowed into giving up any more liberty. The ruling class in Congress did nothing to prevent these shootings and more gun laws won't fix anything. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
