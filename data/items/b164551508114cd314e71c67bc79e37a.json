  "description": "<p>In this episode I discuss what it means to take a break and just be a person. I took 4 days off and realized that leisure time is something Americans hate. Why is that? Jean Baudrillard has some answers, as does Max Weber. Also, I read Dan Harris' book \"10% Happier\" about his journey into finding meditation. A great book for anyone deeply skeptical about the self-help guru world. </p>\n<p> </p>\n",
